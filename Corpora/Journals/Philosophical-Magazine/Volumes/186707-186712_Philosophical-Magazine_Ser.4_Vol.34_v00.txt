  I.    Method       of determining          the Specific Gravity of Vapours and
                       Gases.            By R. BUNSEN, F.R.S., &c.”

        HEmethod of determining the specific gravity of gases and
       vapours described in the following communication does
not depend upon any new principle, but, on the contrary, differs
from the mode usually employed only in practical details.     The
object of this method is to attain the maximum amount of accu
 racy by the employment of the most convenient and simplest
 experimental means and of the smallest number of observa
tions.   It depends, in the first place, upon the ready prepara
tion of glass vessels which possess equal capacities within one
hundredth of a cubic centimetre, and whose weights are the
 same to within a fraction of a milligramme; secondly, upon the
employment of an unalterable perfectly air-tight stopper of very
simple construction, by means of which a vessel which has been
once for      all
             weighed, may      used      frequently
                                                be      may  as wished            as       be

and thirdly, upon the possibility      arranging         of

marked by a chalk line, and the tubes, having been emptied and
dried, are drawn out before the blowpipe to long ends about 1 OO

of rather less than 1 millim. The end is then cut off square
with a diamond, and the edges rounded in the flame.            Plate                                              I.

   In order to determine A, which is seldom more than a frac
tion of a milligramme, it is best not to wait until the beam has
arrived at a position of equilibrium, but to calculate the corre
sponding deviation of the pointer from the observation of a
number of oscillations.     Each of the vessels is filled, before the
weighing, with the air of the balance-case by sucking the air out
with a long hollow thread of glass, then wiped with a linen cloth,
and quickly drawn through the flame of a non-luminous gas-lamp
to get rid of any adhering electricity, and then weighed after
waiting three-quarters of an hour, the vessel I. being always
placed as tare on the right-hand pan.                           -
   The deviations from the vertical of the downwards directed
pointer of the balance are taken to be positive when they occur to
the left of the observer, and negative when they occur to his
right.    If         a1,   a2,

behind the cork, which would render the results of the experi
ment completely illusory.    The vapours from the liquid which
was boiled in the thermostat pass through the tube b into the
cooling-apparatus represented in fig. 3; and they condense at f,
in consequence of the radiation of heat from the platinum-wire,
and form a thin layer of liquid which prevents the entrance of
air into the vapour-vessel.     When the evaporation is nearly
done, the bubbles of vapour pass through this layer of liquid
very slowly; and when it is complete these bubbles cease entirely.
The layer of liquid is then drawn up between the glass and pla
tinum-wire into the capillary of the vapour-vessel, and forms
there a thread of liquid which acts as a vapour-tight stopper.
There is no danger of this thread of liquid being pushed forward
and destroyed by the expansion of the vapour heated from                                                    its

vapours entering from the vapour-vessel into the capillary are

any of the properties of matter without attributing them to the
atom itself.    Thus the “clash of atoms,” as it has been well
called, has been invoked by his modern followers to account for
the elasticity of gases. Every other property of matter has simi
larly required an assumption of specific forces pertaining to the
atom. It is as easy (and as improbable—not more so) to as
sume whatever specific forces may be required in any portion of
matter which possesses the “Wirbelbewegung,” as in a solid in
divisible piece of matter; and hence the Lucretius atom has no
prima facie advantage over the Helmholtz atom.         A magnificent
display of smoke-rings, which he recently had the pleasure of
witnessing in Professor Tait's lecture-room, diminished by one

       III.  On Professor Stokes's             proof of Clairaut’s Theorem.
                      By Archdeacon             PRATT, F.R.S.
      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        GENTLEMEN,                          -
 ABOUT        a year ago      I  expressed an opinion in your Magazine,
         that Professor Stokes's proof of Clairaut’s theorem is not
more general than Laplace's.                  In this I was wrong. My show
ing you in few words how I came to make this mistake will
illustrate the great disadvantage under which those labour who
are far away by thousands of miles from intercourse with the
leaders of scientific thought, and from libraries where books and
journals of the higher branches of mathematical investigation
can be regularly consulted.
     Several years ago Professor Stokes wrote two papers on Clai
raut’s theorem and attractions,—one of them in the Cambridge
 and   Dublin Mathematical Journal, and the other in the Cam
 bridge Philosophical Transactions.                    In the first paper he an
 nounced that the second was under preparation. But in the
 second there is no allusion to the first.                 He was kind enough to
 send me    copies    of both;     but the second         only     reached me.    The
 first, by some accident which it is impossible at this distant date
                                                 I
 to trace, never came to hand, and did not know of its existence.
 As to any allusions         I  saw elsewhere to the new investigation,
 I  had no reason for      supposing        that what      I  had received (viz. the
 paper in the Cambridge Philosophical Transactions) did not con
 tain everything.        It was the other paper which gave a complete
 view of the new method.                 In the paper which did reach me
 there was a step which         I   thought       inconclusive.             I
                                                                        But see now
 that this arose from my misconceiving the author's meaning,
 from which     I  should have been saved had                  I   possessed the first
 paper.    Subsequent correspondence with Professor Stokes brought
 to light that there was a paper missing.                 I   have made every effort
 to  get  a copy   and have at last         succeeded,       but only at the end of
 last March         I  take this     early    opportunity       of recalling the opi
 nion which     I  expressed.
     On the same authority           I   must yield the point that the sphere
 is the  only  surface which        regulates      the redistribution of the mass
  so as to leave the external attraction unaltered.                     Complicated as
  is the function in page 263% of your Number for April last, an
  à priori demonstration by Professor Stokes, which I have just
 received from him, shows that it must be capable of being made

to enter, to emerge, or to diffuse. By means of springs, partly
of brass and partly of platinum, the plates were kept pressed
against the ends, but not so as to prevent the possibility of
sliding them.     The edges were lubricated with sulphuric acid,
which   prevented   any escape of gas, provided the pressure did
not exceed certain limits which were never attained in the
experiments.
   When one of the vessels had been filled with oxygen, and the
other with oxygen mixed with a small quantity of chlorine or
ozonized oxygen, the first vessel was placed on the second. They
were separated by the two glass plates in contact, between which
a drop of sulphuric acid had been placed.    Communication was
then established between the two vessels by sliding the plates
until the holes coincided.      Diffusion then commenced ; the
aperture through which it was effected was 5 millims. in dia
meter; and it was continued for forty-five minutes, at the expira
tion of which time communication was intercepted between the
two vessels.
   The proportion of chlorine or of oxygen contained in each
vessel at the end of the experiment was determined by passing
the gas through iodide of potassium.      The disk which closed
each tube at                           its
                   upper extremity consisted        thick piece              of   a                      of

     M. Carré   on new Apparatus   for  the Production of Cold.   29
   Here, as in the case of chlorine, it is seen that the quantity
diffused is proportional to the mass of ozone contained in the
lower vessel at the commencement of the experiment.          But the
diffusion of ozone is more  rapid than that of  chlorine, and it must
therefore be concluded that the density of ozone is less than that
of chlorine.
   For each cubic centimetre of chlorine originally contained in
the lower vessel, 0.227 cubic centim. penetrate into the upper
one in forty-five minutes, whereas for each cubic centimetre of
ozone 0.271 cubic centim. pass.        The ratio of these numbers,
º:      =0.8382, is very nearly as the inverse ratio of the square
root of the densities,   assuming that the density of ozone is one
and a half that of oxygen.      That is to say, v1658 = 0.8243.
                                                   A/2-44
 The ratio is nearer unity than the theoretical one, as ought to be
the case. Soret concludes from these experiments, and from
 analogous ones made with carbonic acid, that the density of ozone
prepared by electrolysis is once and a half that of owygen.
    Carré has given to the French Academy”, a description of
 some new apparatus for producing cold; they are based on
 Leslie's well-known experiment, and are on such a scale and so
 certain in their effects as to render them practically useful.
    The first problem to solve was the construction of a simple
 and inexpensive air-pump which, while easy to construct and
 work, should produce an exhaustion up to a millimetre without
 being altered by acid vapours.     Such a one was exhibited to the
 Academy; it had cost 60 francs, and had been at work without
 repair for eighteen months; and it produced ice with acid diluted
 to 52 degrees.
    The second problem was to combine a mode of contact of
 aqueous vapour with acid which, without appreciably diminish
 ing the gaseous flow, would enable the acid to be diluted so as
 to obtain the maximum effect. Two principal methods led to
 this result: the first consists in making a thin stream of acid
 pass through a tube through which circulates aqueous vapour;
 the second consisted in terminating the delivery-tube of this
 vapour by a moveable horizontal jet which skims the surface of
 the bath of acid, and which ascends in proportion as the acid     in
 creases in volume by absorbing moisture.

80          MM. Pettenkofer                and Woit on the Elimination
   The receivers for acid, formed of an alloy of lead and anti
mony, stand without change a pressure of five to six atmospheres,
while the charge to which they are exposed never exceeds one
atmosphere.     There is no doubt that they can resist for a num
ber of years the attack of sulphuric acid; it covers them at once
with a coating of sulphate, which almost entirely prevents any
further erosion.
   The pump, which is made of copper, is protected against the
action of sulphurous acid, always disengaged from acid recently
introduced, by an arrangement which constantly and necessarily
keeps      its
           sides coated with oil: this,      far from hindering  so                                its
work, makes               as

   It  follows from these results that the elimination of carbonic
acid is greater at day than during the night; further, that on a
working-day the quantity of carbonic acid and water eliminated
is far greater than on a day of rest, while the quantity of oxygen
absorbed on both days is pretty equal.             In return, however, for
this the quantity of oxygen absorbed during the night which
follows the working-day is greater.           The authors deduce there
from the     following   conclusions:—The oxygen absorbed during   up
the  night          is,   so

plete cooling of the body. The equality in the quantity of urea
separated on the day of rest and on the working-day confirms
the observation made by Voit in the case of the dog, that                                                   in
crease in muscular work produces no increase in the decomposi
tion of albumen.
   These experiments acquire confirmation from some which
Henneberg made in 1865 with two oxen in the respiration-ap
paratus at Weende. He only observed during twelve hours of
daytime, and found that the quantity of oxygen taken in at day
time is not sufficient to explaim the great quantity of excreted
carbonic acid.    In twenty-two experiments with different kinds
of food,  he obtained for 100 parts of inspired oxygen 131, 173,
145, 193, 163, 132, 259, 222 parts of oxygen in the exhaled
carbonic acid.    The circumstance that the apparatus at Weende
can  only  be used in summer, and that he was prevented from
prosecuting the experiments in the summer of 1866, were the
reasons that Henneberg was hindered in experimentally demon
strating the cause of      abnormality.  its

  The general results of Mr. Greg's investigations as regards
meteoric showers are thus summed up in the Report of the Com
mittee on Luminous Meteors.                                -
    “They appear to endure for almost any period, from twenty-four
hours to eight or possibly ten weeks, differing from one another in
richness or intensity of display.      In some there appears to be a ten
dency to maximum display on particular days, as, for example, xlvii,
lasting from November 26th to December 30th; but the most abun
dant display occurs from December 9th to 13th. In others no such
maximum can be perceived.         Their number, of fully fifty as yet as
certained, will probably not be much exceeded, unless by short-lived
 showers, and by others whose radiants culminate just before dawn.
There is no confusion or chance in their return, but, on the contrary,
the showers are very regularly recurrent every year, and, allowing a
radiant region of 10° to 15° in diameter for each, the so-called “spo
radic” meteors will become extremely scarce now that the principal
 showers and their radiants have been pointed out.           A well-marked

entirely from meteors seen in evening hours. But the pheno
menon of radiation caused by parallelism of absolute motions
should be more distinctly evident as the radiant is nearer the
meridian. This occurs in general in the morning hours.
   While, then, the existence of rings or streams is a priori pro
bable, and so the existence of radiants for very short periods is
to be looked for, yet the series now proposed will doubtless un
dergo essential changes as we accumulate observations, or else
some other cause than ring-formations be found to account for
the radiation.
   There should in any case be a tendency to a radiation, both
from the zenith and from the point to which the earth is moving—
hence from the region lying between these points, i. e. from the
north-east quarter of the heavens.

  Erman early asserted the existence of periods from the 5th                                       to,
the 12th     February, and from the 10th
                  of                           the 13th    May.     to                  of
These        he
          attributed   the influence
                                   to  the August and Novem
                                                          of
ber meteors, assuming that they passed     those epochs betweenat
the earth and the sun. To the same cause he attributed certain
dark days, and other appearances, said        have occurred     the

     M. Deville's own conclusions, as given in his later papers,
themselves  throw doubt upon the existence of any important
connexion between the meteors and the temperature of the air.
He finds that there is an accordance between the movements of
the thermometer in the several months, February, May, August,
and November, and that the 12th day of each of these months
is the critical day of a marked inflection.  But this accordance
 (orsolidarity) between the several months     entirely lost when                  is
the days  are           so
                  combined      compare,          as

                                             in
create oscillations                in     the atmosphere, whose

   For the weight of the individual meteoroids he assumes one
gramme, relying upon the conclusions of Mr. A. S. Herschel,
who compared the light of the meteors with the light of a
candle, and hence inferred their weight. The estimate seems
too small; for some of the trains fill cubic miles of space with
matter of sufficient consistency to form a cloud visible for
minutes (see Silliman’s Journal, vol. xliii. p. 86). Yet the pro
bable size of these bodies is so small that                               M. Schiaparelli’s rea

            4. Age of the November Group of Shooting-stars.
   In the Paris Academy of Sciences, January 21, 1867, Le Ver
rier spoke of the November meteors (Comptes Rendus, vol. lxiv.
p. 94).   Inasmuch as the group is not a complete ring, he ar
gues that it is of comparatively recent formation, having come
into the solar system and been turned into               present orbit             its
within few centuries.

as was the case with the comet of 1770.       Moreover comets so
acted upon that the newly acquired orbit has   small perihelion                a
distance, return necessarily the orbit     to
                                          the disturbing  body,      of
just   as   the comet       of
                      1770 returned     Jupiter. We cannot help,

   The question then arises whether the group and Uranus have
ever been together       this point.

that   nosuch  meeting  could have taken place since the year 126
of our era, and that             by
                            change                        of
                                       the computed mode for that

                           placing the perihelion                                  4°
epoch      of                                            from the de
scending node        November, the group would then actually
                        in
strike the planet Uranus.      These two changes are not greater
than the possible errors              of

  . From the paper in the Philosophical Transactions just referred
to, and from this discourse to the Fellows of the Chemical So
ciety, we derive the following view of the chemical world:—
    Atoms, molecules, and the like Sir B. Brodie proposes to ignore
—neither affirming nor denying the existence of atoms, but simply
ignoring the question. The chemical purposes which, according
to him, are served by the conception of atoms are much more
efficiently served by the following conception:-Chemical sub
stances are to be referred to a standard volume—the litre.                If
this litre be empty, it is the unit of space. The unit of space is
conceived as operated on by symbols of operation, and thereby
converted into the standard volume or unit of different elements
or compounds. Thus according to this conception the chemical
unit of a substance, whether simple or compound, is generated
by operating on the litre of space by an appropriate symbol or
symbols of operation.        In accordance with this notion a is the
symbol of that operation by which the litre of space becomes the
litre of hydrogen. By operating upon the litre of space by a
single symbol of operation                                    be

   Although the usual arithmetical meaning may be given to the
signs, such as + and —, still on inspecting the following equa

the combination of symbols.

the only exception having reference to that which concerns hy
drogen.     With regard to hydrogen, which is thus in an alto
gether peculiar predicament, the rule for deducing the coefficient
of a (the Brodie-symbol for hydrogen) from the old formula is
this. Add to the number of atoms of hydrogen in the old formula
one for each atom of chlorine or other halogen or nitrogen, &c.,
and divide the sum by 2, and the result will be the appropriate
coefficient for 2.                   -      -     -

VIII.    Inquiry as to whether the tendency to Dispersion of Cloud
     under a  Full Moon in any way depends on Lunar Influence.
     By WILLIAM ELLIs, F.R.A.S.*
IN toaddition to cloud, the
        disperse
                 some general belief in the power of the moon
                            tendency to disappearance of cloud
under a full moon is also spoken of by the philosophers Hum
boldt, Herschel, and Arago.    By Herschel (“Outlines of Astro
nomy,' seventh edition, page 285) it is believed to be a conse
quence of lunar action, and Arago also (Astronomie Populaire,
book xxi. chapter 33) appears to consider such influence pro
bable.  To question the existence of this power when supported
by such testimony may therefore seem presumptuous; and yet                                                     I
cannot conceal from myself the fact that many years’ experience
as an astronomical observer at the Royal Observatoryat Greenwich
has impressed me with the idea that at that place the evening ten
dency to clearance is not confined to the period of full moon, but
exists to an equal extent at        times, leadingall     the conclusion             to
that the  phenomenon     does not   depend       lunar action.             on
   But there     also evidence that the disappearance            cloud                          of
                    to is
                                                                                                              is
not confined     the full-moon    period.  Admiral    FitzRoy   (Weather
Book, page 256) says that           fine weather there
                                                  in              general                      is   a
tendency towards       disappearance

                                            clouds soon after evening,

other  period.”    And the   question       not whether the tendency
exists, but whether any portion                         of   it is

evening   isgreater     the time at   full moon than   of   other  times,                 at
or greater than      the time
                            at      new moon.     of For     not greater,                 if

                  lunar influence exists.

scarcely differs from that for the whole period,   from that   new             or                   at
moon. The slight difference that exists       against the supposed      is
influence. And comparing the night hours only, the means are
 (including from       20"    17* 20") for full moon 6:48, for the

also against the supposed influence;       the night    least clearor                  is
at  the time of full moon.

     The slight difference between the numbers is against the                 full
 moon influence, confirming a previous result.
     From the observations made at Greenwich during seven years,
 it thus appears that the moon has not that power to disperse
 cloud which has been ascribed to her.
     Supposing the result found for Greenwich to be also uni
 versally true, it may then be asked how arises any general belief
in the moon’s influence. To answer this, let us refer to Table II.
 It there appears that the ordinary evening change is from a cloudy
state of sky to a clear state of sky, also that the change is not
 confined to any one part of the lunation, neither is it greater at
full moon than at other times. Towards midnight, and after
 midnight, the ordinary tendency is again to cloud. Now the
 period of clearance corresponds, at the time of full moon and
about that time only, to the period comprised between the rising
and advance of the moon towards the meridian. There is thus,
 about the time of full moon, some appearance of cause and effect;
for as the moon ascends above the horizon, so does the sky
become, on the average, finer.                Further, the change from a
cloudy to a clear state of sky is more likely to attract attention
near the time of full moon; for with no moon present the
general darkness is little altered, but with the moon above the
horizon, dissipation of the evening cloud so entirely changes the
aspect of nature, that the contrast between the previous dulness
and present splendour of the might is very striking.                      So that
the moon may, by her presence, first attract attention to the
evening tendency to clearance, and then, by her accident of po
sition (the coincidence of her time of rising with the usual time
of clearance), suggest the idea that to her influence is the effect
remarked due.
     Such speculation, however, assumes my own result to be true;
and so far as number of observations can give certainty, it ought
to be good. But the opposite conclusion of Sir J. Herschel is
stated by him (see his ‘Familiar Lectures on Scientific Subjects,’
p. 147) to be also the result of “long-continued and registered
observation.” And it seems difficult to suggest any probable
explanation of the discordance.             My own result confirms my own
previous impression, but, being opposed to that of Sir J. Herschel
as well as to the belief of many people, it may be considered to
require confirmation by discussion of observations made at other

 places before it can be received as generally true. This seems
 indeed but reasonable.    At present, therefore,   will only ask                  I
 that my result may be looked upon as a protest against the oppo
 site and more generally received opinion.

   1. In a paper “On Stream-Lines,” published in the Philosophical
Magazine for October 1864, I stated, and, in a Supplement to the
same paper, published in the Philosophical Magazine for January
 1865,         I
         proved the proposition that “all waves in which molecular
rotation is null begin to break when the two slopes of the crest meet
at right angles.”

that mechanical proposition is a consequence.          a plane curve              If

point,         it   does so    at right      angles.

inclination of any plane curve to the axes at an ordinary point is given

    The following communications were read         :-              By the
    1. “On ancient Sea-marks on the coast of Sweden.”
Rt. Hon. the Earl of Selkirk, F.R.S., F.G.S.
    This paper contained a detailed description of some observations
made in the month of July 1866, upon certain marks placed so as
to show the level of the sea on the coast of Sweden, which were
seen by Sir Charles Lyell thirty-two years ago, and which were
supposed to indicate a gradual and equable rise of the land of about
three feet in a century.      Two of these marks were off the harbour
of Gefle, and one on the Island of Gråså, off Oregrund, on the east
coast of Sweden; the rest were on the west coast, a little to the
north of Göteberg.                                                     -
    The conclusion arrived at was that these marks do not afford any
very certain proof of such rise of the land,-the fluctuation of the
level of the water being so great that any difference of the level of
the land in thirty-two years is lost in comparison with the daily and
weekly changes owing to shifts of wind and other causes affecting
the water, not the land.       The marks off Gefle gave most indication
of a  change   of level; but there were various elements of uncertainty
connected with them.
    2. “On a Post-Tertiary Lignite, or Peat-Bed, in the District of
 Kintyre, Argyllshire.”       By His Grace the Duke of Argyll, K.T.,
 D.C.L., F.R.S., F.G.S.
    A  section of the Bed appeared in a bank cut through by a small
stream near the village of Southend.          The bank appears to belong
 to the “old   coast-line,”  which is so well-marked a feature around
 most parts of the west coast of Scotland.          The Peat at the point
 described is 3 feet 9 inches     thick;  above it is a bed of fine clay,
 from 13 to 14 inches     thick, containing  hazel-nuts, followed by a bed
 of fine  yellow   sand 4 feet   thick,  which is succeeded by a bed of
 coarse gravel, with small boulders of the thickness of 14 feet.
    About 400 yards further up the stream there is a bed of fine
 black-blue clay with Mussel-shells.
    These beds appear to furnish evidence of some five or six different
 changes of level. (1) The Peat-bed has been depressed under shal
 low and very muddy water, depositing the bed of fine clay. (2) A
 further depression has subjected this mud to an inroad of the sea,
 bringing with it the sand which overlies the clay. (3) A further
 depression, or possibly a partial elevation, exposing the same surface
 to some strong current or littoral action, has brought down upon it
 the bed of coarse gravel. (4) All these beds have been consolidated
 and reelevated above the sea. (5) Another depression has enabled
 the sea to erode the valley of which the “old coast-line” forms
 the boundary, and in which this section is exposed. A long period
                                      F2

seems to have followed, during which this “old coast-line” formed
the Coast of Scotland; and during that period the upper Mussel-bed
seems to have been deposited. (6) A final elevation of the land has
determined the pre ent coast-line, and left the old one as it now
appears—subsequently    modified by atmospheric action, and cut
through by streams. All these changes have occurred during what,
geologically, must be called the existing period, as the vegetable
remains in the peat, and in the clay, seem to be       referable                             all                 to
existing species.

   1. “Remarks on the Drift in a part of Warwickshire, and on
the evidence of glacial action which it affords.”     By the Rev. P.
B. Brodie, M.A., F.G.S.
  The later Drift-deposits in the district treated of occur along the
valley of the Avon, and consist of the usual sands and gravels, with
Mammalian remains; but as yet no Flint Implements have been
discovered in them. The author enumerated the different kinds of
rock represented by pebbles or fossils in the gravel, and referred to
the abundance of flints and the occasional occurrence of pieces of
chalk in the gravel as proof that their mode of conveyance was by
icebergs, unless it be conceded that the Cretaceous formation at one
time had a much further extension northwards.           The abundant
quartzose pebbles occurring in the drift of Warwickshire have re
cently yielded fossils identical with those occurring in the pebbles at
Budleigh Salterton; and the author suggests that they had a similar
origin to those in Devonshire.

W. Boyd Dawkins, Esq., M.A. (Oxon.), F.G.S.
  The Pleistocene species of Rhinoceros in Britain are four in
number :—R.tichorhinus, Cuv.; R. megarhinus, Christol; R. Etruscus,
Falc.; and R. leptorhinus, Owen [= R. hemitoechus of Falconer].
The last of these is characterized by the possession of a partially
ossified septum between the nares, and by the slenderness of                                 its
bones.      In

 number.    Its nearest living analogue is the bicorn Rhinoceros of
 Sumatra.    The dentition both of the tichorhine and leptorhine
 species agrees remarkably in one point, that it is more specialized, or,
 in other words, more closely allied to that of living forms than the
megarhine,—a fact that seems to the author to imply that both came
into being after the less specialized R. megarhinus had ceased to
exist.

            the strata which form the base of the Lincolnshire
Wolds.”   By  John W. Judd, Esq., F.G.S.
 After  giving  a sketch of the previous very scanty literature of the
 subject, the author proceeded to describe the outcrop and the various
 outliers and inliers of the “Hunstanton Red Limestone,” which in
 this district serves as a well-marked datum line in the series of
 strata.    It was shown that this bed, while maintaining much uni
 formity of lithological and palaeontological characters, undergoes a
 regular attenuation southwards, being 30              thick      Speeton,   ft.             at                  14   ft.

    In another series of experiments on formic ether, the relative loss
due to absorption of the liquid was 0-28, and that produced by va
pour 0.27.
     Professor Tyndall, in his researches on the absorption of heat by
 gaseous substances, had dwelt upon the extreme energy which ether
vapour exerts upon obscure radiation.             My experiments show that
the absorption exercised by this body on the rays of a lamp is also
very strong.
     A natural consequence of the preceding was that the heteroge
 neous radiation which        I used, when it traversed a tube full of ether
 under a pressure near that of the atmosphere, was more trans
 missible through liquid ether than it was when it had only passed
 through vapour under a few centimetres pressure.               In fact I have
 seen the absorbing-action of ether almost double in consequence of
 a diminution of about 0.58 metre in the pressure of the vapour of
ether in the tube.
     Finally, by working under different pressures, but always with
 the heterogeneous radiation to which the bad condition of the atmo
 sphere has for some time condemned me, I have been able to ascer
 tain that ether vapour follows the law long known as that of the de
 crease of relative losses.        By increasing the pressure from 10 to 10

centimetres, for example, I have been able to ascertain that the mag
nitude of the absorption due to the first 10 centimetres was greater
than that of the ten following, and so on.   I do not dwell upon this
point, for I was not able to work with homogeneous rays.
   I have not spoken in this note of the experiments I have made
with bisulphide of carbon. Its action, whether liquid or gaseous,
was so small that I could not deduce anything definite from     study                                        its

ance   of   galvanic elements are very faulty. Even under the most
favourable circumstances they are destitute               accuracy, and        many

RESEARCHES ON THE WARIATION IN THE DISPERSION OF                                    LI
  QUIDS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HEAT.                           BY M. J.-B. BAILLE.
    In a previous research I had investigated the influence of heat on
the refraction and dispersion of solids whose expansion is regular.
The great distinction which this research received from the Academy
led me to extend these investigations to liquids. Several researches
had already been made on this subject, among others those of
Messrs. Dale and Gladstone (1860) and M. Fouqué (1867); but
these physicists had more especially in view the refraction of liquids;
and as in my previous investigations I had arrived at the conclusion
that the dispersion of solids increases with heat, I wished to ascer
tain if the dispersion of liquids was also subjected to some special law.
    The apparatus and the method I used have already been described.
 Since, from the nature of the case, it was necessary to work rapidly,
the approximation is not so close as in my former experiments.                         I
have used the indices of the three Fraunhofer's lines C, D, and F,
and have obtained a large number of results, among which                          I will
cite the following:—
                                      Distilled Water.
     It  was first ascertained that the refractive index diminishes pro
gressively from 0 to 100 degrees, and that the variation of this
index remains very feeble up to 6 degrees, when it commences to
increase with the temperature.                 The vicinity of the point 4 degrees,
corresponding to the maximum density, did not appear to influence
the refractive index, as has been found by M. Jamin and Messrs.
Dale and Gladstone.                                                         Fa-Cn.

    It is seen from this Table that the dispersive power measured by
 the difference between the extreme indices is constant, or even
 slightly increases, from 2 to 5 degrees, and that from this point it
 diminishes regularly and pretty rapidly.
    Though these numbers differ somewhat from those of Messrs.
 Dale and Gladstone, this constancy of dispersive power up to 5 de
 grees is undoubted; for it is found in their numbers—a coincidence
 the more remarkable that they have not noticed this feature.

     It is thus seen that under the influence of heat the index of                  sul
 phuret       of carbon considerably diminishes,            .  The dispersive power

 also diminishes, but diminishes in an irregular manner. It is in fact
 seen that the green of the spectrum between F and D diminishes less
 than the red part between D and C, even in absolute value and though
 it is more spread out: the green contracts less, then, than the red.
    This fact is again met with in Dale and Gladstone's numbers,
 although they are different from mine.                With their numbers it is
 seen that between A and D the dispersive power diminishes continu
 ously, and between D and H this power seems to remain constant, or
 to diminish very little towards 30 degrees. It is moreover seen that
 from former experiments Mr. Barlow had found that the dispersion
 of bisulphide of carbon increased with the temperature (1829).
                   Bisulphide  of Carbon    saturated with Sulphur.

    The introduction of sulphur into bisulphide has the effect of          in
 creasing the refractive index and the dispersive power.            Under the
 influence of heat these elements diminish, and the irregularity of the
 variation of the dispersive element is even more sensible than in the
 preceding substance.
     With bisulphide almost saturated with phosphorus it seems that
 while the red part contracts, the green part of the spectrum expands.
 F,-D,     varies from 298 to 309, from 15 to 25 degrees of temperature.
     From the whole of these results presented by these three liquids,
 it may be concluded that the dispersion of bisulphide of carbon varies
 irregularly under the action of heat, and that the green part con
 tracts much less than the red part; if the bisulphide be rendered
 more refracting and dispersing by solution of sulphur or of phos
 phorus, this irregularity will be more and more pronounced, so that
 we might arrive at a liquid in which the two parts of the spectrum
 would vary in contrary directions.
                                        Glycerine.

    This substance seems to differ from the preceding substance.
 Here the dispersive power still varies in an irregular manner; but
 the red part remains equally dispersed (the preceding numbers only
giving a slight augmentation), and the green part contracts very
 appreciably.
    I have also worked with many other liquids, and have ascertained
that they may always be ranged in one of the preceding groups.
 Each liquid seems to behave in a special manner. In the greatest
 number of cases, such as aqueous solutions, alcohol, &c. the dispersion
 diminishes regularly, and the two coloured parts mentioned here
 contract almost equally; the dispersion of others, such as bisulphide
of carbon, anhydrous chlorides, varies irregularly, and the green part
of the spectrum contracts much less than the red one; in others,
finally, like glycerine and hydrochloric acid, the dispersion still varies
irregularly, but the red part contracts less than -the green one.—

 bottom or side of a vessel with a velocity which a body would
 acquire in falling freely from the surface, is equal to the weight
 of a column of water of which the base is equal to the section
 of the contracted vein, and about twice the height of the co
 lumn which produces the flowing pressure,                the static force
 of reaction being thus double that which, without experiment,
 had been predicted%.          An instance in which the quantity of
 dynamic force is increased paradoxically may be seen in that
 curious and useful piece of apparatus the injector, by means of
 which a boiler containing steam of high pressure is able to feed
 itself with water through a hole in          shell, though this hole its                                           is

the iron in grooves turned out for their reception, prevented the
 convolutions of insulated wire from flying out of position by the
centrifugal force attending their rapid revolution. The arma
ture is represented complete in fig. 6, and in section in fig. 7.
    12. A number of exactly similar permanent magnets (of the
form shown in fig. 1), 8 inches long, were made from bars of
steel 1 inch wide and a quarter of an inch thick, and the distance
between the inner edges of the polar extremities of the magnets
was a little less than 2 inches.   The magnets weighed about one
pound each; and they received very nearly equal degrees of
magnetism, which enabled them to support a weight of about
ten pounds each.
   13. On each side of the magnet-cylinder was a flat raised
surface, M, M, figs. 2, 3, extending the whole length of the
cylinder between the projections E, E. These surfaces were
planed parallel with each other and with the axis of the magnet
cylinder.    When the magnets, the legs of which were somewhat
less than 2 inches apart, were sprung upon the cylinder in the
position shown in fig. 1, they were held in sufficiently good
contact for the magnetism to diffuse itself equally throughout
the entire mass of the cylinder; the two cast-iron sides of which,
consequently,   formed the poles of the magnets.     On the lower
part of the magnet-cylinder four projections or feet, N, N, N, N,
figs. 2, 3, were cast, by means of which it was bolted firmly to
a wooden base.
   14.  When the armature was made to revolve rapidly in the
interior of the magnet-cylinder, waves of magneto-electricity
were generated in the coils by the reversals of the magnetism in
the rib G.; and from the peculiar construction of the cylinder
and armature,      two waves of electricity, moving in alternate
directions, were generated for each revolution of the armature.
   15. The rapid succession of alternating waves thus generated
could be taken from the machine as an intermittent current
moving in one direction, by means of two steel springs (shown
in the perspective drawing, fig. 10), when they were made to
rub against the opposite sides of the commutator L.
   16. The waves of electricity could also be taken in alternate
directions from the machine when required, by adjusting the
springs so as to rub against the unbroken cylindrical part of
each half of the commutator.
   17. The springs were placed in metallic connexion with the
respective polar terminals of the machine, and to these terminals
wires were attached for making the necessary connexions with
those of a galvanometer or of an electromagnet.                   -

 machine thus described, was made for the purpose of ascer

had upon the quantity of electricity generated by the machine,

of ascertaining the relation existing between the lifting-power
of the permanent magnets on the magnet-cylinder, and that of
an electromagnet        excited by the electricity derived from the
magneto-electric machine.          In these investigations the apparatus
shown in fig. 8 was used, which consisted of a small electro
magnet, made by bolting to an iron block, forming the base of
the electromagnet, two plates of iron 6 inches long, 3 inches
wide, and #ths of an inch thick.             The inside distance between
the two   plates   was about 2      inches;     and the polar surfaces of

somewhat        remarkable,           and    have        amongst          themselves            a   well
defined ratio, such as would hardly have been expected from a
bare consideration of the nature of the magnetism of the per
manent magnet; for when one magnet was placed on the
cylinder, the weight required to separate the submagnet from
the electromagnet was 2.5 ozs.      It might therefore have been
expected that two magnets placed on the cylinder would have
induced a double amount of magnetic force in the electro-magnet,
whereas the force required to detach the submagnet was equal
to a weight of 11:25 ozs, or was a little more than quadrupled.
From a further comparison of the numbers contained in the
Table, it will be seen that (within the limits and conditions of
these experiments, and after making allowance       certain degree         fora
of imperfection     them), the amount

    47. Moreover the direction of the current in the electro
helices, as shown by the galvanometer, was the same after as it
was before connexion with the electromotor was broken; whereas
had the current, as shown by the spark obtained (38), been the
result of a static charge of the kind observed in insulated tele
graph wires, the electricity would have discharged itself, when
the place of disjunction was at the electromotor, in the opposite
direction to that in which it entered the electrohelices.
   48. The conclusions drawn from a consideration of these ex
periments are therefore opposed to the supposition that the
effects described are the consequence of a static charge of the
kind observed to be retained by insulated submarine and subter
ranean telegraph wires; but some of the phenomena described
—such as the retardation of the current when contact was made
with the magneto-electric machine (43, 45), and the exalted
electrical condition of the wire surrounding the electromagnet,
as shown by the voluminous spark seen and the severe shock
felt when contact with the machine was broken (37)—are iden
tical with the phenomena of electric induction observed by Dr.
Henryk and investigated by Faraday with the aid of the voltaic
battery, and which form the subject of his Ninth Series of Re
searches  in Electricityt.

    The force which is the agent in the motion with which heat
is now identified is believed, with reason, to be connected with
the diffusion of highly attenuated matter throughout space.
Adopting the terms of Sir John Herschel, on the relative motions
of “aethereal molecules” and the “gross molecules” of sen
 sitive matter seem to depend        the phenomena allheat.   Two                      of
 distinct sets of theories have been advanced:—those like that of
 Mossotti, which make the gross molecules centres      force; and                           of
 that    Rankine, which makes the aethereal molecules the nuclei,
          of
 and allots    the gross molecules the functions
                to                                  encircling at                of    an

108               Prof. C. Bohn             on Negative Fluoreseence
questioned whether external influences may not cause such bodies
frequently to pass from one form to the other, and consequently
through the typical parabolic orbit.   And so the liquid condi
tion of matter may perhaps be most scientifically described as
“unstable.” Many substances do pass immediately from solid
to gas on an increase of temperature; and where this is not the
case, liquids whose surfaces are in contact with gas undergo a
constant evaporation, which is accelerated either by an increase
of temperature or a decrease of external pressure—by anything,
in short, which disturbs the equilibrium in the hyperbolic direc
tion.    In a similar manner, if the equilibrium be disturbed in the
elliptic direction, the liquid will at once become solid. This is
exemplified by the experiment of water reduced while in a state
of perfect rest to a temperature many degrees below freezing
point: it still remains liquid till slightly agitated, when ice is
suddenly formed.
   During the metamorphosis of matter from solid to liquid and
from liquid to gas a large amount of heat is expended.       In
ancient language caloric became latent; in modern phraseology
it is held that this heat is consumed in conferring potential
energy upon the atoms of the substance.     If sensible heat is
motion, latent heat is position.  More definitely, according to
our theory, the non-thermometric heat is expended in changing
the form of the orbit from ellipse to parabola, from parabola                               to
hyperbola.

and that it has been described by many physicists. But hitherto
the law established by Professor Stokest, according to which
the refrangibility of the fluorescent rays never exceeds that of
the rays which excite the fluorescence, has not been gainsaid.
In fluorescence, as hitherto known, the process is generally re
garded as consisting in the transformation of rays of greater re
frangibility into rays of less refrangibility.    In accordance with
this conception,  M. E.  Becquerelf   hoped    to be able to detect by
experiment  the transformation of red rays of light into less                               re
frangible rays of heat, but he did not succeed in doing                               so.   In

bility. He proposed to call the already well-known phenome
non of a decrease of refrangibility “Positive Fluorescence;”
and the converse phenomenon of an increase of refrangibility,
which he regarded as possible or probable,    he proposed to call
“Negative Fluorescence.”      In the year 1861f he cited certain
familiar facts (such as changes of colour consequent on elevation
of temperature) as tending to establish the existence of this ne
gative fluorescence; and he has recentlyf asserted that these
phenomena afford an actual proof of such a transformation of rays.
   Attempts have lately been made to detect experimentally the
transformation of rays of heat into rays of light in accordance
with negative fluorescence.       Mr. Akin § and Professor Tyndall||
consider that     they have discovered and pointed out distinct phe
nomena of this kind. They have entered into an animated dis
pute, and are disagreed as to which of them was the first to
make the discovery; they disagree also about the name by which
the phenomenon in question ought to be denoted (Akin calls it
“calcescence” and Tyndall “calorescence”), and are at one only
in so far as they both consider that the phenomena of incan
descence which they have either actually produced, or at least
proposed to make the subjects of experiment, ought to be re
garded as phenomena of the same kind as those of (positive)
fluorescence—that                 is,

convinced that the emission of rays of greater refrangibility in
the cases mentioned above was simply a consequence of the ele
vation of temperature which the various bodies underwent, and
that it was entirely immaterial whether they were heated by
dark rays or by luminous rays of heat, or by conduction, or in
any other way.       So far as I am aware, there is not a single phe
momenon dependent on temperature in which the mode in which
the temperature is raised, or the origin and particular character
of the heat which causes                     it,

phosphorescent for more than two minutes       the outside; and                 at
I endeavoured    most casesin                         to

space       as
         soon   possible after the luminosity was unmistakeably
                           as
perceived.

         the crystals and the cells had the temperature         the                                      of
room, namely about 18°C., before they were put into the heated
space, the piece which was suspended without covering became
luminous first, then considerably later the piece     the salt cell,                    in
and lastly, after long additional interval, the piece

     I did not find that the times required by the several crystals
in order to become phosphorescent were constant in different
experiments, nor even that these times were in a constant ratio.
But the uncovered crystal always became luminous first; then,
after from two to three times as long an interval, the crystal in
the salt cell began to shine, and that in the glass cell invariably
last of all... Both cells always became very hot, so that in taking
them quickly out of the heated space, in spite of a thick leathern
glove,   I generally burnt my fingers, and several times there was
a perceptible smell of singed leather.
   5. Very nearly an equal number of equally intense rays of
heat are received in equal times by the uncovered piece of fluor
spar and by the piece in the salt cell. It is true that a small
loss takes place owing to reflexion at the surfaces of the rock
salt plates and to absorption (8 per cent. according to the usual
estimate founded on Melloni’s experiments); but, on the other
hand, the rock-salt itself becomes heated and radiates from a
                                                          as,

power    of absorbing radiant heat,         gets heated chiefly

the hot air, and the glass plates themselves then radiate upon the
crystal. The intensity          the radiation from the glass can never

114                        Prof. C. Bohn on Negative Fluorescence
attained very quickly; and it appears, from observations to be
communicated    hereafter, that this maximum is not reached in
5% minutes (the time which elapsed, in the experiment recorded
above, before phosphorescence began, while in other cases it oc
curred still more quickly).    The radiation from the glass pro
ceeds, however,                 from greater proximity than that from the walls
of the stove.                  But it is impossible to obtain in this way any cer
tain estimate of the quantitative ratio of the radiation upon the
crystal in the glass cell as compared with that upon the unco
vered crystal.   It might therefore be more prudent not to insist
upon the retardation of the phosphorescence in the glass cell as
disproving the direct transformation of rays; but this retarda
tion certainly does not speak in favour of ray-transformation.
I  may mention further that when the fire in the stove was kept
so low that phosphorescence occurred slowly and with difficulty
in the uncovered crystal and in that in the salt cell, it did not
occur at            all

newed    heating, though perhaps not quite so easily as before.
Now it has been asserted by some physicists that phosphores
cence can be excited by heat only after previous exposure to
light; others, on the contrary, regard any such preliminary
insolation as unnecessary.   M. Fiebig has briefly collected to
gether these contradictory views”, and has arrived from experi
ments of his own, made with a piece of green fluor-spar, at the
conclusion that phosphorescence cannot be excited by heat with
out the previous action of rays of light. But as the same piece
of fluor-spar became repeatedly luminous, in my experiments
described in §§ 9 & 11, without having been exposed to light
in the intervals,      I
                    was induced to make a few special experi
ments in order to  acquire  further information as to the question
of the possibility of phosphorescence by heat without previous
exposure to light.
    13. During a dark night                 I
                                 caused one and the same fragment
of fluor-spar to phosphoresce forty times in succession by laying
it on the moderately hot plate of a stove; and the phosphorescence
was as bright and as easily produced the fortieth time as the
first. No exposure to light took place at all:               sat the whole    I
night in the dark.         Every time, as soon as the luminosity had
become quite distinct,           I
                                removed the piece of spar from the
heated stove-plate and allowed it to cool down to the tempera
ture of my hand on a small metal dish before making a new ex
periment. It continued luminous in the cold metal dish for
nearly a minute on an average, and it appeared to me sometimes
as though it shone, when first put into the metal dish, more
                                                                      -

mineral could be rendered luminous     by a  very gentle heat after
having been kept in the dark for months together.         He kept
one piece, that had been previously insolated, in the dark, and
examined it from time to time by night.        On the thirty-sixth
night after the exposure to light, a faint luminosity (Lichtschim
mer) was excited by a temperature of 40° R. On previous nights,
even so high a temperature as this was not needed; the heat of
the hand was sufficient. Won Grotthuss surprisingly concludes
“ that chlorophane, as well as other phosphorescent minerals,
never become luminous except as a consequence of previous ex
posure to light, or, in other words, that during phosphorescence
only that light is developed from them which they had absorbed
during previous exposure to light at some time or other, and
which had been incorporated with their ponderable matter”*.
I should have thought that, as the chlorophane received no new
supply by further exposure, the store of “absorbed light”
must have been exhausted by the thirty-sixth night, though this
cannot have been the case, since the phosphorescence still oc
curred. In my experiments the larger piece was luminous
altogether for nearly ten hours, for the most part shining very
brightly without any fresh exposure to light. This long-con
tinued and abundant emission of light would have exhausted a
 very considerable store, but yet      I
                                     could not detect any diminu
 tion of capacity; at most a somewhat higher temperature was
 required in order to evoke the luminosity when only a short                     in
 terval was allowed to elapse between two experiments; but even
this difference disappeared if the mineral was left longer in re
pose: it then became luminous at the same time as a piece
freshly broken off which had been exposed to light only a short
time before.
    I never heated the pieces of fluor-spar suspended in the cells
so strongly as to cause an alteration of their properties, nor
did I ever allow them to remain luminous long enough for their
luminosity to die out of itself while the external conditions re
                                               -- -

   15. The stove made use of in this experiment has two ovens,
placed  one above the other like two stories.   The bottom plate
of the upper one is 31 centims. above that of the lower one, and
the top plate of the whole stove is at the same distance above the
bottom plate of the upper oven. This latter was used as the
heated space in the experiments described in §§ 2, 4, 7, 9, and
11; and in general the fire was so regulated that the bottom
plate of the lower, unused oven was slightly red-hot. With the

intention of bringing the top plate of the stove to about the
same temperature as the bottom plate of the space into which
the pieces of fluor-spar with their cells were introduced had pre
viously possessed,   Inow increased the fire so much that the bot
tom plate of the upper oven became slightly red-hot.          I then
placed the crystals with their cells and the same tripods upon the
stove.    Here they did not become luminous, not even when                      I
made the fire still stronger.      Only a single mineral, a white
fluor-spar with brownish-black specks, and with more of a fatty
than the true vitreous lustre, which phosphoresced more easily
than any of the other specimens that            I
                                             examined—more easily
even than a chlorophane belonging to the mineralogical collection
of the University of Giessen, with which I had previously expe
rimented—only this one piece became luminous when placed
upon the stove, hanging freely in the air (not in a cell); and
even it required to be brought within a quarter of an inch of
the hot stove-plate.    If the crystals had been so long inside the
oven, where they received the radiation from five surfaces, as to
have become luminous and were then placed upon the stove, they
continued luminous for some time—as much as 2% minutes.
   16. In these experiments the under surface of the crystal was
exposed to just the same radiation as when it was inside the
oven; but the other surfaces of the fluor-spar were there also ex
posed to strong radiation.      Ifthe phosphorescence consisted in
a direct transformation of  rays,  and if it be further assumed that
the radiation must attain a certain degree of intensity in order
that the phenomenon may be perceptible, the crystals ought in
the last arrangement to become luminous, at least, at their under
surfaces.    But as this was not the case, this phenomenon is evi
dence against the analogy of phosphorescence and fluorescence.
On the other hand, if elevation of temperature is the only ex
citing cause of luminosity, this result cannot be expected to occur
when the crystals are placed upon the stove; for in this case they
are far from being as hot as when they are inside the oven.
For, when placed upon the stove, the crystals radiate in     direc     all
tions, except straight downwards, against relatively cold surfaces,
and thus lose   in  these directions more heat than they receive.

remained an hour in the heated space, so that equilibrium of
temperature had been reached, I threw small fragments of fluor
spar upon the dish and upon the flat-iron, and shaded them by
means of a pill-box-lid from the heat radiated by the sides of the
stove. In from one minute to one and a half, the fluor-spar upon
the flat-iron began to be luminous; but the fragments upon the
dish had not become luminous in five minutes, after which was                                                     I

pable of becoming phosphorescent at the temperature which bodies
attain inside the oven, when they are not to any important extent in
conducting communication with the sides, without being exposed
to direct radiation. The experiment with the flat-iron answers
this question in the affirmative, and that with the iron dish gives

described in § 18, which most likely has been long ago made by
others, is contrary to the assumption that any such coercive force
exists.   The fact that the intensity of the phosphorescence gra
dually decreases and at last becomes nothing, although the ex
ternal conditions remain unchanged, and can be renewed only
after a certain interval of repose, also speaks against M. Ems
mann's view.     Moreover the production of light at all, without
the necessity for exposing the phosphorescent bodies to light, is
opposed to a literal acceptation of M. Emsmann's view, although
the statement of this view might easily be modified so as to be
in harmony with this fact.       But the single circumstance that
many substances, including fluor-spar itself, are both fluorescent
and phosphorescent,      and therefore, according to this theory,
possess at the same time a weak and a strong coercive force, is
sufficient to show              its
                        inadmissibility.

sibly a combustion, accompanied, like the slow oxidation of
phosphorus, with evolution of light. The gradual extinction of
the light would, upon such a view, have to be regarded as an
exhaustion of the combustible material; and in the interval of
repose needed for the reacquisition of the phosphorescent power,
a new supply of this material might collect at a low temperature
upon the surface, either by deposition from the air or from the
interior of the mass of fluor-spar.   I do not, however, wish to be
understood as putting this forward as more than a possible
suggestion.
   22. On the other hand,      I
                               feel fully justified by the preceding
observations in denying the analogy between phosphorescence and
fluorescence.   But if once the notion that the phosphorescence
of fluor-spar is a direct transformation of rays of one kind into
rays of greater refrangibility is given up or refuted, it is impos
sible to regard the phenomena of incandescence produced by
Messrs. Akin and Tyndall as phenomena of the same kind as
fluorescence.
    Platinum wire becomes incandescent not only in a charcoal
fire, or by the action of a galvanic current, or in the flame of a
spirit-lamp, but also in the flame of hydrogen. The same ap
plies to lime. Metals become incandescent and melt, and paper
burns, if a certain temperature is reached, however the heat
needed to cause the rise of temperature is produced.
    Such, in my opinion, is the significance of the experiments of
Messrs. Akin and Tyndall.        The idea of negative fluorescence
in their case is out of the    question.           If
                                               water is heated to the
boiling-point, the properties of the hot water and of the steam
are exactly the same, whether the heat requisite for this purpose
was produced by the combustion of any substance whatever, or
by the discharge of electricity, or by the transformation of me
chanical work.     It is impossible for any one to detect in pure
warm water how and where it has got                its
                                                heat—whether from             a

allowed to make use of a mode of expression which is becoming
somewhat obsolete).   This statement makes no claim to novelty;
I  have myself made it as a passing remark a good while ago*.
The phenomena of incandescence at the focus of pure rays of
heat, rays of light and probably rays of heat of high refrangi
bility being excluded, amount to no more than a new argument
in support of this old truth.
   23. It is possible to give theoretical reasons in favour of the
existence of a negative fluorescence—that is to say, of a process
which increases the refrangibility of rays in the same way as it
is diminished in the phenomena of fluorescence as hitherto
observed.
   Professor Stokes assumes that the vibrations of the aether
which constitute the exciting light produce oscillations in the
molecules of the fluorescent body which are not infinitely small;
and hence it is concluded that their periods are longer than that
of the exciting light.   And as molecular movements give rise to
vibrations of the aether of equal period with themselves, the dis
persed light comes to be of less refrangibility than the exciting
rays.               O
   Professor Angström makes the same assumption as Professor
Stokes, but draws from the circumstance of the resulting mole
cular movements not being infinitely small the opposite conclu
sion t—namely, that oscillations of a higher order (that     the                                    is,
octave) are thereby imparted     the aether.  This would conse

     M. W. Eisenlohri   considers that fluorescence     produced                 is                       by
the interferenee            of
                     the bluish-violet and ultra-violet rays.  This

resulting rays is not too great for them to be perceptible by the
eye, the body must phosphoresce; but if it is too great, the
rays, which of themselves are invisible, might during the period
of exposure combine with the impinging rays (of course after
these have been reflected), and combination-colours might be so
produced, which would be directly cognizable by the eye. The

the first plate, can pass through the second.”               have always                       I
understood that those researches      prove  the  very  reverse, viz. that
the percentage of heat transmitted through the first plate is
less than that through the second.
   I presume it may now be regarded as established that when a
beam of light or of heat passes through any substance, those
rays are cut off which agree in period with those of the molecules
of the substance through which the beam passes, and that the
principal part of the absorption takes place on the beam entering
the substance, and that, when          the rays which agree all    period                                in
are cut off (when the beam          “sifted”),     those rays which re

proceeded       the  assumption

peculiar prime factor not          found      any other element; and

as his fundamental hypothesis, the indivisibility         the hydrogen                              of
unit, does not affect his reasoning,       does not assume that they       he
contain any other prime factor.          His assumption        therefore                                  is
here the same       ours; and his reasoning would have been the
                             as
very same            as far        is,   as

   Having now seen in what the two systems agree (or may by
a very slight accommodation of terminology be made to agree) and
in what they differ, we are in a position to estimate their rela
tive advantages.   We have seen that they are equally consistent
when properly used, and equally capable of mathematical treat
ment (for the first six sections of the calculus can be applied
to either). It is true that our system has an atomic origin and
retains traces of this in                        its
                                terminology; but may            used, and                    it               be

but if driven through the cork so as to touch the supersaturated
solution, it did not induce crystallization. A knitting-needle is
given as a convenient illustration of this phenomenon.      The most
efficient nucleus in inducing crystallization is a crystal of the salt
itself; but the efflorescence from a solution into the neck of a
phial contained in    large flask in which the air was dried by
                                 a

the vessel without inducing crystallization.    An open vessel con
taining a supersaturated solution will remain liquid if lightly
covered, as with a watch-glass.   Ziz distinctly recognized the ex
istence of two varieties of sulphate of soda with different fusing

chemically clean will act differently from a rod that has been ex
posed to the air: the latter is said to be in an “active” condi

not always do the work that is expected of it? But it may do
other work, and prove itself a more efficient agent than the so
called “active” rod. This is particularly the case with the                                                              in

   Eap. 2. A glass rod and a platinum spatula that had been
long exposed to the air were dipped first into A, then into B.
Gas-bubbles were abundantly liberated from the surface of both.
They were dipped into spirits of wine, rinsed in water, and then
placed in A and B.    Not a bubble of gas appeared on either
surface except above the points at which the bodies had been
made chemically clean; and there plenty of gas-bubbles appeared.
Indeed it was accurately determined by the formation of those
bubbles how far the rods had been dipped into the spirit.
   Now in these cases, where the surface is made chemically clean,
the attraction of adhesion between the liquid and the surface is
perfect. The clean surface is completely wetted, and there is no
liberation of gasº.        But       the surface   let  not chemically clean be
          readily becomes                   so   by

liquid does not wet the surface completely, and the gas, yielding
to the superior attraction            the solid, adheres

had not had time to become active by exposure to the air. I say
that they were active, as active as Nature's chemically clean
surfaces are, more active in fact than if they had been exposed
to the air. It is true they did not disengage gas; the adhesion
of the liquid was too perfect for that ; and it was necessary to
tame down the adhesive force in order to apply to them any one
         I
of what cannot help thinking are the mistaken terms active,
catalytic, and dynamic, as used with reference to this class of
phenomena.                                                              -
   The ingenious experiment on which M. Gernez chiefly relies
for the success of his theory, seems to me to require quite an
other explanation. A narrow tube, closed at one end and ren
dered “inactive ’’ on the outside, was lowered full of air into
the gaseous solution. “Gas adhered to the column of air which
the tube contained, forming quickly a large bubble, which was
disengaged; then another was produced, and so on. The gas
formed, then, only at the point where the liquid touched the co
lumn of air.”      “From this experiment,” says M. Germez,
“which   I havevaried in several ways, it may be concluded that
air sets up the disengagement of carbonic acid.”       Had M.
Gernez made the inside of his tube as “inactive” as the out
side, I think he would have found that the column of air had
nothing to do with the liberation of the gas.
    Eap. 12. A narrow tube   ll   inches long was kept for an hour in
a  quantity of spirits of wine 5 inches deep. It was then washed
in water, and closed at the top with the finger, and so just
dipped into a fresh quantity of soda-water.       There was no dis
engagement of gas.        The tube was lowered to various depths
with the same   result;   the finger was then removed, so that the
solution could enter the tube. There was no liberation of gas
until the immersion of the tube just exceeded 5 inches; and
then, at and about the boundary line marked by the spirit,
there was a liberation of gas, both on the inside and the outside
of the tube. The solution was 6 inches deep; the tube was
chemically clean for 5 inches of         its
                                         length both inside and out.
Above this there was    1  inch   ofthe tube that was not chemically
clean, which liberated gas.      The tube was taken out, wiped with
a  duster, drawn through the hand, and again inserted into the
solution. The whole length

                                                 the inside was free
from them as before.

me, that the so-called “active     condition

144    Royal   Society:-Mr. H. C. Sorby        on Analysis   of Animal
of cloud are   as follows:—
            6.9,   6.9,     7-2,    6-3,  6-6,   6-4,   6-4.
   The mean of the three days before last quarter is 7-0, whilst
the mean of the remaining four days is 6'42. The mean of the
seven amounts is 6'7.
   So also at full moon the mean amounts of cloud are
            6-6,   7-0,    6-6,     6-9,  6-2,    6.5,  7-1.
   And here again, though the mean of the seven amounts is
6-7, a tendency to dipersion of cloud seems to be indicated after
full moon. Indeed the amounts 62, at this period, and 6-3, at
last quarter, are the minimum amounts of cloud in the lunation
for the years 1841–47 at Greenwich.
   Very remarkable conclusions were arrived at by Schübler from
sixteen years’ observations of the direction of the windº.          The
south and west winds (which it is admitted are the most humid)
were found to increase in frequency from new moon to the 2nd
octant; whilst the last quarter was the epoch when these winds
were at a minimum, and north and east winds reached their
maximum.
    Schübler's results were confirmed generally by Mr. Glaisher
in the spring of this year, from a discussion of the observations
of the self-registering anemometer at Greenwich for the years
1841–47+.
   The number of hours during which the wind blows in any one
direction is accurately registered by this instrument; whilst cloud
measurements cannot be considered more than approximately
correct, and moreover leave the question of the height and den
sity of cloud untouched.

   My attention was first directed to this subject by reading a re
port of Professor Stokes's very excellent lecture at the Royal Insti

and Vegetable Colouring-matters                               by the Spectrum Microscope.                              145
tution, Friday, March 4th, 1864 *.    It immediately occurred to me
that a  spectroscope  might be combined with a microscope, and em
ployed to distinguish coloured minerals in thin sections of rocks and
meteorites.            I
                was soon led to examine many other coloured sub
stances, and found that the instrument is more useful in connexion
with qualitative analysis when only very small quantities of mate-
rial can be obtained.
                                                  2.    Apparatus.
    I  have an ordinary large binocular microscope, and use an object
glass of about three inches focallength, corrected for looking through
glass an inch thick, the lenses being at the top, so as to be as far as
possible from the slit. This is placed at the focus; and between it
and the lenses, at a distance of about half an inch from them, is a
compound prism, composed of a rectangular prism of flint-glass, and
two of crown-glass of about 61°, one at each end.                 This arrangement
gives direct vision and a spectrum of the size most suitable for these
inquiries, since a wide dispersion often makes the absorption-bands
far too indistinct.       In order to be able to compare two spectra side
by side, a small rectangular prism is fixed over half the slit, and
with the acute angle parallel to and just passing beyond                         This                       it.
gives      an admirable result, the only defect being that, when the
spectra are        focus, their line
                     in                    junction        some distance within it;

and therefore           correct this
                            to           use       cylindrical

this account    shall say nothing about modified chemical methods,

and Vegetable Colouring-matters by the Spectrum Microscope.             151
at command.         My aim has been to contrive a special system of
qualitative analysis of coloured substances applicable to minute quan
tities, and as independent of general chemistry as the blowpipe method
 is in the case of minerals.   I may here say that, in some very important
practical applications to the detection of blood-stains, not above
Tºm of a grain was at disposal, and yet perfectly satisfactory results
were obtained.
     I was led to study the colouring-matters of flowers, leaves, fruits,
 woods, and roots, because it appeared a most admirable field of
inquiry to teach the general principles of the subject. The colours
 being so various, and occurring under such complicated conditions,
 I  thought that if methods could be devised to distinguish those
 that are dissimilar and to prove the identity of those that are alike,
even when mixed with coloured impurities, such principles could easily
be applied to other inquiries.      If the question were merely to distin
guish or compare absolutely pure colouring-matters, there would be
little or no difficulty; but it appeared to me that one great value of
the method would be to be able to apply it at once to very impure
and mixed materials.       In such cases mere colour is of very secondary
importance, since that may be totally changed by a very small amount
of impurity.
                         7. Preparation    of Colours.
     If the petals, leaves, &c. of plants be crushed in water, it very
 commonly happens that the colour is rapidly decomposed and
no clear solution can be obtained; but if crushed in a mode
rate quantity of spirits of wine, and the solutions queezed out,         fil
tered, and evaporated to dryness at a gentle heat, the colouring
matter does not decompose, even when redissolved in water and
filtered to remove anything not soluble in that liquid. This clear
solution should then be evaporated to dryness at a gentle heat in a
small saucer, and kept dry; for then the colours often undergo no
important change in the course of many months, whereas, when kept
dissolved in water or alcohol, they may quickly decompose.          I  have
thus prepared the colouring-matter of above a hundred different
vegetable substances, some of which have become entirely changed,
but a large number are apparently still unaltered.        I have also kept
a number of colours, sealed up in glass tubes, ready for direct exami
nation, dissolved in alcohol, in strong syrup, or in alum.            Many
have decomposed; but many have kept perfectly well, or have merely
faded, and still give excellent spectra after above a year.         I  have
also prepared and kept in the same manner some animal colouring
matters, but comparatively few.
                        8. Method    of Eramination.
    The coloured substances are examined, when dissolved in water,
alcohol, or other solvent, in the small glass cells already described;
and the various reagents are added and mixed by means of a mode
rately stout platinum wire, flattened at one end and turned up square,
like a little hoe.    I have made many experiments in order to ascer
tain what reagents are most serviceable in developing characteristic

152    Royal Society:—Mr.                     H. C. Sorby      on Analysis    of Animal
spectra, and have at length concluded that for general purposes the
following are the most convenient. Those which are solid are best
kept in small bottles as coarse powder, and added to the small cells
in a solid state, so that the quantity used may be more readily known.
                                        9. Reagents.
                           Hydrochloric acid.

  This list might of course   be very much extended, if we were to
include such reagents as    may  be used in separating or decomposing
colours by the ordinary chemical methods.       In describing the effect
                                        I                 I
of those named in this list, feel that could not avoid mentioning
some well-known facts without breaking the thread of my argument;
and therefore      I
                 trust it may not be thought out of place if give a                      I
general account of the whole from the particular point of view required
by the subject more especially before us.
   The action of many reagents is so intimately related to different
parts of the spectrum, as to show that there must be some connexion
between so-called chemical reactions and optical phenomena.         Not
that their effect is absolutely the same in the case of        coloured           all
substances, but generally only the extent differs, whilst the character
of the change    uniform,    unless, indeed, decomposition take place;

  Water and alcohol            are the most useful solvents, and the spectra

lutely identical; but often well-marked narrow absorption-bands are
seen  in the alcoholic solution, where they are almost,          quite, in    or
visible in the aqueous. Very commonly the same bands are seen                                     in

central and upper absorption also varies very greatly in different
colours.         If
                there is no general absorption in the centre of the spec
trum when the colour is neutral, but only an absorption at the blue
end, acids and alkalies act on it in precisely the same manner as on
the absorption at the blue end in the case just described, raising or
lowering it to an extent varying greatly according to the substance ;
and the same may be said of any general absorption at the red end.
The reverse certainly occurs when an acid is added to chromate of
potash, or excess of ammonia to a salt of copper; and, according
to Stokes (Phil. Trans. 1862, p. 609), alkaloid bases usually show
this reverse action.         It may depend on the different properties of
two distinct compounds, which does not appear to be the cause
of the phenomena now under consideration. In the case of                     the                              all

   Acids produce no important change, and the effect of alkalies is
best seen by gradually adding carbonate of soda.         This alters the
colour to a more and more blue purple, and the spectrum is changed
in the manner shown in fig. 3. The three bands seen in the neu
tral solution may be referred to as b, c, and d, and their centres
occur at equal intervals of about 14. When enough carbonate of
soda has been added to make it slightly purple, a fourth band, a,
makes         its
           appearance, separated from        the same equal interval

Ammonia does not produce this effect when the colour is dissolved
in alcohol, the solution remaining fluorescent and still giving the
narrow band; and, as a general rule, that solvent greatly impedes or
entirely prevents such changes, and on this account almost invari
ably shows absorption-bands to the greatest advantage.
   We therefore see from the above examples that the absorption
follows the general rule, and is raised by acids, and depressed by alka
lies; but this only applies to the absorption when viewed as a whole,
and not to the separate bands; for those reagents change their
intensity, but not their position.            In some cases, indeed, their posi
tion is  slightly  altered;   so that    perhaps    it would be more correct to
say that acids and alkalies may raise and depress the general ab
sorption to an extent equal to a considerable fraction of                        own                           its

known substance gave rise to similar spectra, with bands at unequal
intervals, we ought strongly to suspect either that it was naturally
composite, or that some new compound had been formed by decom
position.      As a very good illustration                       I
                                                 may refer to the product of
the action of acids on chlorophyll. The band in the red is not at
an equal interval; but, on careful examination, it is seen to be made
up of two bands, the upper of which is at an equal interval.             was                  I
not aware that these were due to two different substances, but was led
to think it very probable; and Professor Stokes informs me that he has
proved it to be the case.       As an illustration of another kind of excep
tion,      I
           refer to the  colouring-matter     of the pink Stock (Matthiola
annua).       The  aqueous   solution shows two bands, whose centres are
at about 3% and     54;  and on adding ammonia the upper is removed,
and the lower      depressed   to 3}.    In spirit of wine they are at 4 and
5}, and ammonia developes a third at 3, which are not equal inter
vals. However, if absolute alcohol be used, the bands are at 23, 4},
and 5}, which are equalintervals; and thus we see that the abnormal
inequality is due to the presence of water, which causes the spec
trum to be as if due to a mixture of two colours, when in reality
it is the same colour dissolved in two solvents.
   In spectra showing one absorption-band, there is very commonly a
general absorption extending from it towards the blue end; whereas
it so seldom extends towards the red end that it is doubtful if it
ever occurs in substances undoubtedly not a mixture of two colours.
It can, however, so easily occur in mixed colours, that any substance
giving rise to such a spectrum is probably a mixture.            Many illus
trations might be given; but I will select Brazil-wood, and the same
artificially mixed with the colour of beet-root.         Adding bicarbonate
of ammonia to both, we have—
               Brazil-wood   alone   ......             4?–5?        ... 7
               Brazil-wood and beet-root                    3}...43–5;       . . . . . 8
Here, then, the shading below the absorption-band from 34 to 43 is
evidence of the second colour; and if such a mixture had occurred
naturally         its
             mixed character might easily have been overlooked.                                   I
have found  many  cases similar  this, and had proved that they were
                                               to
mixtures before   was aware that the spectra indicated
                        I                                       these                  it.   If
very common facts turn out        general laws, we might thus detect
                                          to      be

tures of different groups.   Even if it should be found that perfectly
simple colouring-matters may have, as it were, intermediate characters,
such appear to be so rare that practically they may be classed with
mixtures until some reason be found for *classing them together as
exceptions.
   These reactions of sulphite of soda are so much interfered with
by the presence of alcohol, that it should never be employed as a
solvent, unless the substance is insoluble in water; and then it should
be diluted as much as possible, since the ordinary spirit of wine
with an equal quantity of water is the extreme strength admissible,
and even that very much delays the reaction.       The effect of various
other reagents is also sometimes very different, according to the
nature of the solvent.
   The three groups A, B, and C differ in other particulars.       It is
easy to change A or B into C by various reagents which produce
                                I
decomposition; but do not know a case where C can be changed into
A or B. Caustic alkalies usually soon decompose colours belonging
to group A, when dissolved in water, but act slowly on those of
groups B and C.       Usually colours of group C are far more perma
ment than those of groups A and B; and to it belong most of the
vegetable colours used in dyeing, and nearly        yellows.                      all

difference; for this is very often the case, and very important facts
may be overlooked if too great an excess be added at first. The ad
dition of a small bit of sulphite of soda then shows at once whether
or not a colour belonging to group A is present; and on adding
excess of citric acid we may also determine whether it chiefly be
longs to groups B or C.     Ammonia should then be added in excess,
which may or may not restore it to the same state as before the ad
dition of the acid. To another portion of colour carbonate of soda
should be added, and then excess of citric acid, both spectra being
carefully observed; and finally sulphite of soda, which definitely
shows whether or not there is any other colour than one belonging to
group C.     Combining the results of the two sets of experiments, we
may decide whether it belongs to groups A, B, or C, or is a mixture
of any of them. If the substance is insoluble in water but soluble
in alcohol, the same experiments should be made; only we must add
 the colour dissolved in alcohol to as much water as can be used with
 out making the solution turbid, and must remember how much the
 presence of alcohol may interfere with the action of some of the re
agents.
    Another portion of the neutral colour should then be dissolved
 in as strong alcohol as will give a clear solution, and ammonia,
 benzoic acid, a little citric acid, and much of it added, one after the
 other, and     allthe spectra carefully observed,          well      any other as             as
facts which   may   present   themselves.
    By thus using three separate quantities           colour, and adding re
                                                                     of
agents one after the other, we may obtain about                  dozen spectra,       a
which   may   differ from one another          important  in particulars,                                    or   in
some few cases may                     all
                                alike. The experiments are          easily made,

neutral aqueous solutions exhibit 0, 1, 2, 3, &c. decided absorption
bands. Sometimes one of them may be so obscure that we may hesi
tate whether it should be counted or not; but practically this is no
very serious objection, if we decide to reckon only distinct bands,
and to look on the fainter as important merely in identifying indivi
dual colours.    If no absorption-band can be seen in the neutral
solution, we may take into account those seen when more or less
ammonia is added; and if none occur in either case, we may make
use of those seen in the alcoholic solution when neutral, and after the
addition of ammonia. Whenever in this order of experiments the
solution gives any decided absorption-band, the subgroup is deter
mined; and it is only when none has been produced that the process
must be carried further.
   The general connexion of the subgroups will be best seen fro-
the following Table:–                                                                               amo

     Such spectra are at once seen to differ most decidedly when compared
     side by side; and that the colouring-matters are entirely different is
     proved by other facts.    If the absorption-bands agree very closely,
     we  ought  to compare  other spectra before concluding that the sub
     stances are the same.

        Of course, if any impurity is present which absorbs that part of
     the spectrum where the characteristic bands occur, it may be diffi
     cult, or even impossible, to determine the nature of the substance;
     but the rest of the spectrum may be obscured, and the general colour
     entirely changed, without the least difficulty being thereby produced.

  is to distinguish the separate colours, if we are not sure that they are
  pure and simple.     Sometimes special facts may be of use; but, as a
  general rule, we are compelled to have recourse to the position and
   character of the general absorption. This requires a good deal of
  care, since a difference in the state of the solution may make the
   same colour differ more than two quite distinct colours. After trying
  a number of experiments, I find that the best spectra for comparison
  are those obtained by adding first a moderate excess of carbonate of
  soda, and then a considerable excess of citric acid.     Both of these .
  solutions change very slowly, and give well-marked spectra; whereas
  ammonia often causes decomposition, and weaker alkalies or acids
  give much more faint spectra, or such as rapidly fade. Closely re
  lated colours should be compared together, and made as nearly equal
  as possible after the addition of the carbonate, and then citric acid
  added in considerable, and nearly equal, excess. . We thus can com
  pare two different spectra; and even if the position of the absorp
  tion is the same in both cases, the relative intensity may vary consi
  derably. Very closely allied colours may often be easily distin
  guished in this manner; and the only great difficulty is when coloured
  impurities are present. As an example,                              I

   Sometimes in examining colours of group C, advantage may be
taken of the different rate at which their acid solutions decompose
and fade when a considerable quantity of sulphite of soda has been
added to an acid solution.     The two solutions should be made as
nearly equal as possible in                      all
                                respects; and then the rate       fading                                   of

over it was not very long, it could not be broken in the ordinary
manner.           I made a few experiments in order to ascertain the great
est tension at the time of the fracture.                  In an oval brass holder
small holes were bored, through which the tail was introduced; the
pear-shaped part projected sufficiently, and the part in the holder
was fixed by means of gypsum.                 Two waxed threads fastened to the
projecting part formed a small loop, on which, by means of a hook, a
scale-pan could be suspended, into which shot fell in a thin stream
from a small height.             The following measurements were previously
made :-the horizontal distance l of the hook from the holder; the
axes a and 6 of the elliptical section in the neighbourhood of the
holder, a being supposed horizontal. The experiment yielded the load
P for the moment of the fracture. Denoting by R the greatest ten
sion in the external parts of the section for the same moment, we
have, by a known principle,

     Glass vessels containing water in which the pear-shaped part of
a tear is held when it is broken off are, as is well known, frequently
broken even when the sides are pretty thick.                 Still more interesting
is the     following      experiment:—A         glass  tear is held by means of a
lateral stand in the middle of a small opodel.doc bottle, and molten
resin is poured into the glass.             If now after the resin has quite soli
dified and cooled the           projecting   tail be broken off, the glass smashes
 with    violence;      the  fragments     of resin which have been in contact
with the glass show deep fissures; but, what is the chief point,
the glass tear itself forms a continuous whole, though rather loosely
aggregated, which has detached itself like a kernel from the burst
resinous shell. The surface of the pear, which of course has become
opake, exhibits a peculiar glitter.             If the kernel be broken in pieces,
a   body    is   readily  obtained    consisting   of a lower hemisphere and su
perposed cone, suggestive of certain forms of hail.
     Parallel to the plane of contact of the cone there appears a tole
rably regular separation in layers in the kernel; and since the sur
faces of the cracks form in certain places small angles with the
surface, the above-mentioned glitter is easily explained.
    I  restrict myself to the communication of the above facts. A per
 fectly satisfactory explanation of the causes of the hardness and brit
 tleness of hardened glass and steel we do not possess, so far as I

know:         as regards glass, Knapp's ‘Chemical Technology’ contains
remarks from a     professional   point  of view. Whether the explosive
force of the   bursting   tears is a direct action of the tensions arising
from sudden     cooling,  or whether the glass particles loosened by a
wave of   agitation   impinge   against each other like elastic bodies and
are  immediately    repelled, is a further question the decision of which
is  closely connected with a clear view of the nature of hardened
glass.     More competent physicists may perhaps find themselves
incited by my communication to devote their attention to the matter.

XXI.       On testing Telegraph Cables during the process                   of Sheath
                    ing.   By Louis Schwen DLER+.
A TELEGRAPH          cable, when complete, should be “electrically
           normal;” i.
                   e. its resistances of conductor and insulator
should correspond  exactly  with those of the different lengths of
which it is composed, and which were tested before being joined                   º
together during sheathing.
   The excellent method first suggested and applied by Messrs.
Siemens in testing the Malta-Alexandria cable, gives us both the
resistances of insulation and conduction for equal lengths of core
at a standard temperature and pressure, expressed in the same
unit, the period of time which elapses between connecting the
battery to the cable and taking the reading being always the same.
It has occurred to me, nevertheless, that at present we are not
in a position to make a profitable use of these valuable tests to
decide the normal condition of a cable satisfactorily. As regards
the conductor, we are indeed able to do so; for not only can we
measure       its
             resistance very exactly, but we are also able     cal                to
culate the conductor resistance of the whole cable from those of
 itsdifferent parts; and  this calculated resistance (the tempe
                                    if
rature being taken into account) coincides with the measured
resistance,         we
                may consider the cable “normal            conduc       in   its
tivity.”
   But the same cannot              be   said   of   the insulation, which, however,
is   of   greater importance.            The insulation resistance          of    a   cable

 170               Mr. L. Schwendler                   on Testing Telegraph Cables
 is an unknown function of the time during which the battery
 circuit is closed and of the length, and also an unknown func
 tion of the temperature.     We cannot, therefore, yet calculate
 the insulation of the whole from      different parts until     its

                       during the process          of Sheathing.                          171
     It
      will hardly be necessary to show that a permanent test for
insulation during the hazardous process of sheathing would ne
vertheless be of far greater importance than the mere test for
continuity.
   Being entrusted at the cable-works of Messrs. Siemens with
testing their cables,       I
                        began to search for a method which would
not  only give the insulation of a cable during manufacture at a
glance, and be applicable by means of an automatic instrument
during the sheathing-process, but be also on a level with the
delicate instruments now employed for cable-testing.
   This method, which           I
                            have had in practical operation for some
time, is based on the well-known principle on which the deter
mination of a fault depends when the two ends of a cable are at
hand—known as the loop method.         The two ends of the cable
are connected with the ends of the galvanometer (forming two
sides of a Wheatstone's balance), and the battery put in circuit,
using the leakage of the whole cable as one entrance of the cur
rent, and the point m, fig. 1, as the other, a and d representing
two branch resistances, and W an adjustable coil. The pole of
                                         Fig. 1.
the battery connected with m is insulated completely from the
earth. It is evident that, however the insulation of this cable be
distributed throughout
given branch resistances

   (1) This method furnishes practicable means                which                                   by     it   is
possible     test the cables for insulation and
                to                                   continuity  together
permanently during manufacture. For this purpose the galva
                                              used simply
                                                                                                       as
nometer       Wheatstone's diagram
                in                                                 needle

relay.   The instant a fault either in insulation or continuity
occurs, the balance is disturbed and the needle closes the circuit
of another battery containing an alarm so as to give a signal.
   (2) The position of the resultant fault is independent of tem
perature so long as the latter remains uniform—also of the length
of the cable and the time occupied in testing, i. e. of what is
called electrification—and, further, of the electromotive force.
Thus the position of the resultant fault may be calculated exactly
and tested as nearly as the sensibility of the present galvano
meters permit.
   (3) By observing the position of the resultant fault every day
and finding its maximum resistance, we are able to determine
the position of a slight fault, which may afterwards occur, with
great exactness.
  As full proof of the existence of the above advantages is re
quired, it will be necessary to enter into the theory of this me
thod for testing cables; and this                  I
                                         shall endeavour to do as
briefly as possible in the following.
   Suppose, first, a cable to have only two faults,          other             all
points being insulated absolutely; then                     by

XXII.      On a Connevion between Crystalline Form and Chemical

              the protoxides, like the metallic
                oxides,
                       isometrict in crystallization.
                                                                                          elements,

sesquioxides  are as characteristically heavagonal, this being the
form of the sesquioxides of iron, aluminium, and chromium. The
deutoxides are typically tetragonal, as seen in the deutoxide of
tin (tin-ore) and of titanium (rutile and anatase). There are
other forms   among  protoxides, sesquioxides, and deutoxides:
for example, ZnO is hexagonal; TiO2 in Brookite, and MnO’ in
pyrolusite are orthorhombic; but these cases, as the following
observations make apparent, may be regarded as a consequence
of polymerism—a principle that has been recognized by others
as underlying dimorphism.

from Silliman’s American Journal for July 1867.
   t  I propose to employ in the forthcoming edition of my “Mineralogy’
the terms Isometric, Tetragonal (having a square base), and Orthorhombic
(erect on a rhombic base), in place respectively of Monometric, Dimetric,
and Trimetric. Monometric describes a line better than a cube; the hexa
gonal prism is as much dimetric as the square prism; and the oblique
prisms are as truly trimetric as the right rhombic.      It is very desirable that
the technical terms of science should be uniform over the world, as far as
possible, and that authors should be willing to yield their own usage for
the sake of uniformity, The terms adopted appear to be the best that have
been proposed, and have already extensive use in Europe.              Isometric is
Hausmann’s term; tetragonal and heavagonal, with rhombic, are employed
by Naumann. Mohs's terms pyramidal for the tetragonal system, and
prismatic for the orthorhombic, are exceedingly bad, as there are pyramids
among isometric, orthorhombic, and hexagonal forms, as well as the tetra
gonal; and prisms in      all
                            the systems excepting the isometric.
   There  is additional reason for our proposed change,          the natural rela
                                                                            in
tions   of the systems    of crystallization; for the similarity        the names    in
monometric, dimetric, trimetric (the latter two the monodimetrische and
trimetrische   of  Hausmann) implies         fundamental relation

isometric system, peculiar       in

tragonal and hexagonal forms (alike named from the shape                 the base),  of

maining systems, and distinct         having the axes

for the monoclinic system, and       well enough.  But clinorhomboidal for
the triclinic would not    be
                          desirable,                  as
                                        the French commonly use the word
rhomboidal where others use rhombic; and the diclinic could have no cor

part   of indifferentism in compounds; and many                                    formulae have
of late been written by chemists admitting this.                                    Apophyllite
is a tetragonal species consisting of R+2Si-H2H. Making the
water basic, there is still no conformity to the type of either the
unisilicates or bisilicates, the oxygen-ratio for the bases and silica
being 3:4.      If half the water be regarded as basic, and the for
mula be written (R, H)*Si-H. HŠi, it is made to consist of a do
minant part which is a unisilicate analogous to the tetragonal
species meionite, mellilite, &c., and a bisilicate which is a kind
of opal or water-glass, well known to be a “colloid,” or uncrys
tallizable, and which therefore might well have no effect toward
modifying the crystallization as determined by the other part.

silicon has turned out to be only isometric silicon, we have no
chance for a comparison, like that with respect to carbon.
    Anatase is probably TiO2, and rutile Ti” 0°, the density of the
latter being 4.2, of the former only 3.9. The relations of Haus
mannite and Braunite (p. 179, note) accord with this, the latter
containing two of Hausmannite.        Brookite is intermediate in
density, and in the temperature of origin, and hence may be
§(TiO2). It would appear, therefore, that the species of highest
polymerous state, rutile, forms at the highest temperature.

                                              here state formally, what
has been more than once implied in the foregoing, that while,
according to the principle advanced, tetragonal and hexagonal
forms depend on the numbers 4 and 3, as explained, the pre
sence of these numbers by no means necessitates the occurrence
of these forms. Multitudes of examples illustrate this: the di
morphism of TiO2 is one.                         I
                                  would also remark that         express                           I
no opinion as to whether the molecule of a compound consists of
the positive and negative atoms simply juxtaposed, or whether
these so-called atoms are composed of particles, and there is a
different disposition in the molecule,       and assert only that, what
ever the fact on this   point,  there is  tetragonal   symmetry in the
constitution of the molecule in the      tetragonal  system,  and hexa
gonal in the hexagonal system.
     Ileave the subject here, without discussing at present the
methods by which orthorhombic and clinohedral forms are pro
duced,—only observing that orthorhombic and monoclinic forms

     What physiologists call general sensation or common sensibi
 lity is affected by radiant heat. This we know to consist of un
 dulations of the aether, like those which convey the impression of
 light to the sight. They are freely propagated from a distance
 through space devoid of gross matter; and when a substance in
 tervenes,         whether this heat is reflected                      transmitted from       it,

  with the gross molecules.             The other part          the hypothesis      of                                 is

  the aethereal     undulating      nuclei. We have submitted that these
  orbits are conic sections, and that upon the kind                      conic sec                 of

  Now,  if  it        be
                     true that the gross molecules revolve, and that their
  orbits   undergo     transformations          the conditionas      the substance            of

                                           have three cognate senses—touch,

the surface of water (putting aside the effect of sensible heat)
only conveys information of the presence of the liquid by the re
sistance called into action by pressure. Then the molecules of the
liquid seem to impinge on the sense of touch after the same man
ner as solids.     And so, too, air in motion makes itself felt
 (putting aside the difference of temperature) by the resistance
it opposes to the proper scnse of touch. In addition to the above
considerations, we may observe that it is by the sense of touch the
mind is made acquainted with the size, form, and other external
features of bodies, remarking that such attributes belong only
to the solid condition of matter.     Again, the sense of taste has
especial reference to the liquid state of matter,       proper nerves            its
being affected only             by
                           matter    that condition.

       light some months ago, that there are comets moving
the tracks    the August and November meteors, compels
                  of                                                                                   to in to
infer that there   some intimate physical connexion between the
                            is
two.     January last M. Leverrier pointed out that such stream
        In                                                                                        a
of meteors must have been     compact clusters when they under
                                                  in
went the great perturbations which brought them into perma
ment connexion with the solar system.     And Mr. Graham has
lately shown that the meteoric iron which reaches our earth had
been     some previous time red-hot, and that when last red-hot
        at
it was acted            on       by
                    hydrogen under considerable                                             pressure—a
pressure      of
           perhaps six     more atmospheres.or                                        It   is   my present

to trace      by

comets and the meteors has been.

                                  between Comets and Meteors.                                                                189
gether by the previous repetitions of this process+.   In this way,
a comet while moving in outer    space,   beyond  the reach of the
many powerful disturbing influences which prevail within the
solar system, would inevitably accumulate within itself just
such a globular cluster of meteorites as the November meteors
must have been before they became associated with the solar
system.
     When this body of meteors, enveloped by their comet, swept
past the planet Uranus in the year 126, they may have come so
close that the comet brushed against the atmosphere of the planet.
If this took place, the comet must have both received a motion
of rotation and been retardedf. The meteorites at         centre re                                       its
taining their speed would accordingly gradually pass out through
it and leave      little behind; and when

  The discovery of the Master of the Mint becomes now of ex
ceeding interest, since it seems to show, first, that hydrogen is
one of the constituents of comets; secondly, that the meteoric
bodies he examined, when they originally joined their comet,
fell in with a velocity sufficient to raise them by the friction
they suffered to a red heat; thirdly, that the density of the
comet was sufficient to occasion in front of the advancing me
teorite a pressure of several atmospheres; fourthly, that when
the meteors and the comet afterwards parted company, they
glided asunder so quietly that the meteors were not again raised
to any very high temperature; and, finally, that the friction
they again encountered in passing through the earth's atmo
 sphere was not sufficiently protracted to raise their internal parts
to a red heat.
    When the cluster of November meteors passed the planet
which diverted them into the solar system, they were unequally
 acted on by        it,
                  the path     those which lay nearest being most
                                               of

 their subsequently moving       slightly differing orbits with slightly
                                                    in
 different periodic times round the sum—which after the lapse                                                          of
 many revolutions has gradually extended them along their learly
 common path, and will         time goes         still further lengthen
                                                as                     on

 sufficient    to
               restrain the meteors which were      originally   within                                                it

very in portant conclusion follows, which has already been no
ticed by M. Lamarle+ ; for, imagine that through a tangent to
the curve a section is made normal to the surface. According
to Meusnier's theorem, any oblique section whatever passing
through the same tangent will have a radius of curvature equal
to the projection, on the plane of this section, of the radius of cur
vature of the normal section. This being granted, if this theorem
be applied to the section passing through the osculating plane
of the curve, it is found that the normal section must necessarily
have an infinite radius of curvature.
   It follows thence that the curves formed by the flexible thread
on liquid films are precisely those which M. Dupin has called
asymptotic linest, or those which Mr. Michael Roberts has called
generating lines<U+017F>. There arises then the interesting question
which forms the subject of the present research—that of ascer
taining whether the properties of the lines of equilibrium of ten
sion can be reconciled with the nature of the minimum surface
operated upon.
   We know that the surfaces of mean zero curvature may be
represented, according to Monge, by the three following equa

      If we
         put p"=0, \!"=0, we shall find, after having eliminated
u and v in the equations (1), a result of the form
                                             z= Aw--By--C;
consequently the minimum surface is then a plane. As the cur
vature of the lines formed by the thread must be constant, this
latter will always assume a circular form. This    verified by                                   I

brium of tension on the skew helicoid are the rectilinear genera
ting lines, the axis, and the helices of the same pitch as the                             di
recting helix*.
   In order to submit these theoretical deductions to the test of
experiment,      I
                produced the surface in question in the shape of a
film. M.    Plateau,  applying a general principle which he gave
in one of his  memoirsi,  has produced this figure and pointed it
out in a research which is as yet unpublished; but he has au
thorized me to use it and describe it
here. A helix (fig. 1) is made of iron              Fig. 1.
wire, the distance between the turns of                      n
which is 30 millims. for example, and
which belongs to a cylinder of 45 mil
lims. radius. Any number of turns of
this helix may in general be taken; but
for the present purpose it is best to work
with only one turn. The ends of this
latter are joined by straight iron wires to
another straight wire, serving as axis of
the helix and furnished with a prolonga
tion, by which the skeleton can be easily immersed in the gly
cerine liquid. It is clear that we have obtained a closed contour
belonging to a skew helicoid; and according to Plateau’s prin
 ciple we should obtain a helicoidal film when the skeleton is
 withdrawn from the liquid : this is confirmed in every respect
                                                                           -
 by observation.
     Since the verification of the theory requires in the present case
 very accurate experiments,           I
                                   thought it necessary to give up using
 silk or cotton threads; for their weight, together with that of the
 liquid in which they are immersed, is too great to be disregarded;

not acquire a greater area in proportion as it is more profoundly
altered, and hence does not oppose an increasing resistance to this
augmented surface in proportionas this further removes the figure
from the form of original stable equilibrium.        This supposition
has been   justified by the following  experiment.   On the helicoidal
film a cocoon-thread, 50 to 60 millims. in length, is arranged,
the two ends of which have been tied; after having burst the
film interior to this contour, the thread, by the effect of                                                        its

tension. In order to verify this result by direct observation,                                                          I
use the two rings described in my former note; they are 70
millims. in diameter; the upper one is provided with a suspender,
the lower one resting on three feet.    Suppose, for instance, the
distance of these rings is 40 millims.,    seek the length of the         I
portion of the asymptotic line drawn from one to the other; for
this purpose the portion of the meridian catenary comprised be
tween the same rings may be divided by the cosine of 45°t;
I thus obtain for the desired length nearly 63 millims.    On the
other hand, it is easily found that the meridian planes passing
through the extremities of this portion of the asymptotic lines
form an angle of about 86°.
   This being granted, the following is the way in which the ex
periment is made.                    I

The least diameter of the ellipsoidal bulb which      used was 15                    I
millims., and the maximum 20 millims.
     Irepeated the same experiment with a helicoidal film ; the
bulb remained at one point of the solid helix, the entire surface
of which it could traverse without leaving the film when                                                 I
turned the axis of the surface, keeping it horizontal. The termi

   The following is what imagine to be the explanation of the
effects which I have noticed.     As soon as the plane film touches
the bulb, it fastens on to it in a section whose area expresses the
diminution of the surface of this film; as this is subject in                                           all

   If  we now form a spectrum of this radiant image, either by a
prism or by diffraction, we shall have the radiant spectrum shown
in fig. 2, where M N is the spectrum of the small circular image
S, and A B the spectrum of the radiation, the centre of which
is beyond the violet, and nearly in the place where the intensity
of the chemical or invisible rays is a maximum.                          -

     If
      we now refract laterally these homogeneous radiant spectra,
fig. 3 will be changed into fig. 6, fig. 4 into fig. 7, and fig. 5 into
fig. 8, thus proving that the radiant portion of the spectra con
sists of rays more refrangible than the portion R, Y, and V from
which it is derived, and that the difference between the refractive
indices of these portions increases with the refrangibility of the
rays at R, Y, and W.
   The compound spectrum M. N, AB, fig. 2, is therefore com
               in all
posed of      these separate spectra; and      we refract    laterally,
                                                                      if                   it

                        we produce the oblique radiant spectrum
M'N', A'B', thus proving that the radiant image consists           rays                                  of
more   refrangible   than the homogeneous    light  from which                                            it   is
derived.

increases, in consequence of the gas being subject to greater

that the number of molecules whose motion has to be augmented
likewise increases, for equal volumes, proportionally to the

  § 2. Comparison of consequences following from the conclusions
      arrived at with the results of observations of other kinds.
   The correctness of the values above arrived at, and of the
views upon which they are based, is capable of being tested by a
comparative examination of the values deduced from them of
magnitudes for which numerical values have already been obtained
by observations and reasoning of a different kind. Thus from
equations (6) and (7) we obtain, for the ratio of the two specific
heats,

   As this value is independent of the magnitude a, if the ratio
of the several constituent portions of the specific heat (namely
n: 3:2) upon which it is based be admitted, it must be absolutely
correct.  For gases with diatomic molecules, such, for instance,
as the permanent gases, we have

specific heat of the permanent gases, the corresponding values

   and connewion of the differences between the values found and
   those calculated for the state of perfect gases with chemical
   composition.
   In    the annexed Table there are            contained:—
   Incolumn 1, the names of the gases.
  In column 2, their chemical composition.
  In column 3, in general, the theoretical specific gravities given
by Regnault+. These numbers were recalculated (by the for

duced in place of the one given by Regnault whenever the dif
ference between them was great enough to affect the third deci
mal place of the values in column 5. In order to distinguish
the numbers thus substituted, they are given with only three
places  of decimals.   For the specific heat of nitrogen, referred
to volume,   it is immaterial whether the specific gravity 0-9713
given by Regnault, or the theoretical specific gravity 0.968 be
adopted, inasmuch as Regnault calculated it directly from the
specific heats of oxygen and air, and then deduced from it the
specific heat of the unit of weight.
   In column 4, the value of the specific heats of equal weights
under constant pressure, as given by Regnault.
   In column 5, the specific heats of equal volumes under constant
pressure, deduced from the numbers in the last column by multi
plying by the specific gravities. The evidently erroneoust
numbers 0.41061 and 0.4160S given by Regnault for ethylene,
are replaced by the right ones.

   In column 7, the difference between the values given in
columns 5 and 6.
   In column 8, the number of atoms contained in a molecule.
   In column 9, the theoretical ratio of the two specific heats of
equal volumes (that         is,
                       the specific heat under constant pressure
and that    constant volume), calculated for the condition

conditions in which their specific heats were determined. A
further confirmation of this is afforded by the fact that the the
oretically calculated specific heats are almost always smaller,
sometimes considerably smaller, but never notably greater than
the observed values; for the further a gas is from the perfect
gaseous condition—the more molecular attractions have still to
be overcome when it is heated,—the greater must be the excess
of the specific heat as found by experiment over that calculated
theoretically.    In the case of chlorine, which in one of         com                           its

§ 4. Comparison of the                method of calculating the specific

    heat    of   gases with those proposed by Buff” and Clausiust.
   The equations arrived at for calculating the specific heats of
perfect gases (namely,
       at constant volume                        y  = (n+3)a=(n +3).0-034,
     under constant pressure                     y' = (n+5)a=(n+5).0-034)
necessarily lead, in most cases, to results which differ notably
from those which follow from a rule given by Professor H. Buff.
This rule directs us to “take the specific heat of a simple gas at
constant pressure as many times as there are gaseous volumes of
the constituents which go to make up the compound, and then
divide by the number of gaseous volumes occupied by the com
pound produced.     If to the quotients so obtained the heat of
expansion corresponding to the unit-volume (a quantity which
is the same for           all   gases)      be   added,   the specific heat under con
stant pressure         is   obtained        ”f.       According       the way

this rule is afterwards carried out, it must apply in general to
                                                                  *
such  gases as are formed from their elementary constituents
without condensation, and whose molecules consequently con
sist, according to the usual assumption, of two atoms.       For
every additional atom in the molecule, however, it must give too
great    a value      for the specific heat by       .–                        =0.051; for,
by the rule in question, half the heat of molecular motion (which
is a constant quantity and independent of the number of atoms
in a molecule) is reckoned for each atom that enters into the
composition of the molecule.     (In the case of gases which con
tain mercury, arsenic, or any other body of the same kind, the
excessof the calculated value would bear a different but easily
deducible ratio to the number of elementary atoms contained in
one molecule.)           It   is doubtless to be attributed to this property
of Buff’s rule (namely, that it gives too great a value for the
specific heat, except in the cases already specified, and one which
is so much the more in excess in proportion as the number of
atoms in a molecule, and therefore also in general the degree of
departure from the laws of Mariotte and Gay-Lussac, is greater),
that the values calculated by him agree with those observed by
Regnault, and sometimes with surprising closeness, exactly for
gases which are far from following the laws of Mariotte and
Gay-Lussac, whereas this agreement no longer shows itself in the
case of gases which follow these laws more exactly and at the
same time contain more than two atoms in a molecule; for such
gases the calculated values, in accordance with the above consi
derations, come out too high.
   A method of calculating the specific heat of gases, which agrees
in essential points with Buff’s method, has also been proposed
by Clausius+, to which of course the same remarks apply as have
been made in regard to Buff’s method.        Clausius comes at last
to the conclusion that the     imperfection of the gaseous state is
“ certainly  not quite sufficient” to account for the difference be
tween Regnault's values and those which he calculated.       I believe
        I
that have ascertained the true reason of the     discrepancy.     The
theoretical specific heat ought not, by the nature of the case,
ever to be notably higher than the actual specific heat; and                                its
thesis that the specific heats       equal weights

defect, as compared with the actual value, must be so much the
greater the further the gas is from the perfectly gaseous state.
Since, now, both Clausius and Buff calculated the theoretical
specific heat for a molecule of n atoms too high by a quantity
which may be expressed generally by the formula                                               (n–2) 7+?
in the  case of bodies which, like water, hydrosulphuric acid,
ammonia, (marsh-gas, ethylene",) chloride of ethyle, alcohol,
acetone, ether, and sulphide of ethyle, are not far enough re
moved from the state of perfect gases to counterbalance the errors
of the mode of calculation, the surprising result comes out that
the calculated specific heat is considerably higher than the ob
served specific heat.    In contrast with this, the specific heats cal
culated according  to my   method for the perfectly gaseous condition
are never greater, to an eatent worthy of consideration, than the
observed specific heats, as the above Table shows, -a circumstance
which speaks in favour of the views here developed, and which,
in view of many of the values calculated by Buff and Clausius,
I think ought to be specially pointed out. In accordance with
this, the specific heat of carbonic acid, which Regnaulti found
to increase with the temperature (a peculiarity which he consi
                                                               is all
ders it probable is shared by        the gases which are far from
the condition              of
                  perfect gases),    greater than that calculated by
my formula. Thus the lowest value observed was 0-2801, while
the calculated value      0.272.            is

218            Mr. W. Ellis       on the Influence   of the
heat, it would be at once the surest proof that the molecule of
these two bodies consists of only a single atom, and that the
molecules of most of the other undecomposed bodies consist of
two atoms and not of a multiple of two atoms, and that those of
phosphorus and arsenic consist of four atoms.
   In the foregoing pages it has been shown that for the per
fectly gaseous state the heat of expansion bears a simple constant
ratio to the heat of molecular motion,-and also, on the basis of
Regnault's experimental results, that the heat of atomic motion
bears a simple ratio to the two already-mentioned parts of the
specific heat, the heatof atomic motion being found proportional to
the number of atoms in a molecule.      Thus the ratio of the heat
of expansion to the heat of molecular motion and to that of
atomic motion has been found to be =2: 3: n, and for the spe
cific heat the general expression y=2a+3a-H na–(n+5) a has
been obtained; and this, when (from the results of Regnault’s
experiments) the value 0-034 has been found for a, reduces
itself to the numerical expression y= (n+5)0-034.      Since the
agreement between the numbers thus calculated and those de
duced from experiment, is in general greater the nearer a gas
approaches to the presupposed state of a perfect gas, and since
also the numerical values of other kinds deduced from the equa
tions that have been established agree with the results of expe
riment, the simple conclusions to which the foregoing conside
rations lead, and the consequences connected with them, appear
to be sufficiently established.

 XXVIII.    Some further Remarks on the Influence of the      Full
        Moon  on Cloud.  By WILLIAM ELLIs, F.R.A.S.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
WILL        you allow me space briefly to reply to the remarks
        made by Mr. J. Park Harrison on my paper on the         In
fluence of the Full Moon on Cloud                     I
                                        What wished to show,
                                   I
in the particular case which investigated, was that no great
effect exists, mone that we can easily perceive.   It is to be re
membered that the language of Herschel and Arago is very
strong on the point. Herschel, in his ‘Familiar Lectures,’ speaks
confidently of the tendency of the moon “to clear the sky of
cloud, and to produce, not only a serene, but a calm night, when
so near the full as to appear round to the eye.” And Arago
says, “La lune mange        les
                            nuages.” This does not indicate          a

                                     Full Moon       on Cloud.                                      219
small effect, but rather that the nights near the time of full moon
are much more clear than those on which no moon is present,
as, for instance, the nights near to new moon.          Now the num
bers which I obtained gave no support to this idea; for, from
the observations made during 86% lunations at Greenwich, the
mean amount of cloud, as deduced from six observations taken at
intervals of two hours on five mights at each full moon, was
found to be 6'48, similar observations on five nights at each
new moon giving 6-07 (a clear sky being represented by 0, and
a sky wholly cloudy by 10).                            I
                                    And cannot help thinking that
the cause of the apparent deception is as have stated it in my        I
paper printed in your July Number.         But Mr. Harrison suggests
that sufficient account has not been} taken of the effect of the
omitted (principally Sunday) observations.             may here state          I
that from examination                     I
                                do not find the omissions to occur
in the irregular manner which Mr. Harrison has supposed.
Now what would be the effect of supplying                  the omitted             all
observations? how would the numbers which                  have quoted             I
be   affected? Practically one-seventh part           the observations    of
are wanting, the omissions being pretty equally distributed be
tween full and new moon.           Suppose now each omitted obser
vation         supplied, and
              to   be                means    let
                                                taken     two supposi
                                                                be                 on
tions, first, giving the omitted observations the extreme value
0,  and, secondly, the extreme value 10.       Such means are      each                        in
case the least possible and greatest possible mean values.          But
the one-seventh part                                             consi
                                  is of
                            the observations         each case       is   in               a
derable number.              It
                            therefore       high degree probable that
                                                     in

                   of                                   in a
                                             each case will    between                   lie
the before-mentioned least possible and greatest possible mean
values. We may therefore substitute for the omitted observa
tions (instead          of      or
                          10) the least possible and greatest possible
                            0
mean values.       Means being again taken,             found that the
                                                                          by byit

                                          altered     this amount, and

 new moon. These numbers not only negative any great effect,
 but also the existence       any full-moon influence.
                                     of
    Mr. Harrison further     suggests  that,                    by
                                                 grouping several days
 together, have “merged and eliminated any distinctive character
              I
 they may individually have possessed.”         But was not looking        I
for small effects. The     sky   was said                  to     night
                                                                 be

at  the time        of
                  full moon. The seven years' Greenwich observa
 tions show that such peculiar effect does not exist.        And this                                is
 all   that
          I        wished    to   prove.

        HEN  biniodide of phosphorus is treated with water, yellow
W   W flocculent  masses are formed, which have always been as
sumed to be finely divided phosphorus. This substance has been
investigated by Rudorff", who has found that it is solid phosphu
retted hydrogen. The analysis was effected by heating it in a
known volume of an indifferent gas, by which it was decomposed
into phosphorus, phosphuretted hydrogen, and hydrogen. The
phosphuretted hydrogen was absorbed by a solution of copper,
The hydrogen calculated from this, together with that obtained
by direct measurement, gave the total quantity of hydrogen.
The phosphorus was determined by oxidizing the powder with
nitric acid and combining the phosphoric acid with oxide of lead.
The results of the analysis gave 99 per cent. of phosphorus
and 1:58 hydrogen; this agrees very well with the formula                                   PH,
which requires 98.41 phosphorus and 1:59 hydrogen.
   The iodide of phosphorus yielded about 2 per cent, of                                        its

red colour. On cooling, prismatic crystals are deposited, which
are very large if the cooling is slow.       These, which are but
little soluble in the cold in bisulphide  of carbon, contain almost
all the iodine. To obtain the chloride of carbon dissolved, the
liquid is agitated with water, which decomposes chloride of sul
phur, and then with potass, over which the product is distilled;
this is pure chloride of carbon, C*Cl*.
                                                              -
    Chlorine acting on solution of iodine produces chloride of
iodine, which is decomposed as fast as it is formed, so that the
iodine is constantly ready to take up fresh quantities of chlo
rine. A small quantity of iodine can thus bring about the
decomposition     of a large quantity of bisulphide of carbon by
chlorine.
    Terchloride of iodine (which dissolves in water) also acts upon
bisulphide in the presence of water; the same crystals are
formed; to collect them the liquid is decanted, and the crystals
are dried in a current of dry chlorine.     They are prisms, of an
orange yellow, greatly resembling acid potassic chromate; but
they are very deliquescent and produce a brown liquid, so that
their angle could not be determined.      Water decomposes theim,
with the separation of sulphur; bisulphide also decomposes them.
Their composition is expressed by the formula ICl”--2SCI*;
when heated they lose a little iodine.                         -
    Jaillard obtained a compound, by the action of chlorine on a
mixture of 1 part of iodine and 2 of sulphur, to which he
assigned the composition ICl* + SCI*; Weber has prepared
and analyzed this body, and has found that it is identical with
the body described above.

   Sulphurous   acid and sulphuretted hydrogen do not act on
each other if dry and at the ordinary temperature; in the
presence of water they produce water and deposit sulphur.
It is usually stated that the reaction is thus expressed,
2HS+SO*=2H0+3S; it             however, more complex: pen

thallium solution is reduced by a simple voltaic element.    For
this purpose a short wide glass tube is covered at the bottom
with a bladder, and, being filled with acidulated water, is
immersed in the thallium solution, so that both liquids are on
the same level. A zinc plate is immersed in the acidulated
solution, and it is provided with a platinum or copper wire
which is bent so that it dips outside in the solution of
thallium.   The reduction begins at once, and the wire is
gradually covered with a beautiful crystallization of thallium,
of which in a few days no traces are to be found in the
solution. These crystals are washed, pressed, rapidly dried and
fused to a regulus in a porcelain crucible with cyanide of
potassium.
   According to Otto%, crystallized oxide of chromium may be
prepared with ease and in any quantity by the action of hydrogen
upon bichromate of potassium at a high temperature, whereby
the salt is decomposed into neutral chromate of potassium, water,
and chromic oxide, according to the following equation:-
            2G, Kºo'+6H=2Cr Kºo'+3H2O+Gºo’.
The dried and powdered salt is introduced into a tube of hard
glass, which is gently heated in a suitable furnace, and a current
of dry hydrogen is passed through; aqueous vapours soon make
their appearance, and within a short time the reduction is com
plete. On cooling, the tube is broken and the dark-green slag
placed in water, which dissolves the neutral chromate, leaving
the oxide in the form of small green lustrous flitters.
  Schifff, in an investigation on the influence of various liquids
on the division of phosphorus, has arrived at the following re
sults:—
  In many   cases, but not always, the action of liquids in pulve
rizing phosphorus depends on their density.
   The nature of the liquid has an influence even when       den           its
sity  less than that
       is                of
                       water.
  Wiscosity exerts great influence even with solutions                 of    small
density.

branes.   Wessels of wood or of porous porcelain (unbaked), which
allowed the substances to pass through very slowly, also gave ex
cellent results. The author obtained by this method, and fre
quently in very beautiful forms, the sulphates of barium, stron
tium, and lead, carbonates of barium and lead, oxalate of cal
cium, borate and chromate of barium, magnesia, and the various
sulphides. In the hope of obtaining crystals of quartz, solutions
of alkaline silicates in porous vessels were placed in dilute acids,
and also exposed to the action       of carbonic acid.            Silicates under
these circumstances do not deposit gelatinous precipitates, but
white crystalline masses hard enough to scratch glass.      These
crystals, however, were not quartz; for they were soluble in alka
lies, contained water and a small quantity of soda which seems
essential to their composition. The crystals from silicate of soda
contained 68 silica, 5 soda, and 27 of water in 100 parts.   Neg
lecting the small quantity of soda, the composition corresponds
to the formula SiO3 + 2 HO.
   The author’s experiments furnish an elegant confirmation of
Chevreul’s view of the formation of crystallized oxalate of cal
cium in the cells of plants; for he succeeded in obtaining crys
tals of this kind when he allowed a soluble calcium salt to act
through a membrane on a soluble oxalate.
  Hösaeus has made+ a series         of experiments          on the influence
which various kinds of nutrition exert on the quantity of am
monia and of nitric acid which plants contain.    The plants taken
were the onion (Allium cepa) and the pea (Pisum sativum). The
amount of ammonia and of nitric acid in onions could not be                            in
creased by corresponding mixtures of salts. The nitric acid
which they exhibit in summer has been produced by oxidation
of ammonia, and it is probable that in winter it again changes
into ammonia.      The numbers show clearly that they cannot
assimilate nitric acid. While the roots, even of onions which had
only grown in a solution containing ammoniacal salt, contained
0.5 and 0.3 per cent. of NO”, the onions themselves gave 0-084
per cent, the same quantity originally contained in them. Peas,
on the contrary, can assimilate both nitric acid and ammonia,
and more indeed than is necessary for their growth.        In     ex             all
periments it   was found that the greater the quantity      ammonia    of
and  of nitric acid, the worse appeared the growth       the plants,

effect than with ammoniacal salts alone. The peas and onions
treated with nitrates contained ammonia; those with ammonia
contained nitric acid, and in larger quantity than before.                                 This
is a proof that ammonia is transformed into nitric acid.
   Beyer has furnished a contribution on the metamorphosis of
fruits during their ripening *.   He took gooseberries from one
and the same   plant, and, commencing   with the fruit when they
were   quite small,  he examined them at intervals of three or
four days, determining each time the sugar, free acid, nitrogen,
fat, dry residue, ash.   From these determinations he deduces
the following conclusions:—
   (1) Water diminishes during ripening; and consequently the
amount of dry residue increases.
   (2) Sugar increases constantly both in the fresh and in the
dry residue.
   (3) The proportion of acid is greatest in the middle of the
development.     The decrease towards the end of the ripening is
inconsiderable in the fresh substance, but very considerable in
the dry.
   Tºmineral constituents diminish constantly in both cases.
   Nitrogenous substances exhibit the same relations as free
acid. They increase at first, then diminish; this diminution is
very small in the fresh berries, but is very considerable if cal
culated on the dried substance.
   The quantity of          fat
                       increases    the fresh substance; with the
                                                 in

 228          M. Preyer        on the     Analysis        of Colouring-matters.
 sent when illuminated by homogeneous light. The stage                                           of the
 microscope is illuminated by the various elementary rays                                        of the
 spectrum.
    Yellow light is bright enough for making the most delicate
 observations; the others range as follows in the order of decrea
 sing intensity:—orange, red, green, blue, and indigo.       Human
 blood, or the blood of frogs placed successively in these various
rays, presents the following phenomena:—
    In red light the oxygenated globules appear of an intense red;
in orange light and in the least refrangible parts of yellow they
are also red; in the most refrangible yellow they are only red
dish. When the field passes into green, the globules entirely lose
their red colour, and become completely black in the green near
est the yellow. . In the extreme green they are a little brighter.
In blue and violet the reddish tint reappears.
    It follows thence that the globules contain a substance which
absorbs green rays with the utmost energy; and as Hoppe-Sey
ler's haemoglobine has             its
                            greatest absorption   the green,        in                        it   is
                                                                                                   at
least  probable  that this substance    haemoglobine, thus furnish
                                                     is

    a
matter of the blood.
    From these facts      very delicate method may

 ascertaining the presence                of

ganic compound, including oxygen. The method for determin

heating it to redness in a current of chlorine, when the oxygen
unites with the carbon in the substance, or that which has been
added to       it,
             while the hydrogen combines with the chlorine                                                     to

   The desideratum was, when changing the focus, to increase the
power of the double lens for the planes the most distant and to re
duce it for the nearest planes. At first this seemed to be an impos
sibility. But in considering the subject attentively I was suddenly
struck with the fact that, the power of any double combination of
lenses being proportionate to the distance which separates the two
lenses, greater when they are more separated, and smaller when they
are less separated, it was possible to alter the power of the combina
tion by changing the distance between the two lenses.
   Therefore,            if,
                    instead     moving the whole tube containing the two
                                       of
lenses, we move only the back lens nearer the plate, when we want
to  focus for more distant planes, we increase              the same time the        at
power      of
            the double combination, and consequently the size                    the                                of
image; and we move the lens further from the plate, when we want
                   if
to  focus for the nearest planes,         doing so,  in   reducing the separa       by
tion   of the two lenses, we reduce the           power       the combination,           of
and consequently also the size                   it of
                                        the image. This           most fortunate           is

Clairaut's Theorem follows independently of the adoption of the hy
pothesis of original fluidity, or even of that of an internal arrange
ment in nearly spherical strata of equal density.
   But though the law of the variation of gravity which was ori
ginally obtained as a consequence of the hypothesis of primitive flui
dity, and was afterwards found by Laplace to hold good, on the
condition that the surface be an ellipsoid of revolution as well as a
surface of equilibrium, provided only the mass be arranged in nearly
spherical strata of equal density, be thus proved to be true whatever
be the internal distribution, the question may naturally be asked, Does
not the condition that the potential at the surface shall have                 actual                              its
value require that the internal distribution shall                compatible with              be
that      of fluid mass,                    or

from the atmosphere in which the metallic mass last found itself
in a state of ignition. The meteoric iron of Lenarto appeared to
be well adapted for a trial.    This well-known iron is free from
any stony admixture, and is remarkably pure and malleable.                                        It

grammes, and had the bulk of 578 cubic centimetres.         The strip
was well washed by hot solution of potassa, and then repeatedly
by hot distilled water, and dried. Such treatment of iron, it
had been previously found, conduces in no way to the evolution
of hydrogen gas when the metal is subsequently heated. The
Lenarto iron was enclosed in a new porcelain tube, and, the latter
being attached to a Sprengel aspirator, a good vacuum was ob
tained in the cold. The tube being placed in a trough combustion
furnace, was heated to redness by ignited charcoal. Gas came off

   The metal has given 2.66 times its volume of gas. The first
portion collected appeared to contain of hydrogen 35 per cent,
of carbonic oxide 503, of carbonic acid 7-7, and of nitrogen 7
per cent. The latter portion collected gave more carbonic oxide
(58 per cent) with less hydrogen (21 per cent.), no carbonic acid,
the remainder nitrogen. The predominance of carbonic oxide in
its occluded gases appears to attest the telluric origin of iron.
   Hydrogen has been recognized in the spectrum-analysis of the
light of the fixed stars, by Messrs. Huggins and Miller. The same
gas constitutes, according to the wide researches of Father Secchi,
the principal element of a numerous class of stars, of which a
Lyrae is the type. The iron of Lenarto has no doubt come from
such an atmosphere, in which hydrogen greatly prevailed.        This
meteorite may be looked upon as holding imprisoned within         and                            it,

 distance of seven leagues.       Humboldt observes that the peak of Te.
 neriffe is visible at extraordinary distances, either immediately or
 even several hours after an abundant rain.
    The cause of this phenomenon is not to be sought in an optical
 effect arising from a mixture of air and of aqueous vapour, as was
 formerly believed, but simply in the fact that aqueous vapour par
 tially dissolves the impurities mixed with the air and makes it more
 translucid. This opinion, originally expressed by Colonel Jackson
 in 1832, always seemed well based, but it needed to be more pre
 cisely expressed and supported by experiment.              M. Pasteur's re
 markable researches, in showing that the atmosphere, more espe
 cially the layers nearest the soil, is filled with a mass of organic
 germs, seemed to furnish a key to these phenomena, at the same
 time that they have enabled me to explain the circumstances other
 than moisture which influence the transparence of the air.
    All organic germs form, when the atmosphere is dry, a sort of
 slight mist which intercepts some of the light from distant objects;
 but when a general moisture sets in the mist disappears, either because
 the germs become transparent from absorbing aqueous vapour, or
 because the water which they have absorbed rendering them heavier
 makes them fall to the ground.          This, as I think, is the most fre
quent cause of those striking changes in the transparence of the at
 mosphere which are sometimes manifested in the most unexpected
manner, but which always coincide with variations in moisture.
    Further, if the presence of aqueous vapour makes the atmosphere
transparent when it contains organic germs, this presence is no
longer necessary in the absence of these germs. This explains why
mountains in winter are visible even when the air is very dry, why
the air is transparent on snow fields, why, again, as has been ob
served by Humboldt, the atmosphere of the Peak of Teneriffe is trans
parent with an east wind which brings the African air; for this,
having brought no organic exhalations from the deserts whence it
comes, or from the sea over which it has passed, has no need of
moisture to be transparent.        It                   is,
                                             the contrary,    onthe hot season         in

most charged with this kind          dry vapour, which
                                                   of         serene weather          in

    I have sought, therefore, a means of estimating the degree of
transparence of the air with ease and exactness; and in this investi
gation       I
            have been materially aided by Professor Thury of Geneva.
Under his directions and by his plans has been constructed, by the
Genevese Society for making physical instruments, the photometer
for measuring variations in the transparence of the air, of which the
following is an abridged description.
    The instrument renders it possible to make a simultaneous com
parative observation of two similar views placed at different dis
tances. The difference between the optical images of these views
expresses the effect produced by the interposition of a layer of air of
known thickness equal to the difference in the distance of the two.
The two images are made equal by means of an arrangement fitted to
the instrument itself; and the measure of the modification necessary
to bring about this equality gives the difference in the brightness of
the two images, and hence the effect of the interposition of the
layer of air.
    The two objects to be compared should be viewed by the same eye,
 in the same conditions, and in the same general direction; and since
 a comparison of objects can only be made by that of their images,
these should be quite like the objects they represent.                 Moreover
 any light foreign to the objects should be carefully excluded.
     It has been attempted to realize these conditions by means of two
 telescopes, each having an object-glass, but with an eyepiece common
 to both. Each object-glass gives              image      its
                                                          half the field       in

sponding difference in the images, they may be easily detected and

eyepiece so as to uncover only equal portions of the two views, and
that the adjustment is effected separately for the object-glasses and

light, conditions which are only realized by means of excellent
object-glasses well achromatized and not presenting too pronounced
colours of their own.         The prisms must also be made of very pure
glass, whose colour, as far as possible, should be complementary to
that of the object-glasses.          Lastly, the magnifying-power should be

 ON   THE LAWS WHICH GOVERN THE GENERAL DISTRIBUTION OF
        HEAT OVER THE EARTH. BY PLINY EARLE CHASE.
    The principal elements     general thermometric variation are (1)

the heat imparted                   by
                        the sun, (2) terrestrial absorption and radia
tion, and (3) atmospheric currents.     Of these three agencies the first
is,  inone sense    least, the chief, since

other two, and especially in retarding the daily and yearly changes;
the third is a subject of hourly experience, and its meteorological
importance is now generally recognized.
  The amount of heat which is received directly from the sun evi
dently varies as the cosine of the zenith-distance, or the sine of the
sun's altitude.   In the daily distribution of temperature this is the
most important element, as is evident from the tabular comparisons
in my communication of September 21, 1866*. Absorption and
radiation proceed at nearly uniform rates; therefore it may be assumed
that their effects are approximately proportional to the time during
which they operate. The average general variation which is due to
the influence of the winds is a difficult point to determine; but the
present investigation has led me to believe that it may be measured
by the difference of arc (instead of the sine-difference) of the sun's
meridian altitude. My reasons for this inference are the following:—
(1) The general average temperature of the year often appears to vary
very nearly as the arc in question; (2) it seems unreasonable to
suppose that a variation of this character can be attributable either
to the heat communicated by the sun or to terrestrial absorption and
radiation; (3) the tendency of the air, so far as it is determined by
the direct heat of the sun, is at all times toward that point of the
earth's surface at which the sun is vertical, and we may readily be
lieve that that tendency should be proportional to the distance, mea
sured on a great circle of the earth, through which the air would be
obliged to move in order to reach the subsolar point. This distance
evidently varies as the are of the sun's zenith-distance.
    We have then three natural standards for admeasurement, by
means of which, if we rightly eliminate special and limited pertur
bations, we may perhaps be able to determine the predominating
influence, in many cases, both of local and of general thermal dis
turbance.    In order to institute as broad a comparison as possible,
I have   adopted a method of elimination which may be illustrated by
a  single example.
    The average monthly temperatures of the United States, as de
duced from Professor Coffin's reductions, appear to be as follows:—

librium of a Liquid Mass without Weight,” my father showed that
a very elongated liquid cylinder, or, more generally, any liquid figure
one of whose dimensions is relatively considerable compared with
the others, always changes spontaneously into a series of isolated
spheres:       it was on this principle that he                     based a theory            of the consti
tution of liquid veins emitted from circular apertures. His experi
ments require particular instruments; I have accidentally hit upon
a very simple method by which the phenomena may be studied
without any special apparatus.
   At the end of a cotton thread about 0.2 millim. in diameter and 50
centims. in length a weight of a few grammes is fixed; after having
carefully moistened the thread by rubbing it in water, so as to re
move adherent air, it is held by                       its
                                          free end, and allowed        sink                       to            in   a

to constitute spheres; but the thread which traverses them compels
 them to take a more elongated form, and they really constitute por

 but it is easy to make the experiment so that it takes place along the
 entire length of the thread.             For this purpose a horizontal thread
 must be used instead of a vertical one. A thread about 20 centims.
 in length is stretched between the ends of a small wooden bow, of
 which it forms the string; and the liquid is poured on a plate. In
 this way, after the thread has been well moistened and immersed
 in the liquid, it may be withdrawn, being preserved in a horizontal

                  Mr. A. B. Northcote           on the Water   of
examined,   notably before and after the accession of important
tributaries, and before and after changes of stratum in the river’s
bed.    From this point of view the series of analyses which                            I
proceed to give is but a contribution to a knowledge of the con
stituents of the river Severn, for the specimens examined were
taken almost exclusively at about a mile above the city of Wor
cester.  'I  have, however, been enabled to make one analysis
which bears upon the question of the influence of tributaries;
and among the rest will be found one made in time of extreme
drought and another immediately after a time of flood, which, from
their thus presenting nearly the limits of the river's variation,
have a certain value.
    The channel of the Severn, in its course of 210 miles from the
 side of Plymlimmon to the sea, experiences many changes. Start
 ing from the Silurian rocks of Montgomeryshire and cutting a
 patch of trap rock near the border, it enters the New Red Sand
 stone in Shropshire; at Shrewsbury it passes for a few miles
 through the Lower Red Sandstone of the Permian group and
 the neighbouring coal-field; it then passes again consecutively
 through the New Red Sandstone and Silurian rocks, and tra
 verses in turn the great Shropshire coal-field and the overlying
 Permian Sandstone, until at about Stourport it passes from the
 coal-measures to the New Red Sandstone, through which and
 the Red Marl of the same system it flows to Worcester. At
 some distance below Worcester it cuts alternately the Lias and
the Red Marl before reaching the Bristol Channel.
    But although it thus passes through a considerable variety of
              I
 rocks, yet believe at no part of              its
                                         course does     receive afflu

                                                 as
principal tributaries drain the same formations         those through

                                          of
 Silurian rocks; while              its

        blackened considerably by evaporation to dryness, and the un
        dissolved sediment, when dried at 140°C., presented the same
        weight as it did after subsequent ignition.    The separation of
        the iron from the mixed ferric and aluminic oxides was effected by
        the action of ammonic sulphydrate after addition to the chlor
        hydric solution of much citric acid and excess of ammonia.    The
        other determinations were made   by  the methods in ordinary  use.
        The sediment of April contained a trace of manganese, and that
        of February small quantities of potassium, sodium, and carbo
        nates. 1000 cub. centims. of the water of April contained '0798

ages, present a tolerable uniformity of composition; and he con
ceives that the detritus which these rivers are carrying to the
sea will pass, in lapse of time, into rocks of like character when
the necessary indurating and cementing processes shall have
been passed through”.      Such, therefore, may be the formation
now in progress at the mouth of the river Severn.
   My attention was first drawn to the water of the Severn in
the year 1857, about which time new waterworks for the supply
of Worcester from this source came into operation; my inten
tion then was to analyze it at intervals of three months during
the year 1857–58; but circumstances obliged me to content my
self with making incomplete analyses. The results then obtained
are, however, of interest, as they afford various points of compa
rison with the water of the past year, which              have had more      I
favourable opportunities of examining.
    On the 12th of April, 1866, I collected a specimen from the
middle of the river just above the place at which the waterworks
draw their supply; this point is about a mile above Worcester.
After a period of dry weather, rain had fallen on the preceding
day, and a rise of 4 inches in the level of the river showed that
rain had also fallen up the country.             The river was muddy,
and the   portion  collected     deposited   the sediment of which the
composition has been given; the water remained opalescent, in
which state it was analyzed, for ordinary filtration or rest for a
moderate length of time had scarcely any effect in clearing                                         it.

   At this time became aware that Hawford Brook or the
river Salwarp, which falls into the Severn nearly 2 miles above
the points at which the previous specimens had been taken, re.
ceives the surplus water of the Droitwich Canal, which renders
it occasionally so salt as to destroy the freshwater fish which it
contains.   This little stream being thus evidently an important
contributor of the chloride of sodium which the water at Worcester
contains in such abundance,                  I
                                was desirous of comparing the com

     I
     have found that the observations of rainfall for many of the
places mentioned above do not go back so far as 1857–58, during
which year the first analyses were made; but the observers at
Oswestry, Shiffnal, and Bromsgrove have kindly furnished me
with sufficient facts to show that at these places no rain fell for
several days before the waters were taken in September, Novem
ber, and March, and in May the only rainfall was at Oswestry.
    A river must derive its water from two sources, one immedi
ately, the other intermediately dependent upon rainfall. To the
latter belong          all
                      the phenomena        springs, which frequently
                                                          of

   The conditions upon which such an instrument could be suc
cessful appeared to be the following:—          -
   1. The employment of a zero method, by which the galvano
meter-needle would always be brought to the direction of the
magnetic meridian or the same given point upon the scale and,
therefore, be independent of the unknown function of the angle
of deflection.
   2. The readings to be made upon a simple lineal measure di
vided into equal parts signifying equal units of resistance.
   3. The employment of a single and unalterable comparison
resistance.

        the determination of each curve I use a delicately adjusted
        In
 rheostat or scale of resistances in the circuit of a, giving it
 varying values corresponding to the equal divisions of the en
 graved scale, and constructing the curve according to the position
 which it is found necessary to give to the point s' in order to
 arrive at the magnetic balance. With each instrument it would
 be possible to have two values of R–one expressed in mercury
 and the other in B.A. units; and in order to measure at pleasure
 in either of these units, it would only be necessary to insert the
 one or other between the terminal screws for R.
    The instrument has been found to be very convenient for the
 measurement of the wire resistances of overland lines, or for the
 reading of resistance thermometers; it reduces the operation
 to the observation of the zero position of a needle, and the
 reading upon a graduated scale, which can be performed by a
 person of ordinary intelligence without experience in electrical
 measurement.     In accuracy and range it fully equals the bridge
 method, while as regards portability and cheapness of apparatus
 the advantages are decidedly in                            its   favour.

     It          to me possible that the natives of India might
          appeared
furnish a class of persons who habitually ingest the required mi
nimum of nitrogenous food, and that the quantity of muscle
formed under the most favourable suppositions from this might
be insufficient to supply by                               its

        If
      the individual apertures be as small as has been assumed
above, even their equality is not necessary.   In the case of larger
unequal apertures, the diffracted light arising from one source of
light will appear white, because the maxima of the various colours
almost coincide, and thus give white from their mixture; but
with such small apertures, only reddish tints can mix with red
dish, and the action will be of the same quality as in the case
of a single aperture.    Hence, if a distant white luminous point be
viewed  through a screen which is perforated by very small arbitra
rily arranged apertures, it appears white, but surrounded by reddish
diffracted light; it is therefore immaterial whether the apertures
be equal  or unequal, provided their dimensions do not exceed a cer
tain limit.
   3. We will now return to the consideration      of the action of
an individual aperture, and compare it with the action of a small
dark screen of the same form which stands in the path of the
direct rays, or of the incident wave-plane.
   We disregard in this the diffractive action of the aperture of
the object-glass, or of the pupil, as compared with that which a
small aperture or a small screen produces; this amounts to re
garding this object-glass, and the incident wave, as unlimited on
all sides.                                  Fig. 1.

                the rays proceeding from the parts of the wave
AW and d W"     produce  no effect, and those incident upon the
dark screen between A and B are quite kept off.           Hence only

the centre of c d, and dºn be made   equal  to B  m,  the pencils Bm

their paths by half a wave-length; hence there merely remains
the pencil mn, which is only distinguished from the pencil c B,
remaining in the small aperture, by being displaced about $2.
Hence the pencil m n will have the same amplitude but with
opposite sign, and exactly the same intensity as the pencil c B.

282                       Dr. E. Lommel on           the      Theory of the
 disk like the moon in the horizon,                       I
                                                  believe that the solid parti
 cles suspended in the atmosphere are adequate to explain this
 coloration. A similar appearance is exhibited by the sun also
 in the presence of a thick yellowish vapour (the Höhenrauch),
 even when it is high in the heavens.              The red colour, too, which,
 according to travellers’ statements, the sun exhibits when the
 simoom has raised the sand of the desert, belongs to this category.
     The spectrum of the setting sun has been lately more accu
 rately examined by Janssen.               Towards the violet end it appears
 continually weakened; yet in the less refrangible parts, while
 the intensity of light is otherwise unweakened, dark lines occur
 along with the Fraunhofer’s which are already there and have
 become more distinct.            This latter phenomenon                  my view,  is,   in
to    be ascribed         the absorptive influence
                           to                                   aqueous vapour,

l.          ULES.—The following rules for approximately drawing
          circular arcs of given lengths have not, so far as I know,
been hitherto published.
   Rule I. (See fig. 1.)—From a
given point A, in the circumfe
rence of a given circle A B, to lay
off an arc which shall be approxi
mately of a given length.       From
A draw the straight tangent AC,
equal to one-fourth part of the given
length.    About C, with a radius
                                                        ~

length, draw a circular arc cutting      ..    ------------------- A.
the given circle in D.     Then A D
will be the arc required.
   Rule II. (See fig. 1.)—To draw a circular arc which shall touch
a given  straight line A C at a given point A, shall subtend a
given angle, and shall be approximately of a given length. Make
A C equal to one-fourth of the given length; about C, with a
radius equal to three-fourths of the given length, describe a
circle; draw the straight line AD, making the angle CAD
equal to one-half of the given angle, and cutting the circle in
D; D will be the other end of the required arc. Bisect AD in
E; draw the straight lines A F perpendicular to AC, and EF
perpendicular to AD, meeting each other in F; that point will
be the centre for the required arc A. D.
   2. Eatent of Errors.-The arcs laid off according to the pre
ceding rules are somewhat longer than the exact length given.
The following are examples of the proportionate errors:–
                                                                      Error in fractions

The proportionate error varies nearly   the fourth power
                                                       as    the                   of
angle subtended     the  arc,by
                              and diminishes  very rapidly when
that angle becomes small.

 XXXVIII.         On the Identity of the Vibrationsof Light with Elec
                    trical Currents.     By L. LoRENz*.
       science of our century has succeeded in demonstrating
 THEso many  relations between the various forces (between elec
 tricity and magnetism, between heat, light, molecular and che.
 mical actions), that we are in a sense necessarily led to regard
 them as manifestations of one and the same force, which, accord
 ing to circumstances, occurs under different forms. But though
 this has been the guiding idea with the greatest inquirers of our
 time, it has been by no means theoretically established; and
 though the connexion between the various forces has been de
 monstrated, it has only been explained in single points. Thus
 Ampère has theoretically explained the connexion between elec
 tricity and magnetism, though he has not furnished a proof of
 the possibility of the peculiar molecular electrical currents (as
 sumed by him) which in virtue of their own power are conti
 nuous; and, in like manner, Melloni was subsequently led step
 by step to the assumption of an identity of light with radiant
 heat.   These theories are, however, quite isolated members of
the great chain; and so far are we from being able to follow
out theoretically the idea of the unity of force, that even now,
half a century after OErsted’s discovery, the two electricities are
regarded as electrical fluids, light as vibrations of ather, and heat
as motions of the molecules of bodies.
    Yet these physical hypotheses are scarcely reconcileable with
the idea of the unity of force; and while the latter has had a
signal influence on science, this can by no means be said of the
former, which have only been useful inasmuch as they furnish
a basis for our imagination.       Hence it would probably be best
to admit that in the    present state of science we can form no con
ception of the physical reason of forces and of their working in
the interior of bodies; and therefore                   (at

various manifestations of the forces;                      I
                                            shall prove that in ac
cordance with the laws for the propagation of electricity under
the action of free electricity, and of the electrical currents of the
surrounding media, which we can deduce from experiment, pe
riodical electrical currents are possible which in every respect
behave like the vibrations of light; from which it indubitably fol
lows that the vibrations of light are themselves electrical currents.
     We know that light is produced by       wave-motion with very
                                                           a
 rapid periodical motions which we may call vibrations. It is
 the peculiarity of these vibrations that they are at right angles
 to the direction in which the wave of light travels; and we may
 say that this peculiarity has not found a correct explanation in
 the theory of elasticity, or in the analogous one of Cauchy; for,
 apart from the fact that this theory necessitates the assumption
 of a special medium (the luminous aether, which moreover stands
quite isolated and separate from any other observation or de
 monstrable connexion with other forces), even with this assump
tion, and the various hypotheses of Cauchy, it is scarcely pos
sible to imagine a medium in which a wave-motion could travel
without a trace of longitudinal vibrations.     Convinced that this
theory cannot give a real, but only a factitious explanation even of
the peculiarity of light (the transverse vibrations), had formerly      I
drawn attention to the fact that variable electrical currents, which
induce in closed conductors currents that are parallel with the
original ones, are similar to the vibrations of light, which in a
certain sense also induce parallel vibrations. But as the laws of
induced currents, generally admitted and based on experiment,
did not directly lead to the expected result, the question was
whether it was not possible so to modify the laws assumed that
they would embrace both the experiments on which they rest
...} the phenomena which belong to the theory of light.

   Since we kave a W2=c, we have returned to the first equa
tion (A); and the two others may by analogy be deduced from
this. The constants which should have been added in the two
integrations in reference to t have been here omitted, because it
is clear that such arbitrary constants would have no significance
in the present case.
   This result is a new proof of the identity of the vibrations of
light with electrical currents; for it is clear now, not only that the
laws of light can be deduced from those of electrical currents, but
that the converse way may be pursued, provided the same limiting
conditions are added which the theory of light requires. Thus we
are in a position to deduce by calculation alone the inducing
action of free electricity as defined by Kirchhoff’s equations (2), as
well as the inducing action of variable electrical currents, borh
of which are contained in equations (A), by simply starting from
those facts which are necessary to deduce the laws of light, and
afterwards adding a single member to the differential equations

found between the so-called components of light. This memberex
presses in a correct manner the absorption of light in good conduc
tors of electricity, and disappears for perfectly transparent bodies.
    Without             more minutely on the consequences of the
results obtained here, which manifestly lead us a step further to
wards developing the idea of the unity of force, and open a fresh
                             I
field for future inquiries, shall in conclusion call attention to the
conclusions which we are entitled to draw with some degree of
probability as to the mode of action of light, and how we are
placed as regards the physical hypotheses concerning light.
    Were we to attempt to represent the laws of electrical currents
in such a manner that they would be generally valid for given
heterogeneous   bodies, and not merely for homogeneous bodies
with constant conducting-power, this would appear to be best
effected by starting from the differential equations, and regarding
a and k as variable magnitudes. This would be more especially
in agreement with the general cquations found in the theory of
 light for heterogeneous media; besides, those limiting conditions
which must be fulfilled for homogeneous bodies would then be
contained in the differential equations and could be deduced from
them. In this manner, however, a form corresponding in sim

plicity to the equations (A) could not be attained         hetero

tial equations would remain the original and only valid ones on
which the physical explanation would have to depend.                    The
theoretically important conclusion would thence follow which
has been already indicated, that electrical forces require time to
travel, and that these forces only apparently act at a distance
(as would follow from equations (A) if they were regarded as the
fundamental equations), and that every action of electricity and
of electrical currents does in fact only depend on the electrical
condition of the immediately surrounding elements, in the manner
indicated by the differential equations (B). This is well known
to be an idea indicated by Ampère, and which several physi
cists, more particularly Faraday, have defended.
   The present general opinion regards light as consisting of
backward and forward motions of particles of aether.                 If this
were the    case,  the electrical current would be a       progressive  mo
tion of the aether in the direction of the (positive or negative)
electrical currents. But it is impossible that the same equations
which theory deduces for very small displacements from equili
brium should hold good for             kinds     all
                                                 displacements whatever;

                                                            of
same    equations    hold for both cases.       Light cannot, therefore,

first line of the third field an interval is left of the breadth
of a third part of the whole. In the fourth field there are
visible at nearly equally distant places four blue lines of equal
breadth and brightness: in the violet part, with the exception of
the potassium-line K/9, no lines were observed.     At the period
of  great vividness of the spectrum, the spaces between the lines
of the third and fourth field appeared dark, and presented the
appearance of absorption-streaks, the origin of which would
moreover be explicable in the Bessemer-flame.       On the other
side of the sodium-line, nearly in the position of the orange-red
calcium-line Caa, were visible two lines lying near together and
not sharply bounded, which presented the appearance as if a
broad bright streak were divided into two parts by a dark band
in the middle.
   At the end of the cooling-period the intensity of light of the
groups of lines decreased, and shortly before the end of the

   The appearance and disappearance of the lines is in close con
nexion with the periods of the “charge: ” the commencement
of the combustion-period, in which the decarbonization of the
iron begins, as well as the end of the decarbonization, can be ac
curately determined by means of the spectral apparatus.        But
the occurrence of a group of lines and of an isolated line in the
blue-violet part of the spectrum during the cooling-period, by
which a particular state of this is indicated, must especially be
noticed; and as these lines also again disappear before the others,
their appearance and their disappearance, which invariably take
place in the last five minutes of the charge, must acquire signifi
cance as an indication of its termination.

 G. Johnstone     Stoney,  M.A.,  F.R.S.,  F.R.A.S.
    An attempt is made in the memoir of which this is an abstract to
 take advantage of the insight we have gained within the last few years
into the molecular constitution of gases, and the laws which regulate
the exchanges of heat that take place between bodies placed in pre
sence of one another, and to apply these new materials to the inter
pretation of the phenomena of the photosphere of the sun, the appear
ances presented during total eclipses, and the information about both

   In an inquiry like this, where we are obliged to put up with such
proofs as the materials at our disposal can supply, we must be content
to accept results of every variety of probability, from that degree,
bordering upon certainty, which commands an unhesitating assent,
to that of which the chief scientific value is that it prompts to further
investigation and points out a path.        Those who read the memoir
itself will best judge of the probability of each conclusion from the
proofs laid before them; but in this sketch of          contents          its

 siderable amount of light in the green, yellow, orange, and red,

    A detailed scrutiny of the lines emitted by the various gases
 leads to several interesting results.   Hydrogen and iron are the two
 most abundant constituents of the sun's outer atmosphere, and play
 in it the same part which nitrogen and oxygen do in the earth's.
 There is but the merest trace of sodium present. The other gases
 are met with in intermediate quantities.    Again, barium cannot have

This produces           a region        of equatorial calms bordered on either side
by zones, in the northern of which south-east trades prevail, and in
the southern,           north-east.          These are succeeded                 by variable         winds
in the regions of spots, beyond which the polar current blows over the
surface of the photosphere in the form of a north-west trade in the
northern hemisphere, and a south-west trade in the southern.         In
the region of spots, both the polar and equatorial currents make
their way to a higher level, and in doing so heave up into a colder
situation considerable portions of the upper layer of excessively thin
cloud, that which is seen only during eclipses. This, though it may at
first take place comparatively gently, will be succeeded by a violent
upward motion, because the cloud when raised to a cool region will
retain a temperature bordering upon that of the photosphere. When
this occurs it will both produce the phenomenon of overhanging clouds
seen during eclipses, and give rise to a violent cyclone in the regions
beneath, immediately over the photosphere.       There is no other part
of the sun  upon   which these conditions prevail: hence the limitation
of spots to two bands parallel to the equator.       To these results we
may assign the probability 2.
   In the next branch of the inquiry we are obliged to have pretty
free recourse to speculation; and the results, though there is much
to be said for them, must be received with the caution which becomes
us when we are not at liberty to award a probability higher than
1. We are forced to invoke an external agent to account for the
periodicity of the spots; and that which is submitted as apparently
the most probable, is a swarm of meteors like those which visit the
earth in November every thirty-third year, but extended into a much
longer stream. These while they pass through the sun's atmosphere
would warm the upper regions above his equator, and thus tend to
enfeeble the causes which produce the trade-winds.            Hence upon
each such visit, the trade-winds, the storms which result from them,
and the spots which these occasion would                moderated.  all     be                       It   is
remarkable that this hypothesis accounts also for the fact that spots
prevail more        one hemisphere than the other, inasmuch
                        in                                               the                         as
meteors must act more                   on
                              one hemisphere than the other, and lessen
       the causes that produce spots, unless we make the highly im

 and deserved favour of late years, that the heat expended by the sun
 is continually restored to him by the falling in of meteors which
 had been circulating round him, is no longer tenable.

 ences in their appearances are found to depend mainly on differences
 in the force of gravity exerted at their surfaces. Where gravity on a
 star is feebler than on the sun, either from the mass of the star being

    Those stars in which the force of gravity is very much less than
on the sun appear to form a distinct subclass. The four hydrogen
lines are not found in them, and at the same time new spectral lines,
arranged in bands each of which is closely ruled and fades off on
the less refrangible side, make their appearance. May we not here
venture the suspicion that when gravity upon a star is below a certain
limit, such conditions prevail as compel the hydrogen, which would
otherwise be free, to enter into combination with some other element
of low vapour-density, and that the resulting compound emits that

   Again, it follows as a consequence of this hypothesis that the
circumstances which most favour the formation of a double star are
when the two bodies that come into collision are of nearly equal mass.
Such cases must be rare; but when they do occur, there is a very
high probability that the issue will be a double star. This appears
to account for the fact that a very remarkable proportion of double
stars have constituents of nearly the same magnitude.
   Another consequence is that when the stars are very unequal the
companion will, as it plunges over and over again through the atmo
sphere of the primary, be gradually deprived of several of        lighter                              its
gases;         so
            that when     finally gets clear

                                                                       it

                   solitary star, but others which emanate from denser
                          a

which are found      the minute companions
                              in                   double stars.            of
     Another        consequencethat the orbits
                                             is                          of
                                                     double stars will almost
always have      considerable ellipticity.
                    a
   Another consequence          that the conditions are likely not unfre
                                                 is
quently     arise which would separate the companion into two
               to                                                            more                        or
fragments, and that when this happens the separate pieces will
pursue paths which are distinct from one another and not far apart.
This seems      account for such systems
                    to                                                 as

   When the same conditions act with unusual violence they would
probably break               up

     “On the Chemical Intensity of Total Daylight at Kew and Pará
in 1865–67.” By Henry E. Roscoe, F.R.S.
   This communication contains the results of a regular series of
measurements of the chemical action of daylight, carried out at
the Kew Observatory, through the kindness of Dr. Balfour Stewart,
according to the method described by the author in the Philoso
phical Transactions for 1864, p. 605. The observations extend
over a period of two years, from April 1, 1865 to March 31, 1867.
The second part of the communication gives the results of ob
servations upon the Intensity of the Chemical action of Sunlight
under the Equator, made at Pará in latitude 1° 28 S. during
the month of April 1866.
                                I.   Kew Observations.
   The Kew measurements do not profess to exhibit the changes
in chemical intensity which occur from hour to hour; but they
give, with accuracy, the mean monthly chemical intensity, show
ing the rise and fall with the changing seasons of the year, and
they enable us to deduce the mean monthly and yearly chemical -
intensities at Kew for 1865–67.
   Tables showing the daily mean chemical intensity obtained from
the daily observations, according to the method described in the
above-mentioned paper, are given.    The first result which these ob
servations yield is that the mean chemical intensity for hours equi
distant from noon is constant; that                    is,

A   similar relation is found to hold good for the Pará observa
tions. Assuming the same relation to exist at Kew as at Heidel
berg and Pará, the values of the mean monthly intensity at noon
have been calculated from the observations at 2.30 and 4.30 P.M.,
and the mean monthly integrals of chemical intensity for each
month, from April 1865 to March 1867 inclusive, have been ob
tained.   Curves exhibiting the daily rise and fall for each of the
twenty-four months, as well as a curve showing the biennial varia
tion of chemical intensity for the same period, accompany the paper.
The curve of yearly chemical intensity is found to be unsymme
trical about the vernal and autumnal equinoxes; thus in spring
and autumn the results are as follows:—

liar retarding influence has been suggested which the heating and
luminous rays are supposed to exert upon the more refrangible
portions of the spectrum. The fallacy of these statements has
been fully proved by a series of direct measurements of the che
mical intensity of sunlight under the equator, made at Pará by
Mr. T. E. Thorpe. . The curves of daily chemical intensity given
in the paper show that the activity of the chemical rays in the tro
pics is very much greater—on one day fifty-five times as great as
in our latitudes; and these measurements prove that the reported
failures of photographers cannot at any rate be ascribed to a di
minution in the chemical intensity of sunlight. The following
numbers give some of the daily mean chemical intensities at Pará
compared with the same days in Kew :—                              -

The measurements were made at Pará in the middle of the rainy
season, and at very frequent intervals during the day; the curves
show the enormous and rapid variation in intensity from hour to
hour which the chemically active rays undergo under a tropical
sun during the rainy season.
  “On     the Identity of the Body in the Atmosphere which decom.
 oses   Iodide of Potassium with Ozone.”     By Thomas Andrews,
  .D., F.R.S.                                                                       -
   It was assumed for many years, chiefly on the authority of Schön
bein, that the body in the atmosphere which colours iodide-of-po
tassium paper is identical with ozone; but this identity has of late
been called in question; and as the subject is one of considerable
importance,    I  submitted it lately to a careful investigation, the
                        I
results of which beg to lay briefly before the Society.       The only
property of ozone, hitherto recognized as belonging to the body in
the atmosphere, is that of setting free the iodine in iodide of potas
sium ; but as other substances, such as nitric acid and chlorine,
which may possibly exist in the atmosphere, have the same pro
perty, no certain conclusion could be drawn from this fact alone.
   One of the most striking properties of ozone is       power its oxi      of
dizing mercury, and few experiments are more striking than that
of  allowing some bubbles        electrolytic oxygen

same way upon pure mercury; but, from the very minute quantity
of it which is at any time present, the experiment requires some
care in order that the effect may be observed. On passing a stream
of atmospheric air, which gave the usual reactions with test-paper,
for some hours over the surface of mercury in a U-tube, the metal
was distinctly oxidized at the end at which the air first
                                                     -    came into
contact with it.
     This experiment,  however, cannot be considered conclusive, as
mercury will tarnish and lose                             its
                                    mobility under the influence                                              of
many bodies besides ozone.

   The Lower, Middle, and Upper groups of sandstones and shales of
West Somerset and North Devon were described in this paper as oc
curring in a regular and unbroken succession from north to south,
namely from the sandstones comprising the promontory of the Fore
land, at the base, to the grits and slates &c. overlying the Upper Old
Red Sandstone of Pickwell Down to the south. The author was unable
to see any traces of a fault of sufficient magnitude to invert the
order of succession, or that would cause the rocks of the Foreland at
Lynton to be upon the same horizon as those south of a line of
high ground that passes across the county from Morte Bay on the

conditions.                                   -
   The author then showed that above the Lower or Lynton slates
there is an extensively developed series of red, claret-coloured, and
grey grits, from 1500 to 1800 feet thick; these form a natural and
conformable base to the Middle Devonian or Ilfracombe group. The
highest beds, containing Myalina and Natica, insensibly pass into
the gritty and calcareous slates of Combe Martin, Ilfracombe, &c.;
this Middle group Mr. Etheridge unhesitatingly regarded as the
equivalent of the Torquay and Newton Bushel series of South
Devon.
   Mr. Etheridge gave detailed Tables of the organic remains of the
two groups (the Lower, or Lynton, and the Middle or Ilfracombe),
and collated with them those species found in equivalent strata in
Rhenish Prussia, Belgium, and France.        He was inclined to believe
that these two marine fossiliferous groups represent in time the
unfossiliferous Old Red Sandstone (Dingle beds) of Kerry, and the-
Glengariff and Killarney Grits of the south-west of Ireland.
   The author then endeavoured to prove that the Pickwell Down
beds are the true Upper Old Red Sandstone only, not the whole of
the formation, as was lately proposed.
   Arguments were also brought forward to show the probability of
the Carboniferous slate (in part) and Coomhola grits being the
equivalent of the English Upper Old Red Sandstone, or Upper
Devonian, and that the North Devon beds only are to regarded
as the true type (to which the Irish must be compared), and not
vice versd.

     Physical and Palaeontological evidence distinctly proves, the
 author stated, that the whole of the slates and limestones of Lee,
 Ilfracombe, and Combe Martin underlie the Morte Bay red sand
 Stones.
     The author compared the whole of the Devonian fauna of Britain
 with that of the Rhine, Belgium, and France, by means of a series
 of Tables based upon the British types. These marine Devonian
 species were compared with those of the Old Red Sandstone proper,
 the Silurian, and Carboniferous, and analyses were made of      the                                             all
 classes, orders, genera, and species, with relation  the groups                            to                           of
 rocks     which they occur—the result being the conclusion that the
             in
 marine Devonian series,        whole, constitutes
                                               as   aimportant and                          an

still more largely illustrate the Laurentian fauna.     After giving
short descriptions of new specimens from Madoc and from Long
Lake and Wentworth, Dr. Dawson discussed the objections of Prof.
King and Dr. Rowney to the view of the organic nature of Eozoon,
and stated that those gentlemen had failed to distinguish between
the organic and the crystalline forms, as was especially illustrated
by their regarding the veins of crysotile as identical with the tubu
lated cell-wall of Eozoon.

    3.     “On  Subaérial Denudation, and on Cliffs and Escarpments
           Chalk and the Tertiary strata.” By W. Whitaker, Esq., B.A.,
   From the fact that escarpments differ from cliffs in     their chief                            all
features, the author inferred that the two could hardly result from
the same action, but that, whilst the latter were made     the sea, the                            by
former seem             to

   The chief contrasts between the two kinds      ridges are:—                      of
   (1) Escarpments    always  run   along  the strike.   Cliffs rarely
do so.
  (2) The bottom                  of      an   escarpment            is   not    at   one level throughout.

that, on the other hand, the far smaller denudations and comparatively
trifling irregularities of the surface (our hills and valleys) have been
worn out by the long-continued action of rain, rivers, and ice.

F.R.S., F.G.S.
   The Crendi (or Mahlek) Cavern is situated on the south coast of
Malta. The flooring consisted of two distinct deposits, the lower
being a stratum composed of a hard stalagmitic clay with rounded
pebbles, and containing teeth and bones (unworn) of the Hippopo
tamus (H. Pentlandi).   The upper stratum, also a stalagmitic de

some recent Land-shells.
     The Zebbug Cavern, in the interior of the island, was, when dis
 covered, filled with sandy clay containing subangular fragments of
 the rock, and bones of at least two species of Elephant, comprising
 a complete set of the teeth and tusks of the pigmy elephant, repre
 senting animals in every stage of growth, and part of the tusk of
 a much larger elephant.        No remains of Hippopotamus were met
 with in this   cavern;   but a few bones of Myorus (2 spp.), of Birds,
 and of a Chelonian were discovered in it.
    The Melheha Cavern, at the north end of the island, contained a
 deposit with remains of the teeth and bones of the Hippopotamus
 only, and seemed therefore to represent the lower stratum of the
 Crendi Cavern.
    From the fact that the deposits containing remains of the Hippo.
potamus were so distinct from those including the Elephant-remains,
 Captain Spratt inferred that these two mammals belonged to distinct
 geological epochs, the Elephant being the more recent.
    As Malta and Gozo were probably elevated above the sea at the
close of the Miocene period, it is very possible that the caverns,
formed by the long action of the sea upon              its

submerged lands are indicated by the “Adventure Bank,” between
Tunis and Sicily; and by the “Medina Bank,” a ridge connecting
the south-east of Malta with Tripoli.       An upheaval of about 200
fathoms would render both banks     dry,  with the exception of one or
two narrow     channels, which would not impede the larger animals
from  passing   from one continent to the other at the seasonable
times for migration.
   2. “On the Lower Lias of the North-east of Ireland.” By Ralph
Tate, Esq., A.L.S., F.G.S.
   The author described the Lias of Ireland as consisting of (1) the
Avicula-contorta series, including a well-developed zone of Avicula
contorta and the White Lias; (2) the Lower Lias, embracing the
equivalents to the zones of Ammonites planorbis, A. angulatus, and
A.  Bucklandi of Great Britain, and a fourth zone (that of Belem
nites acutus), representing that portion of the Lower Lias superior
to the zone of Ammonites Bucklandi.
   Mr. Tate stated that the principal portion of the Lias belongs to
the zone of Avicula contorta, and that the greater portion of the
Lower Lias is comprised in the zone of Ammonites angulatus. The
remarkable and isolated mass of metamorphosed Lias at Portrush
was referred to the “Planorbis series.”
   3. “On the fossiliferous development of the zone of Ammonites
angulatus in Great Britain.”     By Ralph Tate, Esq., A.L.S., F.G.S.
   In this paper the author recorded the discovery of a fauna,
hitherto imperfectly known in this country, characterizing beds
below the Limestone-series of the Lower Lias. It is exceedingly
rich in fossils. Cephalopoda are few in number (about 8 species);
Gasteropoda are very numerous and characteristic, there being about
50 species, the majority of which are new to Great Britain; the
Corals are abundant and peculiar.
   Ammonites angulatus was stated to occur at various places in
Ireland; at Marton, Lincolnshire; in Warwickshire; in North
 Gloucestershire;   at Brocastle and Sutton, in Glamorganshire;    and
in Dorsetshire.
   The author further communicated the results of a critical ex
amination of the Sutton-Stone      fossils, which are:—(1) that the
majority of the species are well-known Liassic forms of the con
tinent, and occur in other parts of Great Britain; (2) that they
incompletely represent the fauna of the zone of Ammonites angu
latus; and (3) that the Sutton Stone is lithologically and palaeonto
logically identical with the “Calcaire de Valogne,” the stratigra
phical relations of which have been well determined.

   Beds of the Rhaetic series were stated to occur at  Lea,  two miles
to the south of Gainsborough, and were described as consisting of
more or less indurated and highly micaceous sandstones, alternating
with black shaly clays, and containing two bone-beds.
   The fossils are very abundant, and are those which are usually met

However, the right ramus of the lower jaw of an Ichthyosaurus was
found in the lowest bed, lying on the blue Keuper Marl.         Two
interesting additions to the vertebrate fauna of this series are
Trematosaurus Alberti, and Lepidotus Giebeli ?
   The author pointed out the correlation of these beds with those at
Aust Cliff and other well-known localities in England, and their
probable connexion with similar deposits in Ireland and on the con
tinent; and he concluded by defining the surface-extent of this the
most northern English deposit of Rhaetic age as yet discovered.

amounts to the same thing, an ascending current of positive elec
tricity, in the conducting wire which joins two places at different
heights above the sea-level.
   This furnishes the explanation of a phenomenon frequently ob
served, and under conditions quite free from objection, by M. Mat
teucci. He observed that in every mixed circuit, consisting of a
layer of earth and a metal wire the ends of which are sunk in the
ground, minute precautions being taken to avoid any thermal or chemi
cal action, the wire is traversed by an electrical current whose direction
is constant whenever the soils in which the ends are plunged are of
unequal heights. The current ascends on the metal wire;            intensity                   its
increases with the length         the wire, and with the difference
                                                 of                                                              in
level of the ends. M. Matteucci has convinced himself that at the
higher station there were very intense indications           positive elec          of
tricity, while these signs were feeble,                         or

 served by      M. Matteucci,            of which the experiment just described is
 a faithful representation.
    When I produced a series of discharges, by bringing the positive
 plate too near the negative sphere below, I saw the needle of the
 galvanometer deflect, sometimes in one, and sometimes in the other
 direction, making very irregular movements, instead of preserving
 the constant deviation which it experienced when there was no dis
 charge. This is another faithful representation of what takes place
 in nature—M. Matteucci having observed that during storms the
 oscillations of the needle of the galvanometer are sudden and fre
 quent, while on calm and clear days (the only ones on which the
 normal phenomenon could be observed) the deflection of the needle
 remains almost constant.
    I do not dwell upon the other phenomena of the same kind
 observed by M. Matteucci, such as the presence of very feeble and
 variable currents in a wire terminating in two points of the surface
 of the earth situate on the same parallel and on the same level;
points whose electrical condition should obviously be the same, or
only slightly differ in either direction, owing to accidental circum
stances. The slight currents from south to north, again, which M.
 Matteucci has observed in wires placed horizontally in the direction
of the meridian, and having their ends constantly in the ground,
are probably due to the fact that the negative tension of the earth,
other things being the same, gradually increases from the equator to
the poles, where it is a maximum.        This increase is a necessary
consequence of the influence which should be exerted on the negative
electricity of the earth by the great quantity of positive electricity
accumulated in the atmosphere near the poles, owing to the trade
winds.     The discharges which take place between the contrary
electricities in the polar regions where they are accumulated, give
rise, as I have shown, to the polar auroras and the electrical currents
 which accompany, them—currents, more powerful than those of
 which we have spoken, and which differ from them both in intensity
 and in direction.
    The electrical phenomena which occur at the surface of our
 globe and in our atmosphere are sufficiently complex.         There is first

tioned, there are a great number of partial and local facts, arising
from unequal tension in the more or less variably distributed elec
tricity, whether negative or positive, with which the terrestrial
globe and its atmosphere are respectively charged.   Such are those
which M. Matteucci observed, and those to which I have alluded
in this note; such, moreover, are the ordinary storms, and        the                                  all
varied phenomena which accompany them.            The attraction                                               of

that many other natural phenomena, waterspouts for example, have
the same origin.—Comptes Rendus, June 10, 1867.

      INVESTIGATIONs on THE ABsoBPTION                           of obscure HEAT.
                       BY M. P. DESAINS.
   On May 27 I had the honour of laying before the Academy the
results of a series of experiments on the absorbing action which seve
ral volatile liquids and their vapours exert on the heat from a lamp
with a glass chimney.
   These experiments show that, in the case of the heat in question
and the substances with which I worked, the absorption obeys a
very simple law—that a column of any of these liquids of a given
section and weight exerts an absorption which is independent of the
physical condition of the medium.      The liquid column is very short,
 and the  gaseous  one  very long; but they produce the same effect.
   It     seemed  important to ascertain whether this equality exists
when the     rays  are far more absorbable than those of a lamp with a
double     draught,   which have already passed through a considerable
thickness of    glass—whetherit        obtains, for instance, in the case of the
radiation from a      plate  of copper   heated to about 400°.
    But here a purely experimental difficulty at once presented itself.
This obscure heat is absorbed by glass to far too great an extent for
me to dream of employing the glass plates I used in my former ex
periments.       By the use of rock-salt Professor Tyndall was able to
obtain good results.          But although we need not exaggerate the
 fears which may arise from the facility with which this body absorbs
                           I
aqueous vapour, preferred to get rid entirely of this source of error;
and fortunately           I
                       obtained from M. H. Soleil some very beautiful spe
 cimens of colourless fluor-spar, which were extremely useful to me.
    Melloni's experiments have shown that a thickness of 2 millims.
 of this substance transmits about 50 per cent. of the heat from a
 blackened copper plate heated to 400°.
      Iused it for closing my tubes, and for constructing my lenses and
 troughs; and, thanks to its use,                    I
                                             have been able to ascertain that
 on the heat from a blackened copper plate heated to about 400° the
 ether exerts absorptions which are always independent of the phy
 sical condition of the bodies used.          This absorption is considerable,
 amounting to about 92 per cent. in the case of a layer of liquid
 ether of 0.0017 millim. in thickness at 25°. In                          all

  meets on     its
                 path      the same.

     This characteristic          the absorption which the diathermanous

changed.        The absorptive action of air is known tobe so weak that
it   may be completely neglected.     Lastly, comparing under several
conditions the absorptive action exerted by columns of coal-gas having
the same section and the same weight, I observed that they were the
 same, although their length and their densities were very different.
    Tubes closed by plates of fluor-spar appear likely to be of great use
 in demonstrating the laws of the absorption of obscure heat.
    In my experiments the galvanometric action produced by obscure
radiation transmitted through a tube full of air 0.64 metre in length
was 20°; it sank to 11° when                    I
                                       used the coal-gas tube under a
pressure of 0.76 metre. The action of the vapour of ether is far
greater; a tube half as long would be sufficient to render it very
distinct.
     Imay be permitted, in conclusion, to add that troughs closed by
fluor-spar plates are, from their unalterability, very convenient in
investigating absorption by liquids. Using them, I have ascertained
that liquid chloride of carbon, with the same thickness, is more easily
traversed by obscure heat than bisulphide of carbon itself.

has pointed out a great inaccuracy which I had committed. Quoting
from memory, I had misrepresented the results of Melloni's experi

of transparent plates, the principal absorption is effected by the first
plate.    But the main question to which I called attention, I submit,
remains as it was. Mr. Croll asserts, on the authority of Mr. Meech's
Tables, that if the present annual heat at the equator be represented
by 365:24, the heat at the poles will be represented by 151-59; and
if the obliquity were increased by 1° 22' 34", by 160:04,-these two
quantities being to each other as 18 to 19.          What I contended for
was that each of these last     quantities  was  necessarily erroneous, as
they make no allowance for the diminution of heat in passing
through the atmosphere, which is known to be very great, and that
if we had the true quantities, their proportion might be very differ
ent.    Melloni’s experiments show that the absorption for each trans
parent substance that he tried was very different: he did not experi
ment upon a mixture of oxygen, nitrogen, and watery vapour, such
as our atmosphere consists of.        Mr. Croll says that whatever the
absorption be, it will be the same for each obliquity, and therefore
the proportion will be the same.      But Tyndall has shown that watery
vapour is the greatest absorber of              all
                                           gaseous bodies.   Now increase
of  heat   always attended

                                                       and the additional

                  By DAVID Forbes, F.R.S.        &c.4:
IN readers
       this present communication it is proposed to lay before the
               of the Philosophical Magazine the first part of a
series of researches in British mineralogy which of late have
engaged the attention of the author, who, being still occupied in
their further prosecution, hopes from time to time to communi
cate in the pages   of this Magazine the results of subsequent        in
vestigations.
    In these papers  it is intended, besides treating of the physical
characters and chemical composition of the minerals under con
sideration, to pay especial attention, whenever it is practicable,
to the study of their association, paragenesis, and mode of occur
rence, as connected with the petrology and geology of their loca
lities, in order thereby to elucidate as far as possible the origin
and formation of the rock-masses or mineral veins in which they
may happen to be imbedded.
    As this department of mineralogy has hitherto attracted but
little or no attention in England, it is thought necessary, before
entering upon the description and particulars of the mineral
species which are treated. of in the present notice, to devote a
few words to the consideration of the present state of British
mineralogy, and more especially to bring forward some remarks
on the great importance of the application of mineralogical           in
vestigation to the study of geological phenomenat.
    * Communicated by the Author.
    t The author would take the opportunity of stating that, although
long engaged in mineralogical investigation (many of the results of which

 330                 Mr. D. Forbes's    Researches in
    The high scientific position occupied by British mineralogists
 during the first third of this present century was one of which
 the country might justly feel proud; and the names of Wollas
 ton, Hatchett, Jameson, Thomson, Phillips, Allan, Children,
 and others took their place amongst those of the most able re
 presentatives of the science at that period.
     When, however, the actual state of mineralogical inquiry at
 this present time is reviewed, it cannot but be confessed that
 the many advances since made in the science have been almost
 exclusively due to the labours of continental investigators, and
 that British mineralogists have of late years neither done their
 fair share of the work, nor even sustained the brilliant reputation
 attained by their predecessors.
    The more novel attractions of palaeontological research on the
 one hand, and of organic chemistry on the other, appear to have
 diverted the exertions of many of those who otherwise would
 doubtless have done good service in the advancement of mine
 ralogy; and it is to be feared that the British geologist of the
 present day not only frequently underrates the importance of a
 sound fundamental acquaintance with the elements of mineralogy,
 but also is not sufficiently impressed with the fact that such
 knowledge is absolutely essential to the proper and successful
 prosecution of petrological inquiry.
     To say the least, it may be regarded as       a misuse    of valuable
 time, if not even termed presumption, when speculations alto
 gether hypothetical in their nature are brought forward to ex
 plain the chemical changes which are supposed to have caused
 the appearance or changes of rock-masses in nature before
 the authors are in possession of accurate data to prove the minera
 logical and chemical composition of the rocks themselves.            And,
 here in England, it will not be denied that it is only in some
 very few instances (forming the exception to the rule) that at
 present there are at hand data, either mineralogical or chemical,
 sufficient to enable such generalizations to be attempted with
 any pretensions to soundness; for it is well known that only very
 few chemical analyses of British rocks have been made, but also
 that there is an equal want of either correct mineralogical deter
 minations or chemical analyses of the British mineral species
 which combine to form the mass of even the most common rocks".
have already appeared in this and other scientific periodicals),   his resi
 dence and many years’ travels in foreign parts have hitherto caused his
attention to be more exclusively devoted to the mineralogy of such coun
tries, and prevented him contributing his mite to British mineralogy.
   * It must be admitted that England in this respect stands far behind
the rest of Europe; France, Germany, Russia, and even the small king
doms of Norway and Denmark are far in advance with regard to the know
ledge of the chemical and mineralogical composition of their rocks.

    No wonder, therefore, that the petrological nomenclature in
present use is both indefinite and unintelligible, and, in 'short,
altogether inadequate to the demands of the more advanced state
of the other branches of geological inquiry, and, as a conse
quence thereof, that in geological surveys and maps it is common
to find eruptive rocks of totally distinct mineral and chemical
composition and age confounded with one another (as, for ex
ample, young diorites with old granites, young dolerites with old
diabases, &c.), and in other cases to find rocks coloured and de
scribed by names which do not pertain to them (called, for ex
ample, syenites when quartz may not be even an essential con
stituent, diorites or greenstones yet not contain hornblende, tal
cose slates without talc, &c.).   In fact the present state of clas
sification and nomenclature of the eruptive rocks is such that it
becomes quite impossible to know with any certainty what exact
rock may be intended or mapped under the names generally
In llSe.
  Even in these days of intellectual progress, the old saying that
“there is no royal road to learning” remains just as true as ever,
and the discovery has not yet been made which would enable the
child to read before first mastering the alphabet.
   So even in geology; for however distasteful and laborious the
task may be, it is nevertheless equally essential that the elements
of mineralogy (physical and chemical) be acquired before the
geologist is entitled to indulge in theoretical generalizations
which, it will not even be disputed, must, from their very nature,
be based upon such premises.
   Mineralogy appears too often to be confounded with mere
crystallography, a branch of applied mathematics undoubtedly
of great service in the determination of crystallized mineral
species, but which at the same time, especially when studied into
 its    refinements,
                 must             be

  The study of the mode of occurrence, association, and para
genesis  of minerals, as well as of their origin and the relations
which  they  bear to the geology of the matrix in which they are
imbedded, is one of the highest importance and interest to the
mineralogist.    It is quite true, however, that the attention of
most  mineralogists  has hitherto been      but exclusively devoted        all
to the study     the crystallographic
                           of         characters and chemical com

globe, present themselves under similar conditions, have the same
associated minerals along with them, and that the eruptive rocks
in which they occur, whenever the age of their intrusion could
be satisfactorily ascertained, frequently, if not always, corre
sponded in geological chronology.   This is more particularly the
case with such minerals as have not been produced by a subse
quent metamorphic action* (or alteration of previously existing
species), and which may be assumed to be present in the rock in
the unaltered condition in which they originally were developed

   Some, but comparatively few, minerals must be regarded as
common   to a variety of situations and circumstances, frequently
occurring as normal constituents of very different rocks, although
not really characteristic of any one precise rock or formation.
Such minerals at times owe their appearance to chemical reac
tions and processes quite dissimilar to those which at other times
have caused their          formation<U+017F>.
   Other minerals, the chemical elements of which, being com
mon to the mass of the rock-matrix in which they occur, may
merely indicate by their presence that they have been formed by
the combination and rearrangement of these elements in situ,
effected by the action of heat, water, or other agency.       Epidote
is generally  an excellent  example  of this  class, being  most fre
quently found developed in rocks at their points of contact with
eruptive intrusions, which seem to have affected the parts of the
rock in juxtaposition sufficiently to cause           constituents                its                                 to

amongst the numerous cases in which other minerals were found
to differ when occurring under different circumstances may be
mentioned the following.
   Mica, when it occurs in granitic rocks”, was found, as a rule,
to present itself as Muscovite, although in some special granite
it also does occur as lepidolite. When in serpentines or meta
morphic limestones it was, in                           all

                                               in                                                            as

   Leonhard,      his Charakteristik der Felsarten, has also shown
                    in
that garnets, when        granite, always crystallize

     Again, apatite, when occurring          granites, was invariably

                                             denote structure, the author                                     is
not disposed      to
                  admit that there  any actual structure specially characte

336                  Mr. D. Forbes's Researches in
    Olivine also differs in chemical composition, according as it is
found in magnesian limestones, metamorphic schists, or volcanic
rocks”.
    And this list could easily be extended.             Not only, however,
 do the same minerals when occurring in rocks of different nature
possess distinct peculiarities which distinguish them from one
 another, but, as has been already shown (Christiania Naturfors
kere Mödet Forhandlinger, 1856+), this may even be the case
when they occur in rocks of the same character but of different
geological ages. Thus certain younger granites which are com
mon in Norway, Sweden, and Russia (as well as in the United
 States of America) are characterized not only by the appearance of
numerous mineral species containing the rarc metals cerium, lan
thanum, yttrium, &c., but also by several of the usual minerals
 (common to most granites) which otherwise do not contain any
trace of these elements being found to have a portion of their
ordinary bases replaced by the oxides of these metals.                  Thus,
in this younger granite, epidote is represented by orthite, titanite
often becomes yttrotitanite, garnets frequently contain several
per cent. of yttria or oxide of cerium, apatite contains crypto
lite (a phosphate of cerium), and the scapolite, according to Her
mann’s analysis, is hyposclerite (containing some 3 per cent. of
oxide of cerium).
    The results of the study of the mineral occurrence in eruptive
rocks, along with that of the physical characters and chemical
composition of these minerals, as well as a careful examination
of the rocks themselves in the field in many parts of the world,
have confirmed the author in the belief that such minerals as
previously had been generally regarded as extraneous or acci
dental are in reality truly characteristic of the rocks themselves,
and that even such common species as are usually recognized as
rock-constituents also possess, when they occur in rocks differing
widely in character and geological age, peculiarities cither of
physical structure or chemical composition which may serve to
distinguish them from one another. This inquiry also led him
to conclusions already made public, that:—
    (1) Eruptive or intrusiye rocks of identical mineral constitution
have made their appearance or intrusion into the earth’s crust at
similar geological epochs.
    (2) The minerals, or classes of minerals, accompanying or as
sociated with such intrusive or eruptive rocks may serve as a
   * Carbonate of lime is generally admitted to indicate differences in the
origin of a rock in which it occurs, according as it is present in the form of
calcite or Arragonite; and this is doubtless also the case with sulphate of
lime when occurring respectively as gypsum or anhydrite.

   Unfortunately at the present time but few data are available
for a more extended inquiry into this interesting subject, with a
view to test or confirm the soundness of these conclusions.
   Although mineralogists have accumulated a large amount of
information regarding the crystallographic characters and che
mical composition of minerals, it is but rare to find in works on
mineralogy any definite statements as to their mode of occur
rence, mineral association, or the nature and geological age of
the rocks in which they may have been found imbedded.           In
carrying out such petrological inquiries, geology must necessarily
go hand in hand with mineralogy and chemistry, and, whenever
possible,  the rock-matrix of a mineral should be referred to                                                       its

                 Gold from the clogau Quart: Lode No. 2.
   This specimen was taken from the stamps, and was the result
of quartz mined from the backs of the lode, almost on the sur
face, and was in the form of minute flattened grains, nearly free
from any mineral admixture, and of a fine yellow colour.
   The specific gravity, taken with 34.08 grains free from any
yisible impurity, was found to be 17-26 at the temperature of
60° F.
    The chemical analysis was conducted as follows:—A weighed
amount of the gold was dissolved as far as possible in nitrohy
drochloric acid and evaporated nearly to dryness in a water-bath,
then redissolved in water slightly acidulated with hydrochloric
acid, and filtered from the chloride of silver and insoluble quartz,
which were determined conjointly and afterwards treated with
ammonia, which by dissolving out the chloride of silver, left the
                                             -
quartz behind for estimation.
    From the filtrate, after being heated to nearly boiling, the
gold in     its
              metallic state, along with any copper present (in the
           oxalate), was precipitated               by     strong so
      of of

lution      oxalic acid. The metallic gold was then collected                                on
a  filter and washed, first with water and then with weak solu
tion of   ammonia,          in
                        order     dissolve out any oxalate
                                     to                        copper             of
which    might      present;
                       be     these last washings with ammonia were
collected     separately and tested for copper.
  The first filtrate and washings, which would contain any iron
present    the gold, were now evaporated
            in                                 dryness and the iron

   Another specimen of gold quartz from this lode was also
submitted to examination, the quartz fragments being pounded
for the purpose and washed in a batea by Mr. Melville Attwood.
The gold obtained was in irregular flakes, apparently somewhat
lighter in colour than the previously examined specimen, and
                               to its
upon experiment        specific gravity was found            15-62,                       to   be          a

ciated with the gold were tetradymite, iron pyrites, chalcopyrite,
galena, chlorite, calcite, dolomite, ankerite (?), chalybite, and

sulphate of barytes”. These minerals as well as the native gold
itself are distributed very irregularly in the quartz of the lode.
   When the quartz contains patches of calcite, dolomite, and
chalybite, and includes splinters or fragments of the neighbour
ing clay-slate, it is regarded by the miners as more promising
and likely to yield gold than when the lode consists of quartz
                                                                     -
alone.
   Although the gold sometimes is found alone imbedded in the
colourless quartz, it occurs more often in conjunction with more
or less iron pyrites and the other above-mentioned metallic com
pounds, which usually occur as small patches, nests, or aggrega
tions in the quartz.
   When small pieces or splinters of the bluish-grey slate are found
isolated and enclosed in the quartz of the lode, it is common to
find the gold and other metallic minerals adherent to or crystal
lized on the under surface of such fragments. This mode of
occurrence is very suggestive of crystallization from solution, where
it is common to find the crystals developing themselves in prefer
ence on the sides of any foreign bodies which might happen to
be floating about in the fluid—chips or straws for example.       The
adhesion of the gold and metallic minerals to the underside
of such chips or fragments of slate might be supposed to indi
cate that the underside of such fragments had arrested the gold
&c. in the act of being carried into the lode-fissure from below
along with the stream of liquid quartz: this would be equally the
case whether the quartz is imagined to have been injected as an
aqueous solution, or in            its
                              known gelatinous state,            state           or   in

   These diabases are composed of a felspar base in conjunction
with diallage and chlorite, and frequently, owing to incipient
decomposition of these silicates, effervesce slightly with acids,
thus revealing the presence of a trace of carbonate of lime,
   From the observations of the Geological Survey, it may be con
cluded that the intrusion of these diabases was not of later date
than the Silurian period—which result is conformable with what
is known       to the age of the appearance of similar diabasic
                 as
rocks in other parts of Europe”.
   The auriferous quartz lode at Clogau runs about 18° north of
east and dips at a high angle (88°) to south, cutting through
both the fossiliferous strata and the intruded diabases; it must
consequently be of later geological age than both of these rocks,
and not improbably is even younger than the Silurian formation
as a whole; but at present no data are at hand to                 exact                                fix      its
age with any certainty,

      If wecould suppose the workings on the lode in such a mine
carried down through the entire thickness of these Cambrian
grits into softer and more congenial strata, it might even be an
ticipated that the lode might again be found quite as produc
tive as before, irrespective of actual depth from the surface.
    From the consideration of the general characters of these
auriferous lodes and of the mineral association*, the author as
sumes the probability of these lodes pertaining to what he has
termed the older or granitic intrusion of gold, which he supposes
to have taken place some time between the Silurian and the Car
boniferous periodf; and it is also believed that these lodes have
been injected from below, and not formed either by segregation
or infiltration.

small flattened elongated spangles, in size from about a pin's

And if the iron and titanium are supposed to be present respec

according to the views of Rose and Berzelius, this composition
closely approximates       to the formula Fe.” O* TiO2, which, when

     The minerals associated with this titanoferrite are seldom to be
distinguished by the naked eye, but are easily recognized by a
microscopic examination of thin sections of the rock itself”, and
are seem to be:–a triclinic soda-lime felspar, probably Labrado
rite; augite in brown crystals often finely developed; and a small
 quantity of a green mineral having the same crystalline form as
 the augite, which may possibly be Delessite (a ferruginous chlo
 rite), but is more probably seladonite, a variety (hydrous) of
 augite. In some specimens specks of iron pyrites are seen, and
 occasionally minute long prisms which are hexagonal in section
 and most likely are apatite, as by a chemical examination a small
 amount of phosphoric acid was found in some specimens.                  In
 some instances the rock contains small       radiating   crystallizations
 of a zeolitic mineral, occasionally from one-eighth to a quarter of
 an inch diameter, which, although    -  not as yet examined,
                                                          -

 to be   pectolite.
     The geological age of the intrusion of these rocks is considered
  by Mr. Beete Jukes to be contemporaneous with that of the coal
  measures, but is believed by the author to have been subsequent
  to the deposition and consolidation of these strata.            It is not
  improbable, however, that it was previous to the formation of
  most of the Permian series; since at Marston Jabet in War
  wickshire, and at the Holland Arms in Anglesea, eruptive rocks
  analogous to these are found traversing the carboniferous strata,
  but overlain by Permian beds, which consequently must be of
  later date.
      The occurrence of these insignificant, almost microscopic black
   specks of titanoferrite in the substance of these rocks, should they
   even happen to attract the passing attention of the field geologist
   at all, would most probably be quite disregarded by him, in his

                                                 seem
these two instances are very different, although undoubtedly
both are derived from the alteration of the same rock-mass.
   This apparent discrepancy, however, is easily accounted for.
In the case of the first-mentioned dark-red ferruginous clay, the
alteration, having taken place at the surface, under the full oxi
dating agency of the atmosphere, caused the whole, or at least
the greater part of the iron present in the rock to be converted
into sesquioxide or red oxide of iron, and thus accounts for the
colour of the clay.
   In the depths of the coal-pit, however, cut off from access to
the air, the chemical changes would be very different. The
water percolating slowly through the substance of the rock, be
sides causing it to become hydrated and disintegrated, would
carry off a portion off     lime, magnesia, and alkali, and proba
                                          its

  Specific gravity taken on 61.96 grains pure fragments was 497

     Before the blowpipe, on charcoal, it decrepitates, and then
 fuses to a globule which, when treated in the oxidizing-flame,
 covers the charcoal with a white sublimate of oxide of anti
  mony; and still nearer to the globule sublimates of the oxides
 of zinc and of lead may be perceived, whilst sulphurous acid is
 evolved; with borax or charcoal the glass reacts for iron, whilst
 antimony; and sulphur are given off and by continued treatment
 in the oxidizing-flame a white metallic globule containing silver
 and copper is obtained, which, when treated with phosphate,
 shows the copper-reaction.
    In the open tube sulphurous acid was evolved, and a white
 antimonial sublimate formed.
    When a weighed quantity was fused with borax and lead,
 treated with the oxidizing-flame, and the resulting silver-lead
 cupelled, as in the ordinary blowpipe assay, the mineral yielded
 13.9 per cent. of silver.
    A preliminary qualitative examination having shown the mi
neral to contain sulphur, antimony, iron, silver, copper, zinc,
lead, and a little insoluble quartz, the quantitative chemical ana
 lysis was conducted as follows.
    A quantity of the finely pulverized mineral was introduced
into a previously tared small glass-tube boat open at both ends,
and weighed; it was then introduced (close up to the bend) into
a hard-glass tube, the one end of which was cut off obliquely
and bent so as to dip into a two-necked bottle containing a so
lution of tartaric and hydrochloric acids, whilst the other neck
was provided with a bulb-tube inserted into the liquid only
so far that the solution could only be forced up into the bulb,
but must fall back again. A current of dry chlorine gas was
now passed through; the arrangement and the part of the tube
containing the mineral was then heated gradually until it ap
peared perfectly decomposed and converted into chlorides.      The
tube-boat was now drawn back with a wire out of the hard-glass
tube in which it had been heated, and allowed to absorb mois
ture slowly by being kept for some hours in a glass beaker mois
tened on the sides with water.       The hard-glass tube was now
washed out with hot water into the solution of hydrochloric and
tartaric acid contained in the two-necked bottle.
    This operation consequently resulted in the formation of two
products, respectively:—
    A, a solid residue contained in the tube-boat, which contained
all           in
     the silver             of

 these were filtered off, well washed with water                 dissolve out the

 insoluble quartz, then determined; and afterwards the former
was dissolved out          by  ammonia, leaving the quartz behind, which
was estimated.
  The copper and lead     this solution were now precipitated
                                     in                                                                    by

subsequently dissolved out by water allowed the sulphate of lead
to be determined.                         -
   The filtrate, which now contained the iron and zinc, was added
to that previously obtained from solution B, and the whole pre
cipitated by hydrosulphate of ammonia, after previous neutraliza
tion of ammonia. The sulphides thus obtained were oxidized
by nitric acid and separated by ammonia, when both these metals
were determined as usual.
   To determine the sulphur, a separate portion of the mineral
was acted upon by nitrohydrochloric acid, evaporated nearly to
dryness, a small amount of free sulphur removed and estimated
scparately after deduction of a minute quantity of residue left
upon ignition, and the solution, after filtration from insoluble
matter, was precipitated by chloride of barium, and the amount
of sulphate of barytes determined as usual. 20:01 grs. of mineral
afforded 0.50 free sulphur, along with 36.41 grs. of sulphate of
barytes; it consequently contained 27°41 per cent. of sulphur.
   The other results obtained were as follows:—Mineral employed
and treated by chlorine, 2002 grs. ; sulphate of lead obtained,
0.39 gr. ; insoluble quartz, 0.07 gr. ; chloride of silver, 3.61 grs. ;
sulphide of antimony with free sulphur, 13.22 grs.; antimo
miate of soda from 4:04 grs. ditto, 2.88 grs.; oxide of zinc, 1.16
gr.; sesquioxide of iron, l'98 gr.; sulphate of copper, 12:53 grs.
    The above data will upon calculation show the percentage
composition of the mineral to be as follows:—

we have a fine red sunset, we must conclude that there are few
clouds within a hundred miles or so towards the west.          Since,
then, the prevailing winds are from the west, and since rain very
commonly depends on the advance of clouds from the west, red
clouds at sunrise indicate that clouds are advancing from the
west, and that therefore rain is probable; whereas a red sun
set shows that there are few or no clouds in the far west, which
by their advance could bring rain, and therefore it is a sign of
fine weather.     These are the chief facts connected with this sub
ject; but there are besides a number of a more complicated cha
racter, not easily accounted for, unless we also take into account
a variety of circumstances the full explanation of which would
make this notice far too long.”
                           I
    In such an abstract could only give a very general account
                      I
of my views; and purposed to publish a more complete paper
 when I had collected more facts, and had had the opportunity
 of reexamining some kinds of coloured clouds that I have not
 since seen. In the paper read at the Meeting, but not published,
 I  contended that it is often mainly the minute particles of dust
 and fog which occur in the atmosphere, comparatively near the
 surface of the earth, that give rise to the red colour of the clouds
 at sunrise and sunset, and that therefore these magnificent
 colours, which we are apt to look on as so very celestial, are to
 a great extent due to the atmosphere being contaminated with
 terrestrial impurities.
     I must confess that I was quite unacquainted with Lommel's
 previous more mathematical paper in Grunert's Archiv (1861,
 xxxvi.); but from what I have said it will be seen that previously
 to his paper in Poggendorff’s Annalen I had been led to form very
 similar conclusions; and at the same time it appears to me that
 what I have said with reference to the effect of the clear transpa
 rent vapour of water will serve to remove a number of difficulties
  connected with the subject. I say this, notwithstanding the facts
  described by Janssen (Brit. Assoc. Report, 1866, Sects. p. 11),
  which  I think admirably account for the blue colour of the sky,
  and for the greatly increased intensity of the narrow black at
  mospheric lines in the red end of the spectrum of morning and
  evening light, but do not explain why, independent of narrow
  black lines, the intensity of the blue end is so greatly dimi
  nished, which   I attribute, with Lommel, to the presence of mi
  nute solid or liquid   particles.

 possible to say; and we might with as much reason, as far as
 evidence goes, assert the prevalence of furious hurricanes.
    The calms which have been named the calms of Cancer come
 more directly within the limits of evidence, and the testimony of
 thousands of seafaring men who cross the tropic every year can
 readily be brought forward. Personal experience has, not un

                                        quote from my own journal
 that, in May    1856, H.M.S. ‘Calcutta' (a rather dull sailing
 line-of-battle ship) ran from the Channel into the trades with a
fresh northerly wind the whole way.         Between the latitudes of
45°N. and 25°. N she made never less, generally considerably
more, than 150' a day, a distance which was for her a very good
run. Our longitude was then, being outward bound, between
 13° and 23° W.       On the homeward passage, in July 1859, we
found calms and very light winds through nearly our whole course
from 30° N. 40° W. to 42° N. 32° W., and were a fortnight be
tween these two positions.
    La Pérouse, in August 1785, ran from Brest into the trade,
in longitude 16° W., without suffering from calms, and with a
prevailing wind from N.E.           The expedition in search of La
Pérouse, leaving Brest in the end of September 1791, found a
fresh north-easterly wind in latitude 46° N., longitude 8° W.,
which carried them to Teneriffe, and thence into the trades in
longitude 17° or 18° W.
    Vancouver, under date April 1791, writes, “The wind, which
had been generally from the west, veered round by the north as
we advanced to the southward, and settled in the N.E. trade, ac
companied with fine pleasant weather, which on the 26th, in lati
tude 30°54' N., afforded me an opportunity of obtaining several
sets of lunar distances . . . . . their mean result showed the lon
gitude to be 16°21'32".” (Voyages, vol. i. p.                       In 8.)
    Cook’s testimony            is    to
                               the same effect.       1772,     says,                  he
“We left Madeira               on
                          the 1st    August and stood

   This Table, giving the means of a very large number of ob
servations, shows no indications of any undue delay in the lati
tude where the zone of calms is laid down in the diagram.
Neither does the Chart published by the Board of Trade show
any such calms extending across the Atlantic, but represents
them rather as confined to the immediate neighbourhood of the
Western Islands.     Further east, under the same latitude, we
find a very marked preponderance of north-easterly winds; and
further west, south-westerly winds seem to establish themselves,
even in a lower latitude. The chart shows this, and the extracts
of logs given in the “Sailing Directions’ (vol.    pp. 156-340)                                 ii.

of fact the unanimous testimony of reliable witnesses is strongly

that excessive dryness or of the easterly winds which Maury

9th [June 1791] we had reached the latitude 19° 47'   lon                       of             S.,

Trinidada and Martin Was.     The wind now permitted our steer

pic of Cancer [on the 12th] the wind became very variable, as
well in point of strength as in direction, so that on the 28th
we had only advanced to the latitude of 31° 56' S.,     -

     Isubmit, then, that there are well-founded reasons for be
lieving that in the South Atlantic, as in the North, the general
tendency        of the atmospheric currents is to circle round a central
region in which calms and irregular winds prevail, and that
in neither the South nor the North Atlantic is there any zone or
belt of such calms extending over the whole width of the ocean.
   In the Pacific the steady winds from the south-west down the
coast of Chili or Peru, and from the north-west down the coast
of California—winds which in both hemispheres veer through
the bearing of their respective poles towards east, till on ap
proaching the equator and at some distance from the coast they
become the regular trades—seem at first to point to the conclu
sion that the atmosphere there also moves round in a pair of
                     I
circles; but have no evidence which will confirm such an idea
by the completion of the circles on the western side of that vast
ocean or over the continent of Asia. It would be foreign to my
present purpose to enter into the peculiar nature of the winds
that blow as well in the Western Pacific as in the Indian Ocean;
but a very cursory examination will suggest that the same cause
which produces the monsoons—which                              is,

to divert the trades from their   regular  course—may     also    strong           be
enough       prevent their recurving

 the internal radius and the easternal
radius), so that A B is a half-side of
the given polygon. Bisect O B in C;

      which brings into close connexion the theory of electricity
and of magnetism with that of light and of radiant heat.          have                                              I
found that the   electrodynamic    actions of galvanic  currents may
be explained by assuming that the action of one electrical mass
on the rest is not instantaneous, but is propagated to them with
a constant velocity which, within the limits of errors of observa
tion, is equal to that of light.    On this assumption, the differen
tial equation for the propagation of the electrical force is the same
as that for the propagation of light and of radiant heat.

currents but not moved towards each other; let e be an electrical

different functions, the specific heat of perfect gases under con
stant pressure may be resolved, namely the heat of expansion,
the heat of molecular motion, and the heat of atomic motion, are
to each other in the constant ratio 2 : 3: n, where n denotes the
number of atoms contained in one molecule.      But since the heat
of expansion is expended in the performance of external work,
the total thermal content of a gas is represented by the      viva                                                vis

                                   of the Electrical Current.                                           383
agree  in many respects. The present research has the object of
calling attention to such an agreement.     will endeavour at the         I
outset, for the sake of the connexion, once more to solve a pro
blem, though in a different manner, which, from the researches
of Messrs. Thomson, Clausius, Holtzmann, Quintus Icilius and
others, has long been considered settled.         -
   When a hydro-electrical current has become constant, there
must be a constant compensation in the motor in order to keep
it up; and if the current performs neither external nor perma
ment internal work, but only developes heat, this heat is the
equivalent of the compensation.      In homogeneous batteries
(such, that is to say, as are only distinguished by the number
and magnitude of the elements united), in the solution of each
atom of zinc (or when each atom of the electropositive      body
changes       its
            condition) the same process    repeated.  Hence the       is
compensation, like the development      heat,         cases pro  of             is   in   all
portional    the consumption
               to               zinc, and          of

In     heterogeneous      batteries dissimilar processes take place                                 in   the
solution      of   each atom      zinc.; and for this we have

   If the consumption of zinc and the vis viva of mn elements
joined as a battery are to be greater than those of mn isolated
elements, each of which has the resistance A, m must be greater
than n. The vis viva and consumption of zinc of a battery
attains a maximum if n=1, but a minimum if m=1.           It fol
lows  by no means from this that the actions to be  produced  by
a battery attain simultaneously their maximum or their minimum.
This depends upon the distribution of vis viva between motor
and conductor.
   While L has a constant value in the case of a battery closed
without an interpolar,                P=        º is      variable,       and hence the action
on the conductor must also be variable.      The impact of a moving
body exhibits a similar difference in action if the         viva    con                     vis         is
stant but the velocity variable; and therefore,           investigating                on
this problem, results are                            be

note an action which depends only on the consumption. What
ever be the internal process in the motor and conductor, the
action perceived is quantitatively viewed as if a motor had ex
erted an impact on the conductor and both had behaved like
completely inelastic bodies.    Something in common both pro
cesses must have; and this testifies strongly to the actual presence
of a vis viva, and of an acceleration whereby, owing to the resist
ance, the accelerated motion would soon be constant.       The pre
ceding seems to indicate that an increase of cells produces more
powerful impacts, while an increase of the plates increases the
quickness of their succession but not the intensity of the indi
vidual impulses, so that there would be an analogy to red and
violet light. So long, however, as there are no further reasons,
this notion remains a rather vague hypothesis.

the charges acquired is either when one or other of them is so
strong as to cause sparks to pass across some of the separating air
spaces, or to throw the drops of water out of their proper course
and cause them to fall outside the receiver through which they
ought to pass. It is curious, after commencing with no electricity
except a feeble charge in one of the jars, only discoverable by a
delicate electrometer, to see in the course of a few minutes a
somewhat rapid succession of sparks pass in some part of the ap
paratus, or to see the drops of water scattered about over the lips
of one or both the receivers.

recently brought before the Royal Society by Mr. C. W. Siemens
and Professor Wheatstone, and mathematically                    investigated by
Professor Clerk Maxwell. Indeed it was from the fundamental
principle of this electromagnetic system that the reciprocal part
of the electrostatic arrangement occurred to me recently. The
particular form of self-acting electrophorus condenser now de
scribed,    I first constructed many years ago.            I  may take this op
 portunity of describing an application of it to illustrate a very
 important fundamental part of electric theory.                  I hope soon to
 communicate to the Royal Society a description of some other
 experiments which       I made seven years ago on the same subject,
and which      I  hope now to be able to prosecute further.
     Using only a single inductor and a single receiver, as shown in
fig. 1, let the inductor be put in metallic communication with a
 metal vessel or cistern whence the water flows; and let the receiver
be put in communication with a delicate electroscope or electro
meter.      If the lining of the cistern and the inner metallic surface
of the inductor be different metals, an electric effect is generally
found to accumulate in the receiver and electrometer.                   Thus, for
 instance, if the inner surface of the inductor be dry polished zinc,
 and the vessel of water above be of copper, the receiver acquires a
 continually increasing charge of negative electricity. There is
 little or no effect, either positive or negative, if the inductor present
 a surface of polished copper to the drops where they break from
 the continuous water above; but if the copper surface be oxidized
 by the heat of a lamp, until, instead of a bright metallic surface
 of copper, it presents a slate-coloured surface of oxide of copper
to the drops, these become positively electrified, as is proved by a
continually increasing positive charge exhibited
by the electrometer.         When the inner surface
of the inductor is of bright metallic colour,
either zinc or copper, there seems to be little
difference in the effect whether it be wet with
water or quite dry; also          I have not found a
considerable difference produced by lining the
inner surface of the inductor with moist or
dry paper. Copper filings falling from a copper
funnel and breaking away from contact in the
middle of a zinc inductor, in metallic commu
nication with a copper funnel, as shown in fig.
4, produces a rapidly increasing negative charge
in a small insulated can catching them below.

results.    Its sensibility is such that it gives a deflection of 100
scale-divisions (fºr of an inch each) on either side of zero, as the
effect of a single cell of Daniell's; the focusing, by small concave
mirrors supplied to me by Mr. Becker, being so good that a deflec
tion can easily be read with accuracy to a quarter of a scale-division.
By adopting Peltier's method of a small magnetic needle attached
to the electric moveable body (or “needle"), and by using fixed
steel magnets outside the instrument to give directing force (in
 stead of the glass-fibre suspension       of the divided-ring electro
meters described in the articles referred to), and by giving a mea
surable motion by means of a micrometer screw to one of the
quadrants,    I have a few weeks ago succeeded in making this        in
strument into an independent electrometer, instead of a mere elec
troscope, or an electrometer in virtue of a separate gauge electro
meter, as in the Kew recording atmospheric electrometer, described
in the Royal Institution lecture.
    Reverting to the arrangement described above of a copper vessel
 of water discharging water in drops from a nozzle through an        in
 ductor of zinc in metallic connexion with the copper, let the re
 ceiver be connected with a second inductor, this inductor insulated;
 and let a second nozzle, from an uninsulated stream of water, dis
 charge drops through it to a second receiver.      Let this second re
 ceiver be connected with a third inductor used to electrify a third
 stream of water to be caught in a third receiver, and so on. We
 thus have an ascending scale of electrophorus action analogous
to the beautiful mechanical electric multiplier of Mr. C. F. Warley,
with which, by purely electrostatic induction, he obtained a rapid
 succession of sparks from an ordinary single voltaic element. This
result is easily obtained by the self-acting arrangement now de
 scribed, with the important modification in the voltaic element
 according to which no chemical action is called into play, and work
 done by gravity is substituted for work done by the combination
 of chemical elements.

    The following communications were read       :-
    1. “The Alps and the Himalayas: a Geological Comparison.”
  By Henry B. Medlicott, Esq., A.B., F.G.S.
    Current opinions on Alpine geology were first fully discussed by
 the author, especially as regards the abnormal nature of the actual
 boundary of the Molasse with the rocks of the higher Alps, including
 the explanation usually given of this phenomenon and of the con
 tortion of the inner zone of Molasse—namely, the direct upheaval of
 the main mountain-mass.        Mr. Medlicott then described some of

        Mr. H. B. Medlicott     on the   Alps and Himalayas.       397
the sections exposed on the south flank of the Himalayas, and sug
gested a parallelism between them and those exhibited in the Alps.
The clays, sands, and conglomerates of the Sivaliks are very like.
those of the Molasse; and in both regions the coarser deposits pre
vail towards the top. In the Himalayas also the younger Tertiary
deposits almost invariably dip towards the mountain-range which
they fringe, the plane of contact inclining in the same direction,
and thus producing actual, though not parallel, superposition of the
older rocks.   All the arguments which have been used to prove
prodigious faulting in the case of the Alps would therefore, the
author stated, be quite as applicable to that of the Himalayas. But,
as regards the latter range, Mr. Medlicott brought forward evidence
which appeared to him sufficient to prove that the present contact
of the Sivalik formation with the mountains is the original one,
modified only by pressure, without relative vertical displacement,
and that the sinking of the mountain-mass is the proximate cause
of the contortions of the Tertiary strata.   He then endeavoured to
show that this explanation is equally applicable to the Alps, espe
cially as it seems also to account for collateral phenomena which
appear difficult of explanation consistently with the ordinary hypo
thesis; and he concluded by discussing the current theories of the
formation of lake-basins, in relation to the more immediate subject
of his paper.
   2. “On some striking Instances of the Terminal Curvature of
Slaty Laminae in West Somerset.” By D. Mackintosh, Esq., F.G.S.
   Whilst engaged in investigating the nature and extent of oceanic
and atmospheric denudation, and the origin of superficial accumula
tions in the West of England, the author observed, on the nearly
level floor of one of the valleys which indent the Quantock hills, the
laminae of Devonian (Carboniferous?) Slate, very regularly and
distinctly bent backwards towards the south.
   Sections near Wiveliscombe exhibited some interesting instances
of the curvature of the laminae, the line of demarcation between the
commencement of the curving back and the undisturbed mass of
slate below being remarkably distinct and straight along the strike
of the cleavage; but at right angles to the strike, the surface formed
by the edges of the laminae beneath, though as distinctly marked, is
very uneven.
   At Raleigh's Cross other instances of the curvature are seen.
The most important fact in connexion with the sections was thus
stated:—the bending and curving back over extensive areas has
taken place on perfectly level ground, with a declivity instead of an
elevation on the side whence the movement must have come.
   An exaggerated continuation of the general curving back is seen at
Gupworthy, which at first sight appeared to be part of a denuded
anticlinal fold. Instances have also been exposed in a cutting of
the Exeter and South Devon Railway near Plymouth.
   In all partsof Devon, West Somerset, and Cornwall,      if not in all
districts where the slates are flewible, and where the cleavage-lamine

   398                       Geological  Society:-
    dip at a considerable angle to the south, or where they are vertical,
   with an approximately east and west strike, similar appearances
    might be discovered, irrespective of the outline and inclination of
   the ground.
       In the author's opinion the curving back of the slaty laminae in
   this district must have been produced by a great weight of solid
   matter propelled in a southerly direction.

      The following communications were read:—
       1. “On Cyclocyathus, a new genus of the Cyathophyllidea, with
   remarks on the genus Aulophyllum.”       By P. Martin Duncan, M.B.,
   Sec. G.S., and James Thomson, Esq.
      A careful examination of a large series of sections and weathered
   specimens of Corals from near the base of the Carboniferous series
  at Lesmahago &c., which have hitherto been referred to the genus
  Aulophyllum, E. & H., has convinced the authors that A. fungites
  and A. Bowerbanki must be referred to a new genus, which they
  propose to name Cyclocyathus. It differs from Aulophyllum in having
  a more or less essential columella of a very complicated structure,
  while that genus was described by its authors as devoid of any
  such structure.     One form in the series of specimens examined by
  Dr. Duncan and Mr. Thomson exhibited no columella, and the space
  which would otherwise have been occupied by it was covered in by
  successive tabulae; they therefore referred it to Aulophyllum, under
  the name of A. Edwardsi.
      2. “On the discovery of a new Pulmonate Mollusk (Conulus
 priscus, P. P. Carpenter) in the Coal-formation       of Nova Scotia.”
 By    J. W. Dawson, LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.
      Some crushed specimens of the little shell described in this paper
 were found in a bed of clay, associated with numerous individuals of
 Pupa vetusta, between coals No. 37 and No. 38 of the Joggins
 section, during a search undertaken for the purpose of discovering,
 if possible, traces of land-animals in addition to the Pupa already
 known. On submitting these specimens to Dr. P. P. Carpenter,
 they were referred by him to the group Conulus, a subgenus of
 Zonites; and he has added to Dr. Dawson's paper a description of
 the characters which they present.
     3. “On some tracks of Pteraspis (?) in the Upper Ludlow Sand
 stone.”     By J. W. Salter, Esq., A.L.S., F.G.S.
     Impressions upon two slabs discovered by Mr. R. Banks in the
Downton or Upper Ludlow Sandstones of Kington, Herefordshire,
were described by Mr. Salter as the tracks of Pteraspid fish.       His  .
reasons for assigning this origin to the imprints were partly based
upon their character, and partly on the fact that the Pteraspis was
the only known creature of the period capable of making the im

endowed with stiff defences to their pectoral or ventral fins. Whether
the Pteraspis possessed such defences he was not aware, though he

old Tertiary quartzose trachytes and pearlstones, on which repose
extensive agglomeratic and tufaceous deposits (clays, sands, and
lignite bands); these are succeeded by thick-bedded calcareo-arena
ceous strata,   the whole broken through by Dolerites, which in
their turn are covered by sand, clays, and thin limestones, probably
of Pliocene age.

   From a detailed examination and analysis of the rocks composing
the Malvern Hills, with a view to the determination of the chemico
physical       processes which     have      contributed to their formation,         Mr.
Timins has arrived at the following general conclusions in regard to
those rocks of eruptive origin:-(1) that, in the intrusive trap-rocks,
the ratio of the oxygen of the silica to that of all the bases taken
together, varies progressively from 5:4 to nearly 2: 1; (2) that the
relative proportions of the several bases vary considerably in different
rocks, and often characterize particular localities; (3) that the che
mical composition of the eruptive rocks does not vary according to
their age; (4) that the atomic proportion of the silica to the bases
is generally highest in the largest masses of trap, and lowest in the
smallest masses; (5) that in the same masses of trap there is an
appreciable increase in the silica towards their centres, and that the
primary source of         all
                      the trap-rocks     the Malvern Hills was nearly
                                                   in
a  bisilicate, which, during the various processes by which             has     it
been brought          the surface, has become united more
                     to                                           less withor

of St. Catherine's, Brazil.” By Edward Thornton, Esq.
   The existence of Coal in this district has for many years been an
established fact; but no practical exploration had been made until
the years 1861–63, when Viscount Barbacena, having purchased a
tract of land containing the best seams, ascertained the existence of
a series of coal-beds at nine different levels, underlying a sandstone
formation, horizontally disposed, and varying in thickness from 14
to 10 feet. Analyses of specimens of the coal prove it to be of good
quality,    profitable working depending solely upon the facilities for
                its
transport.

power of contraction. A coagulation, on the other hand, could never
disappear instantaneously.
   (7) Making a series of experiments on the same muscle, by
heating it several times successively to the point of zero work and
then cooling, I have observed that the greatest ordinate, that in
which the mechanical force ceases to increase or to diminish, ap
peared in the next experiment at a lower temperature.         I have found
that this phenomenon is caused by the remarkable fact that the
muscle is more rapidly exhausted at a higher than at a lower
temperature.     This I proved by putting to work two muscles of
the same  weight   (as nearly as possible) under the same tension and
the same  irritation, but at different temperatures. At the commence
ment the ordinates at the higher temperature were then always greater

dications of the instrument may thus be corrected by calculation,
and reduced to what they would have been if the thermometer had
been surrounded by air under a pressure of 760 millims.
    I think I may assume that, when this correction is made, the num
ber of degrees above zero indicated by the thermometer gives a very
approximate measure of the intensity of the direct solar radiation.
    Observations made at Geneva.—A series of observations made
at Geneva has shown me that the moisture of the atmosphere influ
ences the direct solar radiation; in general, the more aqueous vapour
there is in the air the less is the radiation.    I will limit myself to
adducing some examples.
    Comparing the small number of observations which I have been
able to make in winter with those of summer, we see that with equal
radiation the height of the sun above the horizon was considerably
greater in summer than in winter.
    On several occasions a stronger radiation has been observed during
dry than during moist weather, although the atmosphere was un
doubtedly purer and more transparent in the second case than in the
first.   The presence, then, of solid or of liquid particles diffused in
the air is insufficient to account for variations in the solar radia
tion.
    With virtually equal solar heights the minima of radiation corre
spond to days on which the tension of aqueous vapour was strongest,
 and the maxima of radiation to the dryest weather (during or imme
 diately after strong north winds). Thus, for solar heights greater than
 60°, the minimum temperature was 14°82 on the 2nd of last June,
 the tension of aqueous vapour being 14 millims., after a series of moist
 days: it indicated a maximum of 15°-93 on the 10th of July, on the
 day after a strong north wind during which the temperature sank
 to 7°, and after a series of exceptionally dry and cold days.
    Yet as these variations are not great, while fog exerts also an
 undoubted influence, it would be very interesting to have a long
 series of observations, the means of which would enable us to de
 termine the exact relation between the moisture of the atmosphere
 and the intensity of the direct solar radiation.
     The radiation is remarkably constant while the sun is at a great
 height above the horizon, and when the atmospheric conditions remain
 almost the same.       Thus observations made between 11.30 A.M. and
  1.30 P.M., the sun being more than 60° above the horizon, the sky
 clear, the tension of aqueous vapour 8 to 11 millims., excepting the
 case of strong north winds, have regularly given radiations comprised
 between 15°.31 and 15°59.        It may thus be assumed that the num
 ber 15°-5 represents the solar radiation of Geneva under these cir
 cumstances.
     Observations at different heights.-The frequency of clouds on
 mountains renders it difficult to make observations at different
 heights; and thus I have only been able to make an inconsiderable
 number of them. Yet particularly in an ascent of Mont Blanc, on
  the 20th and 21st of July last, during exceptionally fine weather, I
  obtained results which, if I am not deceived, possess some interest.

406             Intelligence and Miscellaneous          Articles.
   Let us first take the observations made with the sun at a height of
more than 60° above the horizon.
   On the 20th and 21st of July, the state of the atmosphere being
just that at which, as I have before said, the radiation at Geneva
was 15°5 of my actinometer, this number may be admitted for a
height of 400 metres above the sea-level”. On the 20th of July, at
the Glacier des Bossons, a height of 2500 metres, the thermometer of
the actinometer indicated 18°63. On the 21st of July, at 11.30 A.M.,
on the top of Mont Blanc, the thermometer of the actinometer marked
21° 13. These observations, being made under different atmospheric
pressures, should be reduced to what they would have been had the
thermometer been surrounded by air under a pressure of 760 millims.
To render the results more comparable, the atmospheric thickness
must in each case be calculated (product of the barometric height by
 the secant of the zenith-distance of the sun),

    It follows from these numbers, first, that under the observed con
 ditions the ratio of the intensity of solar radiation on Mont Blane to
 that at Geneva is about 3. Thus the solar heat which has reached a
 height of 4800 metres through the upper layers of the atmosphere
 undergoes an absorption of in traversing the lower layers of the
 atmosphere to a height of 400 metres under an angle of 60° to 65°.
    It will be observed, in the second place, that the increase of the
 radiation with the height is less rapid than the diminution of baro
 metric pressure, and than the diminution of the atmospheric thick
 ness. Taking the atmospheric thicknesses for abscissae, and the cor
 rected radiations as ordinates, three points are obtained representing
 the above three observations. If a curve be drawn through these
 three points, it will be seen to be concave towards the axis of the
 abscissaet.   This result is contrary to that which may be deduced
    * It may perhaps be thought that, instead of adopting this figure, it
 would have been better to make simultaneous observations at the foot of

 the mountain; but, apart from the difficulty of this, imagine measure
 ments made in a narrow valley like that of Chamouni present fewer gua
 rantees of accuracy.
    t By prolonging this curve indefinitely, the point where it cuts the
 ordinate axis would correspond to the radiation for zero thickness.             The
 number thus obtained would be about         20°5,   and would  represent    the  in

Brienzº.
     I
     will further add two results flowing from observations made
when the heights of the sun above the horizon were lower.
   With equal atmospheric thickness the radiation at a greater height
is undoubtedly stronger than at a lower height.       Thus on the 20th
of July, at 5.30 P.M., on the Grands Mulets (3000 metres), the atmo
spheric thickness being 1500, the corrected radiation was 15°26.
Now at Geneva, even under the most favourable circumstances, it
scarcely reaches 14°.      An observation made in winter on Mont
Salem confirms this   result, which is also opposed to what Mr. Forbes
had found.
   The diminution of the intensity of the radiation with the diminu
tion of the height of the sun above the horizon is considerably less
strong at a great height than on the plain; so that the ratio of the
radiation observed at a higher station to that observed at a lower
one is greater in the morning and evening than in the middle of the
day.—Comptes Rendus, September 23, 1867.

  4. In order that    the acquired uniformity may be attained, changes
should be made in     existing names when it can be done without great
inconvenience.
    Names like Quartz, Garnet, Gypsum, Realgar, Orpiment, with
 the names of the metals and gems, which are part of general lite
rature, must remain unaltered.       Mica and Felspar, equally old with
 Quartz, have become the names of groups of minerals, and are no
longer applied to particular species.
    Fluor was written Fluorite last century by Napione.          Blende,
 although one of the number that might be allowed to stand among
 the exceptions, has already given place with some mineralogists to
 Sphalerite, a name proposed by Haidinger (because blende was ap
plied also to other species) in 1845, and signifying deception, like
Blende.     Galena was written Galenite by von Kobell some years
since. Orthoclase, Loxoclase, Oligoclase might be rightly lengthened
to Orthoclasite, &c.     But the termination clase (from the Greek for
fracture) is peculiar to names of minerals, and the abbreviated form
in use may be allowed to stand for species of the Felspar group.
 It seems better that it be avoided elsewhere. These remarks on
special cases might be further extended; but it is unnecessary, as                                            I
shall soon present my views more fully in another place.
    There are, of course, objections to all such change. But the num
ber of names requiring it are comparatively few ; and hardly any of
them are over sixty years old, a short time compared with the future
of the science.    Mineralogy is yet in       formative period;

But what saved me was the importance I early attached to facts.
In reading Mrs. Marcet's book on chemistry, I took care to
prove every assertion by the little experiments which I made as far
as my means permitted; and the enjoyment which             found in            I
thus  verifying  the exactitude of the facts contributed essentially
to give me a taste for chemical knowledge. You may therefore
easily imagine the pleasure                   I
                                   experienced when    subsequently        I
made the   personal   acquaintance   of Mrs.  Marcet,  and how de
lighted I was when my thoughts went backward to contemplate
in her at once the past and the present. Whenever         presented            I
her with a   copy  of  my memoirs,                   I
                                       took care to add that sent                       I

structress.”
     “I  have the same sentiments towards the memory of your
 own    father,”  adds Faraday; “for he was,                          I
                                                       may say, the first
who encouraged and sustained me, first at Geneva when had                               I
 the pleasure of seeing him there, and afterwards by the corre
spondence which I regularly maintained with him.”
    Faraday here alludes to a journey in which he accompanied
 Davy to Geneva in 1814, and in which, during a stay which he
 made with his illustrious master at my father's, the latter quickly
 discerned the merits of the young assistant, and formed relations
 with him which were interrupted only by death.               At the time
 when he travelled with      Davy,   Faraday   was his assistant at the
 Royal Institution in London; and I must say that he has more
 than once expressed to me, both by letter and viva voce, his
 thankfulness to the eminent chemist, who had admitted him to
one of his courses, and consented, after running through the
 notes of this course prepared by the young pupil, to take him
for his assistant. ,

                                           Faraday, with the exception
of  rare and short absences, never again quitted the Royal Insti
tution, where       he
                     had his laboratory and his residence.         Married
to a   lady worthy      him, and who shared and understood

of his character, the active benevolence which he displayed in
his relations with others, gained him general esteem and affec
 tion. Always ready to render services, he could quit his labo
 ratory when his presence elsewhere was necessary to a friend or
 useful to humanity. We see him putting his knowledge under
 contribution both for inquiries upon questions of public health
 or industrial applications, and to give practical advice to an ar
 tisan or examine the discovery of a débutant in the scientific
 career.   Only, as I have already said, with these exceptions, he
 made it a rule not to allow himself to be turned aside from the
labours to which he had consecrated his life by occupations of
another kind, or by those pretended duties of society which waste
time, abridge intellectual life (already so short), and very often
leave nothing behind them but emptiness and regret.           It was
not that he could not be eminently sociable when necessary, or
that he did not allow himself some relaxations when, fatigued
with work, he needed some repose.         But these were only acci
dental circumstances in his life, which was so exclusively devoted
to his laboratory.
    The scientific career of Faraday was equally fortunate and
complete.      Named as early as 1823 a correspondent of the
Academy of Sciences of Paris, he was called in 1844 by this same
Academy to occupy one of                       its
                                 eight foreign Associateships, after
having been associated successively with         the learned bodies      all
of   Europe and America.      He was           means insensibleby       no                             to
these scientific honours, which       accepted with genuine satis

tubes, from which it appeared that the velocity of the flow of
elastic fluids does not depend upon their density alone, but also
upon their individual nature. Various other points of chemistry
and physics, besides those which had electricity and magnetism
for their object, attracted his attention from time to time through
out the whole of his scientific career.     Now we have a note upon
the combustion of the      diamond;    then an investigation of the
sounds   produced   by  the combustion of gases, or by the super
position of a strongly heated iron rod upon a mass of copper at
the ordinary temperature (Trevelyan's experiment); and then,
again, researches upon the limit of vaporization, or upon the
evaporation of mercury at low temperatures.          We may notice
two   important   memoirs—one      upon   the explanation  of certain
optical illusions produced by bodies in motion, the other de

for the production of the gas, and plunging the other extremity
in a freezing-mixture. The gas, evolved in a closed space, spee
dily condensed into a liquid state in the refrigerated extremity of
the tube. In this way chlorine, sulphurous acid, sulphuretted
hydrogen, carbonic acid, protoxide of nitrogen, cyanogen, am

we ought to speak of certain of Faraday's theoretical ideas rela
ting to general physics, and more especially to the nature of the
forces, and their correlation to each other and to the essence
of matter; but we prefer not to discuss the opinions emitted
by him upon these questions until after the exposition of his
works on electricity and magnetism. We must, however, at
once admit that his views on these matters are very contestable,
and that, if they inspired him to make experimental researches
of the highest interest, this is a proof that, in the hands of a
man of genius, even a bad theory may be the origin of the most
beautiful discoveries,
                                                           II.
     I pass now to the examination of those works of Faraday which
relate to electricity  and magnetism.         It is not without embarrass
ment that        I
               approach   this examination;      for these researches are so
numerous that it would be necessary to extend this notice beyond
all bounds       order
                     in     give only to   simple analysis      a them; and               of
they are       the same time
              at                    varied,   that  so     impossible        exit   is                     to

                     in                           their publication without

confusion being the result. Thus, for example, the researches
 on induction are interrupted          others             by
                                                     electrochemical decom on
positions,       to       be
                    afterwards resumed and completed.               Each me
moir   certainly  forms     complete    whole;      but one  memoir       most                           is

  Faraday sometimes had doubts upon this point, and that he even
  thought that water could conduct electricity without being de
  composed.        Now experiment shows that in              cases, even those              all

that the  quantity  of chemical action exerted by an electrical cur
rent is proportionate to the quantity of electricity constituting
this current, and, further, that the same quantity of electricity,

the same quantity       water.   The quantity

424                     Prof. A. de la Rive's Memoir   of
chemical theory.    This theory, foreseen by Wollaston and Fa
broni, but opposed by most of the physicists of the early part of
the present century, had found a powerful argument in its favour
in the beautiful experiments of the elder Becquerel upon the
electricity developed by chemical actions.    It was then (from
1825 to 1835) that, profiting by these experiments, and seeking,
on my own part, to make others of the same kind although in a
                                   I
slightly different direction, published several memoirs to sup
port and render more precise the chemical theory of the voltaic
                 I
pile. But cannot but admit that we are indebted to Faraday
for having based this theory upon irrefutable proofs, not only by
the great number and variety of his researches, but especially by
his beautiful discovery of the definite decomposing action of the
electric current—a discovery which established between the ex
ternal chemical action of the voltaic pile and the chemical action
which takes place in the interior of this apparatus, a relation so
intimate that it is impossible not to see in the latter the cause of
the former.

     In   1831           discovered electrical induction; it is the
                     Faraday
most important, although perhaps not the most brilliant of his
discoveries.   Ten years before (in 1821) he had observed a per
fectly new phenomenon in the science of electrodynamics,       that
science which issued complete, as we may say, from the brain of
Ampère, after (Ersted’s discovery.     Struck by the experiments
of the  great French   physicist  upon the mutual attractions and
repulsions of electrical currents and magnets, Faraday was led,
by theoretical ideas which were rather disputable and not very
conformable to the principles of mechanics, to assume that an
electric current must turn round the pole of a magnet with a
continuous movement, and reciprocally that the pole of a magnet
must in like manner turn round an electric current.     He verified
this double result by experiment; and Ampère soon showed               its
accordance with his theory, adding            to
                                               other facts

nature.        It not the less true that the discovery

of any such action        physics.

   Arago (in 1824) was the first who directly established this re
lation,    by
            his beautiful discovery       of
                                          magnetism     by rotation; for
he   showed that simple mechanical movement could render               a
body,     itself non-magnetic, capable
          in                                  acting upon the magnet.

     I now  pass to the last great series of Faraday’s works.                                        I
have  said,  and,   I
                    think, proved, that induction was the most
important of his discoveries;               I
                                 must now say that the action of
magnetism and electricity upon light was the most brilliant.
Often the attempt had been made to see whether magnetism
and electricity exerted any direct influence upon light; but
these attempts had always failed.    Investigators had operated
upon luminous rays travelling in the air or in liquids, and en
deavoured to act upon them, sometimes by strong magnets,
sometimes by electric currents or by statical electricity; but
these attempts had led to nothing, absolutely nothing.        All
these negative investigations have never been published, but they
have nevertheless been made.
   Guided by theoretical considerations upon the mutual cor
relation of the forces of nature, Faraday, after many fruitless
attempts, succeeded in finding the connexion which exists be
tween light and the magnetic and electric forces.              Instead of
taking an ordinary ray, he operated with a polarized ray; instead
of acting directly upon this ray by means of a magnet, he sub
mits it to the influence of magnetism whilst it is traversing a
glass prism in the direction of                 its
                                          length. This prism, termi

interruption of the current which magnetized the electromagnet.
The action of magnetism therefore consists simply in causing
the plane of polarization to turn by a certain angle, and to give
artificially to the glass, while it is under the magnetic influence,
a property which certain substances, such as quartz and essence
of turpentine, possess naturally.
     Any transparent substance, except gases, may serve, although
 in different degrees, as the medium for magnetism to act upon
 the polarized ray.         But that by means of which this influence
 is best manifested is the yellowish heavy glass (borosilicate of
 lead) which Faraday obtained in his experimental                       researches
 upon the fabrication of glass for optical purposes.                He happened
 to have at hand several specimens of this glass; and it was by
 using one of these for performing the experiment just described
 that he discovered the magnetic rotation of the plane of polari
 zation, a phenomenon which would probably have escaped him
 if he had made use of ordinary glass at first starting. Thus the
 long and painful labours to which he had formerly devoted him
  self without any great success, in order to discover a glass fitted
  for the fabrication of lenses, were not lost to science, since they
  facilitated his enriching it with one of his finest discoveries.
      Let us now study the new phenomenon a little more closely,
  so as better to show         all      its
                                      importance. Some substances, we
  have said, naturally possess the property               causing the plane
                                                                   of                                   of

   Thus, whilst in substances naturally endowed with circular
polarization the rotation of the plane of polarization always takes
place, according to the nature of the substance, either to the
right or left of the observer, in Faraday’s experiment the direc
tion of this rotation only depends upon the direction of electric
currents or the relative position of the magnetic poles, since it
is completely independent of the position of the observer. These
two kinds of action are therefore not identical, and we cannot
say that by the influence of the magnet or of electricity we pro
duce in      all
             transparent bodies exactly the same property that
certain substances maturally possess.         Faraday well shows this
difference       by     an
                   experiment  which consists          producing              in                            by    an

     In  the numerous researches which Faraday devoted (from

 in a perfectly satisfactory manner, with the laws which govern
 magnetism and diamagnetism. Subsequently Tyndall succeeded
 also in demonstrating, by a decisive experiment, that diamag
 netism, like magnetism, is due to a polarity caused by the influ
 ence of the magnet in the diamagnetic body, but with this dif
 ference, that, instead of opposite poles, homonymous poles are
 developed by the poles of the magnet.         Thus fell to the ground
  all the other more        less rash attempts
                                          or         explanation which              at

    Another point which deserves attention            the investigation              is
which Faraday made             the magnetism and diamagnetism

magnetic and diamagnetic bodies, and upon the possible relation
between gravity and electricity.         In 1850 Faraday reverted to
this question, which he had previously attempted but without
success. We see that it is with regret that he is obliged to re
linquish the discovery of this relation, which he had twice sought
after; but with his usual good faith he admits that, although
convinced that it exists, he was unable to find any fact to esta

         science.
   The first character that strikes us       their number. What              is
Faraday published          the form    in
                                        memoirs from 1820     of   1855                              to             is
incredible. And what would           have been      side
                                                       it   side with the       if,         by
multitude            of
                 experiments which         has made known, we placed
                                                                   he
      parallel series those which         never published

in  a                                                                  true                   :      It       is
that  if        he
             has left them buried        his journal,       because    they            it

gave him negative results; but from how many fruitless essays
and erroneous attempts                           he
                                  would have preserved scientific men
if he had not been so discreet                          !           -
    A  second character        the exactitude of the results obtained:
                                            is
I    donot think that Faraday has once been caught               mistake;                     in    a
so  precise and conscientious was his mode            experimenting and           of
observing.         mustIt    admitted that  be   him the hand marvel         in
lously seconded the head;            was     remarkable dexterity, and
                                                        he             of

                   have no doubt, will always be regarded as
corner-stones in the new edifice which we are now endeavouring
to construct.
     I designedly say, which we are endeavouring to construct; for
we must    carefully avoid thinking that it is already constructed.
Since the fine discovery of the mechanical equivalent of heat, it
seems as if everything had been said and everything were easily
explained by means simply of a ponderable matter, an imponde
rable aether, and a mechanical impulse. Vulgarizers of science,
more anxious to produce an effect than to remain faithful to sci
entific truth, proclaim a molecular system of the world destined
to form a pendant to the Mécanique Céleste of Laplace. Accord
ing to them, nothing is more simple, nothing clearer; attraction
itself, which has been the object of the study of so many superior
minds, is merely the effect of an impulse easy to understand.                                         A
dangerous illusion     which, if it succeeded in propagating itself,
would be as fatal to the true progress of science as opposed to
 itsuseful diffusion; for        especially upon those who take

              LV.    On the Spectrum of the Bessemer-flame.

         HEOctober Number of the Philosophical Magazine contains
        translations of two papers by Professor Lielegg, giving the
results of his observations on the spectrum of the Bessemer
flame.    As these results are published as entirely new and no
mention is made of any prior observations, it is only right that
attention should be called to the fact that as long ago as 1862
the same results had been obtained by Professor Roscoe, and
were published in the form of a short preliminary notice in the
‘ Proceedings” of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical
Society for February 24th, 1863. As the note is extremely short,
I  venture to transcribe it in full.
    “Professor Roscoe stated that he had been for some little time,
and is still, engaged in an interesting examination of the spec
trum produced by the flame evolved in the manufacture of cast
steel by the Bessemer process, on the works of Messrs. John
Brown and Co., of Sheffield.      The spectrum of this highly lumi
nous and     peculiar flame exhibits during a certain phase of                                     its
existence     complicated
              a             but most characteristic series      bright               of
lines and dark absorption-bands. Amongst the former the sodium,
lithium, and potassium lines are most conspicuous; but these are
accompanied         bynumber
                         a              of
                                   other, and     yet undetermined,
                                                              as
bright lines; whilst among the absorption-bands those formed
by   sodium-vapour and carbonic oxide can              readily distin

guished. Professor Roscoe expressed his belief that this first
practical application       the spectrum analysis will prove
                                of                                 the                        of

tassium, hydrogen, and nitrogen.
   An important practical result of the observations on which
these communications were based, was the discovery that the
exact point of decarbonization could be determined by means of
the spectroscope with much greater exactitude than from the
appearance of the flame itself, the change in which indicating
the completion of the process is minute and requires a length
ened experience to detect with certainty. This method of deter
mining the point at which it is necessary to stop the blast was
indeed at that time (1863) in constant use at Messrs. Brown’s
works at Sheffield, and has since been introduced with equal
success by Mr. Ramsbottom         the suggestion        (at

   The occurrence of absorption-lines in the Bessemer-spectrum is
in itself extremely probable; and that this is the case appears
almost proved by the great intensity of some of the dark lines of
the spectrum.    It was with this view that the investigation was
commenced, with the expectation that the spectrum would prove
to be a compound one, in which the lines of iron, carbon, or car
bonic oxide &c. would be found, some as bright lines, others
reversed as dark absorption-bands.    To a certain extent this an
ticipation has been verified; but the great mass of the lines,                                 in
cluding the brightest in the whole spectrum, have not as yet been
identified.
   In dealing with a complicated spectrum like that of the Bes
semer-flame, it is indispensable that the spectrum should be
actually compared with each separate spectrum of the elements
sought. This was the plan actually pursued; the spectroscope
was so arranged that the spectrum of the Bessemer-flame was
seen in the upper half of the field of view, and the spectrum
with which it was to be compared was seen immediately below.
In no other way can any satisfactory conclusion be obtained as
to the coincidence or non-coincidence of the lines with those of
known spectra.
   The spectrum of the Bessemer-flame was thus compared with
the following spectra:-
   (1) Spectrum of electric discharge in a carbonic-oxide vacuum.
   (2) Spectrum of strong spark between silver poles in air.
   (3)             29             92         iron       35          -
   (4)             32             39         ironpoles in hydrogen.
   (5) Solar  spectrum.
    (6) Carbon spectrum—oxyhydrogen blowpipe supplied with
olefiant gas and oxygen.
   The coincidences observed were, however, but very few, and
totally failed      explain the nature
                       to                                  of

but more commonly a quite different spectrum (fig. 3) is seen,
which reminds one at first of the ordinary carbon-spectrum, but
differs from it very remarkably.
    In the carbon-spectrum, which is drawn (fig. 1), each group
of lines has its strongest member on the left (i.e. less refran
gible), and fades gradually away towards the right hand; in the
spectrum of the spiegel-flame the reverse is the case; each group

      444           Mr.     J.    K. Laughton                  on the       Natural Forces that
      mean for         July at Abousheer, 111°                          as occasional in the Red Sea.
      In Central Australia, according to Captain Sturt, the thermo
      meter rose every day to 1 12° or 116°, and on at least one occa
      sion (on January 21st) to 131° in the shade; and the testimony
      of other explorers is to the same effect. Compared with such
      high temperatures, the 82° of the equator sink into insignifi
      cance; and it is clear that if the expansion of the air by heat pro
     duces a sensible wind, then we must find during the summer
     months a westerly wind prevalent on the coast of Africa between
     the latitudes of 20° and 30° N., between which parallels the
     great Desert is for the most part situated,—as also a south
     easterly wind on the southern coast of Arabia, and a north
     westerly on the north-west coast of Australia. These winds we
     do not find.           I
                      am at present unable to tabulate the winds on
     the Australian coast; but                        I
                                 have before me the star-charts pub
     lished by the Royal Meteorological Institute of Holland, which
     show for the month of January a marked prevalence of winds

 believe that such trifling variations as these, at such a distance
 apart, and on opposite sides of the Himalayas and the high table
 land of Thibet, could produce such very marked results as the
 north-east and south-west monsoons, even if we were to set on
 one side the utter want of dependence that can be placed on com
 parative barometric observations so taken (L'Asie Centrale, vol. i.
 p. 80), and even if Humboldt’s evidence as to fact was not con
 clusive. But since the Himalayas form an actual boundary to
 the monsoon region, the cause of the monsoons is clearly not to
 be sought either on the Gobi or at Barnaul.
   If now we for a few minutes put on one side the theory that these
 constant winds, whether trade-winds or monsoons, are due to the
expansion caused by heat, we cannot but be struck with a certain
remarkable relation between the points to which they tend; these

Atmospheric Changes     which produce Wind and Rain,” called
attention to the great effect which condensation must produce;
but he attributes that effect to the further expansion of the air
by the latent heat made manifest, rather than to the actual loss
of weight, or elastic force, in the atmospheric column. This
view has also been partially adopted in the later editions of the
‘Physical Geography of the Sea, by Captain Maury, who con
siders that the latent heat developed by condensation may give
a further expansion to the tropical air.   It seems to me, on the
contrary, more probable that the effect is produced by the direct
statical agency of diminished pressure, and that the heat evolved
is simply thrown off into space through the very thin and clear
medium of the upper atmosphere.
   Whether this is the case, or not, it is difficult (perhaps impos
sible) to decide; but             I                    I

for believing  that, in whatever way it acts, sudden condensation
of  aqueous  vapour   is the principal cause of the trade-winds, of
their inflection towards the west coast of Africa, and of the
Indian monsoons, in opposition to the theory which would de
rive these winds from the mere expansion of the intertropical
air by heat.

that this definition contains something more than a mere state
ment of the facts determined by observation.                 It contains a hy
pothetical explanation of the facts.
    Let A and B be two particles of matter.                We know experi
mentally that they tend towards each other with a force inversely
as the square of their mutual distance; but the ordinary defini
tion of gravity goes further than this. It not only asserts that
they tend towards each other, but it asserts that this force or
tendency arises from A attracting B, and B attracting A.                       It
asserts that B moves towards A because B is attracted by                                                         it.

pothetical part of the theory with the adage in question that led
Sir Isaac Newton to suggest that gravity might be transmitted
by means of an aethereal medium existing in space.
   Another objection is this: if another particle C be placed be
side B, it will be found that A will attract C with as much force
as it does B, and yet continue to attract B the same as though
C had not been added; and if we add another particle D, this
particle will also be attracted with equal force, the other two
remaining as strongly attracted by A as though D had never
appeared.     We might in like manner go on adding particle to
particle to infinity, and still A would continue to attract each
new particle as it appeared with as much force as though no
other particle were in existence.         In fact there is no limit to this
attracting power of A. This is contrary to what we know of the
character of force in every other department of nature.
   Another objection also follows; when we add C to B and thus
double the attraction, A doubles its force also and attracts them
with as much force as they attract                            added, the at
                                                                     it.       If   D      be

452                Mr.         J.   Croll      on certain           Hypothetical Elements
of what becomes of the motion externally imparted to the stone
when throw nupwards, or where the increase both of attraction
and motion is derived as it descends.     If the attraction theory
be correct, then there is a destruction of force in the one case,
and a creation of force in the other; and if so, then the principle
of conservation of force is violated.
   Professor Brücke tries to answer Faraday’s objections in the
following manner:—“Let the mass A,” he says, “be separated
from the mass B by an external force; while this separation
takes places the attraction diminishes, the attractive forces being
in the inverse ratio of the squares of the distances.        Where
abides the force which is here   destroyed?   The   reply is: If the
mass A be left to itself, it moves back towards B, and when it

energy thus stored up is given back in the form of motion as
before.   To express the matter in more precise terms—when the
stone is thrown up, the vis viva becomes less and less, and when
it reaches the turning-point it is zero. But at this point the
whole energy as a cause of motion is stored up, the     viva                                            vis         is
transformed into tension, actual                                   or   kinetic energy into potential
energy.

to  this theory, both the kinetic and the potential energy decrease
as the stone rises.

454               Mr.   J.   Croll on certain Hypothetical Elements
vity.   No one would for a moment think of denying the correct
ness of this mode of reasoning in regard to heat, magnetism,
electricity, or any other form of force. Why, then, make an ex
ception in the case of gravity ? But more than this, the very
idea of an exception is in itself absurd; it is nothing less than
to make an exception in regard to a principle which we admit
holds universally true.
   To reconcile the common conceptions of gravity with that of
conservation, it has been said that the potential energy of gra
vity does not simply consist in the tendency which bodies have
of approaching to each other, but consists also in the distance
through which that tendency is capable of continuing to act.
For instance, when two bodies approach each other under the
mutual influence of their gravity to one-half their former dis
tance, their potential energies are diminished also to one-half
(although their tendency to approach is not diminished), because
the distance through which that tendency is aow capable of act
ing is but one-half of what it was formerly.
   The energy of a raised weight, for example, it is said is the
product of the gravitation-pull upon                        it,
                                        and the distance through
which this pull can act.

descends and performs work, the pressure               the weight, the                        of
thing which performs the work, increases also.           And when the

 458               Mr.     J.   Croll on certain Hypothetical Elements
 and not a property or quality, the most philosophic way is to say:
 with Faraday *, that the atom is simply a centre of force, and
 what we call matter is simply a power of resistance acting in a
 certain part of space, thus making no hypothetical statement of
 any kind regarding the nature of this cause or power.
    But the hardness or resistance manifested to our experience
 is considered by those who adopt the ordinary theory to be a
 property or quality of a substance, not the effect of a cause. But
 this does not afford any warrant for assuming the existence of
 solid impenetrable atoms.    It will not do to say that there can
 be no resistance without  solidity.  All that we require to affirm
 is that there must be a something possessed of the property or
  quality of resistance—a something which manifests itself as re
  sistance in space.     What we must believe is that there exists a
  substance or subject to which the resistance belongs.
     The necessity for assuming the existence of a something to
  which these properties belong is purely metaphysical.               The me
  taphysical necessity under which we              obliges                lie

                  common      usages,  designate    this unknown quality

The lettered matrix forms (as in the preceding cases) a “conjugate
system [in Cauchy’s sense] of regular substitutions.” The right
hand matrix, interpreting + and — to mean plus and minus
units, is a direct and inverse orthogonal matrix corresponding to
8 represented as 2.2.2; the lines produced by the term-to-term
multiplication of the three matrices gives the quantities A, B, C,
D, L, M, N, P, which satisfy the equation
                                         XA*=(Xa”)2(a”),
and the term-to-term product of the two matrices actually above
written is an orthogonal matrix of the 8th order.

as such in the Nouvelles Annales for January of this year#.

where 9 is the total number of times that p undergoes a change within the
same interval,—such change being always even, on account of the two ter
minals of the G series being both positive—the one extremity being a positive
constant, and the other the square off. This change, however, is sometimes
additive and sometimes ablative, q, not necessarily increasing always (as p
does) on ascending from a to b; thus the two unknown transcendants 6
and 9 are connected by the simple relation

   Of course each evanescence of a term in the         for    G series between two
terms of like sign is to be reckoned as a distinct time of change.                   I  also
make abstraction of the singular cases where several consecutive terms va
mish together in either series.

WHEN
   had in view the wants of the numerous class of readers who
bring to the study of natural phenomena a knowledge of elementary
mathematics only; this class we suppose to be more numerous in
America than in England, though here it must be large and increa
sing.  There cannot, we apprehend, be any question of the advan
tage gained by treating the subject mathematically in   elementary                                  its
parts, and particularly     setting the student

sketch, though doubtless very good so far as it goes.           Its treatment
is so characteristic of the work that we will mention its contents.
In the first place it is shown that Kepler's laws follow from the law
of universal gravitation, the proofs being substantially the same as
those of Newton's 1st, 11th, and 15th propositions.              The case of
two reciprocally attracting bodies is then briefly considered.               In
the case of three bodies, expressions are found for the components of
the disturbing force along the radius, tangent, and at right angles to
the plane of the orbit respectively; but that point attained, the ana
lytical treatment of the question stops. The modifications of the
motion of the disturbed body under the action of these forces is
only considered generally, the kind of effect produced by each
being pointed out without any attempt to calculate                 magnitude.                 its

THE“On   the Amiens Gravel.”
                                                            was read:—
                                    By A. Tylor, Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S.
   The author referred first to the prevalent views respecting the
gravels of the Valley of the Somme, namely, (1) that there are two
deposits of distinct age—the upper and the lower valley-gravels;
(2) that the former of these is the older; (3) that the Valley of the
Somme has been excavated to the depth of 40 or 50 feet since its
deposition; (4) that both gravels contain bones of extinct animals,
and implements of human manufacture, the lower gravels, however,
containing the greater number of species of Mollusca, and the upper
the greater number of flint implements; and (5) that the height
(70 feet) of the gravels at St. Acheul above the present level of the
Somme is much beyond the limit of floods, and that, therefore, they
could only have been deposited before the river-channel was cut
down to         its
              present level.   He then pointed out that the general
                           refer back the remains of man found at St.
          of                    is
effect   these views            to
Acheul     to       an
              indefinite date, separated from the historical period                                               by
an  interval during which the valley was excavated.
     Informer papers Mr. Tylor stated his belief that the upper and
lower valley-gravels            of
                           the Somme are continuous and       the same                               of
age, which            he
                  considered        close   the historical period.

and South-east Yorkshire.”            By S. W. Wood, Jun., Esq., F.G.S.,
 and the Rev. J. L. Rome, F.G.S.
    The features of Yorkshire and North-east Lincolnshire having
 distinctive characters from those of Central and South Lincolnshire,
 the authors described the two areas separately.             In the former, their
coast sections exhibited the Glacial clay separated into two portions:
of these the lower, which they identified with the ordinary (or
upper) Glacial clay of the South, contains abundant chalk débris;
but the upper or purple portion (which was in places divided from
the lower by sand and gravel beds) contains no chalk in the upper,
and but little in the lower part of               the place       it,

North Devon.” By N. Whitley, Esq.
   Mr. Jukes having, in a late paper, mentioned some glacial grooves
observed by him in the valley of the Exe, the author stated his
opinion that the “Grooves” have been formed by the minor contor
tions of the strata, and not by glacial action.

in the South of Ireland.” By A. B. Wynne, Esq., F.G.S.
   The object of this communication was to place upon record
certain facts connected with alterations of level in the shore of the
South of Ireland, near the town of Youghal. The occurrence of
submerged peat beneath the Youghal strand shows that considerable
alterations of level have taken place along the coast of Youghal Bay
subsequently to the formation of the peat which so commonly covers
the Glacial Drift of Ireland.   The author also inferred that towards
the close of the Glacial period the sea was further from the present
land than it is now, that the land then sank to the depth of about

 's  disengaged and is collected in the graduated tube is at least a
 hundred times as great as the volume of the projectile.
     These experiments appear to me to prove that sufficient attention
 has not been devoted to the important part which air plays in the
 penetration of projectiles into resisting media, and during their
 passage through more or less thick solid plates.
     I  have made an extensive series of shots in plates of different
 kinds, using projectiles either of metal or of organic substances, as
  stearine, wood, caoutchouc, &c., varying the nature of the media to
 be penetrated and the substance of the projectile.
     The following are some facts.
     If a leaden ball be fired either with a great or a small velocity at
  an ordinary slate, the projectile traverses without smashing it; the
 round apertures produced are small, and but little different whatever
 be the velocity. A perfectly round hole may even be made, without
 breaking the slate, although the velocity of the projectile is inadequate
 to pass through the slate. This latter experiment requires that the
 slate be fastened in a wooden frame, or regularly supported in several
 points.     If a lead or a cast-iron ball be fired from a pistol or a gun
 against a leaden plate, it is observed that the larger apertures in the
 lead correspond to the great velocities, so that the measurement
 of the diameter would furnish a datum for the velocity of the
 projectile.     The plate remains flat for great velocities, but bulges
 out with small ones.        Chipped edges are produced on the two sides
 of the plate: those on the side of the face struck are virtually per
 pendicular to the trajectory, those on the opposite face are parallel;
                                                                  -
 in short, they are almost at right angles.
    The results of the firing into plates of plastic clay are of the most
unexpected character, and have surprised all the artillery officers
 who have witnessed them.
    (1) With equal velocities the apertures are larger the thicker the
plates traversed, up to a certain limit.
    (2) The diameter of the circular apertures increases with the velo
locity of the projectile.
    Thus a pistol-bullet (12 millims. in diameter and weighing about
 10 grammes) produces in a very plastic plate of ordinary clay, when
shot by a charge of powder of 0-150 gr., an aperture having twice the
diameter of the ball; the same projectile shot by 2 to 2.5 grms.
of powder produces such an aperture as would be attributed to a
projectile from a field-gun.
    The edges on both sides are so strongly jagged that it is difficult
to say on which side of the plate the ball has struck.
    This phenomenon is accompanied by one no less remarkable: part
of the clay flies towards the firer, and is thrown several metres in the
opposite direction to that of the projectile.
    (3) Two plates of clay are taken, each about 15 millims. thick and
25 to 30 centimetres in diameter, and are cemented together by
moistening their surfaces.
    If a pistol-bullet be shot by 2 grims. of powder against these plates,
the edges are formed as in the preceding experiment; but the two

                Intelligence   and Miscellaneous  Articles.            483
plates separate partially by bulging from each other, in opposite
directions, leaving a hollow between them like a double convex
lens, the centre of which corresponds to the hole formed by the ball;
the circular aperture due to the passage of the projectile attains
more than 10 centims. diameter.
    With thick clay plates the aperture has the shape of a truncated
cone, but, contrary to what happens in the case of indefinite media,
the base of the cone is on the side at which the ball emerges.
    In large blocks an ellipsoidal or double conical shape is met with,
and at a small depth the figure is met with deduced from the able
analysis and the celebrated experiments of MM. Didon, Probert, and
 Morin.
    The general    shape and the greater or less degree of acuteness of
the cone appear to depend on the density of the projectile.          I have
even produced cavities resembling a semiellipsoid of revolution, when,
for instance, wooden balls were used, which burst.
    I  am indebted to the kindness of M. Regnault for having been
able to repeat the experiments, originally made on common clay,
with a mass of Sèvres porcelain prepared for hardening in the fire.
I   may be allowed to express my obligation to the able director of the
 Imperial Manufactory of Sèvres.
    I   have lately examined the shape of the aperture produced by
lightning in a glass pane 4 millims. in thickness, and have resumed
 on this subject experiments which       I made long ago. The results
 of these  experiments    are completely  opposed to what is assumed with
regard to the phenomena of the communication of motion*.
    Hundreds of experiments, in fact, without exception, give the
 following results    :-                                                    -
     (1) When a pressure is exerted on the centre of a square gradu
 ally increasing until it is broken, a certain number of slits are made
 which radiate around the centre of pressure; these slits are gene
 rally in almost straight lines.
    (2) A cork bullet fired by a strong charge of powder against a
 pane coated on one side with gummed paper produces slits analogous
 to the preceding; these are sometimes intersected by slits, which       in
 dicate that the motion commenced at the point struck.
    (3) If from the same pistol and with a small charge of powder a
 leaden bullet be fired against a pane suspended by metal wires, the
 glass is perforated and broken as in experiment No. 1.
     (4) Other things being equal, if the charge of powder be increased
  to about 0.2 grm., the ball traverses the square, producing a greater
 or less aperture surrounded by short and almost rectilinear slits;
    * The following extract is taken from M. Delaunay's excellent Traité
 de Mécanique Elémentaire (vol. i. p. 156, 3rd edition):—“A lead bullet
 gently projected against a window-pane would be repelled without produ
 cing fracture.   If thrown strongly by the hand, it would pass through the
 square, producing a large number of slits which radiate round the hole
 through which it has passed. But if the bullet is fired from a gun, it will
 merely make a round hole in the pane; the rest - of the pane will be un
 changed.”

the other parts of the square remain unchanged, and                                                it continues
suspended.
   (5) If the charge be increased to 2.5 grms. for instance,              other                             all
conditions remaining the same, the square             smashed into numberis                             a

is seen that with small velocities the hole produced               the paper                  in                       is it

   Comparing these experiments with those which prove the transpor
tation   ofthe air, we must conclude that the air which precedes the
ball commences the action; and we may perhaps                     able    prove               be            to

ON   THE INFLUENCE OF WARIOUS COLOURED RAYS ON THE DE
    COMPOSITION OF CARBONIC ACID IN PLANTS.                 BY M. CAIL
                                               -
    LETET.
   It has long been observed that the green parts of plants exposed
to the direct rays of the sun possess the property of decomposing
the carbonic acid in the air, and of disengaging an almost equivalent
quantity of oxygen.       In darkness the converse phenomenon is pro
duced: the oxygen of the air is absorbed, and carbonic acid is dis
engaged, arising from the oxidation of part of the carbon of the plant.
                          I
   In the experiments have undertaken to ascertain the influence of
the various coloured rays on the decomposition of carbonic acid by
plants,  I have endeavoured to attain as far as possible the conditions
under which nature works.
   I  had to arrange my coloured glasses so as to prevent, by a consi
derable draught of air, the great increase of temperature produced
in closed vessels exposed to the direct solar rays. Under a red glass
I  have observed the temperature rise to above 70°.
   By preliminary trials    I found that by taking some precautions the
detached leaves acted on mixtures of gases as if they still adhered to
the plant which produced them.         I have also found that leaves of
the same plant and of equal surfaces virtually decompose the same
quantities of carbonic acid when they act upon the same gaseous
mixtures exposed to the same source of light.
    The absorption of carbonic acid, and the disengagement of oxygen
more or less mixed with nitrogen, is met with exclusively in the
green parts of vegetables; but it is indispensable that the organs
be intact, for by crushing or even by rubbing them the property of
absorption is destroyed.       When a leaf is carefully cut into small
fragments the decomposing action is still manifest; for each part,
containing all the anatomical elements, acts like an entire leaf.     A
temperature of 10° to 15° C. is necessary for the manifestation of the
decomposing action, but the rays of obscure heat are insufficient to
produce it. This      I  have been able to ascertain by means of an ap
paratus which I owe to the skill of M. M. Alvergniat.
    It consists of two concentric gas-jars of colourless glass sealed at
the bottom.     In the space between these two vessels of different
 diameter there is a concentrated solution of iodine in bisulphide of
 carbon. This screen only allows obscure heat to traverse it; and it
 can be ascertained that carbonic acid placed in the central gas-jar is
 not decomposed by the leaves, spite of the continued action of the
 sun's rays.
    The different coloured rays have, on the contrary, a special action
 more or less energetic in the decomposition of carbonic acid. When
 tubes containing leaves of the same plant equal in surface are placed
 in the same gaseous mixture under bell-jars of different colours, after
 eight or ten hours' exposure to the sun, the quantities of carbonic
 acid left undecomposed are stated in the following Table.

    The examination of this Table proves that the thermal rays, equally
with the chemical rays, are without action on the strange decomposi
tion of carbonic acid by vegetables which takes place under condi
tions quite different from those we can produce in our laboratories,
But the forces which produce this decomposition act on the elements
of this compound body dissolved in the liquids of the leaf, and we
must avow our entire ignorance of the state in which these elements
exist in the solution.             It   would appear, from an inspection of the
numbers given in the Table, that the colours which are most ac
tive, from the chemical point of view, are just those which least
favour the decomposition of carbonic acid.                                                 •
     I must particularly dwell upon the special and unexpected action
of green light, whether this colour be obtained by a glass, by the
leaves of vegetables, or by coloured solutions.                     Under its influence,
carbonic acid does not seem to be decomposed at all, but, on the
contrary, a new quantity of the gas seems to be produced by the
leaves.
     For if under a green glass bell-jar, and exposed to the direct rays
of the sun, a gas-jar be placed containing a leaf in pure air, we
obtain, after the lapse of a few hours, a quantity of carbonic acid
little less than would be produced by the same leaf in total
darkness.
     It is possibly owing to this curious property of green light, which
must in the long run produce the etiolation of the plants on which it
acts, that vegetation is generally languishing and feeble under large
trees, though the shade they produce is frequently not very intense.
     The results of my experiments agree with the conclusions of the
beautiful research published by MM. Cloez and Gratiolet on the
 vegetation of submerged plants. Working with gaseous mixtures,                              I
have merely been able to confirm this curious property of green
rays, which the authors could not have been led by their special re
searches to suspect.—Comptes Rendus, August 19, 1867.

  The one of these values of t, is greater than that got from
equation (1), and has therefore no importance for this problem.
When the temperature of combustion tº is found, then we get
from equation (4) the value of hat, i. e. the quantity by weight
of hydrogen which was burned at the moment when the maxi
mum temperature of the flame was reached; and consequently
also the value of h(1—a), i. e. the quantity by weight of hydrogen
which had lost the power of burning at the high temperature                                                tr.

492                 Prof. R. Bunsen      on the Temperature       of the
 gas which takes no part in the combustion, the celerity of the
 ignition becomes more and more diminished, until, when the
 mixture is on the point of burning, the progress of the ignition
 can be followed with the naked eye.     If therefore the combustion
 is excessively slow, owing to the presence of foreign gases, the
 measurement of pressure is rendered completely erroneous, since
 the first portion of gas which is ignited is cooled down again
 before the remainder has become heated.         In order to remove
 this source of error, it is necessary to avoid too great a dilution
 with foreign gases, to have the diameter of the column of gas to
 be burned not too great, and to cause the inflammation of the
 gases to be as instantaneous as possible.       This last is best ac
 complished by sending a very powerful spark from a large Ruhm
korff’s coil-machine through the entire length of the column of
gases. The exploding-vessel (fig. 1, Plate IV.) which        employed   I
was made of exceedingly thick glass, and contained a column of
gas 8-15 centims. in height and 1.7 centim. in diameter, so that the
entire length which the combustion had to travel was 8.5 millims.,
the distance from the path of the spark to the glass walls.       The
shorter the time in which the maximum temperature is reached
in proportion to the duration of the cooling, the less is this source
of error to be feared. It is necessary here to say a word on the
celerity with which the propagation of the ignition takes place.
This is estimated as follows: the explosive mixture is allowed to
burn from a fine orifice of known diameter, and the rate of the
current of gas carefully regulated by diminishing the pressure,
to the point at which the flame passes back through the orifice
and ignites the gas below         This passing back
                                       it.                  the flame  of
occurs when the velocity with which the gaseous mixture issues
from the orifice     inappreciably less than the velocity with which
                        is

   An experiment with pure hydrogen explosive mixture gave the
following numbers:—
   W=963000 cubic millims.; d-1-2 millim.;           seconds,    t=    25

                Flames   of Carbonic Ovide     and Hydrogen.                493
    The rate of propagation of the ignition in pure hydrogen                mix
 ture is therefore 34 metres in the second*.
    It is to be supposed   that the true rate found by the experiment is
somewhat too       high,  owing   to the cooling which the stream of gas
 is subjected to at the mouth of the exit-opening, and which makes
 the desired value too small.
    Since the distance between the path of the spark and the sides
of the glass vessel (constructed of the dimensions given above) is
                                                                          -
only 8.5 millims, we may conclude
That the time which the whole of the gas takes to burn com
    pletely, and therefore also to reach the maximum temperature,
    is not more than 4000 part of a second.
    The light of the spark was examined by means of a disk whose
rate of rotation is known, and provided with radiating segments.
Looking through this at a white surface illuminated by the light
from the exploding gases, the duration of the illumination is
found to be ºr of a second.
Hence, whilst the maximum temperature is reached at the very
    most in adoo of a second, the temperature during ºr of a
    second appears to fall so little that the flame still produces a
    dazzling light.
    It is therefore clear that, in the case of pure detonating gas, a
constant error in measuring the pressure is not to be feared.
These relations are less favourable in the case of the detonating
mixture with carbonic oxide, which possesses the very low rate
of not quite 1 metre in the second, but, on the other hand, seems
to cool very slowly indeed.          Notwithstanding this, satisfactory
results can be obtained by measurements of pressure of this gas,
since we can scarcely doubt that the agreement between results
with this gas and those with hydrogen does not depend simply on
chance.      The measurements of pressure were made in the fol
lowing way:-The mixture of gases to be exploded is collected
over mercury in the exploding-vessel, fig. 1, and filled up to a
definite point denoted by a file-mark; the level of mercury in
the vessel is then made equal to that in the trough, and the
vessel is closed with the covering-plate, fig. 2. This consists of
a thick disk of mirror-glass with polished surface.                 To this a
second, iron plate is cemented, from which an iron pin passes for
the reception of the spark through a hole in the glass plate.
   * From these numbers we      see that the velocities   which are observed on
the sun’s surface in the case of certain progressive luminous effects occur
ring in given times, are altogether of a higher order than the velocities
with which chemical combinations occur in gaseous mixtures.          The hypo
theses  according  to which these solar phenomena     are explained by chemical
processes must therefore undergo considerable limitation.

The glass plate is covered with       a little olive-oil and then brought
under the exploding-vessel,       to the polished mouth of which it is
made to adhere by gentle rubbing.             The vessel thus closed air

a great extent dependent on the time during which the pressure
works.     In order, then, to measure this force under the same
circumstances as when the experiment is going on, the following
plan was adopted.      The pan of a balance was fastened by means
of string to the adhering glass plate, and weights were placed
on it by degrees until the point was reached at which, when the
explosion-vessel was quickly raised, the adhering plate was re
moved without any marked raising of the balance-pan.             The
weight at which this occurred was then added to that mea
sured on the lever-arm. The uncertainty which attends a cor
rection made in the way described does not, however, affect the
accuracy of the method, since the weight for this correction is
only a very small proportion of the entire pressure which is mea
sured.    The exactness of measurements conducted in this way is
only small; but, as the following experiments show, it is still great
enough to show the remarkable laws which govern the combustion
of gases. By a series of experiments the volume of gas in the ex
ploding-tube was found to be 18-5 cubic centims.        The cylin
drical flame produced was 8:15 centims, in height and 1.7 cen
tim. in diameter.      For the first and second of the following
seven   experiments,  a mixture was used of h parts by weight of
carbonic oxide with o parts by weight of oxygen, which exactly
serves for complete combustion.       For the experiments 3 to 7
the same mixture was used with successive additions of n parts
oxygen.     The pressures P and Pi are, in these and in        subse                                              all

     The discontinuous combustion of              a uniform mixture of a
 combustible gas with oxygen             belongs to a class of phenomena
 which fall under a    law pointed out by me in another placet, which
 is expressed as follows:—
 That the quantities of compounds which, under favourable cir
     cumstances, form simultaneously in a perfectly uniform gaseous
     mixture, bear simple atomic relations to each other; and that
     these simple atomic relations undergo sudden alterations by
    the gradual addition of a third body, which does not affect the
     homogeneous nature of the mixture.
     In order   to explain this law more clearly,       I here append some
of the observations on which it is based, and which have been
already publishedf.
    If a light is applied to a uniform mixture of hydrogen, car
 bonic oxide, and oxygen which contains less oxygen than is
necessary for the combustion of one of the other two gases,
three results are possible; viz., the oxygen may burn only with
the one, or only with the other, or with both together.               Expe
riment shows that both burn; but it is also seen that the quan
tities of the two gases present in excess which the oxygen selects
for combustion stand in a simple atomic relation to each other,
and that these quantities of gas united to the oxygen do not
regularly increase by gradual increase of one part of the mixture,
but by intervals they spring suddenly from one simple atomic
relation to another. The oxygen divides itself between the excess
of hydrogen and carbonic oxide in the proportion represented by
the following atomic numbers of the products of combustion:—
         2CO2        CO2        CO2           CO2      CO2       CO2

   As up to the present time it has not been possible to prepare
any single compound of carbonic acid and water, we are com
pelled to assume that even between the uncombined atoms cer
tain predominant attractions, corresponding to simple atomic
relations, are at work, but that we are unable to repeat the condi
tions under which the compounds corresponding to these rela
tions are formed; so that the chemical attractions have the power
of arranging the neighbouring atoms (whether they afterwards
take part in the combination or not, and even before any combi
nation of the system occurs) in simple atomic proportions,
according to which combination can occur more easily than in
any other.    Bearing this in mind, and comparing it with what
happens in the case of the combustion of gases, we find that we
have to do with similar phenomena.       If we suppose a number
of carbonic-oxide and oxygen atoms,
CO, O, CO, O, CO, O, CO, O, CO, O, CO, O, CO, O, CO, O,
to be exposed to a constantly increasing temperature, then a
point must come when the first pair CO, O are united together
and CO2 produced.  The result of the force between the atoms
                              CO, O.; CO2; CO, O
must now be quite different from the original,
                         CO, O.; CO, O.; CO, O.; CO, O.
It  may be that the two atoms of carbonic acid cause the neigh
bouring atoms to become carbonic acid between the temperature
3033°C. and 2558°C.                       If,
                                  then, the same action        repeated            is
throughout the whole mass          the gas, only
                                           of    one-third      the gas            of

cident with the faintest of Fraunhofer's lines.     If this should
prove to be the case, and if the observer       could train himself to
distinguish in the hurry and under such          novel circumstances*
the lines of the different gases, it would     even be possible to as
certain how high in the sun's atmosphere       each reaches, by using
a curved slit, and noting the moment at which each set of lines
is obliterated by the advancing moon.          This would be a deter
mination of exceeding interest. The observations should com

nitromesitylenic     acid, Gº  Hº (N9°) 0°, which crystallizes and also
furnishes crystallizable salts.
    When mesitylenic acid is treated with chromic acid, it yields a
new acid which Fittig calls trimesic acid, Cº H996.              This is pro
bably the same as that which is formed in small quantity when
mesitylene is directly oxidized.            It crystallizes from hot water
in  pretty   thick,  colourless and     transparent  hard prisms.     Heated
in a   glass  tube it  begins   to melt at a    temperature    which is cer
tainly not below 300°; but before the entire mass is melted the
 substance volatilizes without change.            Trimesic acid is a strong
tribasic   acid, which forms with barium a very characteristic salt.
Its formation from mesitylenic acid may be thus written:-
                 C9H10O2+60=C9H6 06-1-2H2 0.
    Schlebusch has examined the action of hypochlorous acid on
some of the fatty acids*.            With valerianic acid hypochlorous
acid in solution unites       directly,   in the manner expressed by the
equation
               C5H10O2+Cl H0 = C5H8 ClO2 + H2O.
    The acid which is thus formed, chlorovalerianic acid, remains
mixed with some unaltered valerianic acid, and their separation
is attended with considerable difficulty; but in many cases the
presence of unaltered valerianic acid is no very great objection.
    When the mixture of the above acids was treated with caustic
baryta, valerolactic acid (Gº H1903) was obtained; and when the
same mixture dissolved in absolute alcohol was saturated with
ammonia, butalanine (C*H* 0° N) was formed.
    Schlebusch also tried the action of hypochlorous acid on pal
mitic acid, and finds that it takes place in accordance with the
equation
          C16 H32   02-H2Cl H 0–C16 H30 Cl2O2+2H2O.
    It  would thus seem that as we go higher in the series of fatty
 acids the facility of substitution increases.
   Bayer has investigated:f the two products of condensation of
acetone—oxide of mesityle and phorone.                They are most easily
prepared by saturating acetone with hydrochloric acid gas, leav
ing the mixture for some days, and then treating it carefully with
alcoholic potash : a mixture of the two is liberated, and they are
separated by fractional distillation,-oxide of mesityle boiling
at 130°, and phorone at 196°.

 into a chloride, Cº H9Cl.

 is   a colourless
 camphor.          It   is decomposed partially by distillation, giving some
products of condensation.
    What has hitherto been known as phorone has been an impure
product. It is best prepared by rectifying that part of the ori
ginal product which passes between 180° and 205°.      It crystal
lizes in long friable prisms of greenish-yellow colour, and with
an odour like geranium. Treated with perchloride of phosphorus
this body yields chloride of phoryle, C*H*C), which, treated in
turn with potash, regenerates phorone.
    Simultaneously, but quite independently of each other, Wurtz
 and Kekulé have described a reaction by which the aromatic hy
 drocarbons may be converted into their corresponding phenolesl.

  516      Mr. T. Gaffield  on the Action of Sunlight  on Glass.
     “His inquiries, since he instituted these experiments, have
 brought out some fine specimens of Belgian sheet glass from a
 house built three years ago, which had changed in some instances
 to a golden and in others to the well-known purple hue.
     “It  is his intention to pursue the experiments further, with a
 view to ascertain the effects of sunlight during each month and
 season of the year—and also whether exposure to heat, air, or
 moisture alone, out of the direct action of the sun’s rays, will
 produce any corresponding change.
     “Mr. Gaffield does not propound any theory to explain these
 changes of colour, which under our sunny skies probably take
 place much more rapidly than in the different and less clear at
 mosphere of England.
     “Some writers point to the presence of oxide of manganese in
 the original composition of window-glass, and some to the oxide
 of iron, as a chief cause.
     “Some writers have peculiar theories about the different
 classes of the sun's rays.     Some may think the change referred
 to a molecular or chemical one; and others, wiser than the rest,
 refrain from any explanation, waiting for a larger multiplication
 of experiments and a greater accumulation of facts before edu
 cing any satisfactory law of nature which governs these curious
 and interesting phenomena.
     “Mr. Gaffield makes no pretensions to any discoveries, unless
 it be to the very rapid change in glass observed in our climate
 in July, but only gives the result of his experiments in the hope
 that the great interest now manifested in the subjects of light
 and heat may lead others to examine the matter, to repeat the
 same experiments in other countries, and to give the world the
 result of their researches, and enable the learned and scientific
men of the age to explain this remarkable power and action of
the sun’s rays.
    “It  should be remembered that he submitted his specimens
to the most severe tests, by placing them where they received
reflected as well as transmitted light and heat.       The change in
glass when glazed in the windows of our dwellings and stores
is so much more gradual that it very rarely attracts the atten
tion of observers, except in the marked variation from white to
purple.”
    In  accordance with the intention above expressed,          I have
continued     my    experiments   on this  interesting   subject,  and
under different heads will now give some account of their
method and results.
    My first experiment was with pieces of glass 4 by 6 inches
placed in a sash 6 by 60 inches long, in the grooves of which

the specimens were placed, the sash being fastened together
by wooden pins, and placed on a nearly horizontal rough plate
glass roof which received the direct rays of the sun during
the greater part of the day.      In my next experiment I placed
some of the specimens   directly on the rough plate glass.     These
were carried on in summer and autumn.          It was necessary to
make a different arrangement for winter, when the fall of snow
and the formation of ice might interfere with the full success of
the experiments.   I concluded that the best size for specimens
was 4 by 2 inches; and I made some wooden boxes about ; inch
deep, 4} inches wide, and of a length to        the sills   windows                  fit                    of

bably very little, if any, manganese, changed not in two years.
 Perhaps a longer exposure may produce some change.
    A rough piece of light-coloured window-glass metal changed
to a yellowish colour in a year.
     Coloured glasses after two or three years’ exposure showed no
 perceptible change in any instance, except a slight one in a single
 specimen of purple.      Perhaps an exposure of many years may
 make a    change  in some other colours.
      Ihave made experiments with artificial heat on glass in various
ways, from exposure to the heat of a cooking-range oven to that
of a glass-stainer's kiln, without any change of colour in the
common colourless window-glasses, while the same or similar
specimens exposed to sunlight have been nearly           changed                    all                      in   a
few months.
    Specimens exposed        hot water for month, indoors and out
                                      in                        a

                       sunlight; or,   speak more exactly, they     to
retake the light-green shade which they had before exposure.
A   second exposure      sunlight produces

526       Mr. T.  Gaffield on the Action    of Sunlight on Glass.
    I  have made an experiment for one year with two kinds of
 easily changing glass out of doors, and out of the direct rays of
 the sun, and found that they were both slightly affected and
 changed towards a yellowish colour. I did not expect any change,
 but can perhaps properly account for it on the ground that it
was the result of the action of diffused sunlight.          It is barely
 possible that the sun may for a few minutes in some days of the
 year have cast some reflexions when         I was not present in the
 dark corner in which     I placed my specimens.
     It may be that the action of the sun's heat produced the
 slight effect noticed.     If so, it would be an interesting confir
 mation of   Tyndall's   experiments,    and of his theory of the cor
 relation of forces.     I  do not consider my single experiment
 entirely conclusive, and shall make others which will give us
 more material for proper theories and conclusions.
    The experiments which       I  have carried on for four years em
 brace one specimen of optical glass, a few kinds of flint glass,
 and glass ware, sixteen kinds of French, Belgian, German, and
 English plate glass, four kinds of American, English, French,
 and Belgian rough plate, two of American and English crown
glass, ten kinds of American, Belgian, French, and English
 white sheet glass, four kinds of American, Belgian, and             En
 glish ordinary sheet glass, fifteen kinds and shades of English
 coloured glass, four of opake, white-enamelled, and ground glass,
 and one piece of the rough metal of American sheet glass,            in
 all, about sixty varieties.
    I  have watched and recorded in some experiments the results
 from day to day, in others from month to month and season to
 season.    I have now commenced a series in which I may record
results from year to year for ten years or more.             In these it
 may be found that specimens of what are called colourless glasses
changed to a yellow colour by exposure for a year, may by much
 longer exposure be turned to a yellowish pink and a purple.
And some which have been entirely unaffected may be affected
 by an exposure for ten or twenty years.          Perhaps some of the
coloured   glasses may show signs of a change of hue or shade.
    These new experiments include rough and polished plate,
crown, cylinder, ground, enamelled, and coloured glass.           I have
also begun to expose under several of these kinds of glass pieces
of easily changing glass, which         I  shall take in from year to

them to transmit the actinic rays.
    The most easily changing glasses are a certain kind of white
plate, which changes from a white to a yellowish colour, and a
certain kind of Belgian sheet, which the manufacturers used to
make of a brownish yellow (they          now make    it of a  bluish or

a flesh-colour or a pinkish hue.    I have accordingly taken these
two kinds for my under-glass experiments.        Under each of se
veral kinds, to be exposed from one to ten or twenty years, I
have placed pieces 4 x 2 inches of the white plate.    shall take in                  I
one piece at the end of the first, second, third, fourth, sixth, and
tenth year.   These six lights will show the increased action of
the transmitted rays from year to year.     By comparing the dif
ferent series with each   other, one can perceive the comparative
actinic power of each kind of glass, or rather their comparative
power of transmitting actinic rays.
   Another interesting under-experiment is the following.                                                    I
have placed under one piece of each kind of glass exposed a piece
of easily changing glass, which I shall take in at the end of the
year.

strip of 4×2-inch glass, taking in each piece at the end of the
year of            its

   A similar experiment to the above      have commenced with          I
two pieces of white plate and the simple letters T. G. without
the date. The result of the experiment in a year or more will
be to show in one case yellowish letters on a light-coloured

ground.
     I
     have thus given as briefly as possible, and yet as fully as
desirable, an account of my past and present experiments.   New
ones are  suggested  from   year to year.  trust that this inter           I
esting field for observation and experiment may be worked in
other countries. There is ample room for research in the ap
plication of chemical knowledge, of qualitative, quantitative,
and spectral analysis, and of photogenic tests, to discover the
exact action and causes of the interesting effects of the sun’s
rays which have here been noticed.
   Theories.—The interesting phenomena of which I have given
an account have given rise to many theories to account for their
cause.    Some attribute them to the presence of oxide of iron,
and some to oxide of manganese.              Exactly how the change
takes  place is a question   on which writers differ, although it is
my opinion that the precise explanation can only be given after
a multiplication of experiments and a thorough examination of
exposed and unexposed specimens of glass by quantitative and
qualitative analysis, and perhaps by spectral analysis and obser
vation of effects, or photogenic tests+.
   We will briefly state the part which the oxides of iron and
 manganese play in glass-making.           In almost       kinds    win               all            of
 dow-glass, and      some poorer qualities
                                in                flint glass and glass    of
ware, materials are used which are not perfectly and chemically
pure. The sand, the carbonate               sulphate             or
                                                           soda, and the              of
lime, one     all, contain slight impurities
                      or                             iron, the protoxide       of
of which gives glass     green colour.      aTo correct this after the
batch      partially
                 is   melted,    little oxide        amanganese, called        of
glass-makers’ soap,     put into the crucible

   Bontemps, in an interesting article in the Comptes Rendus of
February 4, 1867, attributes the changes in colour to the pre
sence of oxide of manganese.    He also remarks that he thinks
that the violet colour occurs only in glass in which the silicates
have a base of  potash, and the  yellow  in cases where soda is
used.   I doubt the correctness of this opinion, as am quite                                      I
sure that      I
            have several specimens coloured violet which contain
                        all
no  potash at       their composition.

I     have also specimens which are coloured both yellow and
violet    the same piece—the yellow portion

been covered with black paint while the violet portion was pro
duced     by
           longer exposure.

tinge of yellow to cut off twenty-five per cent. of the actinic
rays.     I

tion from the wind and weather, but in doing so sacrifice, in                      I

exposure proportionately.    With the best of glass the loss from
reflexion and absorption is considerable.  This may be fearfully
increased  by  the  colour;  and if that  undergoes  a continual
change for the worse, the state of things is exceedingly unplea

take care of a certain kind of cheap French glass, made for
glass         which turned yellow; but

When the putty covered the glass, the sun's rays could not reach

windows were removed in 1846, and since used as covers for

         tion has ever been made of that of which am about to make a          I
         a short report.
            The success of the electroscopic experiments, the results of
         which    I communicated to the Academy on the 18th of March,
         1867t, gave me occasion to observe them. Among others, then                            I
         occupied myself with the excitation of electricity on rubbing
         mercury against insulators. The enigmatical anomalies which
         were long ago observed by the older physicists, whose observations
         I found fully confirmed, raised the question whether they would
         occur in the absence of air; and                     I
                                                 thus directed my attention to
         the   phosphorus   mercurialis,   which in the earlier history of elec
         tricity played so interesting (I might almost say amusing) a part.

of an induction-coil 10,000 feet in length, without perceiving a
decrease in the action.     Just as little effect is produced by a
shunt, if it is not too strong. The electrodes to which the tube
hangs, if they terminate in points, may be brought within an
inch from each other (when small sparks begin to pass) without
causing the cessation of the phenomenon of motion in the tube.
    Even the current of an ordinary electrical machine with a disk
of only 15 inches set the mercury just as briskly in vibration
as that of Holtz's machine; the motion was not, however, so
continuous, but was more by starts.            And it was the end of the
machine joined with the conductor (that                  with the positive    is,
pole   of the machine) towards which the mercurial thread moved.

     I will mention, in concluding,                            that the phenomenon                      of motion
in question is accompanied by a pretty luminous appearance,
which, however, is only visible in the dark.
  At the negative end of the tube, as far as the platinum wire
projects, a beautiful yellow fluorescent light appears in the glass,
and the same at the end of the mercurial column turned towards
the positive pole, which travels with it through the entire tube as
far as the positive bend, which, when the mercury reaches            also                                    it,
shines   very   brilliantly.     The rest      the  tube, excepting   the  of
mercury,       filled with beautiful violet but unstratified light.
                  is                                                                                                  It

Sun-views   of the Earth, or the Seasons Illustrated. By RICHARD A.
  PROCTOR,    B.A., F.R.A.S. London: Longmans, Green, and Co.
  1867.
    A sun-view of the earth means a perspective projection of the
earth, the sun's centre being the point of sight and the plane of the
picture at right angles to the line joining the sun's centre with that
of the earth; of course such a projection is practically orthographic,
Mr. Proctor's book consists mainly of twelve plates, one for each
month, on days so chosen as to show the earth when in the sol
stitial and equinoctial points.   Each plate contains the four views
corresponding to 6 A.M., noon, 6 P.M., and midnight, Greenwich
solar time. Each view is in fact a small map of a hemisphere, 2%
inches in diameter. The whole series shows extremely well the
general distribution of land and water on the earth's surface far
better than can be done by any single map. This, however, is not
the main object of the book, which is to enable a learner to under
stand the way in which the various regions of the earth are presented
to the sun at different times of the year. The plates are extremely
good, and show what is intended as well, perhaps, as anything of
the kind could do. In addition to these twelve plates there are two—
one showing five “sun-views” of the British Isles for different times
of the year, the other showing the daily motion of the earth in her
orbit for the year 1867, and the positions of the centre and major
and minor axes of the orbit.     There is prefixed to the work an   in
troduction of four pages, explaining the plates and suggesting points
illustrated by them.
    In addition to the above work, Mr. Proctor has also published
four separate plates.     The first is a chart of all stars of the
zodiac of magnitudes superior to the 6th; the second and third
show the orbits of the larger and smaller planets, their major axes,
lines of nodes, &c.; the fourth gives a series of eighteen views
of Mars as seen at different dates, together with a chart of Mars
based on twenty-seven drawings by Mr. Dawes.          It is by no means
clear whether the   eighteen  views are copies of actual drawings; we
could have wished that Mr. Proctor had left the point clear of
doubt; for   if,   on
                  the one hand, they are copies     actual drawings,
                                                    of
they completely justify the chart;   not, we are left entirely with
                                    if
out the means    estimating the value

     “Results of Observations of Atmospheric Electricity at Kew Ob
 servatory, and at Windsor, Nova Scotia.”                     By Joseph D. Everett,
 D.C.L., F.R.S.E., Assistant to the Professor of Mathematics in the
 University of Glasgow.
    The paper commences with an account of the concluding observa
 tions taken by the author at Windsor, N.S., of which the previous por
 tion has already been published in the ‘ Proceedings,’ vols. xii. & xiv.
    It then goes on to describe the self-recording apparatus employed
 at Kew Observatory for the observation of atmospheric electricity,
 and the method of procedure employed in measuring and reducing
 the curves thus obtained, this portion of the work having been per
 formed in the Physical Laboratory of the University of Glasgow.
    Tables are given showing the mean hourly values of the electrical
 potential for each month, and the mean monthly values are hence
 derived. These values for Kew are compared with the corresponding
values for Windsor, N.S., and remarkable differences are shown to
 exist between the curves, both diurnal and annual, for the two places.
    The hourly means at Kew for the mean of the year are represented
 by the following numbers:—
23h          Oh          1h           2h         3h     4h         5h           6h          7h

 1°52      1:64         1.96         2.26       2.28   2. 13.
    These numbers indicate a principal maximum between S" and 9",
and a secondary maximum between 20" and 21". At Windsor, on
the other hand, the mean potential about 9" was in every month,
without exception, less than at the other principal times of obser
vation, viz. about 21" and 14".
    The following Table shows the ratio of the mean monthly to the
mean annual potential for the whole series of observations at both
places:—

ations, both diurnal and annual, at Kew, and the annual variations at
Windsor,            by the first two terms          of an harmonic series.
    In the          case           of the diurnal variations at Kew, the amplitudes of
the two terms were nearly equal, but the epoch was much more

     1. “On the Graptolites       of the Skiddaw Series.” By Henry
 Alleyne Nicholson, D.Sc., M.B., F.G.S. &c.
     The author first described the geological relations and distribu
 tion of the Skiddaw Slates, and noticed their correspondence with
 the Quebec Group of Canada, and then gave a description of the
  Graptolites found in these rocks.       The genera and their distin
 guishing characters are the following:—
     1. Dichograpsus, Salter (3 species) : possesses a frond repeatedly
 dichotomous from a basal stipe into 8, 16, or more branches, each
 with a single row of cells, the lower part of the stipe being enve
 loped in a corneous cup.
     2. Tetragrapsus, Slater (3 species) : possesses a frond composed
 of four simple stipes, arising from a non-celluliferous funicle, which
 bifurcates at both ends.
     3. Phyllograpsus, Hall (2 species): differs from the last in pos
 sessing a frond composed of four simple stipes united back to back
 by their solid axes.
    4. Didymograpsus, M'Coy (7 species): the frond consists of two
 simple stipes springing from a mucronate radicle, which may be
 rudimentary or apparently absent.
    5. Diplograpsus, M'Coy (4 species): two simple stipes, united
 by their solid axes into a celluliferous frond furnished with a radicle
 at the base.
     6. Graptolites vel Graptolithus, Linn. (4 species): simple stipe,
 with a single row of cells on one side, and a small, generally curved,
 radicle at the base.
    7. Pleurograpsus, Nicholson (1 species): celluliferous branches
 derived from a main celluliferous rhachis.
    2.  “On    the Fossil Corals (Madreporaria)     of the West-Indian
Islands.—Part IV. Conclusion.”          By P. Martin Duncan, M.B.,
 Sec. G.S.
    In this communication the author concluded his series of memoirs
on the Fossil Corals of the West Indies with a description of the
Miocene corals from St. Croix, Trinidad, and with some supple
mentary remarks on the species described in his former papers from
St. Domingo, Jamaica, and Antigua, including notices of new
species from those islands.       He also gave a complete and revised
list of all the fossil corals he had described from the West Indies,
including    5 species from Cretaceous strata, 4 species and 1 variety
from Eocene deposits, and 102 species and 26 varieties from the
Miocene formation, making a total of 111 species and 27 varieties.
Of the Miocene species 11 still exist, namely, 6 in the Caribbean

    Jamaica has yielded the only known Cretaceous and Eocene
 corals; and Dr. Duncan stated that the former are identical with
 European Lower-Chalk species, and that the latter are similar                                               to
 species from the London Clay, the Bracklesham Beds, and the
 Paris Basin.
    Dr. Duncan then mentioned several curious facts               the distribu       in

 the circumstance that whilst         Jamaica,   San   Domingo,    and Guada

 and that the roads would be widest where the inclination of the hill
 is less than usual, and where streams bring down matter from above,

 about the same throughout, because the angle at which matter will
 stand depends partly on gravity and partly on friction. Now, as
 long as the water is at rest, the equilibrium in water remains as in
 air; but as soon as the water is agitated, the friction is diminished,
 and the angle of repose becomes less. In other words, the pebbles
 are set in motion, and roll down the hill,
    This explains the equal width of the roads, because the new angle
 of repose being equal throughout, and the depth to which the agita
tion extends being also equal, the width of the road must be equal
 also; and when once the new slope of repose was acquired, the hill
side would again be in a condition of equilibrium, and the road
would receive no further enlargement however long the water might
stand at the same level.      This explains why there are no roads
when the natural rock      appears, or when the hillside is less steep
than   usual, whereas if the roads were due to a heaping-up action, of
course in  places where the sides were more shelving the roads would
be better marked.      We can also thus understand why there are no
rolled  pebbles on the roads; and lastly, as the lower line of the roads
marks the depth to which the water was disturbed, we can see why
the roads become narrower wherever they are steeper than usual.
; Finally, the vertical height of the roads (that is to say, the vertical
difference between their upper and lower lines) gives the mea
sure of the depth to which the water filling the valleys was agitated,
and affords thus an additional argument in favour of its having
been that of a lake, as in a tidal sea the width of the roads must
have been much greater than it                      is.

He was led       examine the deportment

investigated were the following:—Ebonite, gutta percha, caoutchouc,
patent caoutchouc (Patentgummi), waxed cloth, white wax, resin,

dion, and gun-cotton. And the metals and conductors rubbed were
 graphite, carbon (gas-carbon), platinum, gold, palladium, silver,

mercury, mercury-amalgam, tin, bismuth, antimony, copper, zinc,
cadmium, iron, lead, aluminium, and magnesium.
    Although, from causes hitherto unexplained, individual exceptions
occur, the author thinks himself entitled to lay down the general
rule that the so-called electronegative metals, platinum, gold, palla
dium, silver, &c., render the above insulators positive by friction ;
while the electropositive metals, zinc, cadmium, iron, &c., put them
in the negative condition.             An almost never-failing example is ebo
nite; rubbed, or rather gently stroked, with platinum it becomes
positive, while with zinc or iron it is negative.
    The action of amalgam is especially remarkable. So far as the au
thor's observations extend, it makes                             all

Now the    same physicistt has deduced the coefficients of friction of
several gases from the values of their coefficients of transpiration
found experimentally by Graham.       But as molecular weights have
but relative values, the previous equation can also only be used for
deducing relative values of the molecular sections r"t ; in what fol
lows, these are given for those gases whose coefficients of friction are
known.
  Let 7 and 7, be the coefficients of friction of different gases, m and
m, the molecular weights, u and u, the molecular velocities, r and
r, the molecular radii; we have from the                        above equation,

             ON THE POLARIZATION OF THE ELECTRODES.
                           BY M. J. M. GAUGAIN.
    In a note which l had the honour to lay before the Academy some
time ago (Comptes Rendus, Dec. 24, 1855) I have shown that the elec
tromotive force arising from the polarization of the electrodes has not
a constant value as was then generally believed.                  The force varies
with the intensity of the current and with the time; but with a given
electrolyte and system of electrodes there is a limit which cannot be
exceeded, whatever be the duration of the electrolysis and the inten
sity of the current.     This maximum value of the electromotive force
I have had in view in the researches of which I am about to give an
account.
    Several physicists have endeavoured to determine the part which
each electrode takes in the polarization, and have arrived at entirely
different results.    Poggendorff considered that each electrode played
an equal part in producing the electromotive force; Lenz and Savel
jew found, on the contrary, that the part of the cathode is greater
than that of the anode.       I endeavoured in turn to solve the question
by using, as in my previous researches, the method of opposition, ar
 ranged in the following manner.          In a cylindrical glass vessel I
placed a much smaller porous vessel, and filled both vessels with
the same liquid. The platinum plates used in the decomposition of
 the liquid were placed in the outside vessel, and I placed a third plate
in the porous vessel; this third plate, which is always outside the
 circuit traversed by the current, undergoes no polarization, and may
be compared successively with each electrode when they are polarized
 to saturation; this comparison gives the measure of the two polari
 zations—of the anode and of the cathode. The porous diaphragm
 protects the neutral plate from the hydrogen disengaged by elec
 trolysis.
    The following are the results    I obtained in this way in a series of
 experiments made on a mixture of nine parts by volume of distilled
 water and one part of sulphuric acid:—
            By the polarization of the anode . . . . . . . . 193

                                     both . . . . . . . . . . . . 350
    Within certain limits the quantity of sulphuric acid added to the
 water appeared to exercise no influence on the result, provided the
 proportion was not less than a certain amount; but when this be
 comes extremely small, the polarization of the cathode increases
 without any appreciable modification in the polarization of the anode.
 The following are the results obtained by electrolyzing pure water:–

   M. Matteucci has recently called to mind an experiment which he
made in 1838, and on which he considers himself justified in assuming
that the polarization arises from the gas adhering to the electrodes.
I think that the polarized metals should be regarded as fugitive
combinations of the metals and the gases; and I assume that in
polarization-elements, as well as in Grove's gas-battery, the electro
motive force is the affinity exercised on one of the elements of the
water by the gas united in some special way to a metal; there                                                          is,
