   The calcaire grossier does not always rest immediately on

sand.     We cannot state whether this sand belongs to the for

estimation, one of the most remarkable facts that our researches
have brought to light.
    The mode we have employed to recognize a bed already
observed in one district, is the nature of the fossils contained
in each bed: these fossils are always of the same general cha
racter in corresponding beds, and present very observable dif
ferences in species from one system of beds to another.        This
mode of   recognition   has not as  yet  deceived us.
   It must not however be supposed that the difference be
tween one bed and another is as marked as that between the
chalk and calcaire grossier. If it were so, we should have so
many distinct formations; but the characteristic fossils of one
bed become less numerous in the bed above            and either dis            it,
appear    in those above the latter,      are gradually replaced
                                                             or                                          by
others which had not before appeared.
   We now proceed          describe the principal systems
                                       to                       beds                            of

                  in           grossier.   The first and most in
ferior beds are the best characterized; they are very sandy,
often more sandy than calcareous.        When they are solid, they
decompose         the air and fall into powder: the stone also

   This green, earthy, and granular silicate of iron is only
found in the lower beds: it is not seen either in the upper or
white chalk, in the (plastic) clay, or in the middle or upper
beds of the calcaire grossier, and     presence may     its
                                                         regarded                      be

                                    the plastic clay, and conse
quently    the chalk. The prodigious quantity
             of                                       fossil shells,              of

   however, the principal characteristic     this system      beds;"
                                                                   of                        of
the greater part    these shells are more unlike existing species
                            of

                                   in
    Nummulites are found           this system
                                           in       beds.    They occur
                                                                   of
either alone       or
                   mixed with     madrepores    and     few shells. We   a
have found them near Villers-Cotterets,              the valley     inVau                    of

of   quartz which form this rock into          kind       conglomerate;

               that the   greater  part  are entire and well preserved,
that   they  are   easily  separated   from the rock, and that many
 of them have still    preserved    their nacre.
    The other systems                 of
                                beds are less distinct. The middle
beds still contain an abundance of shells.            We should notice
a  bed, sometimes soft and often possessing          green tint, whence
                                                                    a

    The third        upper system contains fewer shells than the

careous marls appear.    These divide into fragments, the faces
of which are  commonly   covered by a yellow bloom and black
dendrites.   They   are divided by soft calcareous marls, by
argillaceous marls, and by calcareous sand containing chert.
We refer the bed in the Neuilly quarries to this system, in
which are found quartz crystals, rhomboidal crystals of car
bonate of lime, and small cubical crystals of fluor spar.
   This fourth and last system contains very few shells: in fact
the upper beds do not usually contain any.

     It is in this sandstone and at Beauchamp to the E. of Pi—
  errelaie that M.M. Gillet de Laumont and Beudant have ob
  served terrestrial and fresh-water shells (well characterized
 Limnei and Cyclostomat) mixed with the above-named marine
 shells.
     It results from the preceding observations: 1. that the fos
 sils of the calcaire grossier have been deposited slowly and in
 a tranquil sea, since these fossils occur in regular strata, are
 not mixed, and the greater part are in a perfect state of pre
 servation; notwithstanding the delicacy of their structure, even
 the points of the spiny shells being entire; 2. that these fossils
 differ entirely from those of the chalk; 3. that as the beds of
 this formation were deposited, the species changed, many dis                 s
 appeared, while new fossils took their place, which would ren
 der a long series of generations of marine animals probable;
 and lastly, that the number of species continually decreased,
 until they finally disappeared.
 2. On the Position      of the Fossil Bones of Mont de la Molière
        (Switzerland), by the late Mons. P. F. M. Bourdet*.
     The author commences with a description of the rocks
 in the vicinity of the mountain in question, which he visited
 in June 1823. “The beds,” he says, “are composed, 1. of
 vegetable soil; 2. of nine feet of a soft sandstone (nagel-fluh
 sand), which easily decomposes in the air; 3. of eight inches
 of a species of coloured fuller's-earth-marl, employed by the
 clothiers of the country; 4. of the same thickness of a hard
 calcareous sandstone; and 5. of a chocolate-coloured and hard
argillaceous marl. The remainder is concealed by fallen por
tions of the upper beds; the debris of a molasse sandstone.
Advancing towards the hill, the slope of which is very gradual,
two distinct rocks are seen beneath the vegetable soil; the first
    * From a notice in Baron de Ferrusac's Bulletin des Sciences, (a very
valuable periodical publication,) of the Author's paper in the Ann. de la     º
Soc. Linnéenne de Paris, Sept. 1825.
    “This memoir is highly interesting, as it presents us with a well authen
ticated instance of the bones of the hyaena, the elephant, the rhinoceros,
&c., having been found lower down in the series of formations than the    di
luvium, mixed up with marine, terrestrial, and fresh-water shells; a very
valuable geological fact, in addition to that, now some time known, of the
teeth of the mastodon (not the great species) having been discovered
among the lignite of some of the Swiss sandstones. Specimens of the lat
ter I had the pleasure of seeing at Prof. Meisner's at Berne a few years
since. As my friend Dr. Buckland intends elucidating this subject from
observations made in Italy, &c.,      I shall abstain from further remark.

second is a greenish-gray and very fragile molasse sandstone,
containing no fossils. The two rocks constitute the upper bed
of a much harder molasse, occurring nine feet lower down.

The calcareous sandstone, which is very hard, contains marine
shells of the genera Venus, Tellina, and Pyrula; among which
terrestrial and fluviatile shells are found, belonging to the

M. Bourdet describes the various specimens met with, a con
siderable part of which he found in the collection of M. Fon
taine of Friburg, in those of MM. Meisner and Wyttenbach,
and in the museum of Berne. The remainder were either ob
tained by himself or others, and have been deposited, partly
in the collection of Christian Frederick, hereditary prince of
Denmark, and partly in his own. Three plates, comprising
twenty-three figures of specimens, accompany the memoir. We
shall nothere follow him through the anatomical details which
he has entered into respecting each, but present the following
results at which he has arrived.
    I. Carnivorous Mammiferae. A species of Hyena, differing
         from those at present known.
    II. Pachydermata. An Elephant, of two different ages, ap
         proaching that of India;
         A Hog, which though young, was of greater size than
         those which at present exist;                    º
         A Rhinoceros, probably nearly approaching the Uni
         corn Rhinoceros of Java.       .
    III.  Ruminants.     An Antelope, as it would appear.
    IV. Various Bones.                     -                  .
    “The other remains of the bones of         quadrupeds   found in
 this place are,” says M. Bourdet, “too much mutilated to be
 recognized; the collection of Berne, however, contains some
 fragments of gallinaceous ornitholites, such as the remains of
 the tibia and femur.”
    “The remains of a land tortoise are here met with; as also
 those of fish, the best preserved of which are the teeth of
 sharks, &c., the palates of unknown rays, and cestracions.
 This is the first instance of the teeth of the latter fish, a na
 tive  of New Holland, having been found fossil. The other
 remains of fish consist of vertebrae and ribs.”
     “The remains of shells are the most abundant: those
 which we have observed belong to the marine genera Cytherea,
  Wenus, Tellina, Cardita, Pecten, Cama,         Buccinum,    Voluta,
  Turbo, Strombus, Cerithium, Bulla, &c. Among the terrestrial
 and fresh-water shells are Helir, Planorbis, Limneus, &c.

 and precision in his Monography of the Molasses of Switzer
 land.”           -

L'auteur pense, comme on sait, que dans le cas où les molécules.
fluides sont soumises                     à   leur attraction mutuelle suivant une
fonction quelconque de la distance, la condition ordinaire de
l'équilibre est insuffisante; mais la nécessité d'aucune condi-                                             .
tion nouvelle n'a été admise par les Géomètres; et j'ai refuté,
il y a près de trois ans, l'opinion de Mr. Ivory sur ce sujet,
dans un petit écrit* qui auroit pu mériter son attention.       Si
l'on excepte le cas où l'attraction est en raison inverse du carré
 des distances, et où il s'agit d'une couche fluide comprise
entre deux surfaces elliptiques semblables et semblablement
placées, l'auteur n'en citeroit peut-être pas un autre où sa nou
velle condition d'équilibre fût satisfaite; et même, dans ce cas
particulier, il faut observer qu'elle a lieu comme une propriété
des ellipsoïdes quelconques, solides ou fluides, et non pas
comme une condition propre à l'état d'équilibre des fluides.
Depuis la publication de l'écrit que je viens de rappeler, et au
quel Mr. Ivory n'a pas répondu, je n'ai eu aucune raison de
changer d'avis. Je pense encore aujourd'hui que personne n'a
démontré jusqu'à présent que l'ellipsoïde fût la seule figure
d'équilibre, excepté dans le cas du sphéroïde peu différent
d'une sphère qui a été résolu par M. Legendre.           En restre
ignant la question à cette forme particulière, on peut alors dé
velopper le rayon du sphéroïde en série convergente, ordonnée
suivant les puissances de la force centrifuge divisée par l'at
traction à la surface; et l'équation d'équilibre fournie par les
principes ordinaires de l'hydrostatique, suffit pour déterminer
successivement autant de termes qu'on veut de cette série. Si l'on
s'arrête aux deux 1º, comme dans la Mécanique Céleste, on
reconnoit immédiatement qu'ils appartiennent à la figure ellip
tique; mais il deviendroit de plus en plus difficile de s'en assurer
 à mesure qu'on pousseroit plus loin        approximations succes les
 sives;      qui n'est pas, ainsi que Mr. Ivory paroit
             ce                                               croire,                   le

sance des tems pour l'année 1826. A cette occasion, j'ai relu ce
 Mémoire et un autre qui en est le développement (Annales de
Physique et de Chimie, tome xxiii. page 337); et j'avoue que
je n'y airien trouvé d'inexact. Mr. Ivory en comparant la
formule (6) demon Mémoire a une équation qu'il a trouvée
d’une autre manière, pense qu’elles sont différentes l'une de
l'autre, et que cest la mienne quiest en défaut. J'attendrai
qu'il fasse voir en quoi le raisonnement qui m'a conduit a cette
formule seroit erronné ou incomplet; et jusques-lä je persis
terai a croire qu’elle exprime la variation de température qui
accompagne une très petite compression ou dilatation de l’air,
quand sa quantité de chaleur propre reste la même, ainsi qu'on
le suppose dans le phénomène du son, a cause de la rapidité
des vibrations du fluide; ou bien encore, comme cela a lieu
lorsque l'air est comprimé dans un vase fermé dont lamatière

            tics in the University of Cambridge.
    Sir,
    Ihave examined the note in your paper in the Phil. Trans.
 1826, but       I
              confess, without seeing much reason to alter my
opinion. In my paper to which the note refers,        limited my    I
investigation to homogeneous fluids, expressly setting aside
those of variable density as matter for future discussion. Your
paper is confined to the case of variable density, and your re
ference to a law restricted to homogeneous fluids appears                         in
considerate and misplaced, and looks as if you had gone out
of your way to find fault with what had written. I       do not             I
conceive that Science could in any respect be bettered by the
note, and ultimately it will be found that no advantage has
resulted from       You barely assert
                           it.            opinion without con

found a great trespasser on this occasion; but, for many years,
I have been very frequently attacked without rhyme or reason,
and with no regard to scruples: and this will,          hope, be                                          I
deemed a sufficient   apology  for any warmth of language, more
especially to a gentleman who, it appears from his paper, knows
full well to do himself justice.

             read in the last Phil. Mag., p. 447, induced me to

     The precipitate by heat was exceedingly bulky and not
  crystallized. It did not amount in general to so much as 3.8
  grains from 8000 grains of the solution. Indeed the mean of
  seven experiments        made upon different solutions was 2.5
  grains of precipitate.     But it was found that the amount of
  the precipitate depended much upon the time and agitation
  employed in effecting the solution, as it is difficult to saturate
  water with this salt.        It is evident, therefore, that not the
  mean but the greatest result will approach nearest to the
  truth.
      Phosphate of magnesia boiled in water for several hours,
  afterwards yielded solutions possessing this property. By the
  heat, the crystals assumed the appearance in the water of
  having effloresced.
      Phosphate of soda and sulphate of magnesia were added
  separately to solutions of phosphate of magnesia, in the pro
 portion of 10 grains to 1000 grains solution, without influ
  encing in the slightest degree the amount or appearance of
  the precipitate.
      Phosphate of magnesia appears to be much more soluble
  in the acids than in water; at least it was observed to dissolve
 with facility in the following acids, even when in a very dilute
 state—acetic, oxalic, phosphoric, muriatic, nitric, and sulphu
 ric. The addition of the smallest quantity of any of these
 acids to the aqueous solution, prevents the appearance of the
 usual precipitate by heat, by increasing the solvent power of
 the menstruum".
     In prosecuting this subject -   I had occasion to make several
 observations.                                                    -
     Mere continuance of the heat had no effect in increasing the
 amount of the precipitate, in the solutions of hydrate of lime
 or of phosphate of magnesia, provided no part of the solution
 was at any time converted into vapour.            When filtered solu
tions of lime and phosphate of magnesia, which had formerly
been heated, were again subjected to a temperature of 212° by
 complete immersion in the water-bath in close vessels, and
 retained at that temperature for several hours, no additional
precipitate appeared. But when heat of greater intensity was
applied to elevate the temperature of the solution to 212°,
this was seldom the case. When such a solution was heated
 by the flame of a spirit-lamp, even in a close vessel, a slight
precipitate generally appeared.          When the vessel, although

densed  in the upper part of the vessel and returned without
loss,-the precipitate might be increased ad libitum, particu

24             Mr. Graham      on Exceptions to the       Law
lieve that the deposit from slight boiling observed in many
 mineral waters, and generally attributed to the dissipation of
carbonic acid gas, depends in some instances upon this cause.
However weak the solution may be, it is evident that a por
tion of the salt may be deposited in this way.
   It had occurred to us as a method of determining the rela
tive solubility at different temperatures of bodies of this class,
to form a saturated solution at the lowest temperature, and
dilute it with water till it ceased to deposit at the high tempe
rature. But this method was found inconvenient from the
difficulty of incorporating the solution with the water added.
   4000 grains lime-water were diluted with 2000 grains water,
agitated and set aside for two hours. Upon being then heated
in the water-bath to 212°, a precipitate appeared, which being
received upon a filter and dried was found to amount to nearly
2 grains hydrate of lime. Phosphate of magnesia similarly
treated gave 12 grains of precipitate.
   4000 grains lime-water diluted with an equal quantity of
pure water, and occasionally agitated for three days in a stop
pered phial, became slightly turbid upon being carefully heat
ed in the water-bath, and deposited a small quantity of hy
drate of lime, of which 0:15 grain was recovered.             The so
lution of phosphate of magnesia in the same circumstances
yielded a precipitate, which although it rendered the solu
tion much more turbid, did not amount to so much.
   It was found, as might be expected from the previous ex
periments, that the deposit by heat from lime-water was not
diminished sensibly by being allowed to remain in the solu
tion till it became cool, or was not re-dissolved upon cooling.
Hence it is unnecessary to filter the solution while hot. The
phosphate of magnesia, however, appeared to be re-dissolved
in a more sensible degree, probably from the state of extreme
division in which it is deposited.     At least 2.3 grains of pre
cipitated phosphate of magnesia were obtained by filtering at
212°, while an equal quantity of the same solution, allowed to
cool with occasional agitation before filtration, gave a preci
pitate which did not exceed 2 grains. In appearance, the pre
                                                                       -
cipitate had suffered a very great reduction.                  …
   The rapidity with which phosphate of magnesia ºffloresces
when exposed to the atmosphere, led us, from theoretical con
siderations, to look for this anomaly in       itssolubility.    Efflo
rescence  in   the hydrates    of
                               the salts  certainly indicates weak   a
affinity for water atthe atmospheric temperature—an attraction
    affinity, too, which                             by
                                                     slight elevation
in or
                          is much diminished
   temperature.    If  the attraction  subsisting   between the salt
and water, when     in solution,    be   of
                                        the same nature       that be

tween the base and water, when in the state of a solid hydrate,
we might expect the striking power of heat in weakening the
affinity or attraction, to affect the solubility of the salt at dif
ferent temperatures.     Even supposing that the solvent power
of water increased to a certain extent with rise in temperature,
yet this rapid diminution of the attraction of the salt for water
as the temperature rose, might counteract and eventually over
come the increasing power of the solvent, in salts so efflo
rescent as phosphate of magnesia or sulphate of soda. Hence
the solubility of such salts might begin to lessen, when the
temperature was raised beyond a certain point.

26                     Mr. Davies's  Symmetrical
of the particles of    such bodies.     For if we examine the solu
bility of these bodies, we shall find it necessary to suppose, that
at no time is the simple substance itself dissolved, but always
an original and intimate compound of the substance with
water.     These compounds are of a higher order than the
 common hydrates, and frequently require peculiar circum
 stances for their formation. Silica is a good instance.        Dried
 and destitute of water it is altogether insoluble, and cannot be
 made again to form a solid combination with water, but in a
 state of previous and intimate combination with water it is so
 luble. It is evident then that the solution should be viewed
 not as a solution of silica, but as a solution of hydrate of sili
 ca. The alkalies are in the same situation; and the fact stri
 kingly illustrates our position, that when the alkalies dissolve
 in alcohol they are still in the state of hydrates. The combi
 nation between water and lime in slaked lime is of this supe
 rior kind, so that lime-water may be considered not as a so
 lution of lime, but as a solution of hydrate of lime. The water
 appears to be in more close union with the lime, than the water
 of crystallization of salts to which efflorescence is confined. It
 is therefore no objection to the theory that hydrate of lime is
 more soluble in cold than in hot water, and yet does not efflo
 resce.    Were the hydrate of lime to form a loose compound
 with an additional quantity of water, like the water of crystal
 lization of ordinary salts, then if that hydrate did not efflo
 resce, the circumstance would be inimical to the theory.
     The coincidence of efflorescence with diminished solubility
 at high temperatures, in the case of sulphate of soda, is fa
 vourable to the view taken of the connection between these
 properties.     If the solubility of the efflorescent salts were ex
 amined particularly, more of them probably would give indi
 cations of the same property.
     Carbonate of magnesia in crystals is very efflorescent, and
 according to Butini” it is more soluble in cold than in hot
 water impregnated with carbonic acid.

        lxv, page 38.,             of
                         the Philosophical Magazine, have                                      I
made mention            of
                   having registered several           observa
tions of the semi-arcs               of clock with dead beat  a                       a
scapement and deal pendulum.        Since that time have con                      I
siderably extended this series; and from which          appears                          it
that these arcs are     times at   unaccountably  variable,
                                                 so         that
for this reason   am induced
                    I               trouble you with some re
                                                     to
                        *    Communicated             by   the Author.
                                                                                                marks

          with a Dead Beat Scapement and Deal Pendulum.                          35
 marks on the subject, hoping at the same time that they may
 be the means of calling the attention of your readers to this
 curious circumstance, and which appears to be general in a
 greater or less degree, under certain atmospheric variations;
 and is moreover too important to be overlooked, in every case
 where great accuracy is required.
   These variations in the supplementary arc of vibration, are
in many cases of much greater consequence to the accurate
going of a clock, than theory would seem to point out; and
what is worse, perhaps no two clocks can be found, that, un
der the same circumstances of angular vibration, would have
their rates affected in an equal degree; as the thickness and
length of the suspension spring, the nature and accuracy of
the scapement, the weight of the pendulum, and the power
applied to keep the clock in motion,-all have a tendency,
more or less, to affect the result.
   With a given power, weight of pendulum, and dead beat
scapement, might not a suspension spring be made of such a
length and thickness as perfectly to neutralize the effect on
the rate, which would arise from an increase or decrease in
the arc of vibration ?
   Although I have in the paper above alluded to given some
account of the clock on which these observations were made,
yet perhaps it may not be amiss to say something more in
this place respecting          it.
   This clock has very perfect dead beat scapement, and the
                           a
train is   of the very best workmanship; the balance-wheel                       is
of brass, and the pallets            of
                                 steel: there         jewelling
                                                         is   no     any    in
part. The pendulum weighs twelve pounds, and                        deli   so
cately hung, that very small maintaining power                     at is
                                                                the pal
                       to a
lets    sufficient     keep        motion; there are two tangent
                                          in
                                                                     º
     is                              it
screws for adjusting the beat, and          graduated nut and index
                                                 a
for  regulating   the rate.
   Now from the observations which have made on the vi
                                                     I

                                      of         have found that they
                                                     I
are  at times regular,        nearly
                               or              so,
                                          for several days                       ;
and   on  the other hand, they are frequently very irregular, va
rying several times         the day, and that too, without any ap
                           in in
parent cause; but         general have observed the arcs most
                                           I
variable, when much cirri, cirrostrati, and highly electrified
cumuli appear        the atmosphere, and also
                      in                                      on

stormy weather; yet this          not always
                                      is       the case, for sometimes
the pendulum has          very unsteady motion even
                           a                                       in

serene weather.        Ihave also found that the same anomaly
takes place       clocks with recoiling scapements, and probably
                 in
in others   of  the most highly finished workmanship,            circum
                                                                    a

          with a Dead Beat Scapement and Deal Pendulum.                                                        37
    I shall now advert to the valuable    of observations made      series
by Col. Beaufoy in 1819, 1820, 1821 and part of 1822, on the
going of a clock with a straight-grained deal pendulum rod.
From these observations I am led to believe that the small
and sudden irregularities in the rate of this clock are not re
ferable to changes in the length of the pendulum, but to those
in the arc of vibration: for had the changes of the atmo
sphere affected the length of the pendulum, whilst the arc of
vibration remained constant, the clock would have gradually
gained upon       mean rateits                       as
                                   the summer advanced, and lost
as the winter  approached,      which does not seem          have been                      to
the case from these observations.          So that we may conclude
this pendulum rod         have undergone little
                                         to                 change du              or   no
ring the period        three  years
                                 of   and   upwards     that the daily
rate      of
        this clock was    registered.
   But      if      we
              take the differences        each succeeding daily rate,
                                                               of
as given    the tables for the deal pendulum, and compare them
                 in
with like differences      the daily rate,of    found       subsequent as              by

          observations made also
1825, with      teak pendulum, we shall find that
                      a                                       the latter

of  March, when                     its
                        daily rate was about two seconds,            the                                  to

     It has   been usual to refer to motion, instead   of force or
 power; but this is clearly beginning at the wrong end, motion
 being merely the result of the action of unresisted power. Our
 sense of feeling informs us that, motion is a consequence of
 our power being exerted so as to exceed the resistance.
    Force, denoting the intensity of the action of power, may
 be considered to flow equably or unequably with time; it may
 also be considered in relation to space, and to space and time
 conjointly. The variation with regard to time, do not re           I
 collect having seen considered.     Natural phaenomena should
 only be looked into for suggesting branches of research, not
as the objects and end of them; and whatever advantage it
may give to ordinary readers, their use in illustration should
be avoided; the Elements of Euclid in this respect should be    -
                                             -
an example to imitate.
    Might not the sciences relating to the mind equally profit by
attending to the mode by which we obtain our ideas of mo
tion? Could the system of Hume stand the test of such an                      in
quiry? even with the ponderous support which Brown has
endeavoured to place under it?       Have we not as distinct a
perception of the possession of power as we have of the order
of sequence?. The eye and the ear are not the only organs
of sense capable of affording us correct ideas; indeed, neither
of them could inform us of the existence of matter; and be
sides, these organs themselves, when examined, appear to con
vey impressions to the mind by an operation analogous to that
which conveys the perception of feeling, showing that no im
pression whatever is transmitted to the mind except by the
action of force, or power.          I
                                will go a step further, and ques

 VIII.       A further Account of the great Mass of Native Iron of
        Bitburg. By Messrs. STEIN INGER and Noegg ERATH : with
        Observations, by Dr. C. F. F. CHLADN1 *.
         HERE          is no doubt that the mass                       of native iron found in
      the vicinity of Bitburg, near Treves, weighing from 3300

 to 3400 pounds (mentioned in this Journal for 1825)+, which
 was afterwards through ignorance melted down, was of the
meteoric kind; since            Gibbs, of New York, has found
it to be similar to other meteoric iron, and to contain nickel.
For the first intelligence of the discovery of this iron I ain

tions given on this subject in the American Mineralogical
Journal, examined it more closely on the spot, caused the

stinguished as the precipitate of the solution, which is at first
of a greenish, and afterwards of a dark blue colour, and con
tinues so distinguished till it is mixed with the rest by a con
tinued stirring; at the same time pellicles of a purple violet
show themselves on the surface of the blue liquor.       I enter

     “Icould, however, discover neither lime nor magnesia in
the solution of the meteoric mass, freed from oxide of iron.
It appears therefore that metallic oxides only constitute the
scoria mixed with                   it.                                 -

                      on the Meteoric Iron                 of Bitburg.                                    45
ceive detached surfaces, angles, &c. of crystals no longer de
finable, but probably octahedral, which cover the surfaces of
the cavities in groups, and are partly melted themselves, and
covered over by a scoriaceous substance.           The latter forms
the black dull surface, which is perceived in the above-men
tioned state of brilliancy, wherever it became attached during
the original fusion in a purer form, and in the shape of
hemispheres.
   “The light-grayish-white substances which appear either
singly or in small groups incorporated in the surface like splin
ters in the shape of small angular grains, appear to me to be
too soft for quartz, and may perhaps be the same granular
body as that which forms the principal part of meteoric stones.
There are, however, too few of them in the fragment before
me, to allow of any certain decision on this point.
   “The pure meteoric iron of Bitburg itself is somewhat
lighter in colour than the melted mass. It is malleable and
softer than the latter; it may be splintered a little with the
knife.    It is possible that this difference arises from the un
melted substance having no admixture of sulphur, which may
have been added during the fusion by the intermixture of py
rites. There              is,
                    however,       appearance  no such    mixture      of             a                    in

   “Among the minerals which you will receive with the pre
sent letter, is a piece of native iron from Jiquipilco, ten leagues
north of Toluca. The existence of this iron, of which as yet
nothing is known, deserves to be further investigated.                   For
myself, although              I
                         have taken great pains respecting it during
my journey to Jiquipilco, I have not been so fortunate as to
find any of it in             its
                          original situation.              however known,It    is
that    a  rather large quantity was formerly found there                                                in
ploughing the fields, and that             was used for various instru

the compression derived from a comparison of the English
and French arcs is less affected by any small error that may
be supposed to exist in either or both of the measures of
these arcs, than equal or even smaller errors in those of                  In
dia and Peru, though the distance between the parallels of
the latter is greater than that between those of the former;

and the same thing is true of those in similar circumstances
with respect to the pole. Arguing on similar principles, it
will appear that the ellipticity derived from arcs bisected by
the tropics and polar circles will be entitled to the greatest
     .
confidence, as the length of a degree varies considerably at
those parallels, and they are sufficiently distant to counteract
any small error arising from a similar error in the measures of
the degrees. A great deal of discussion has taken place upon
this subject lately, and from which it may be supposed an im                     º
proved solution of the figure of the earth, whether from the                     -

Transactions for    1824,                               I
                          a new and, so far as am able to judge,
an  improved    solution of equilibrium of a homogeneous body
revolving about an axis.         Airy has endeavoured to extend
the               proposition called Clairaut's theorem, by                in
cluding the terms of the second order. In this investigation,
however, Mr. Airy has not included the second condition of
equilibrium, which Mr. Ivory has thought requisite, and assigns
as a reason the insufficiency of that gentleman's arguments.
    Several of the French mathematicans have also contro
verted some of Mr. Ivory's views on that subject, in which
perhaps prejudice and the authority of the late Laplace have
not been without their influence. Indeed, a very few only of
the first mathematicians are competent to enter with effect
upon such a difficult subject; and as Mr. Ivory has apparently
succeeded in solving the question in              its

 dition of equilibrium the difference would be great, though
 it is likely a slight difference might take place. Indeed, before
I   saw Mr. Airy's paper, I was in the habit of employing the
reduced or geocentric latitudes in the solution of this problem,
instead of the apparent or observed latitudes which have been
generally used. The difference, however, is not great in a
spheroid of small compression, such as our earth, and the em
ployment of the apparent latitudes increases in a small degree
the lengths of the computed pendulum near 45°; but the ef
fect upon the compression is almost insensible.        I shall not,
however, at present direct my attention to this method by the
pendulum of obtaining the compression, but proceed to con
sider that derived from the measurement of arcs.
    Mr. Airy gives the following table of the measure of arcs,
which are certainly the most extensive and accurate:

   The method of comparing large arcs has been said to be
the more accurate plan of arriving at a correct value of the
ellipticity, than by a comparison of single degrees; though it
is not likely to have any great advantage over a comparison
of degrees derived from the measurement of large arcs—As
a comparison of single degrees is more easily made than of
arcs, I    have deduced from the above arcs the value of a de
gree at the middle latitude of each.

       your insertion of the following errors and corrections
which have been pointed out to me by Captain Kater.        They
belong to a work of mine, entitled “Chemical Manipulation,”
which being intended for instruction ought not to contain such
errors uncorrected. Your insertion of the corrections will
tend greatly to prevent any harm arising from the errors, and
will much oblige, Gentlemen,

it of a proper length. A receiver for such a retort is made of a
piece of straight tube of larger diameter closed at one end. The
beak of the tube-retort is merely inserted an inch or more into the
 tube-receiver, the junction is left open, and the latter is cooled, if re

great quantity is suddenly volatilized each time the bottles are
opened, and from the instantaneous cold produced, the bottoms ge
nerally break and fall out: but if it be preserved in vessels like
those described, they may be of sufficient thinness to bear this sud
den depression of temperature without fracture, and may even be
cooled previously with facility by a piece of ice and a little salt.
Sulphurous acid may be preserved in such tubes in small portions
for single experiments, or if in large quantity, it is easy to distil or
transfer it as has been described. When used for sulphurous acid,
they must of course be retained in a refrigerating mixture during
the distillation, they must be continued in this mixture whilst the
 top piece is withdrawn, and also whilst the bend is given to them, if
 that be required.        It is also necessary that they be sealed when
 thus cooled, for it cannot be done after they are exposed to the air.
 The best method is to prepare the small aperture by drawing off
 the extremity, to lift the tube into the air, then to apply the flame

this is easily prevented by softening them near the centre in the
spirit-lamp, and then very slightly bending them. In washing pre
cipitates an inverted bottle of water is extremely useful: it supplies
the fluid as fast as it is wanted; and as it requires no watching, fil
tration may not only be performed during the absence of the ope
rator, but that cracking of the precipitate which occurs in many
cases when the filter becomes dry, is prevented.
    From the long extract which we have made, the reader will have
a sufficient opportunity of observing that Mr. Faraday's style is at
once simple and correct: there are however two passages which

the effects of dividing the nerves of the lungs, and subjecting the
latter to the influence of voltaic electricity. By A. P. Wilson Philip,
M.D. F.R.S.”
   When the nerves of the eighth pair, supplying the lungs, are di
vided, the animal breathes with difficulty, and speedily dies of suf
focation. If the lungs are examined after death, their cells are found
so completely filled with a viscid fluid as to obliterate them entirely,
as well as the air-tubes.   They sink in water, and from a descrip
tion  by Mr.  Cutler, which is stated at length by Dr. Philip, it ap
pears that they are rendered impermeable to injections. These par
ticulars having been described, the author states, on his own testi
mony and on that of various other gentlemen who have witnessed
the fact, that if the due degree of voltaic electricity be transmitted
through the lungs by those portions of the nerves which remain at
tached to them, no affection of the breathing supervenes, and the
lungs, after death, are found quite healthy, unless the electricity
has been applied of such power, or for so long a time, as to cause
inflammation, in which case the appearances on dissection are those
of inflammation, and not those produced by mere division of the
nerves.
     A   paper was also read, entitled, “On the change in the plumage
 of some Hen Pheasants. By W. Yarrell, Esq., F.L.S.” Communi
 cated by W. Morgan, Esq. F.R.S.
     The last shooting season having been unusually productive of hen
 pheasants, which have assumed more or less the plumage and ap
 pearance of the male, much discussion has in consequence arisen
 on the cause of this change; and the author, having had many op
 portunities of examining the facts, as respecting both the pheasant

 liarities which invariably accompany this transformation. According
 to an opinion of John Hunter and of Dr. Butter, this change only
 takes place at an advanced age; but Mr. Yarrell considers the facts
 in his possession as at variance with this idea, and that the appear
ances in question may occur at any period of life, and may even be
produced artificially.

        METEORITE WHICH FELL NEAR FERRARA IN 1824.
    This stone, like that of l'Aigle and most of the same nature, con
tains a great number of small globules of iron, which are ductile
and flatten under the pestle; it differs however in appearance from
other meteoric stones in containing small white grains, which are
supposed to be a peculiar substance, probably amphigéne.—It was
impossible to separate them by mechanical means from the other
substances which compose the stone.                         M. Laugier analysed the
meteorite with the following results:

    From this amount there must be deducted 92 of oxygen, by
 which the 30 parts of metallic iron that had been separated from
 the stone by the magnet, are in the analysis converted into per
 oxide;—this reduces the total to 95.3. This analysis shows that
 this stone is composed of the same elements as the greater number
 of meteorites, but that the sulphur and nickel are in smaller quan
 tity than usual.—Ann, de Chim. et de Phys. Feb. 1827.
                          COMPOSITION        OF IRON SCALES.
     M. Berthier in analysing the             above substances, concluded that
 they are composed of 2 atoms of protoxide of iron, and 1 atom of
 peroxide.       M. Mosander has examined the scales produced by
 exposing a bar of iron to a red heat: his results differ from those
 of M. Berthier;-the mean of three analyses gave
                              External layer.                         Internal layer.

     M. Mosander remarks, that deducting the silica and the prot
  oxide of iron with which it forms a silicate, the oxygen of the
  protoxide in the external layer is to that of the peroxide ::4:3,
 and in the internal layer :: 2: 1–Consequently, the composition
  of the external layer may be considered as 2 atoms of protoxide
 and 1 atom of peroxide, and the external layer as 3 atoms of prot
  oxide and 1 atom of peroxide.                     The composition of the first
  agrees exactly with that given by M. Berthier for the entire scales:
  this coincidence may be explained by the impurity of the scales,
                                                                                    which

 ascertained the composition of the two layers which form the scales,
 M. Mosander examined whether they were similar throughout: he
found the outer part of the external layer contained more peroxide
than the entire scale, viz. 52-77 instead of 34-65, but the second
layer, in contact with the iron, was found to be homogeneous
throughout.     It results from these experiments that these scales
are not  homogeneous;      that the first layer contains more peroxide
in proportion  to     nearness        its
                                   the exterior surface; but the second

     Native iron, on Canaan mountain, a mile and a half from the
 South Meeting-house.              This is particularly interesting, as it is the
 first instance in which native iron, not meteoric, has been found in
 America.       It was discovered by Major Barrall of Canaan, while
employed on surveying several years ago. It formed a thin stratum
or plate, in a mass of mica slate, which seemed to have been
broken from an adjoining ledge. It presents the usual characters of
native iron, and is easily malleable. For some distance around the
place where it was found the needle will not traverse, and a great
proportion of the tallest trees have been struck with lightning.
Whether these phaenomena are connected with the existence of a
large mass of native iron, I leave for others to determine; the facts,
however, may be relied on.

    Remarks by the Editor (Dr. Silliman).-There can be no question
but the native iron above described is a genuine production of the
earth; and that it holds no connection with meteoric iron.—The
mass bears the marks of a true metallic vein, it has smooth sides
 (saalbandes), and small specks of a blue and white quartz are
sticking in it; nickel, constantly found in the meteoric irons, is
absent from this specimen; and if it were a question whether native
iron be a true production of mines, this discovery decides it.—

              DISCOVERY OF FOSSIL HYAFNAS                           IN KENT.
   A most interesting discovery has, within these few days, been
made in this county, by John Braddick, Esq. of Boughton Mount,
of the fossil remains of an extinct species of hyaena and some other
 antediluvian animals, in the extensive quarries of Boughton, about
 three miles south of Maidstone. These quarries appear to have been
 worked for many centuries; and there is a tradition that many of
 the materials of Westminster Abbey, and other ancient buildings
 in London, were brought from hence; they have lately been ex
 tensively wrought by Mr. Braddick, for the purpose of erecting
 buildings on his estate.      The stone is designated most commonly
 by the name of Kentish Rag : it consists of a succession of beds of
 limestone and coarse flint dispersed in irregular thickness through a
 matrix of sand and sandstone;               its
                                        geological position        the lowest is     in
 region  of  the  green-sand    formation immediately above the weald
 clay. The remains         question consist
                          in                    the jaws, teeth, and broken
                                                        of
 portions  of  the skull,  together  with bones       the fore and hind legs
                                                                of

                                        a
    the ox and horse.       All these were found nearly together, within
 the space    ofa  few feet        in
                                 one          of

 (locally called vents) that intersect the strata         this place, and are
                                                                       at

 vents are hollow apertures          various sizes, some
                                        of                       which occa
 sionally expand themselves into caves: two such caves have lately
 been destroyed     inthe quarries            on
                                          the north side        the valley,  of                     at
 Boughton Mount.        These fissures       vents cut through the strata
                                                   or

numerous chalk-flints;        these last must have been drifted hither
from some distant hills, and have fallen into the fissures           the same        at
 time with the loam. This loam                          its

cisely similar to the bones of hyaenas and other animals, that were
discovered in the fissures of the break-water limestone rock, near
Plymouth, embedded in similar diluvial loam and pebbles. It is
highly probable that at Boughton, as was the case at Plymouth, the
caves communicating with these fissures will be found to contain
an abundance of similar bones.      Mr. Braddick's workmen say they
have frequently found them in his quarries, but always neglected to
preserve them; one fine head was thus lost but a few weeks ago:-
enough, however, has already been done to show that the hyaena
was among the antediluvian inhabitants of Kent, as it has been
proved to have been among those of Yorkshire and Devon; and it
is highly probable that if the proprietors of quarries in this country
will reward their workmen for preserving whatever teeth, or bones,
or fragments of bones, they may dig up in the course of working
their stone, many similar discoveries will soon be made. Professor
Buckland and some other gentlemen of the Geological Society of
London have this week visited Mr. Braddick's quarries, and en
tertain the most sanguine expectations that his further researches
therein will be attended with success.      Mr. B. has added materially
to the value of his    discovery, by  communicating    information of it
immediately to the Geological Society of London, as well as by pre
senting the specimens to their museum.—Maidstone, June 12, 1827.
 ON REGISTER       RAIN-GAUGES.      BY B. BEVAN, CIVIL ENGINEER.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
       Gentlemen,                         -
Observing on the cover of your Magazine for the present month
a request by one of your readers, relative to my rain-gauges, I take
the first opportunity of complying therewith, by giving the follow
ing specification of the several parts.
    The part usually called the gauge, we may distinguish by the
name    of the collecting vessel, which is in the form of an inverted
cone, with a base of 12 inches diameter: from the bottom of this
collecting-vessel passes a tube of about 4 of an inch diameter to the
receiving-cylinder of 6 inches diameter and 36 inches depth. In
the receiving cylinder is a copper float, of about 54 inches diameter
and about 2 inches height, having a socket on the middle of the
 upper side, to support a light rod of deal about 5 feet in length,
near the upper part of which is fixed a small frame with friction
rollers to support a black-lead-pencil; the pencil is kept upon the
rollers by a small weight, and is also pressed forwards by another
 small weight, against a sheet of paper which is fastened upon a brass
 cylinder of 2 feet in length and about 5 inches in diameter; the
brass cylinder is connected by a line and pulley wheel with a time
 piece, so as to revolve uniformly at any pace that may be required.
 The whole of the apparatus, except the first-mentioned conical ves
 sel, is placed under cover, where most convenient : the deal rod
 which carries the pencil is about 4 inches wide and 4 inch thick,
 and passes between two vertical guides, to insure the parallel posi
 tion of the pencil.
    From this description I presume it will be easy to comprehend
                                                                     the

the operation. Thus the moment the rain begins to fall into the co
nical collector, it is conducted by the tube into the receiving-cy
linder, and begins to raise the float, and with it the deal rod, with                                                                                               its

  MR.   squire's comparative observations of THE solar
                       ECLIPSE   of   Nov. 29, 1826.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
     Gentlemen,
In No. I. of the New Series of the Philosophical                               Magazine and
Annals, you were so good as to insert my observations of the solar
eclipse of November last; but having now the Greenwich observa
tions of the end of this eclipse, and being desirous of comparing the
observations taken at the two places, I have for this purpose made a
computation of the end at this place, and by which I find that my
observation agrees so well with the mean of those taken at Green
wich, that I am induced to trouble you with the results. In calcu
lating the end for Epping, (latitude 51° 41'41"–6, longitude 27 se
conds E. of Greenwich,) I have taken into consideration the sphe
roidical figure of the earth, and applied every other correction that
the present refined state of astronomy requires, the same as was
done in the computations for Greenwich.
   In the following summary of the calculations and observations,
the instants are given in mean solar time, according to the meri
dian of the Royal Observatory.

                                                                                              -

Ditto at Greenwich by ditto. . . .     . . . . . . .   ..      . . .   29          0     0        14 °55

Hence it  appears that, owing to the effects of the lunar parallax,
the termination of this eclipse at Epping was absolutely later than
at Greenwich by 12:9 seconds in the former case, and 12:45 in the
latter, making a second difference of only 45 of a second between
the computed and observed times at the two places; a nearer ap
                                                                           ---
proximation could hardly have been expected.

              Meteorological Observations for May 1827.                                                79
two halos of this large diameter have been seen here the last eleven years.
All these phaenomena, appeared in lofty attenuated cirrostrative vapour,
lowered agreeably to the sun's descent, and slowly disappeared as the va
pours moved off out of the refracting angles of the sun's rays.
   The atmospheric and meteoric phaenomena that have come within our
observations this month, are five parhelia, four solar halos, three meteors,
one double rainbow, lightning and thunder on three different days; and
eight gales of wind, or days on which they have prevailed; namely, one
from N.E., one from S.E., five from S.W., and one from N.W.

         XVI.      On      the   Royal Observatory at Palermo.
 A NEW         volume has just appeased of the Astronomical
**    Observations made at this celebrated observatory, edited
by M. Cacciatore. The preceding volumes were published
under the superintendence of the late illustrious conductor of
that observatory, M. Piazzi; and the present volume, which
may be considered as a continuation of that work, is the pro
duction of his distinguished successor.       The work contains
not only the observations made by M. Cacciatore himself, but
also the result of many observations made by his predecessor
not hitherto published. It extends therefore over several years.
As the form, in which the observations of Palermo are pub
lished, differs from that of every other observatory, and pos
sesses many advantages over the ordinary method, it may be
acceptable to our readers to see a brief abstract of the -con
tents of the present volume.
    Instead of presenting a regular journal of daily observations,
in the order in which they were recorded, we are here fur
nished with a number of interesting dissertations on various
branches of the science, arising out of the observations that
have, from time to time, been made.         The observations, re
lative to each subject, are selected and brought together un
der one head: first, the observations as they were made, and
as they stand in the observation book; secondly, as reduced
either to the day of observation, or to some other given epoch.
In this latter shape they are presented to astronomers in an
useful and tangible form; and can readily and instantly be
made use    of,    occasion may require.
                  as                                               -

                     the computed longitude; and              the computed         5°

noticed       other observatories; and which has been supposed
              at
to  arise from one        other or    the following circumstances:

 a bending of the metallic wires in the focus of the telescope:
 2° a bending of the telescope itself; each varying according
 to the temperature of the atmosphere: 3° a want of informa
 tion as to the true value of the mean refraction, or the correc
 tions to be applied thereto: -4° a modification of the rays of
 light by the action of heat. The first two he gives up as
 groundless: and to the last he does not attach much import
 ance.     With respect to the refraction, he has shown that it
 cannot, under any circumstances, account for the whole of the
 difference; although it is possible that a portion of that dis
 cordancy may be occasioned thereby. In order to set this in a
 clearer point of view, he has given a small table (which we shall
 here subjoin), in which is contained the amount of refraction
 according to the several tables of Piazzi, Carlini, Delambre,
 Young, and Bessel, on the day of the summer and winter sol
 stices respectively, for the several observatories of Palermo,
 Milan, Paris, Greenwich and Konigsberg.                    The altitude of
 the sun at each place, on those days, is added; together with
 the assumed mean state of the thermometer. The barometer
has been assumed equal to 29-6 inches.                These elements are
sufficiently correct for the comparisons proposed.

    It is evident, therefore, that the difference between the two
solstices cannot wholly arise from the tables of refraction em
ployed: and M. Cacciatore was consequently induced to ex
                                   M   2                                 tend

84.            On the Royal Observatory at Palermo.
tend his investigations as to other probable causes of this phae
nomenon.
    Amongst the various causes that might be assigned for this
remarkable anomaly M. Cacciatore imagined that the heat of
the sun on the circle might have the greatest effect: and he
has entered into an elaborate investigation of the subject with
a view to determine this curious point. We have not room
for a detail of the steps of the process pursued by this learned
astronomer: but it may suffice at present to state that, on the
presumption that the circle was divided at the temperature of
54°Fahr. (which, he informs us, was the case) the corrections
for the readings of the microscopes on the limb will be
        For  the summer solstice     = (t – 54°) x 0",06931
        For  the winter solstice    = (t  – 54°)   x  0",29133
By   the help  of these formulae, and the application of the me
thod of minimum squares, he finds the mean obliquity for
January 1, 1809, to be as under: viz.
    From the summer solstice = 23° 27' 51",57                340 obs.
    From the winter solstice = 23 27 51 ,75                  182 obs.
whence he deduces the mean obliquity, regard being had to
the number of observations, to be on January 1, 1809, equal
 to 23° 27' 51",64.    He then compares this result with the de
 terminations by other astronomers, reduced to the same epoch,
 which are as follows; viz.
                                       Mean Obliq. Jan. 1, 1809.

    M. Cacciatore next investigates the subject of the annual
 diminution of the obliquity of the ecliptic, and deduces the fol
 lowing results from a comparison of the observations of the
  under-mentioned astronomers: viz.
                  Piazzi  . . . . . . .   =   0",4546

                  La Caille   . .  . . .   = 0,4650
  The mean of these is 0",4522, but M. Cacciatore is disposed
  to reject the result deduced from La Caille's observations;
  which will therefore reduce the value rather below 0",45.
                                                                      He

   He next discusses the subject of the nutation of the obli
quityof the ecliptic; and by comparing the several observa
tions of the solstices from 1791 to 1821, he obtains the quan
tity 9", 12. By a different mode however of investigating the

                                   is           almost identical with   is
that deduced           by
                      Dr. Brinkley, and which has been assumed
by   the Astronomical Society          London,          of

    From the solstices M. Cacciatore proceeds             the determi                      to

  Several other similar instances might be adduced of an ap
 parently variable proper motion: we shall select however only
 one more, which seems to be the most remarkable.             It is the
 case of 67 Ursae Majoris:  the  proper    motion of which appears
 to be as under: viz.            AR in arc.               D.

              1813 to 1819 = — 1,480                   0,000
 This  subject is certainly a very curious and interesting one,
 and is deserving of more minute inquiry and investigation:
 but we very much doubt whether the observations of Bradley
 or Piazzi (setting aside those of Mayer, La Caille, &c.) were
 made with sufficient accuracy to serve as the foundation for
 such a minute investigation. These remarks are not made
with a view to diminish the fame of those excellent observers,
whose characters stand too high to be thus affected; but when
 we see that the best practical astronomers of the present day,
with the most perfect instruments that ever were made (far
superior to any that could have been possessed by their pre
decessors), differ from each other, not only one or two, but
sometimes as much as four and five seconds, in the position of
a star, both in right ascension and declination, we may fairly
hesitate in assenting to the conclusions which are intended to
be inferred from these comparisons.         There are moreover too
many discordant elements in the reduction of observations, too
                                                           *
many circumstances to be attended to in the steps of that pro
cess, to induce us to assent instanter to the results which are
thus laid before us. The detail of the method pursued in such
cases cannot be too explicit, where the differences are so mi
nute, and the results so important.       It is not enough to com
pare one reduced catalogue with another reduced
                                                                unless

   unless we know that the same mode of reduction has been
  adopted in each, and the same elements employed in the com
   putations.
     The next subject treated of by M. Cacciatore is that of the
  six comets which he observed at Palermo.             These are the
  comets of   1821,  1822,  and  1824,  the comet of Encke in 1825,
  and another comet in      1825,   the return of which he also ob
  served in 1826.     The same plan is followed here as in the
 case of the planets.     First, the observations, as taken from the
  observation-book, are given in the order in which they were
  made.    The place of the comet is then reduced, and a sepa
  rate table is given of those reduced places: and lastly, the ele
  ments of the comet are inserted.                                      -
     The work is closed with numerous     meteorological   tables, from
  the year 1791 to 1825, both inclusive.         The state of the ba
  rometer and thermometer is taken four times in each day: viz.
 in the morning, at noon, in the afternoon and at midnight;
  and the names of the observers are given. We have also the
  maximum, the minimum, and the mean state of each instru
 ment for each month in the year, together with the days of
 the month on which each case occurs. Amongst the most re
 markable phaenomena recorded in the meteorological journal,
 we may notice several destructive earthquakes; in many of
 which the concussions were so great as to stop the pendulum
 of the clock: and in one instance, in 1823 (when several houses
 were thrown down and fourteen persons were buried in the
 ruins), the floor of the observatory opened, and threatened de
 struction to the building.
     Upon the whole, this work reflects great credit on the di
 stinguished astronomer who now conducts the observatory at
  Palermo.     The plan, although nearly the same as was pur
 sued by M. Piazzi, and therefore not altogether new, is dif
 ferent from the printed observations of other observatories:
 and is in many respects worthy of imitation.           For, although
 we would not wish to be considered as discouraging the print
 ing of observations in the order, and in the manner in which
 they are actually made, yet we are certainly desirous, in com
 mon with many others that are fond of astronomy, of seeing
 the reductions of those observations a little more frequently
 than we do; and, at        all          seeing the principal results

     Mathematics in the University of Cambridge.  By J. Ivory,

       Sir,
INthethelastletter I did myself the honour to address to you in
              Number of this Journal, I showed that the analysis
employed by Laplace in the investigation of the figure of the
planets is confined to rational and finite expressions of three
rectangular coordinates, or to such functions as can be ex
panded, by converging series, into expressions of the kind
mentioned.      I proved this from the nature of the development,
which   appears   to me to be the proper foundation of this ana
lytical theory.     But it has been usual to rest this doctrine on
Laplace's equation in partial differentials, Méc. Céleste, liv. 3",
No. 10, or on M. Poisson's proposition, Conn. des Tems, 1829,
p. 330 *, which are supposed to be demonstrated with I know
not what degree of generality. In order to remove every dif
ficulty, it therefore seems necessary to reconcile the two dif
ferent views that have been taken of this subject, and to prove
that the equation of Laplace, and the theorem of M. Poisson,
are restricted by the same limitation which the nature of the
development requires to be adopted.        To accomplish this end
is the purpose of the present letter, which I address to you
as a person not indifferent to the progress of this branch of
science, and, I may add, as the only one in England who
seems to have bestowed upon it the least degree of attention.

possible to oppose any objection, by a process of investigation
depending upon very delicate considerations, I chose to found
my reasoning, in the letter I addressed to you, on the nature
of the development. In that letter I have expressed myself
rather unguardedly with respect to M. Poisson's theorem: but
it would serve no purpose to enter upon any explanation of
these points; because the demonstration             have now given is                  I
equally clear and simple, and ascertains with precision the
nature and extent of this analytical theory.
    As it is now proved that the functions which come under the
method of Laplace are not entirely arbitrary, we have next to
inquire, how we are to distinguish them.             And first we may
suppose that y' is a function of three rectangular coordinates,

         Gentlemen,                                                                     -
        SENT  you a short paper a few days ago, and since that
    time I have looked into your last publication, which con
tains M. Poisson's remarks. I shall answer all his remarks
when l find leisure and inclination; but, in order to lessen
the work cut out for me, it may be proper to add here, as a
supplement to my letter to Professor Airy, what I have further
to say of Laplace's method of investigation.
   In M. Poisson's demonstration the arbitrary function y'                                                    is,
in  reality, treated       constant quantity. Assuming that the
                                as  a
said function       always
                      is    finite within the limits      the integral,                 of
 he  makes       constant while
                it                   and     vary    little from theirV
                                                                                of a
                                                        3'
initial values, after which       the increments  allthe integral are
regarded       zeros;
                as         that,    so
                                     fact, the demonstration       the
                                                    or in
                                                                                                        is
 same whether         y'       be     variable.
                                                                                                        #;

       The author then presents us with some reasons for sup
     posing that this equivalent of the calcaire grossier has taken
     some of the characters of the plastic clay, and proceeds;
       “That the calcaire grossier has here partly preserved the
     character of plastic clay is proved by the Cyprinae, which are
     common, and which are found in the latter in the Isle of
     Wight; the Astarte, a characteristic fossil at Antwerp, is fre
     quently found in clays, referred for the most part to the plastic
    clay. Many of the shells of the calcaire grossier of Antwerp
    belong equally to the plastic clay, or rather to the point of
    contact or mixture of the two formations.
       “Beds, therefore, exist in Belgium analogous to the lower
    part of the first marine formation (calcaire grossier) of the
    Paris basin, and these beds are in general characterized by
    the presence of silicate of iron, by sharks' teeth, Nummulites,
    many species of Astarte, Pectina, Cyprinae, Pectunculi, &c.”
       The author then describes the upper sands without shells,
    which he refers to diluvium, and notices the finding of ele
    phants’ bones in it at Antwerp, Vilvorde, &c.; and after men
    tioning the alluvial deposits, he adds:
      “A    tertiary basin exists in Belgium, bounded by chalk hills,
    which, quitting the coast of France, form a zone, as M. Prévost
    has noticed, that passes near Mons, Liége, Maestricht, &c.
    This basin appears to resemble that of the E. of England",
    and probably contains many beds equivalent to those of the
    environs of Paris. At Antwerp we have examined beds which
    appear referable to the plastic clay, the lower part of the
    calcaire grossier, diluvium, and alluvium.”

       Two cretaceous formations are observable in these islands:
    one the same with the chalk of England and France; the other
    apparently analogous to the plastic clay or calcaire grossier.

   bed situated at a greater depth.
      The following rock occurs at the Klint, or cliff of Stevn.
   It is a true chalk, and constitutes the last bed in the cliff; it
  contains flint (silew) in a nearly horizontal position: there is
  however a slight inclination to the W.S.W. The most per
  fect regularity reigns throughout this formation, the beds of
  which are completely parallel to each other. To the chalk
  succeeds a bed of clay three or four inches thick, and then a
  limestone bed one foot thick.                The clay bed contains car

100                                          On the Coal Deposits
   The author draws the following conclusions from his ob
servations.—The cretaceous rock of Stevn is true chalk, and
the clay and cerithium limestone, plastic clay and calcaire
grossier.   He regards the limestone of Faxoe as a local de
velopment of cerithium limestone; the beds of clay in the
limestone of Stevn and Faxoe, and in the cretaceous rock of
Möen, as subordinate strata, developed in the great formation
of rolled stones, and formed at one and the same period, the-
commencement of the tertiary epoch.
                                    of the Prussian States”.
                 5. On the Coal Deposits
   The coal measures of      Upper   Silesia form masses on grey
wacke; the Tarnowitz limestone, in many places covering the
coal measures, is probably muschelkalk. There are four series
of coal-measure strata in Silesia, which have not been yet found
to agree with each other: the first and richest is the eastern
part; it extends from Sabrze, between Gleiwitz and Beuthen,
N.W. as far as Kostow, near Bremse. These beds, having
various dips, occupy a basin, and have a direction from N.W.
to S.E.; they are exposed for three miles and a half in length
and one in breadth:#.        A second series passes to the W. of
the preceding, from Nicolai on the W. to a mile E. of Rybnik;
it only occupies an extent of half a mile square, and is situated
in a basin. The coal measures reappear near Hultschin, on
the left bank of the Oder; they are highly inclined, with a                                              di
rection from N. to S. There is a coal basin in Lower Silesia
to the S.E. of the Riesengebirge, and to the W. of the Eu
lengebirge.                       Its
                    limits are half     mile     the N.E.    a  Land       to                 of

     6. Observations on Fossil Shells; by                          M. B.          de Basterot”.
    The geographical distribution of organized beings over
the surface of the globe, has long since furnished a subject
for the meditation of the naturalist. The limits of regions
occupied by different families of quadrupeds, oviparous ani
mals and plants, have been pointed out in a series of ingenious
observations.    The animals of a less elevated order have not
been observed, in this point of view, with the same attention.
The molluscous animals, so very abundant, so interesting by
the variety, the beauty, and the number of the fossil remains
which they have left on our continents, have been entirely
neglected in this respect.     Let us in imagination transport a
naturalist on an unknown shore, covered with the remains of
arborescent ferns, palms, gigantic Gramineae, the bones of
elephants, tigers, hyaenas, &c.; would he not immediately re
cognize the productions of the torrid zone? But            this coast                      let
 be alone covered      the     by
                           productions      the sea,              of

and zoophytic animals; would they reveal           him the climate           to
             of he
in  which     was placed?        should think not; for though the

frequency      univalves may have been remarked between the
tropics,    among fossils, we are far from possessing general
           as

                              this subject.

come sufficiently advanced to furnish us with numerous and
well-authenticated facts.”     Now this knowledge of species is
almost   entirely wanting as respects the Mollusca.     It is but a
short time since, that the search for shells has become, from a
simple amusement, the study of scientific men: it was only
after the period when it was perceived that geology and an
cient zoology were destined to be enlightened by their fossil
remains, that this research passed from the hands of amateurs
into those of naturalists.     From this period, the number of
fossil species observed by naturalists and inscribed in their
catalogues, has increased with astonishing rapidity.
    The thirteenth edition of the Systema Natura cites only
fifty-three species as found in a fossil state, ten of which were
analogous     to those at present existing. At the moment                                     I

  geological phaenomena.          Curious resemblances will, I have
  no doubt, be found to exist between these two distributions;
  and though fossil shells do not lead (as has been observed) to
  equally exact results in solving the different problems relating
  to the ancient zoology of our planet, with the remains of large
  quadrupeds, they may, it appears to me, afford a firm support
 for those deductions, which arise out of the examination of the
 other classes. Shells are, moreover, indefinitely more abundant
 than bones in the beds of the earth; they are often the only
 remaining documents to enlighten us respecting those changes
 which have taken place in the existence of living creatures
 since the formation of the globe. Shells have, in fine, the ad
 vantage of being in a great measure found in those situations
 which have given them birth, and thus remain the incontesti
 ble proofs of the presence and retreat of the sea. A striking
 example of this will be seen in the fresh-water limestone, no
 ticed in the course of this memoir. These limestones, formed
 in the first instance in waters filled with Limneae and Planorbes,
 have been abandoned by them; the sea has afterwards covered
 them, and the inhabitants of that sea, Pholades, Saricava, and
 other similar shells, have fixed their dwellings in                       third          it:   a
 revolution has arisen, the sea has retired, and left them dry                                            in
 that place where we now study them.

species are distinct or are mere varieties, and he will find very
few means of answering this question.
   The difficulty here offered is of a very special nature, and
deserves particular attention.          This difficulty consists in the
variation in form observable           among     shells, both living and
fossil, when we examine the same species obtained from dif
ferent situations.
   We never, it may be affirmed, observe perfectly identical
species, either on the surface of the earth (at least in the more
recent beds) or on the coasts of our present seas, in situations
separated by considerable horizontal distances, or even simply
distinct from a difference in the nature of the rock or waters;

 they do, the forms of our domestic animals and cultivated
 plants; would not the differences of bottom, depth, tempera
 ture and agitation of the waters in which they live, vary the
 inhabitants of the sea?
    It may not, perhaps, be useless to state an opinion here,
 which an examination of many shells contained in the more
 ancient beds has enabled me to entertain: I have observed an
 uniformity in their exterior characters not found among those
 from the more recent rocks, an uniformity which becomes the
 more striking, as the total number of species diminishes; in
 other words, that identical species are the more generally spread
 in direct proportion to the antiquity of the rock containing
 them *.
    In fact, the transition limestone of England, France, and
 North America, presents us with the same species of Trilo
 bite.    Impressions, very remarkable for their forms and as
 sociation, are found with the same characters in the transi
 tion slates of Wales, Northumberland, Finisterre, the Co
 tentin, the Ardennes, the Hunsdruck, the Hartz, the county
 of la Mark (Colombia), New York (Pennsylvania), and the en
 virons of lake Oneida, in North America.            I should not, how
 ever, omit noticing that an attentive examination of fossils from
 the carboniferous or mountain limestone, in places distant
from each other, has not presented me so perfect a resem
blance; yet identical species are still found in Ireland, En
gland, the Pays-Bas, France, and Norway. The species should,
 however, be more varied in this than in a more ancient rock,
even according to the rule              I
                                    have proposed.

    The catalogue which have formed of the fossil shells of the
environs of Bordeaux, is not, doubtless, perfectly complete;
it is however sufficiently so, to give rise to some remarkable
approximations in ancient zoology.
    It is there seen, that, notwithstanding the loose nature of the
beds in these environs, notwithstanding the resemblance they
still bear to a coast recently abandoned by the waters, the
Bordelais soil owes          its
                            origin          to

    It is in the more recent fossil deposits, but distinct from
the   products   of our present seas, that we find a much greater
analogy as to species.         It will be seen that even in these more
ancient times horizontal distances exerted an appreciable              in
fluence.     Taking the Gironde basin as a centre, it will be
observed that the shells of similar basins the more resemble
each other the shorter the distance of these basins.            Thus out
of three hundred and thirty species collected in the environs
of Bordeaux, ninety are found in similar rocks of Italy; sixty
six in those of the environs of Paris; eighteen in those of Wi
enna, and only twenty-four in the tertiary basins of England.

 XX.    Plan for Mooring Ships in Roadsteads.                By Lieut.-
                  Colonel MILLER, F.R.S.*
 INto ahercountry whose attention has been so steadily directed
            naval prosperity as that of England has been, it may
 perhaps appear surprising, that some attempt has not been
 made, or rather that any means should have been left untried,
 for effectually securing ships in roadsteads; as every heavy
gale of wind is sure to be followed by an account of vessels
driven from their anchors, on some part of the coast or other,
and too frequently accompanied with a melancholy catalogue
of loss of life and property. The only grand national works
that have been undertaken to guard against so great a cala
mity, are the breakwaters at Plymouth and Kingstown; but
however creditable these works may be to the nation, and
however well they may answer the purpose intended, their
great expense must be a serious obstacle to their ever being
generally adopted throughout the country.
  The following plan is therefore sub
 mitted with due deference to the public;
 and if it should be the means of saving
 a single vessel from shipwreck, the ob
ject of the writer will be attained.  It is
very simple, and will easily be under
stood from the figure. It consists merely              .
in securing a large buoy, by means of                  :
a block of cast-iron, so that it cannot
be moved by stress of weather, to which
a vessel can make fast, instead of letting
go her anchor.

   The buoy must be made abundantly strong, bound with
iron and coppered, as it will be subject to a heavy strain, and
may frequently be drawn under water.        A strong iron hoop
also passes round    its   centre,   to   which the chain and ring are

the buoy to rise to the surface at high water.
   In most anchorages the weight of the cast-iron block will
sink it sufficiently deep to prevent      being moved; but                 its
stiff ground,   where that may   not take place, piles must                                                          be in

sufficient       to

              the  larger  the   buoy,  with the   greater  ease would the
vessel ride.

YXII.           On the Volcanos          of Guatemala.                  By M. DEHUMBoldt.*
      HE volcanos of Central America are ranged successively
     between the mountains of Veragua, and Oaxada, latitude
11° to 16°. The gneiss and mica slate of Veragua connect
them with the western chain of New Grenada; the granitic
gneiss of Oaxada unites them to the Mexican ridge: this con
nection, however, is formed not by the volcanos themselves,
but by the mountainous land which surrounds them.       During
my voyage from Lima to Acapulco, I collected from the Spa
nish manuscript charts of John Morabda and other navigators
various particulars, which throw light on the situation of the
burning mountains of Guatemala with respect to the sea.
Most of these volcanos are inserted by Bauza, with an accuracy
peculiar to himself, in the Carta es<U+017F>erica del Mar de las An
tillas, 1805, and in the Carta es<U+017F>erica desde el Golfo Dulce
hasta San Blas, 1822: yet Von Buch very properly remarks in
his classical work on the Canary Isles (1825, p. 406—409),
that William Furnel, Dampier's mate, discovered at the early
period of his voyage almost        that we know         all
                                                       them                             of             at
present.
 I   shall pursue the series from S.E.          N.W.,       they are    to              as

tures.       Southernmost stands the Volcan de Barua, lat. 8° 50',
in the interior of the country, seven miles N.E. of Golfo Dulce;
it is called in the English maps Volcan de Varu, and placed,
I  believe incorrectly, far more to the east (under 84° 52' west
long, and 8° 25' lat.) in the province of Veragua. Next to
the Volcan de Barua comes the Volcan de Papagayo (lat.
10° 10'), not on the mountain of Santa Catalina, but five
leagues more to the north, scarcely more than 4% English miles
from the coast.
                                                                       #.
   East of the Volcan de Papagayo are three old burning
mountains, near the South shore of the lake of Nicaragua; viz.
the Volcan de Orosi, between Rio Zabales and Rio
the Volcan de Tenorio; and the Volcan del Rincon de la
Vieja, the last of which is in lat. 10°57', and only 1° 35' west
of the mouth of the Rio San Juan in the Atlantic Ocean. The
great crater-lake of Nicaragua seems to me to have been
produced by some phaenomenon connected with this peculiar
eastern site of the Volcan de la Vieja.
   North of the city of Nicaragua, on the isthmus between the
Lake and the sea-coast, between 10° 30' and 12° 30' lat. some
uncertainty still prevails in the synonomy of the volcanos.
Juarros the historiographer of Guatemala, and Antonio de la
Cerda, Alcalde de la Ciudad de Granada, whose manuscript
maps     Ipossess, adduce merely; 1. Volcan Mombacho, on a
mountain a few leagues south-east of the city of Grenada;
                                                 .
2. Volcan de Sapaloca, in the lake of Nicaragua, opposite
Volcan de Mombacho; 3. Volcan de Masaya, between Ciudad
de Granada and Ciudad de Leon, near the little lake Masaya
west of the Rio Tepetapa, which connects the Laguna de Leon
or Managua with the Laguna de Nicaragua; 4. Volcan de
Momotombo, at the north end of Laguna de Leon, rather to
the east of Ciudad de Leon. According to this nomenclature,
the Volcan de Granada, of which Funnel and Dampier speak,                              .
describing it as being in the form of a beehive, is omitted in                   all
the Spanish sea-charts.       From    passagea   Gomara (Historia

                               it           be that Volcan de Ma

Of these twenty burning mountains, those of San Miguel, San
Vincente, Isalco, San Salvador, Pacaya, the Volcano de Fuego
or de Guatemala, Atitlan, and the Volcano de Sapotitlan, have
hitherto been the most active.       The volcano of Isalco had
  reat eruptions   in April 1798, and from 1805 to 1807, when
the flames often came in sight.     It is particularly rich in am
monium *.
    The volcano of Pacaya lies three miles from the village of
Amatitlan, and consequently east of the Volcano de Agua.
It is not so isolated as the latter, but is prolonged into a vast
ridge with three apparent summits.         Streams of lava (which
the inhabitants here as well as in Mexico call desert-land
(mal pays), pumice, scoriae and sand, have laid waste the sur
rounding country. At the end of the sixteenth century (ac

most part, and sometimes are considerably bright; they are
externally of that colour which is termed smoky or brown
quartz, and may generally be separated from the limestone
readily, leaving a cavity exhibiting their precise form. . . .
    In order to observe as accurately as possible the interior
of these crystals,     I  attempted to break them across the prism,
at   right   angles    to the axis.     I found,
however, that they would yield only in
directions parallel, or nearly so, to one
or other of the planes of the pyramid, as
is the case with common quartz. The
annexed sketchexhibits a cleavage in that
direction, and, generally speaking, also
 the aspect of the plane produced, which
 appeared to consist of alternate and con
 centric prisms of smoky quartz, which
 in thin fragments is highly translucent,
 and of gray, opaque, and somewhat gra                        -
 nular limestone.
     On applying a drop of diluted muriatic acid to the fractured
 surface, a brisk effervescence immediately ensued along the
 parts which are of a gray colour, satisfactorily proving the
 presence of limestone, and inducing a hope that it might thus
 be possible to dissect the crystal, by separating the smoke-co
 loured layers of quartz from each other: but in this was dis  I
  appointed; for the effervescence soon ceased, and                I could
  not  procure   a renewal of it for     any   considerable  time,  by  re
  placing the first by a second quantity of diluted acid; and the
  result of leaving the fragments in it for a week or two was,
  that the gray parts of the crystal became visibly cellular, and
 so soft as to admit of being scraped away by the point of
  a knife, leaving a little channel between the lines of brown
  quartz.
     The annexed sketch, though not an absolutely faithful por
  trait of a crystal in my possession, shows the fact, that the whole
  consists of a minute central crystal of quartz surrounded by
  four thin layers of the same mineral, separated by a gray sub
  stance constituted in part of limestone.            The outer coat of
  brown    quartz   is  generally  thicker than the layers within
                                                                         of

XXV.     On the Origin of the Power of suspending Respiration,

To     determine the nature and conditions of that power which
      certain species of aquatic animals possess of suspending
respiration for a considerable time, has long been an interest
ing object of physiological investigation; but the most accurate
observations and ingenious experiments seem hitherto to have
failed in removing the obscurity in which this singular phae
nomenon is involved. Can this #". arisen from the erroneous
direction in which research has been conducted; or can it re
                                                                                               .

                                     of
   We observe certain diving animals that breathe through

 be  necessarily and immediately fatal        land-animals    similarly

                      are then too hastily disposed         infer, that         to
this singular faculty which aquatic animals possess, must de

these animals possess of supporting life, not merely like the

 become more highly oxygenized; and that hence the brain
being temporarily more highly excited, could not at once bear
so long a continuance of the venous influence.           I have re
peatedly ascertained that the dark venous blood of the seal
 when exposed to oxygen, as speedily assumes the arterial hue
 as that of any other animal.
    To a certain extent also, this capacity of suspending respira
 tion is under the influence of habit, as we see exemplified by
 those individuals, even of our own species, engaged in the
 pearl-fisheries. And moreover, this faculty even in aquatic
animals is limited, and differs in the different species; for be
 yond a certain period they, like land-animals, are unable to
 remain under water.        I have repeatedly seen seals taken in a
 net; and when not allowed to come to the surface to breathe,
life became extinct generally in less than a quarter of an hour.
 In this case, it is true, the violent struggling to get loose would
naturally abridge the period during Which they could remain
 under water in a tranquil state, which       I should believe to be
 somewhere about twenty minutes.
    The young of the great seal, like the young of the other
species of Phoca, is brought forth on land, and must remain
there a month or six weeks before it can live in the water.
 If  before this period it be thrown into the sea, it exhibits as
much anxiety and awkwardness as a young dog, and cannot
remain longer, without inconvenience, under water.              The
young of the common seal, on the contrary, follows the mother
to the water immediately it is born, and swims and dives with
 ease and perfection; a difference so strongly marked and so
decidedly established, as in my opinion sufficient to constitute
among others a most important feature of specific distinction
between them.
    With respect to whales,       I have been often assured by   in
telligent Greenland shipmasters, that they have been fre
quently known to remain upwards of an hour under water;
and this also accords with my own observation.           The differ
ence therefore in this faculty which we remark in different
kinds of aquatic animals, and between these and land-animals,
seems more to consist in degree than in kind.

most delicate test objects, it was impossible to decide the
question of superiority between J. J. Lister's microscope, and
that which the profound and skilful optician of Modena, had
with him during his late visit to this country; although the
professor most obligingly afforded every facility for the trial.
   Most of the observations of which I am about to speak, were
made in the course of the last spring, when my friend not
 merely favoured me with the use of his instrument, in order to
ascertain the accuracy of some recent microscopic examina
tions, but took upon himself a very active part in the inquiry.
   As we hope, before long, to give a detailed account of our
investigations,        I
                  shall on the present occasion confine myself
to an outline of the facts.
     Particles   of the Blood.—In our examination of                 these   cor
puscles,  we have in vain looked for the globular form attri
buted to them, not only by the older authors Leeuwenhoeck,
Fontana, and Haller, but still more recently by Sir Everard
Home and Bauer. Our observations are also at variance with
the opinion long since formed by Hewson, that these particles
consisted of a central globule inclosed in a vesicle composed
of the coloured part, and which, though refuted by Dr. Young,
has since, in a modified. form, been revived by Sir Everard
Home and Bauer in this country, and by Prevost and
Dumas on the Continent.      We have never been able to per
ceive the separation of the colouring matter, which our coun
trymen have described as taking place in a few seconds after
the particles have escaped from the body; nor can we with
Prevost and Dumas, consider the particles as prominent in
the centre.
  The particles of the blood must unquestionably be classed
amongst the objects most difficult to examine with the micro
scope; partly from the variations of form to which their yield
ing structure renders them liable, but still more from their
being transparent and composed of a substance which, as Dr.
Young has remarked, is probably not uniform in                 its   refractive
power.
   These causes of error we have endeavoured                  to
                                                        counteract
by  varying the mode              of
                             observation.     We have viewed the
particles both wet and dry, both              as
                                          opaque and       transpa as
rent objects, under every    variety    power
                                            of and  light,  and we
lay   nostress        on
                  observations which have not been confirmed
 by frequent repetition.               -                         -
   To      us
           the particles         of
                            human blood      appear           to
                                                         consist              of
circular flattened transparent cakes, which, when seen singly,
appear      to   nearly
                 be         quite colourless.
                                 or             Their edges are

132   Dr. Hodgkin and                J. J. Lister's     Microscopical Observations
rounded, and being the thickest part, occasion                              a depression   in
the middle, which exists on both surfaces.                                  This form   per
fectly agrees with the accurate observation of Dr. Young, that
on the disks of the particles there is an annular shade, which
is darkest on that side of the centre on which the margin is
brightest. Though the Doctor drew the obvious conclusion
that the disks were concave, he does not consider the fact as
demonstrated; since the appearance might be produced by a
                                - of different parts of the cor
difference in the refractive power
puscle.
    This objection we think completely met;
    1st. By their reflecting the erect image of any opaque body
placed between them and the light, precisely as a concave lens
                              -
would do.
   2dly. By the appearance presented by the particles when
viewed dry, as opaque bodies. When illuminated by the whole
of the Leiberkuhn, the entire margin is enlightened, and in
most of the particles there is besides a broad inner ring of
considerable brightness; whilst the centre, and the space be
tween the two rings, is completely dark.      On half the Leiber
kuhn being covered, the rings are reduced to semicircles, the
outer one being opposite to the light side, and the inner to the
darkened side of the speculum.
   3dly. When fluid blood having been placed between two
slips of glass, the particles happen to be at right angles to
the surfaces of the glass, so as to be seen in profile, the two
concave surfaces are visible at the same time, or alternately,
but more distinctly, if the particles slightly vacillate.
   The concavity of the disks      however, extremely trifling;
                                                 is,

The thickness of the particles, which is perhaps not so uni
form as the diameter of the disks, is on an average to this latter
dimension as 1 to 45.
   The form and size of the particles of the blood of other
animals have frequently been compared with those of man.
Many observations were made for this purpose by Hewson;
but while some of them appear tolerably accurate, others are
decidedly far from the truth. Those which have recently
been made by Prevost and Dumas, are the most extensive and
complete which as yet exist.            Our attention having been
chiefly taken up with the blood of man, we have not as yet
carried our investigation of that of other animals so far as we
                                                                                         of all

134   Dr. Hodgkin and    J.J. Lister's Microscopical Observations
less central globules which have been strongly insisted on by
 Sir Everard Home and Bauer, and by Prevost and Dumas,
and which have been regarded not merely by themselves, but
by other distinguished and intelligent physiologists, as con
stituting by their varied combination the different organic tis
sues.    The separation and detection of these globules is stated
to be facilitated by some of the means which effect the changes
to which I have alluded; but, as I have already stated, we have
                                                           -
in vain looked for these globules.
   After blood taken from the living body has been kept a suf
ficient length of time for an alteration in the form of the par
ticles to commence, and this according to circumstances will
be from a very few hours to one or more days, the first change
which we have noticed is a notched or jagged appearance of
the edge of a few of the particles.     The number so modified
 continues to increase: some of the particles lose their flattened
form, and appear to be contracted into a more compact figure;
 but their outline continues to appear irregular and notched,
and their surfaces seem mammillated. Hewson and Falconar
appear to have accurately noticed this change, and have com
 pared the particles in this state to little mulberries. When
 more time has elapsed, most of the particles lose this irregu
larity of surface and assume a more or less perfectly globular
form, and reflect the image of an interposed opaque body as
a convex lens would do. Some of the particles resist these
changes much more obstinately than others.
    If a small quantity of blood be placed between two pieces of
glass, which are afterwards pressed together with some force,
several of the particles, however recent the blood, will be ma
terially altered.   The smooth circular outline is lost, and as
in the former case, they appear notched.         A few seem to be
considerably extended by the compression.           When the sur
face of the particles has in this way been broken into, the rup
tured part exhibits an adhesive property capable of gluing it
to another particle or to the surface of the glass; but the par
ticles in their natural state, though often drawn together or ap
plied to the surface of the glass by the force of attraction, seem
to be nearly or quite void of adhesiveness.
   There is scarcely any fluid except serum which can be mixed
with the blood without more or less altering the form of         its
particles, probably in   consequence  of  some chemical change.
In   this general result our observations accord with those      cf
Hewson and Falconar, whose experiments         of   this kind were
very numerous.      We differ in   some of  the  particulars, butI
reserve the detail of  these fora   future occasion. There  is  no
fluid which, when mixed with the blood, produces more re
                                                      a

markable and sudden alteration in the appearance of the par
ticles than water does. With a rapidity, which in spite of
every precaution, the eye almost invariably in vain attempts
to follow, they change their flattened for a globular form, which
from the brightness and distinctness of the images which they
reflect as convex lenses, must be nearly perfect.
     Contrary to Sir Everard Home's remark, that the particles
in their perfect and entire state are not disposed to arrange
ment, it is in this state only that we have found them run into
combinations, which they assume with considerable regularity.
In order to observe this tendency of the particles, a small
quantity of blood should be placed between two slips of glass.
In this way the attraction exerted by one of the pieces of glass,
counteracts that of the other, and the mutual action of the
particles on each other is not interfered with, as is necessarily
 the case when only one slip is employed.
     When the blood of man, or of any other animal having cir
cular particles, is examined in this manner, considerable agi
 tation is at first seen to take place amongst the particles; but
 as this subsides they apply themselves to each other by their
 broad surfaces, and form piles or rouleaua which are some
 times of considerable length. These rouleaua often again com
 bine amongst themselves, the end of one being attached to the
  side of another, producing at times very curious ramifications.
     When blood containing elliptical particles is examined in
 the same manner, it exhibits a not less remarkable but very
  different mode of arrangement.        Though they are applied to
 each other by some part of their broad sides, they are not so
 completely matched one to another, as is the case with circular
  particles; and instead of placing themselves at right angles to
  the glass, with their edges presented to           its
                                                     surface, they are

by the long range of mountain-limestone which, from Ingle
borough to Castle Carrock fell, presents to the west an escarp

140             Mr. J. Phillips on the Direction
low the range of oolitic rocks between Thirsk and Pockling
ton, and commonly in gravel-pits and on the surface of the
country around York.       But this is by no means their eastern
limit; for I have observed them of great size at several points
on the Yorkshire coast between Redcar and Scarborough,
where they are very plentiful on the shore, and are occasionally
found inland, as about 300 feet high in cutting a new road
toward Hackness, on the hill side above Scalby: and, to com
plete the evidence, they are seen lying on the cliff at Flam
borough head, above 100 miles from their native situation.
   An observer stationed on Shap fells sees the country to the
north and east a good deal lower than the point where the
granite appears in situ, and may therefore feel no particular
surprise that blocks should have been transported into the
vale of Eden; nor does it appear strange that they should
have followed the vale of Lune to Lancaster. These effects
might possibly have happened in consequence of the bursting
of an elevated lake, according to Dr. Fleming's view ; but
that the bursting of such a lake, in the vicinity of Shap fells,
could effect the transport of granite blocks across the deep
vale of Eden, over the summit of Stainmoor, and down the
valleys and over the hills of Yorkshire, to Scarborough and
Flamborough head, I find myself incapable of admitting.
This case has always appeared to me decisive in favour of the
opinion, that the dispersion of gravel over large tracts is attri
butable to the deluge.
   From the facts above mentioned, I am induced to suppose
that the flood of waters, which rolled away blocks of granite
from Shap fells, moved principally in an eastward or rather
south-eastward direction; and that the dispersion of fragments
toward other points may have happened, in consequence of
contemporaneous     or subsequent minor currents, down the
valleys of Eden and Lune.
   The next rock, whose bouldered fragments I propose to
notice, occurs in situ on the precipitous sides of Carrock fell,
one of a group of Cumberland mountains lying to the north
east of Skiddaw.    It is a compound of white compact felspar
and   large-grained  dark hornblende, in variable proportion,
 with here and there some magnetic iron-ore.
   To the north, bouldered blocks of great size are seen some
 what thinly scattered between Hesket, Newmarket, and Bol
ton. I have noticed them near Kirk-Oswald, on high ground
 west of the Eden: they abound about Lowther Castle; and         I
 broke one large mass, which at the time     I considered to be a

day, they were able to work with candles, which they could not
have done had no good been done by the application. They threw
in a large quantity of the chloride when they began to work; but
finding themselves annoyed by the gas evolved, they neglected fur
ther application of it for the rest of the week: in consequence of
which, on the following Monday, a man going in with a candle was
severely burnt, and is since dead, . Next day the author sprinkled
more chloride; and the day following, a candle burnt in safety at
 the spot where the man had been killed. The same plan was con
tinued to be used in that spot, which was the only one in the mine
infested with the fire-damp. On April 6th, the chloride was dis
 used. On the 10th, a candle caused a strong explosion.       On the
 12th, the chloride being still disused, an explosion was again pro
 duced by a candle. On the 12th and 13th, the chloride was applied.
 On the morning of the 14th, no explosion could be produced by a
 candle. The chloride was again discontinued till the 18th, but no
 explosion occurred. On the 20th, a weak explosion took place, the
 chloride being still discontinued. The men not having been at work
 in the interval from the 6th to the 20th, the experiments were fairly
 tried.   The paper concludes with describing the method of using
 the chloride for this purpose.

    June 14.—W. J. Guthrie, Esq. was admitted a Fellow of the
  Society: and a paper was read, entitled, “On the ultimate com
  position of simple alimentary substances; with some preliminary
  remarks on the analysis of organized bodies in general; by W.
  Prout, M.D. F.R.S."
    This is the first of a series of communications on the same sub
 ject which Dr. Prout intends to present to the Royal Society; the
 object of the whole being to determine the exact composition of
  the saccharine, oily, and albuminous divisions in which the ali
  mentary substances of the higher animals may be comprehended;
 and then to inquire into the changes which are induced in them,
  during the subsequent stages of assimilation, by the stomach and
  other organs. In the present paper are given some preliminary
  observations on the analysis of organized bodies in general, together
  with the composition of the saccharine substances.         Dr. Prout ob
  served, whilst stating the difficulties attending the use of oxide of
 copper, as now employed in the analysis of organic substances, that
 it is not only hygrometric, but, like many other powders, also con
 denses air. He also found that when it was removed from the tube
 in which the combustion had been effected, and re-triturated and
  re-burnt, it almost invariably gained in weight: a circumstance
 which he ascribed partly to the combination of the oxygen of the air
 contained in the tube with the partially reduced oxide of copper.
     These sources of error Dr. Prout has been enabled to obviate
 by means of the following well-known chemical facts.               When
 we burn in a given quantity of oxygen gas a substance com
 posed of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen, one of three things must
 happen.      Either the volume of the gas will remain unchanged, in
 which case the hydrogen and oxygen must exist in the substance
 in the proportions in which they form water; or the volume may be
 augmented, in which case the oxygen must be in excess; or lastly,
 the volume may be diminished, when the hydrogen must exceed that
proportion. The author then proceeded to describe the apparatus he
employed for the purpose of determining the composition of vege
table substances on these principles; and also detailed some precau
tions necessary to be observed in the process, pointing out at the
same time some of                its
                            peculiar advantages, the chief  ofwhich   that
                                                                     is

                                                                          bein he

                                            in
the   proportions      which    they form water. These were statedby

consisting of carbon 44'44, and water 55.55. The other variety of
sugar was obtained from Narbonne honey, and consisted of carbon
36:36, and water 63.63. Between these two extremes, sugars of
almost every possible grade occur, analyses of some of which were
given. The next class of bodies considered, was the amylaceous;
and the author commenced with some remarks on the sense in which
he employed the term merorganized. He stated that he had satisfied
himself from many observations that the minute quantities of foreign
bodies found in             all
                          organic products, instead          being mechanically        of

    May, 11–There was read a paper “On the approximate places
 and descriptions of 295 new double and triple stars, discovered in
 the course of a series of observations with a 20-feet reflecting tele
 scope; together with some observations of double stars previously
 known.” By the President.              The author prefixes a few remarks to
 this   catalogue    of  stars,  in which he first explains why the places of
 the stars which it contains are probably materially more exact than
 those of his former catalogue, especially in right ascension.                      He
 then records some results of his observations, either in them
 selves considered, or in comparison of preceding observations of
 Mr. South, and some other astronomers. Thus the curious double
 star, AR 17' 52" I’,5, so remarkably situated in the midst of a very
 large and conspicuous nebula, affords a striking instance how easily
 the latter class of objects may be overlooked in the usual mode of
 conducting astronomical observations. Mr. South measured this
 star in the 5 feet equatorial, but the nebula, which forms so inter
 esting an appendage to                  it,
                                     entirely escaped his notice. The obser

that which eclipsed the sun. This unexpected occurrence Mr. D.
thinks may be turned to advantage, as it seems to show that the
reduction of the sun's light, by the intervention of an opaque sub
stance, may enable an observer to see the moon when she is very
near the sun.
   There was next read, A letter from Mr. Reeves of Canton, giving
an account of a comet seen at sea, Oct. 3d, 4th, 5th, 10th, and
30th, 1825. When it was first observed the ship was in lat. 7°20'N.
Long. 110° 20' E., the comet was in a line between y Eridani and
Tr Ceti, about one-third of the distance from the former star.        It
then  passed   ir Ceti, advanced toward a Celi  ; and at  length on the
30th of October was seen so near to a in the western wing of the
Crane, that that star appeared to form the nucleus of the comet.
Shortly afterwards the comet entirely disappeared.
   Lastly; A letter was read from M. Gambart to the President,
containing new elements of the comet which passed across the sun's
disc in Nov. 1826, with a more precise determination of the mo
ment of      leaving the disc; from which
           its                                    concludes that both    he

    Dr. Thomson then proceeds         to show, in opposition to the views
of Berzelius, that the permuriate of tin, like the muriate of gold, is
more probably a muriate than a chloride.—Ibid. p. 182.

  . This substance was brought from the hot-spring of Oxhaver in
the north-east of Iceland; it occurs in petrifactions, in which the
wood has been replaced by calcareous spar of a fine ochre-yellow
colour, and more or less crystallized; it occurs in thin veins, in
amorphous masses, in aggregated groups of crystals, and sometimes
in insulated crystals implanted in the calcareous spar.
    Dr. Brewster states that the crystals are acute octahedrons, with
a square base ; the angles at the base are truncated by planes pa
rallel to the axis of the octahedron, and equally inclined to the
adjacent sides of the base, so as to form, when enlarged, the faces
of a square prism. Dr. Brewster observes a very remarkable pro
perty in the crystals of this substance, and which he has never be
fore seen.   Every face of the octahedron is a surface of double
curvature, in consequence of which the maximum angle of the two
opposite faces of the pyramid is 58°, while the minimum angle is
42°, giving a change of inclination of no less than 16°. The maxi
mum inclination occurs at the base, and at the vertex of the pyra
mid, and the minimum inclination at an intermediate point. The
colour of the crystals is light-gray, leek-green, olive-green, and
reddish-brown; they are nearly as hard as apatite, sp. gr. 2:218.
Their general size is about one-tenth of an inch in length; their
surfaces are even, but not brilliant, and the small truncations of the
angles at the base of the pyramid are more imperfect than those of
the octahedron, the imperfections having the direction of the axis.
They cleave with some facility perpendicular to the axis, but in no
other direction; the plane of cleavage is considerably rounded,
the convex surface being turned towards the apex of the pyramid.

 ron and alumina, combined perhaps with a little water, are not to
be regarded as accidental impurities, rather than as essential parts
of the mixture. In this view the oxahevrite would be a variety of

    M. Englehart has shown that when an aqueous solution of the
colouring matter of the blood is treated with chlorine, it is decom
posed; a flocculent substance is deposited, which is insoluble in
water, and which, when separated by the filter, yields               the iron                            all               of

        COMPOSITION OF NATIVE ARGENTIFERO US GOLD.
   M.   Bousingault   having had occasion to examine a great number
of samples   of argentiferous   gold found in Colombia, has observed
that these metals are united in definite proportions;          his process
consisted  simply  in dissolving the specimen   in nitromuriatic acid, se
parating the chloride of silver, and then precipitating the gold in                                             its

XXX.    On the Figure of Equilibrium of a Homogeneous
  Planet in a Fluid State; in reply to the Observations of
  M. Poisson, published in this Journal for July last. By
   J.   Ivory,       Esq.   M.A. F.R.S.*
    HE     two letters which I have addressed to Professor Airy
      in the last Numbers of this Journal, fully ascertain the
 nature and extent of the analytical method employed by                                            La
 place in the investigation of the figure of the planets.          now                        I
 proceed to the conditions which I have found to be necessary
for solving the problem of a homogeneous mass of fluid re
volving upon an axis, to which M. Poisson objects.            The sub
ject is one of considerable importance; it involves a capital
 question in the system of Newton, towards the solution of
 which nothing has in reality been added since the time of
 Maclaurin and Clairaut. This is the more unaccountable, be
 cause, in the long interval elapsed, the problem has continued
 to occupy the attention of                all
                                     the great mathematicians; the
difficulties  attending  the  computation                     of
                                                 the attractive forces,

 which embarrassed the first inquirers, have been overcome
 the progress       mathematical science; and

 162               Mr. Ivory           on the Figure            of the Planets,
  any misapprehension or error that may have impeded the
  progress of this branch of mechanical philosophy, is at least
  deserving of serious attention, and ought not to be fastidiously
  thrown aside merely because it is opposed to what has re
  ceived the sanction of great names.
     In what follows, homogeneous fluids only are understood;
  and it is supposed that the accelerating forces which urge the
  particles, are expressed by functions of the coordinates that
  satisfy the criterion of integrability.       It will also be proper to
 notice a distinction   depending       on the nature of the accelera
 ting forces, inattention to which has been the cause of no little
 perplexity in this theory. The forces mentioned may be either
 explicitly given, so as to be entirely and absolutely known when
 we know the coordinates of a molecule of the fluid upon which
 they act; or the same forces may be relative to the unknown
 figure of the mass of fluid.
   If   the particles of a fluid are urged by attractions to fixed
 centres and by centrifugal forces, the problem of equilibrium
 falls under the first division.        In such cases all the level sur
 faces have the same differential equation, and they are dif
 ferent only in the different pressures they sustain.              When
 any one of those surfaces is known,                              all
                                                     the rest are derived
           merely        by
                       varying the pressure, and the figure
                                                                                    Atof

whole mass          equilibrio,       necessarily determined.          the
                    of in

                                                     is
when the outer surface satisfies the differential equation com
mon     to   all
               the level surfaces, or, which             the same thing,is
when the resultant         the   accelerating

solving the problem          fulfilled.

    When the particles            fluid attract one another, the acce
                                       ofa
lerating forces urging them will depend upon the place they
occupy and upon the figure                         of
                                          the whole mass.      As the at
tractive forces upon points differently situated must vary,                                all
the level surfaces will not,         this case
                                            in                   as

differential  equation.     These surfaces will now vary from one
another       two accounts; namely, the different pressures they
             on
sustain, and the variation           the attractive forces according

                                    in reply to M. Poisson.                                             163
appears to be no absurdity in supposing that the latter con
dition may be fulfilled, at the same time that no level surfaces
exist in the interior, and consequently when there is no equi
librium of the mass of fluid.
   It has been shown that there is a plain distinction between
a fluid in equilibrio when the accelerating forces acting upon
the particles are explicitly given, and when the same forces
depend upon the figure of the mass.            Yet, according to the
received   theory  there is no difference in the two cases with
respect to the conditions necessary to insure the equilibrium.
Supposing that the algebraic expressions of the forces possess
the criterion of integrability, nothing further is required in
either case, than that the outer surface of the fluid be a level
surface cutting the direction of gravity everywhere at right
angles.    But if the determination of the equilibrium be the
same in both cases, we might expect that the demonstration
would be different in circumstances so essentially distinguished.
It must be confessed, however, that we meet with nothing in
the shape of demonstration, except what is vague and unsatis
factory and applies alike to both cases.         The principle seems
to be this:   granting   that the exterior surface is a level sur
face, it is always possible to trace the level surfaces in the
interior; because, since there is no distinction of density, we
may adopt any surfaces we please as level surfaces”. When
the accelerating forces are explicitly given, there is no diffi
culty nor ambiguity; because the equation of              the level sur            all
faces are nowise different except                         in
                                           the constants introduced
by  integration, which vary from one surface            another. But           to
the case     not the same when the level surfaces depend upon
               is

iron, copper, and argentiferous lead mines.                It often passes
into mica slate in the vicinity of these beds, the felspar sud
denly ceasing, and being replaced by a greater quantity of
mica, chlorite, hornblende, &c. The ores often occur in
masses of considerable bulk.
   Mica slate never occurs in the plains or low hills, except in
beds subordinate to the gneiss; it commonly forms the most
elevated summits of the great chain of Scandinavian Alps, and
contains beds of metalliferous substances, limestone, &c.              The
other rocks, such as clayslate, limestone, talcose slate, compact
felspar, and diorite, scarcely form any thing but subordinate
beds in the gneiss or mica slate.          Diorite and compact felspar
alternate with     gneiss   in Smoland;     talcose slate with micaslate
in Jemtland; and with gneiss in the parishes of Hallefors and
Grythytta, in Westmania. , Dark-gray compact limestone is
found in subordinate beds in the clayslate of Jemtland.                  On
some of the Smoland heights, near the church of Saaby, and
in the environs of Willkjol, a compact felspar occurs, contain
ing small crystals of the same substance, thus forming a por
phyry; it is however of inconsiderable extent.                              -
   Granular limestone is the most common and abundant rock
of    all
       those subordinate           the gneiss.

    Transition Rocks. –The transition rocks of Sweden are
distinguished by their extent in an horizontal direction com
pared with their thickness, their position, and the nature of
the fossils they contain. The rocks composing them are the
following: graywacke, conglomerate, and quartzose sandstone;
hornstone porphyry, and flinty slate; diorite both compact
and porphyritic; a fine-grained and sometimes red-grayish
sandstone, nearly without organic remains; aluminous slate;
compact limestone, containing orthoceratites; and clayslate,
containing fossils of the same genus, but smaller, named grap
tolites.    A thick bed of greenstone occurs on the elevated
summit of Mount Westgotha, above the four latter rocks; it
is difficult to determine whether it belongs to the transition
epoch, or is of volcanic origin.                                       -
    The author afterwards describes with much care the dif.
ferent districts of Sweden in which transition rocks occur;
viz. Dalecarlia, Jemtland, Nericia, Ostrogothia, Westrogothia,
Kinnekulle, the Hunneberg and Halleberg, Mount West
gotha, the isle of Oeland, Scania, and the isle of Gottland.
    Secondary Rocks.-The formations belonging to the secon
dary epoch are confined within the districts of Schonen and
Scania. They are divided into two portions: sandstone and
limestone.      1. Sandstone, containing beds of coal, bituminous
slate, and schistose clay, occurs along the Sund, for the length
of from three to four leagues, on the south of Kullaberg;                                   its
greatest breadth between the Sund and Süderas               more than     is

daloid with. a brown base, partly resembling that of Holme
strand, has been found in isolated fragments near the Sund,
and it will probably be met with in place. There are green
stone dykes in Scania, and the country of Christiana in Nor
way. In the latter country they traverse transition limestone
and clay slate; in Scania, they occur in the slate, and also in
the sandstone and gneiss.     Trap dykes are also seen in the
environs of Rostanga, Konga, and Andrarum.          .
   Alluvion Formations.—The base of all these in Sweden is
composed of the remains of primitive rocks; and it is seen,
from the nature and disposition of the rolled pebbles, that the
cause which has given birth to these extensive formations
acted from north to south.       The presence of stones on the
coast of Northern   Germany,    derived from Swedish rocks, yet
more   clearly proves this fact. The great catastrophe which
has produced these numerous alluvions is the last which the
 Scandinavian peninsula has experienced”.
   Bog iron-ore is met with in Smoland, Dalecarlia, and
Jemtland; where it occurs in sufficient quantity to supply the
wants of the principal forges of those countries.

     M. Omalius d’Halloy recognized            these rocks at the entrance
of   the Pontine            marshes near Cisterna, at the foot of the vol
canic hills of Velletri, in a low plain. The limestone is white,
compact, and solid, pierced by numerous tubular cavities, and
contains Limneae and globular Helices; he presumes that it is
in many points covered, as in Auvergne, by volcanic breccias.
It would appear that this limestone also occurs to the south
towards Calabria; for it is stated that the temples of Paestum,
in the gulf of Salerno, are constructed with a concretionary

  sufficiently dense.    2. That fresh-water shells are very rare in
  it; for not only does M. Omalius d’Halloy mention that he
  had not seen any, but he considers that their absence is to be
  accounted for by sulphuretted hydrogen gas dissolved in these
  waters, and which prevents any fresh-water Mollusca from
  living in them. The very different state of the lakes Tartari
  and of the Solfatara accord very well with this theory.

    These considerations have appeared to us of sufficient im
portance to arrest our attention for a short time, as they con
tribute to complete the history of a formation first recognized
in the environs of Paris.
    The travertine or fresh-water limestone of the plains of
Tivoli is not, however, entirely without the remains of shells.
I  have observed them at Villa Adriana, at the foot of the hill,
in a limestone bed, the position of which, relatively to the other
rocks, is very clearly shown.
    The fundamental rock of the Tivoli hills is a fine compact
                                                                       #.
limestone, containing interrupted beds or nodules of chert,
and which appeared to me to bear the greatest resemblance
to the Jura limestone *; the fresh-water                    sometimes
rests immediately on this older rock, at others it occurs on a
volcanic brecciola which rests on this compact limestone. The
place last mentioned shows this superposition in the most evi
dent manner.        Proceeding from the surface downwards, we
see: 1. a compact travertine, with tubular sinuosities and a
few shells; 2. a mixture of friable travertine, and the debris
of volcanic brecciola; 3. a thick bed of this brecciola.
    The facts observed by M. Brocchi, which I have also veri
fied with him, and those which I have myself noticed, esta
blish the relative position of the rocks analogous to those of
Paris, as well at Rome as in                   its
                                       environs; the following order

length of the pendulum at New York as trifling: so also are
the corrections at the four other stations, where the rate of
the clock was obtained with the repeating circle. The obser
vations recalculated show the clock to have been gaining at
Jamaica 43,07 daily, instead of 4,14; at Trinidad 3,23                in
stead of 3,19; at Maranham 2,69 instead of 2*,70; and at
Bahia 2°,76 instead of 2,68.          No correction amounts to one
tenth of a second       per  diem,   and the joint effect (in the com
parison between the tropical stations and those of the middle
and northern latitudes) does not exceed one hundredth of a
second per diem; a quantity far too small to have
                                                                 any  in

  . I avail myself of the
                              opportunity to subjoin a table of the
 corrected lengths of the pendulum, for the convenience of any
 person who may have occasion to employ them. The latitudes
are given in the table to the nearest half minute, being suffi
 cient for the required purpose.             The observations of the
 southern stars have been recalculated with Mr. Fallows's
                                                                    right
 ascensions and declinations. The only alteration produced
 thereby worthy of notice is in the latitude of Ascension, from
 7° 55'48" to 7° 55' 10", by employing the more correct
                                                                      ap

 no influence beyond the mere correction; as 39.0152+0-20227
 sin” 7° 55' 48", and 39.0152 + 0.20227 sin” 7° 55' 10" give
 the same theoretical pendulum for Ascension.                In no other
 instance do the corrections exceed a very few seconds.

 XXXIII.           Notice on the Larvae of Diptera.   By WILLIAM
                         SHARP  MAcLEAY,   Esq., F.L.S.
                    To Richard Taylor, Esq.
 No     order of insects affords greater proof of the necessity
      of generalizing, than that of Diptera. We often hear of
 the last joint of the antennae in this order terminating in a
  bristle, or being furnished with a lateral one; whereas this
  bristle is essentially part of the antennae, being in fact articu
  lated, and composed of as many joints as with the thicker ones
  will make up the proper number that characterizes the family.
  The true description therefore of the antennae in Musca vomi
  toria is, that the last three joints compose              seta     bristle in
                                                                              a             or
  serted laterally       the extremity

I   find     onlooking    over the various      entomological       works that
  have been hitherto published, that whenever the larvae                                                       of
  Diptera fall under consideration, they are altogether errone

 terior spiracula. So far as the word proleg may signify a pro
 cess of the body in Annulosa, it may be an admissible term;
 but the utility of the expression may be questioned, as it scarcely
 ever adds to our knowledge of the physiology and real use of
 the organ.      In dipterous larvae generally, whether terrestrial
 or aquatic, it is extremely common to see the stigmata sup
 ported on peduncles.
    It is worth remarking that although, in these larvae, until
 we arrive at the extremes of the order, there are no stigmata
along the sides, except the first or humeral pair; yet on dis
secting a common flesh-maggot,-in which, by the bye, the
tracheae form a most beautiful microscopical object,--we may
observe that the longitudinal trunks of these send off at equal
distances lateral branches just as if there were spiracula to
correspond with them.           Nay more, in several species of dip
terous larvae we     may    observe the place of the deficient stig
mata marked out as tubercles along the sides of the body, and
they become very distinct in the pupa. The prolegs, as they
have been termed, of the larva of Elophilus pendulus give a
curious instance of these abortive stigmata in a high state of
development, and what have been described in this insect as
the anterior pair of feet, are no other than the usual palmated
stigmata which occur on the humerus of the larvae of Muscidae,
only they are here somewhat pedunculated.
    Reaumur and Degeer afford us mines of information; but
in the present state of the science, these most valuable authors
must be read with the insects before us, else they will only
serve to lead into error.
    Having thrown out these few hints, in order to show the
value of generalization in natural history, I conclude, Sir, with
stating myself,                   Your very obedient servant,

am reproached by the author, as not being acquainted with
the practical use of the reflective                  feel myself
tempted to reply in a few lines, which you will greatly oblige
me by inserting in your valuable Journal.                 -
   In determining the inclinations of the planes of the hyalosi
                            I
derite, it is true, have employed the common goniometer;
but it was because              I
                       had no reflective goniometer at my dis
posal: yet being convinced that any measurement of small
crystals afforded by the common goniometer will remain still
imperfect,     I
              thought to have prevented any reproach on that
account, by further observing that my determinations cannot
boast of very great accuracy. Some time after the publica
tion of my measurements, Dr. Gustavus Rose * found by means
of the reflective goniometer the inclination d a 139° 16', and               –
observed the plane M in Mr.W. Phillips's figure, which the
crystals I possessed had not. Therefore the observations of
Mr. W. Phillips cannot, it is obvious, pretend to be alto
gether new.
   Mr.W. Phillips allows himself to communicate to the public
the unfavourable opinion he entertains of the mineralogists
of the continent, whom he pleases to mention as prejudiced
against the reflective goniometer.      It is indeed singular and
astonishing to meet with such a reproach at a time when                                               all
measurements     are made      means       by

                   Cooper, Esq. for analysis; and having ascer
tained it to be sulphuret of bismuth, he was induced, by the
rareness of this substance in well-defined prisms, to permit me to
take several of them, in the hope of my being able to acquire
some information respecting their form by means of the reflec

  The second figure represents some crystals from the Cornish
specimen, and the measurements obtained from them are an
nexed.   The near coincidence between the natural and arti
ficial crystals is remarkable; and perhaps the small difference
of 30', occasioned by the artificial affording M on M'91°, while
the natural gave 91° 30', may be accounted for by the ex
treme difficulty of separating the natural crystals from the
matrix without bending them in some degree, since almost

plane       f

us to express our assent to, or our dissent from, one or other
of these sentiments; and we should unquestionably stand in a
ridiculous dilemma indeed, were we to adhere to one of those
views exclusively. We assent to the theory of life entertained

stinct thing altogether from matter, a distinct somewhat; but
 we dissent therefrom, so far as it regards life as a mere principle
of so abstract a nature and so indefinite a shape as to admit
of being resolved into an imaginary somewhat, an ideal, inex
plicable, and unintelligible phantom—a materies vitae diffusa :
 We assent to the theory that life is a property of matter, so
 far as it regards it as dependent upon matter for             manifesta      its

                                    to

purposes and designs,—for we fear not to say that the best pur
poses and the wisest designs are discernible in the formation

fluidity in a very eminent degree; it must admit of so subtile
a division without a destruction of its nature, as will enable it
to penetrate into those minute channels and secret recesses
where the human eye-sight is eluded, and where those deli
cate manipulations and chemical operations are performed
which no human skill can imitate nor art accomplish. Still
the pathways to these recesses are open to our search ; still

   190         Dr. Spurgin's Outlines of a Philosophical
   giving a little snip sideways, both at the top and bottom, by
   sticking a fish-hook in each corner of the skin, it was easily
  stretched out before the microscope, and presented on the
 'screen a most beautiful picture of the veins and arteries in the
 ‘skin, with the blood circulating through them.       In the arteries
  we could plainly perceive the blood stopping, and as it were
  receding a little at each dilatation of the heart, and then im
  mediately running forwards again at each contraction; whilst
  in the veins it rolled on in a continual current with inexpressi
 ble rapidity.” To this Mr. Baker appends a note, wherein he
  says, “When the arteries were magnified very much, by re
  moving the screen to a considerable distance, the alternate
  expansion and contraction of their sides were very visible and
  remarkable. After considering this” he proceeds, “as long as
 we thought needful, we opened the abdomen, and extending
  the muscles before the microscope, by the same means as we
  had done the skin, we had the pleasure of viewing their struc
 ture, which we found to consist of bundles of transparent
 strings or fibres, lying parallel to one another, and joined to
 gether by a common membrane.            These strings or fibres ap
  peared through their whole length made up of minute roundish
 vesicles; or, in other words, seemed like rushes divided the
 long way. We could not be certain of any circulation through
 the muscles, though sometimes we imagined we saw a very
 slow motion of some transparent fluid; but the object growing
 dry and rigid, we proceeded to our last experiment, which
was to draw out gently a part of the frog's intestine, in order
 to apply the mesentery to the microscope: and herein we suc
 ceeded so happily, that      I believe the circulation of the blood
 was never before seen in so distinct and fine a manner.          No
 words can describe the wonderful scene that was presented
 before our eyes! We beheld the blood passing through num
 berless vessels at one and the same instant, in some one way,
 in others the direct contrary. Several of the vessels were mag
nified to above an inch in diameter, and the globules of the
 blood rolling through them seemed near as large as pepper
corns; whilst in many of the minutest vessels only single glo
bules were able to find a passage, and that too not without
changing their figure into that of oblong spheroids. We saw
likewise much better than we had done before, the pulsation
and acceleration of the blood in the arteries, in the manner
before described, and could clearly distinguish two or three
vessels lying over one another, with currents running different
ways.      In short, it appeared like a beauteous landscape, where
rivers, streams and rills of running water are every where
dispersed.

     Ocean.       By   J. W.     Robberds, Esq. Jun.”
INNorfolk,
   originating the inquiry respecting the Eastern Valleys of
           my avowed object was, not to contend for victory,
but to elicit truth. As this end can only be attained by fair
and liberal discussion, it is highly satisfactory to me that my
observations have called forth the remarks of Mr. R. C. Taylor.
                                           I
Willingly and with pleasure acknowledge the candour by
which the comments of my “fellow-traveller” have been                                         di
                       I
rected; nor do believe that he intentionally withdrew from
the guidance of the same just and honourable feeling, when at
the conclusion of his strictures he condemned me for attempt
ing to deduce general principles from “assumptions founded
on the limited considerations of local operations.” This charge
can only have arisen from a misconception of my line of argu
ment; for, not only did I in my introductory statement point
out, as one of the laws of investigation which       prescribed to        I
myself, that local circumstances could only be of importance
as far as they belonged to a chain of connected evidence, and
that they must be “included in a wider survey of correlative
cases,” in order to “establish a leading general principle in
some branch of physical science,”—but at the close of my book
I again distinctly asserted, that “no general principle can be
established by a solitary isolated fact; ” and that        should,                  I
therefore, according to the second law of investigation which
I  had laid down, proceed hereafter to compare and connect
the changes in the Eastern Valleys of Norfolk with numerous
observations made on the shores of every ocean. These pas
sages must have been overlooked by Mr. Taylor, or I am sure
that he would have refrained from preferring against me an
accusation, which          I
                       had shown so much anxiety to avert. My
observations were    undoubtedly    confined to a particular                                  di
strict; but my inference was equally restricted within the same
limits. The general principle I left to be deduced from a ge
neral survey of corresponding cases; and I must still consi
der this to be the safest, the most satisfactory, and the most
conclusive train of reasoning:—first, to select some local fact;
to examine it in           all   its
                            bearings, and submit        the severe        it   to
scrutiny      to of
              modern science; and then
                                                             it to
                                               ascertain how                                 it   is
adapted      that universal frame     which    of    essential and   is   an

to decide     precipitately,   or an eagerness to draw extensive con
 clusions from narrow and insufficient data.                My desire, on
the contrary, is to make good my ground as                      proceed.                 I                     I

   The operation of the bias thus given to Mr.Taylor's mind is
very apparent in the whole of his reasonings upon the Valleys
of Norfolk. He has admitted at once my historical proofs, and
 assented to the first position established by them; viz. that these
valleys were formerly aestuaries, filled by the waters of the ad
jacent sea.    But Mr. Taylor denies that the retreat of those
 waters affords any evidence of a depression in their general
level; and he maintains that the conversion of the greater part
of their early   channels into dry land has been effected “by the
gradual precipitation from waters charged with alluvial mud,
and the consequent exclusion of the tide from         ancient recepta          its

they ought also to have shut in those which covered the val
leys at the time when the barrier was raised. , Supposing the
level of the German Ocean to have remained invariably the
same, the reflux at Yarmouth haven during the ebb, can
not have been greater than the influx during the flow, of the
tide; no more facility can have been afforded for egress than
for ingress; where the rise and fall have been uniformly
equal, the volume of water passing and repassing through the
 same aperture and in the same space of time, must also have
been equal.          These are self-evident propositions; and from
them it is most manifest that the aestuary of the Garienis might
 have been changed into a lake, but could never have been
 converted into dry ground by such a process as Mr. Taylor
 has described.          Lake Lothing and Oulton Broad have not
 been      emptied    of their waters, in consequence of Kirkley Road
 having been blocked up; neither have their basins been filled
 by alluvial deposits or decayed vegetables. The great depth
 of those basins has of course prevented their being drained;

     staithes; and Mr. Taylor has himself admitted, that there are
     “conclusive reasons” for assigning the waters              to    these val         of
     leys, within the period            which we possess historical records,
                                         of
                 of              “four       five feet above the mean height

   198       Mr. Robberds               on the former Level               of the German                  Ocean,
  been produced by any deficiency in the supply of water, either
                                                    º
  from the main source, or tributary springs of the Wensum; for
 all the mills situated upon it have continued their usual ope
  rations, nor has there been any perceptible abatement in the
  strength of the current by         their machinery is set in mo
 tion. These facts evince that a progressive reduction in the
 amount of the floods of this valley has been going on from the
 date of the earliest records up to the present time.   How then
 has the former excess above the quantity of water now exist
 ing been carried away? The mouth of the haven at                                                             Yar
 mouth is the only passage at which it can have flowed out;
 and in order to effect this, the average outfall of the ebb at
 that point during the last seven centuries must have been
 greater than the influx of the rising tide. But    have already                      I
 shown that this could not have been the case, if the level of
 the German Ocean remained unchanged; therefore, as it is
 an indisputable fact that the receding tide has carried away
 a greater body of water than it brought in during                 access,                        its
it  necessarily follows that the floods which have left the val
 leys must have been drawn off              the depression      bythe re                         of
 servoir      which
                 in  they  have been absorbed.
     But Mr. Taylor maintains also that these floods have been
 driven out             by
                  the growth       solid land occupying their place;
                                                   of
 that the tide has been excluded “from               ancient receptacles  its
 by   the gradual precipitation from waters charged with alluvial
mud.” This argument rests upon                   assumption, which   an                                        is
physically impossible and logically absurd               supposes water    ;     it

actually above               its
                      own surface; which includes the proposition
that    a part     not only equal

I      will now try this reasoning       the test     facts    exhibited           of                 as
in  these valleys.     Mr. Taylor says, that “four distinct pro

                                    the sea; second, the deposit                                                       of
oozy sediment from muddy waters; third, the external cover

                     the operation       the winds; and lastly, the

 their acting          higher level than that which they now oc

these sands, it would still have been incumbent upon him to
provide a foundation to receive them, constantly above the
highest level of the sea; for by no means could they have per
manently accumulated, while exposed to the action of the
waves.       A striking proof of this has been already adduced in
 the dispersion of the Scrotley Bank in the year 1582.                 But a
 more familiar and more          frequently  recurring  illustration of my
 argument may be seen on flat beaches, where, when the tide
 is out, a strong wind blowing along the shore drives the sand
 before   it,  and forms numerous mounds and ridges; but the
 first  ripple     of the returning flood sweeps them             away, and           all
 “the baseless fabrics—leave not wreck behind.” Mr. Tay       a
lor's own theory, therefore, presupposes that his “heavy ma
terials rolled           by
                       the sea,” and his “oozy sediment from muddy
waters,” must have been raised above the access                 the swelling       of
tide and      of the storm-driven       surge,  before his “external co
 vering   of   sand           by

have found       a resting-place upon them.         Nature, ever uniform

 Gorleston,         I have thus demonstrated,—                    -
    First, That the wind and vegetation—the two “powerful
 agents,” which Mr. Taylor condemns me for having altoge
 ther overlooked—have in fact contributed in a very “insig

                                            2 by

204      Mr. Robberds   on the former Level   of the German        Ocean,
or has it been gradually spread over them, below the usual
level of the waters that anciently covered their whole extent?
   Mr. Taylor has appealed to the evidence given before the
Committee of the House of Commons to prove, “that the chief
portion of the eastern marshes is even now eighteen inches
to two feet below the surface of the rivers which pass through
them, and that the water is artificially kept out by embank
ments and draining mills.”    Every one acquainted with this
district must be aware, that this is far too comprehensive an
assertion; and I must regard it as a general inference, hastily
drawn from local and limited facts. That the circumstances
here described do partially exist along the course of the
rivers, particularly where they approach towards the sea, is
not denied; yet the slight banks which have been thrown up,
must be looked upon in many instances rather as memorials
of past, than as proofs of existing danger; and seem to have
been more designed to guard the lands from the effects of un
usually high tides, than to rescue extensive tracts, which with
out the protection of such barriers would be constantly over
flowed, to the depth of eighteen inches or two feet. But it is
certain, that for the space of several miles below the city of
Norwich, there is neither embankment nor draining mill, and
that the surface of the meadows is decidedly above the level
of the river. Within the memory of those now living, they have
advanced considerably in solidity, and the waters which in rainy
seasons used to stagnate upon them, are now quickly carried
 away, without the assistance of artificial draining. The lowest
bed of their soil is sand, in which marine shells are found;
 above this, the sand is mixed with black mud, and the shells
 that are distributed in it are both fluvial and marine: the ex
 ternal covering consists entirely of black mud, full of the re
 mains of aquatic plants, and abounding in freshwater shells.
 In this series we may trace the successive operations by
 which the bottom of the valley was filled: first, the sea exclu
 sively occupying the whole basin; then, as        tides were gra
                                                        its
 dually withdrawn, the waters from inland springs,             first   at
 mingling with them, next supplying their place, and finally,
 settling into the contracted channel              of
                                                the present river.
 These are proofs, not       transient and irregular inundations,
                            of
 but     the long residence and gradual retreat
         of                                               of

necessary    part of the regularly progressive change which is
here   displayed.    But neither have they expelled themselves
by their deposits, nor have they been of sufficient frequency
and duration, to have been the only agents in raising the land
of these districts above the ordinary level of their rivers *.
    It is evident that the sea anciently flowed so copiously up
the aestuary, as to exclude from it the animal tribes which
live only in fresh waters.             I
                                 am not appealing, in proof of this,
to the marine exuviae on the sides of the hills; my observa
tions are for the present confined to those which are below
the alluvial mud of the valley, where the beds of sand and the
fossil spoils which they contain, attest the early and absolute
dominion of the sea. How then have its tides been driven
out and compelled to yield this part of their empire to the
fresh-waters? Not by the increased quantity and force of the
latter; and it has been already shown that they could not
expel themselves.       Here then again, in another stage of the
same    operation  of Nature,  no competent and satisfactory cause
can be assigned for a visible and unquestionable effect, but
the falling level of the sea. Those who deny the intervention
of this principle, supply         placeits                  by

of    these two causes must necessarily have diminished the
 amount     ofthe tides that made their way into the inner valley,

 drawn.     By this process, room was made for the fresh water

 they may be thus described, after the nomenclature used by
the German zoologists: One rostral shield; then a group of
6 or 7 small nasal scales on each side; 2 anterior frontals; 3
posterior frontals in a cross band; 4 vertebral scales; 6 super
ciliary band-like scales over each eye; 10 occipital, shields;
the first 5 small, forming a narrow, and the hinder 5 larger
and longer, forming a broad band; so that there are 8 large
scales on each side, and 3 odd or medial scales, without the
superciliary ones.

   Tail rather longer than the body; head smooth. Scales
broad lanceolate, those nearer the head the smallest, those of
the back, upper part of limbs and tail strongly midribbed and
ending in sharp tips, so as to form raised longitudinal lines,
tending obliquely towards the tail; the dorsal line the largest.
The scales of the lower parts smooth, scarcely midribbed, green.

    LoPHYRUs, n.
    This genus was first called Uranascodon    by Caup, and al
tered to Uraniscodon    by  Boie, who has since changed it to
Ophryesa.     It may be divided into two sections, which will  -
probably form two genera, thus:
    1. Head and eyebrows uniformly scaly: palatine teeth large
                                          -
and distinct.                                                     -
   This nearly agrees with the Lophyrus of Spix, and contains
4 or 5 species figured by Spix, in t 10, 12, 13 and 13 a.
   2. Head scaly with a large occipital subperforated scale; the
eyebrows shielded; the palatine teeth very small (or none).
   This agrees with the Agamae of Spix. It contains the Agama
hispida, A. tuberculata, A. nigricollis, and A. Cyclurus of Spix,
t. 15, 16, 17, said to be different ages and sexes of the same
species; and Lophyrus ochro-collaris, Spix, t. 12. f. 2.
   This section appears by the superciliary scales to be inter
mediate between the true Lophyri and the Leiocephali which
I  have just described; and should it hereafter be found to be
a genus,  Boie's name of Ophryesa may be used to designate     it.

    From a re-examination of a specimen in spirits, I find that
 the teeth of this genus are placed on the inner side of the
jaws, and therefore it ought to be referred to this family.                                         I
 was misled by seeing only a dried specimen, and by Cuvier's
 expressly describing the teeth as in Agama.        may observe,             I
 that the best way  to examine the structure of the teeth is to
 take a needle and turn down the inner gums from the edge of
 the teeth; when if they are placed on the inner edge of the
jaw, their roots will be distinctly seen; while if they are onl
 on the edge, the bone of the jaw- will be smooth and of a uni
form colour.
   The genus should be arranged after Cyclura, having no
palatine teeth and being provided with femoral pores: but it
may be easily separated from                  it,   by
                                  the large size and peculiar
form of the shields of the head.                       -

differs from my specimens in some particulars, and resem

the lobes on the side of the face are not large enough for that

broad lobe on each side behind; scales large, rugose, ridges

   In the Museum is another specimen of a smaller size, which
agrees with the above, but the flaps on the side of the head are
small. It may be the other sex, or the young; it is 8 inches
long.                                                 -

June 21.          HOMAS TELFORD,                       Esq. was admitted a Fellow
                of the Society; and the reading of a paper “On the
theory of the diurnal variation of the needle," by S. H. Christie,
Esq. F.R.S. commenced on June 14, was resumed and concluded.
   Mr. Christie having been led to doubt the validity of the moving
easterly variation adopted by Canton, but at the same time having
observed that the changes in direction and intensity appear always
to have reference to the position of the sun with regard to the mag
netic meridian, was led to connect these phaenomena with Professor
Seebeck's discovery of thermo-magnetism, and Professor Cumming's
subsequent experiments; and to refer the phaenomena of diurnal va
riation to the effect of partial heating modified, perhaps, by that of
rotation and by peculiar influence in the sun's rays.
     In support of this opinion he cites passages from papers by Pro
fessor Cumming and Dr. Traill, whom a similar idea appears also
to have impressed. But in place of looking to the stony strata of
which the earth's surface consists as the elements of the thermo
magnetic apparatus which this doctrine requires, the author regards
them as rather consisting of the atmosphere and the surfaces of
land and water with which it is in contact. Thermo-magnetic phae
nomena, he remarks, have hitherto only been observed in metallic
 combinations; but this may be owing merely to the small scale on
 which our experiments are conducted.
     To put to the test of experiment whether thermo-magnetism
could be excited when the surfaces of two metals instead of touch
 ing at one point were in symmetrical contact throughout, the
 author first employed a compound ring of bismuth and copper, the
 copper outwards; and he found that to whatever point heat was ap
 plied, magnetic powers were developed; a needle being affected dif
 ferently according to the different positions in which the ring was
 placed with regard to     it. After lapse   a   two years from this first

   He then details a set of experiments by which he assured himself
   that a uniformity of action obtained wherever in the circumference
   the heat was applied. He next instituted a series of observations
  for determining the laws which govern the magnetic phaenomena
  resulting from the application of heat as above described; the re
  sults of which are stated in the form of tables.
      Four poles appear to be produced, two north and two south, the
  north both lying in one semicircle, and the south both in the other,
  and not in alternate quadrants, and                               all

points near the earth's surface, respectively, the character of the
deviations turns out to be the same in both cases, so that in this
respect the hypothesis, so far as is known, agrees with observation.
    One general effect of some experiments with a hollow copper
shell filled with bismuth, afforded a striking correspondence with
nature. The whole equator being heated, and one part more than
the rest, he uniformly found that the elevated pole being towards
the north, the north end of the needle deviated when the place of
heat was on the meridian above the horizon, and south when below,
which is precisely the character of the diurnal variation in north
latitudes.

 Esq. F.G.S. &c.
       he total length to which this dyke has been traced is 1577 yards.
 It  increases in breadth from S. to N.; being 43 yards wide near the
 most southern point, where it has been cut through, and 214 yards
 wide at the most northern spot hitherto observed.       It is formed of
 two walls of greenstone, each from two to four feet in thickness;
 and these walls contain between them a breccia, composed of frag
 ments of shale and whin, cemented by calcareous and argillaceous
 matter. Carburetted hydrogen and pure water issue from a narrow
 fissure in the broadest part of the dyke. The coal of the beds through
 which the dyke passes is charred, and deteriorated in quality, to the
 distance of about forty yards on each side.

 conglomerate rests upon gneiss and other primitive rocks; but at
 Malbay it is interstratified with brown limestone, and contains spiral
 univalves and various bivalves *. The author is inclined to refer
 the formation to the old red sandstone.
     The porphyries of Gros Cap and Nipigeon on Lake Superior, contain
 agate, chalcedony, fluor, green earth, and vitreous felspar : they are
 unstratified, and form serrated precipices. Near Gravel Point they
 much resemble some of the porphyries of Arran in Scotland.
     The rocks of the St. Lawrence Valley, beneath the series above
mentioned, consist, in a descending order, of grauwacke, interme
diary limestone, quartz-rock, primitive limestone, and various slaty
rocks,—including gneiss, mica slate, actinolite slate, with syenite,
greenstone, and ophicalcic rock. The prevailing direction of the
strata, for more than 1000 miles, from the River Saguenai, on the
north of the St. Lawrence, to the northern shore of Lake Huron, is
to the N.E. ; and the rocks are regarded by the author as the most
recent of the primitive class.    Quartz-rock prevails on the north of
Lake Huron for more than 70 miles; and the islands in that part of
the lake consist of fine-grained red and gray granite, with quartz-rock
and trap: and vast masses of granite alternate with greenstone for a
space of 300 miles on the north shore of Lake Superior.           Of the
slaty primitive rocks, the most abundant is gneiss; which constitutes
some of the principal heights, and forms the mountains N.E. of Que
bec, and lines the northern shore of the St. Lawrence. Cape Tour
ment, 1800 feet in height, consists of this rock; so also the outlet of
Lake Ontario, and it skirts the north shore of Lakes Simcoe and
Huron, and occupies a considerable tract on the north of Lake
Nipissing, and at the upper part of the river Ottawa.
    The author supposes that the numerous boulders of Labrador fel
spar on the shores of Lake Huron, on the S.W. of Lake Simcoe, and
even so far eastward as the outlet of Lake Ontario, have been de
rived from a tract about 60 miles west of Penetanegeneshene, where
the gneiss passes into Labrador felspar, traversed by veins of pyroxene
and garnet; and this he supposes to be the southern verge of a vast
tract of the same composition.     Magnetic iron ore is associated with
syenite on the north of Ontario. Greenstone occurs in veins in Lower
Canada: near Lake Huron it supports intermediary limestone; and
it is found at Gros Cap in Lake Superior, and forms numerous dykes
of great size in the north shore of that lake. A mass composed of
a mixture of augite and hornblende occurs near Montreal, con
stituting Montreal Hill, 650 feet high, from which numerous dykes
cut through the shelly deposits at the base of the hill.
    The primitive limestone appears in every part of the St. Lawrence
Walley to belong to one and the same epoch, and occupies a conside
rable space on the south-western frontier of Lower Canada, near Lake
Champlain.      In Upper Canada, the upper part of the river Ottawa

    A notice was read, “On some fossil bones of the elephant and
other animals, found near Salisbury:"—by Charles Lyell, Esq.
F.R.S. F.G.S. &c.
   Bones and teeth of the elephant, rhinoceros, and ox, have been
found for many years past in the brick-earth at the village of Fish
erton Anger, at the distance of about 4 of a mile from Salisbury
 Cathedral.    Several pits sunk in this brick-earth show that it varies
in thickness in different places from about 10 to 20 feet. It bears
every mark of a tranquil sedimentary deposit from water; but the
laminae are sometimes divided by thin layers of fine sand, or oc
casionally, but rarely, by a layer of small flint pebbles.       There
are no marine remains; but land-shells are said to occur sometimes
in this deposit. The brick-earth rests upon a bed of chalk flints,
 the greater part of which are not water-worn: and beneath these is
 chalk, which is loose and rubbly in the upper part.
   This brick-earth is not connected with the alluvial soil of the pre
sent valley, but appears to have been deposited when the valley was
at a higher level; for it forms a low terrace, along the side of the
river Wily, between Salisbury and Wilton, rising 30 or 40feet above
the present water-meadows. It is necessary at least to suppose that
when these beds were accumulated, the water rose much higher than
it now does.
   The bones are in a very decomposed state, but have no appear
ance of having been rolled; they are found in the lower part of the
brick-earth, and not in the subjacent flint gravel. And in one spot
there is reason to believe that the remains of an entire skeleton of
                                                        -
an elephant might have been procured.
   A paper was read, entitled “Remarks on some of the strata be
tween the chalk and the Kimmeridge clay, in the south-east of En
gland:”—in a letter to Charles Lyell, Esq., from Wm. Henry Fitton,
M.D. P.G.S. &c.—The objects of the author were; first, to ascertain
in the interior, the existence of that remarkable group of strata,
which on the coast has been found to include the remains of orga
nized bodies supposed to belongtofreshwater; and secondly, to trace
along the western boundary of the chalk the strata which imme
diately succeed     For the latter purpose, he gives series of
                to it.

formation passing from the coast of Dorsetshire, round the Black
 down hills in Devonshire, and thence by the vales of Wardour,
 Warminster, and Pewsey, through Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire,
 Bedfordshire, &c. to Hunstanton Cliff on the coast of Norfolk, where
 the course of the chalk range is interrupted by the sea. These sec
tions prove that the order of the strata is throughout the same as in
 the Isle of Wight, and in Kent, Surrey and Sussex;-and the paper
 describes the principal variations in the proportions and characters
 of the beds, at the site of the several sections.
   In proceeding westward from the Isle of Wight, the beds which
intervene between the chalk and the Purbeck limestone appear to
run together; and cannot well be distinguished further west than
Lulworth Cove. Beyond that point no trace has yet been detected of
any of the freshwater beds beneath the lower green-sand; nor is the
separation of the upper from the lower of these sands by a stratum
of clay (Gault) any longer discernible. Some fossils, however, of the
gault occur in the sands on the coast near Lyme Regis, and at the
 well-known quarries of Blackdown; and the presence of the gault
itself beneath the upper green-sand is again distinct in the Vale of
 Wardour, and throughout the entire range from thence to Norfolk.
   The only places in which the author has detected the presence
of the freshwater beds succeeding the lower green-sand, are in the
 Vale of Wardour, and in the vicinity of Aylesbury: and it would
appear that the great extent of the sands immediately beneath
 the chalk, shooting out beyond the subjacent strata, and concealing
their outcrop, may be one cause why the group next in succession
is but rarely visible in the interior;-though it is also probable that
strata produced at the bottom of freshwater-lakes, or of aestuaries,
were originally deposited in detached portions, comparatively of no
great extent.
   In the Vale of Wardour, the series consists of 1. Chalk; 2.
 Upper green-sand; 3. Gault; 4. Traces of the lower green-sand
(Shanklin sands); 5. Traces of the Hastings sands; 6. the Purbeck
strata, containing in great abundance freshwater shells, principally
of the genus Cyclas, and in the upper part the Cypris faba: which
remarkable fossil therefore pervades the whole group between the
lower green-sand and the Portland stone; 7. Calcareous strata, con
taining the fossils of the Portland stone, and of the same mineralo
gical character with the beds of that formation in the Isle of Pur
beck; 8. Clay, like that of Kimmeridge, &c.
   The succession in the vicinity of Aylesbury is nearly the same
with that of the Vale of Wardour; the Portland stone being covered
at Whitchurch by beds of whiteish fissile limestone, containing
freshwater shells, among which are Cyclades, and a species of Cypris.
The Portland strata occur also at Brill Hill in Buckinghamshire, and
at Garsington in Oxfordshire; and the remarkable nodules of Shot
over-hill, though differing considerably in appearance from the lime
stone of Portland itself, must probably be referred either to that
formation, or to a group of strata which, from their abounding in
green particles, might be confounded with some of the calcareous
beds of the lower green-sand, but which, both in Buckinghamshire
                                                                  and

 and on the coast of the Lower Boulonnois, occur beneath the equi
 valent of the Portland stone.

 Society adjourned till Friday evening, the 2nd of November.

     June 8-There was read a paper by F. Baily, Esq. “Remarks on
  the Astronomical Observations of Flamsteed.” The object of this
  communication is to draw the attention of astronomers to the ob
 servations of that eminent observer, which the author considers,
 from their great number, from the care bestowed upon them,
 and for the very long period elapsed since they were made (nearly
  140 years), to be deserving of more strict examination than they
 appear yet to have received. The imperfection of the instruments
 used by Flamsteed appears to have been one chief cause of this
 neglect, being in fact only a mural arc of 120° with cross wires in
 the focus of the telescope fixed in the plane of the meridian, and
 an uncompensated clock.           The arc, though of 80 inches radius,

   There was next read a paper by Mr. Utting, “On a new period
of eclipses.” In this communication, Mr. Utting adverts to the
well-known Chaldean periods of 223 lunations and 6890 lunations:
but, besides these, there are others that have been brought in aid
of computations relative to eclipses. The new period, which Mr.
 Utting proposes, consists of 3803 lunations, or about 307 Julian
years and 174 days; at the end of which time he says the sun and
moon will be in conjunction at the opposite node to that from which
they started: and at the end of 7606 lunations they will be in con
junction at the same node. Mr. Utting gives the secular motions
of the sun's longitude and anomaly, and of the moon's longitude,
anomaly and node, from the most recent tables: from which he de
duces the correct period of a mean lunation; and thence the other
necessary quantities for the computation of the time of the mean
                                                           -
 conjunctions.
   The next papers were a series of observations by Major Hodg
son: 19. On the transit of Mercury over the sun's disc, on Nov. 4,
 1822,    2°. Occultations of stars by the moon; particularly of the
Pleiades on March 17, 1823. 3°. A set of equal altitudes for deter
mining the time at Futty Ghur. 4°. Transits of Moon and moon
culminating stars at the same place.
   Mr. Baily read the following extract of a letter from Professor
 Harding, of Göttingen.—“You will be pleased to hear of a small
variable star, which I have discovered since June 9th, in last year.
It is situated in Serpens; and my observations (which however are
not very correct) give                  its
                            position for 1800,  follows:                  as
                      AR    =    235° 22' 3"

“It has,         at   this time,    its  greatest light; and will soon begin    di                 to
minish.      As far         as
                            I    have    yet observed,        its
                                                          period seems       about       to   be

                     ANALYSIS OF SPATHOSE IRON.
    M. Lassaigne   has analysed a variety                 of this      ore from Tenzen  in
the Grisons; the resuits are:

    M. Lassaigne considers this as equivalent                   to   1 atom  of protocarbo
nate of iron, 3 atoms of carbonate of magnesia, 5 of carbonate of lime,
and 13 atoms of water: but adopting the atomic numbers employed in
 England, we must substitute 5 atoms for 3 of carbonate of magnesia.
    This mineral is white, with a shade of yellow; it is crystallized in
rhomboids. When heated by the blowpipe it decrepitates, becomes
more opake, yellow, and afterwards colourless: if the calcination
be performed in a glass tube closed at one end, the upper part of
it is moistened with a large quantity of water. The specific gravity
 of this mineral is 2.927; it therefore differs in this respect from
 carbonate of iron, the specific gravity of which, according to Kir
 wan, is 3:640 to 3810—Annales de Chimie et de Physique.
                      SALT OBTAINED               FROM OPIUM.
    M. Dupuis lately presented to the Société Philomathique a salt
 obtained from opium, which he considers as a natural compound of
 morphia, and such as it exists in the vegetable;—analysis induces
 him to believe that it is sulphate of morphia. The salt in question
 is obtained in the following manner: He exposes extract of opium,
 nearly of the consistence of thin honey, to the air for five or six
 months; this extract gradually becomes a crystalline mass: he
 mixes it with a small quantity of water, and the crystals precipitate;
 he decants the fluid, and thus separates a part of the crystals, which
 he purifies by washing them with a small quantity of water and
 then with cold alcohol.
     M. Dupuis concludes from his experiments that opium contains
  narcotine, and more of the sulphates of morphia, lime and potash.

                          ARSENIC          AND CADMIUM.
     M. Bischoff proposes a simple method of distinguishing arsenic
  and cadmium from each other. It is well known that both are pre
  cipitated of a yellowish colour by sulphuretted hydrogen; but ac
  cording to M. Bischoff, hydrosulphuret of ammonia (hydrosulfate
  d'ammoniaque) gives no precipitate with arsenious acid, but forms
  with cadmium.—Ibid. July.                                            -

                                SOLUTION: BY R. HARE, M.D.
    Through the discoveries of Sertuerner, it is now well known
that opium contains an alkaline substance called morphia, to which
it owes      its
              efficacy     promoting sleep and relieving pain: also, that

detecting opium; which has probably arisen from the circumstance
that the meconate           iron does not precipitate.

disseminated    through those portions of the stone which were adja
 cent to the fissures occupied by the metallic mineral. Towards the
 top of the section cakes of the sulphuret of lead were found in a
 loose state, and exactly filling the irregular cavities in which they
 were deposited.
    The above description            I
                                 received from one of the overseers and
from the men employed upon the road. As was desirous of ascer       I
taining as far as possible the truth of the account, T. Bunn, Esq.
of Frome, to whose love of science we are indebted for a know
ledge of this interesting phaenomenon, had the road opened for my
inspection.     The result verified the previous details.
   1 presume that this is the first instance in which galena has been
found in so comparatively recent a formation; but the connection
of the inferior oolite with the carboniferous limestone in that neigh
bourhood, apparently affords data for attempting an explanation
of its occurrence. The latter rock is well known to abound with
lead. At Shipham near Axbridge, the dolomitic conglomerate, which
occupies a position analogous to that of the inferior oolite of Frome,
also contains numerous irregular veins which yield galena. In both
the newer deposits the situation of the metal accords with the cha
racter of the stone. The inferior oolite possesses a natural tendency

hinge and valves noticed.       A fine specimen was exhibited, and the
statement of authors who affirm that it extends the whole length
of the tube proved to be erroneous; since these tubes, which are
formed by a peculiar secretion from the body of the animal, are
often many feet in length and circuitous in their course. This was
shown to be the fact, by a large piece of wood pierced in             direc                             all

 The opinion that the animal revolved was also presumed                  un                            be
 founded, for then only one valve (from the peculiar construction

the  living   and dead state.     Their manner           boring was explained, of

               Meteorological Observations                    for July       1827.                 239
    General Observations.—This month has been remarkably fine, dry, and
generally calm, but not hot for the season, except on the 7th and 8th, on
which days the thermometer in the shade rose to 80 degrees.          No mea
surable rain fell here from the 4th to the 19th, and the refreshing showers
on two or three days afterwards were found very beneficial to the herbage,
fruit, and corn crops. From the uniformly fair weather the mean barome
trical pressure is high for this period; and on many serene evenings the sky
round the horizon at sunset was tinged with light blue, surmounted by light
red and yellow, the brightest colours being opposite to the sun; but the
evening twilight reflected richer tints upon the surrounding water, and the
setting sun was frequently followed by small orange-coloured arcs, which
 indicated a continuance of fair weather.
    On the 29th, sheet lightning appeared soon after sunset, between the
N.W. and S.E. points, and emanated in quick succession from low cirro
 strative clouds through the night. These clouds appeared at noon in the
 character of descending cirri: they afterwards transformed into cirrostrati,
and were wafted in the evening to the western horizon by a brisk easterly
 wind under very hot sunshine, by which means they acquired much electri
 cal matter.
    The mean temperature of the external air this month is nearly one de
gree higher than the mean of July for the last eleven years.
    The wheat harvest has just commenced in this neighbourhood, (August
the 2nd) and from appearances here, and reports from             parts     the    all            of
country, the crops will          be
                              both abundant and    good quality.
                                                               of
    The atmospheric and meteoric phaenomena that have come within our
observations this month, are one lunar and two solar halos, six meteors,
lightning and thunder        the night
                                in       the 29th; and four gales

           which they have prevailed, namely, two from the S., one from
S.W., and one from the West.

                             [Continued     from p. 168.]
    N  the last Number of this Journal I have investigated the
    figure of a homogeneous planet entirely fluid. #. a pro
cess of analytical reasoning founded on the homogeneity of
the fluid, and the nature of the forces urging the particles, I
have shown, what is contrary to the usual theory, that two
conditions are necessary to the equilibrium of the whole mass.
I have next proved that, when both conditions are fulfilled,
the planet will have a permanent figure, and that this will not
be the case, if either of them be wanting.       This solution is not
different from the usual theory, except in one of the conditions,
to which objections have been made; and, as we shall chiefly
have occasion to speak of this condition, it may be proper to
recall what it consists in to the recollection of the reader.
   Conceive a level surface in the interior of the planet, and
let V denote the sum of all molecules contained within the
level surface divided by their respective distances from any
point assumed in that surface, and A.V, the like sum for                                all
the molecules exterior        the same surface; then the new pro
                                   to
perty      the equilibrium consists
          of                              this, that A.V must have
                                                  in

                                            the same level surface.
The    invariability       of
                        A.V. leads     some curious consequences.

in which the stratum acts upon the interior fluid body a b c.

 For the exterior matter can produce no action on the interior
fluid, except through the intervention of pressures on the sur
face, and the continuance of the equilibrium requires that these
pressures be equal.
   I   have already sufficiently replied to what is contained in
pp. 234, 235, of M. Poisson’s article in a note, p. 165, of the
last Number of this Journal.
    It does not appear that M. Poisson has refuted my theor
of the equilibrium of a homogeneous planet; and he never will
be able to refute           it.

mass of air, or when i = 0.       What may be their general re
lation, when     i
                 has acquired any finite value, cannot possibly
be duduced from this equation alone.          M. Poisson derives
this integral from the   expression (1), viz.
                      1   +       x 4   +   2   i   _          6    Nk–1

doubt that the formula (1) is thus satisfied: for if we differen
tiate the integral, and put i = 0 in the differential, we shall
arrive at the formula in question.    But there are innumerable
other integrals that will equally produce the same result in

M. Poisson's integral is not the only one that will fulfil the
required conditions; there is no evidence that it contains the
law of nature more than any other; it is dependent on a hy
pothesis, or an arbitrary assumption.
   We shall pursue this investigation on less exceptionable
principles in the manner following.    Suppose that the air is
condensed by the diminution of                            its

when the pressure is constant, the variations of latent heat and
temperature, i and r, preserve the same constant proportion,

results of the cerebral organization which, doubtless, are mo

superior to those of muscular structure or organization, to

cause of the blood's     fluidity,  it  may   seem at first sight diffi
cult to   demonstrate,    as  having    apparently    no real existence
in animal nature; but if the reality of things diminishes with
                                       ...?
their invisibility to our eye-sight, or in proportion as they
evade our senses, it              be a fruitless effort to search the
                      ..
finer textures and organizations of our bodies, for in so doing
we should wander from the substance to the shadow: but if
on the contrary the reality of things increases with their im
perceptibility to our senses, as is in truth the case; if the finer
textures and organizations of our bodies astonish us by the
beauty, the                and the perfection of their forms, as in
truth they do; we are labouring to a good purpose when we
are investigating them, we are tracing the direct path from
effects to causes, and proceeding by the method so insisted on
at the present day—of induction.

 so that each distinct stage is a medium and instrument, bear
 ing the energy of the antecedent stage fully and perfectly to

   Reduced to the beds which alone belong to the baculite
limestone, this rock appears to me to be as easily determinable
by    itsmineral structure and organic remains                any known              as
formation. Always, however, rejecting the solid calcareous
beds, containing milliolites, and those with pisolite concretions,
which under the name                       of
                                 fahlun have been confounded with

croscopical Cephalopodes, which have never seen in the marls
of the chalk, where they are replaced by small foraminous
corals, Craniae and Thecideae. These latter deposits much
resemble, as to fossils and incoherence, the beds, also subor
dinate to chalk, of Mirambeau, in the Charente Inferieure, and
that of Maëstricht.
   The different kinds of baculite limestone, such as have been
above enumerated, present either, as at Orglandes, uncon
nected and unstratified masses of compact limestone in the
midst of calcareous gravels containing the same fossils, and
subordinate to the same formation; or, as at Bonne Ville, very
extended thin beds, uniform tables, for the length of many
yards; or, as at Néhou, isolated marls without solid beds; or
lastly, as at Fréville, the entire system, composed of many
nearly horizontal strata, alternately coherent and friable, com
pact and marly; incontestably proving the relations of the
beds, elsewhere found isolated. The whole, however, as far
as can be judged from the few known places where workings
are carried on, of infinitely less thickness than the chalk of
the great basins of France and England.
  I  am only able to afford a very imperfect idea as to their
topographical extent, and shall add nothing to the notices
collected by M. de Gerville, who can best assign them their
true limits. This rock, more particularly developed to the
 S. of Valognes, in a space comprised between Sainte Mère
Eglise, Montebourg, and Pont l’Abbé, would appear to have
a direction from E. to W., and to form one system, at pre
sent interrupted by several small rivers.      I have only studied
it in the communes of     Fréville, Cauquigny,   Bonne Ville,             Or
glandes, and Golleville, to which list M. de Gerville adds
  Gourbeville, Hauteville, Néhou, Rauville, and Sainte Co
 lombe.      I
            cannot however assert that all these localities would
 afford the true compact limestone, equivalent to chalk.
   I  have no where very evidently seen the immediate super
 position of this rock on those more ancient, though many cir
 cumstances connected with relative position and dip lead me
 to conclude that it rests on the oolite limestone, named Cal
caire de Valognes, at Orglandes and Picauville; on Calcaire
 avec Gryphées arquées” at Cauquigny and Fréville, and on
 transition rocks near Néhou;            biti
                                         have no where observed
 the slightest fact which  might  lead us to doubt the posteriority

upper chalk, (Belemnites mucronatus, Ananchites ovatus, Cra

dle chalk (crate moyenne); and some, though peculiar to the
baculite limestone, more nearly approach the fossils of the
chalk, than those of any other formation.

chalk with flint acquire, in two countries distant from each
other, (the N.E. of Ireland and the Vicentin,) a compactness
with conchoidal fracture, more perfect, more homogeneous
perhaps, than any of the Jura limestone beds", even passing
into a granular and spathose structure; and we are enabled,
with the effect, to discover the cause of this alteration from a
previous state, in the influence of the igneous action of the
basalts common to these two countries.
     The uplifting of the chalk at Corfu Castle appears to
coincide with            its
                       hardness;       Mr. Webster informs
                                               as                  that              us

 262        M. Desnoyers    on the Chalk   of the Cotentin.
  dier, Omalius d'Halloy, Constant Prévost, de Bonnard, and
  Brongniart, have observed this hardening of the chalk in many
  parts of France, either in entire beds or in nodules.   M. Elée.
  de Beaumont has observed many remarkable facts in the de
  partments of the Seine Inferieure, and Eure, at St. Etienne de
  Rouvray, Louviers, Caumont, Vernon, Rolleboise, in the pe
  ninsula formed by the Seine from Elbeuf to la Bouille: these
  are, the occurrence, in the midst of loose beds, of unconnected
 beds or masses, sufficiently compact, homogeneous, and sub
 lamellar to be worked as marble, the connection of which with
 the upper chalk was observed by M. de Beaumont. Similar
 deposits appeared to me to occupy the same situation at Châ
  teaudun (Eure et Loire).
     MM. Conybeare, Webster, Parkinson, Phillips, Mantell,
 and Winch, have given numerous examples of this modifica
 tion of the chalk of the S.E. of England and Yorkshire, in their
 memoirs.
    But to return to the Valognes chalk:—No other bears so great
 a resemblance to it in texture and composition as the spheru
 lite coarse chalk (craie grossière d spherulites) of Sainonge,
 Périgord, and Gascony. We have, in fact, the same union of a
 compact and crystalline cement, penetrating a mass of the re
 mains of shells and corals; the same alternation of friable and
 solid, compact and granular beds; in a word, it appears in
 these cases to be the calcareous sand of Maestricht connected
 by a spathose paste, the effect of a chemical solution posterior
 to a mechanical deposit.
     Can these analogies, joined to the observed place of the
coarse chalk of Saintonge and Périgord, between the green
sand (sable vert) and chalk with flints, suffice for supposing
the Valognes chalk to have occupied a precisely identical si
tuation in the midst of the great chalk formation?       We have
seen that, in general, compactness is but a slight kind of ap
proximation; and that from the assemblage of the other cha
racters, the baculite limestone does not completely resemble
any one of the various divisions, elsewhere comprised between
ferruginous or iron sand (sable ferrugineur) and the tertiary
rocks. May we not presume that it is not identical with any
one of them, but that, contemporaneous with them, it repre
sents the whole in geological order, with variations produced
by the different circumstances of the deposits 2 It will be ob
served that these modifying circumstances must have been the
same in two other localities, above cited as approaching the
baculite limestone, Maéstricht and La Charente. Now, these
three chalk rocks are remarkably analogous in being           de

posited near transition rocks: the chalk of Maestricht, at the
foot of the Ardennes; that of Saintonge, not far from the gra
nites of La Vendée; and that of Valognes, near the old rocks
of the Cotentin. The absence in the latter country of the fer
ruginous sand (sable ferrugineur), the still uncertain place of
the greensand (sable vert), and of every rock which might
exclusively represent the upper chalk; the mixture of the fos
sils of the two chalks, and the isolated geographical situation
of this little basin, are circumstances sufficiently powerful to
afford colour for this supposition.              H. T. D. B.

order with the curve AB in P, and therefore so as to coincide
with it in the consecutive points P and P.

  If inthe equations we have thus deduced for the involute to
the caustic by refraction, (m) be made equal to unity, we shall
at once determine the involute to the caustic by reflexion.
Thus for rectangular coordinates, we have

Or, to determine the curve in terms of R and P,                                                    we have

  From these last equations                     it will be easily seen that the                                         in
volute to the caustic by reflexion, is in fact the curve which
would be traced out by a point similarly situated with the ra
diating point in a curve similar and equal to the reflecting
curve made to roll on                its
                           circumference, similar points having
first been   contact, and both curves being

in favour of my opinion. The Anglo-Saxon for herring was
haºning; and at this time it is in Dutch haring, in German
hiring, and in French hareng. The derivation is so obvious,
that no other either has been, or can be, offered;—how then
can it be said, that my explanation of it is strained, in order
“to favour a given theory?” With respect to Herringfleet,
the existing form of the name is a far better authority to as
certain     its
            origin, than that which was employed              the Nor                          by

 the adjunct be Herlyng or Heryng, it cannot alter the fact that
 Herringfleet, in the Anglo-Saxon times, was situated upon an

taken, on which this statement rests?—From the vale                                             of

pressions of the sea.        These changes I conceive to have been
effected    by successive transfers of the existing body of water
from one      hemisphere     to the other; and the solution of the
problem, which they exhibit, appears to be connected with
some of the most interesting astronomical phaenomena, dis
played in the history of the heavens.              I have been induced
thus to anticipate the course of my inquiry, and to point out
the nature of the general inferences which I shall hereafter
draw from a long chain of evidence, in order to explain my
view of the distinction between the Crag stratum and the
shelly deposits of the Norfolk valleys.          The chalk which con
stitutes so large and important a feature in the central basin
of Europe, was formed in the bosom of a tranquil ocean, whose
surface must have been more than 1000 feet above that of the
sea, now existing in this quarter of the globe.              Beneath the
present level of those seas, we find the most decided traces of
submerged forest-land, at points so distant from each other
and over spaces so extensive, that the fact cannot possibly be
accounted for by any subsidence or sinking of the ground on
which these trees were produced.             From the nature of their
remains it is evident, that they can have flourished only on
dry land; and as they grew in some of the lowest hollows of
the chalk, it is equally clear, that the waters, in which that
formation was consolidated, must have been withdrawn to
such an extent as to leave uncovered considerable tracts, which
at this time are constantly overflowed by the tides. During
this retreat of the waters, their level appears to have been
subject to repeated minor fluctuations, and the lower basins
of the chalk were filled with beds of sand and clay, which in
some districts exhibit the vestiges of fresh-water tribes, alter
nating with the marine exuviae of an intermediate date. These
beds seem scarcely to have extended into Norfolk, where the
general range of the chalk was probably above their level;
some portions of them may however rest in the deepest bot
toms of the valleys, and on the declivities of the present coast;
and it was perhaps on their surface that the forests arose and
the animals lived, which a subsequent catastrophe over
whelmed*. At the period to which I am referring, there was
no variety of climate over the whole face of our globe; the
    * Mr. W. Smith, in his geological map of Norfolk, has indeed delineated
Strumpshaw and Poringland hills, as detached outlying masses of the Lon
don blue clay; but I believe that Mr. Taylor will agree with me in regard
ing this as an error; for I am not aware that any organic remains have ever
been found in these hills, to identify them with the formation to which
Mr. Smith considers them to belong.

 vegetable and animal tribes, which are at present never found
beyond the tropical regions, abounded then even in the highest
northern latitudes, for their vestiges have been discovered there
 under such circumstances, as prove them to have been natives
of the districts in which they perished. Their remains are
either buried under, or associated with beds of sand and gravel,
which rise to between 300 and 400 feet above the present level
of the sea, and from which it is manifest, that the waters must
 have again invaded these tracts, rising above the height at
which these memorials of their action still exist. By this ele
vation of the ocean, the forests which had grown up during                                  its
retreat, were largely overwhelmed,—many                the land animals,

             But am unable to perceive how they can reconcile
with their views of the question, the positive fact, that con
siderable portions of what was dry land before the lastirruption
of the waters, are at this time actually covered by the sea.
This is proved by the submarine forests, that have been found
on every coast of our island. The lands on which they grew,
must have been at that distant period far above the range of
the waves; they must also have been submerged by that last
catastrophe, which in the current phraseology of the day is
called diluvian.      It cannot then be denied, that before this
event, there were sylvan tracts which are now buried beneath
the floods; and if we compare those remains of them, which
have been discovered on our own shores, with the correspond

ing traces that exist on the opposite coasts of the continent,
it will be found            no means improbable, that they were
originally connected, and that the whole bed of the intervening

   From whatever cause then, this last great influx of waters
over our quarter of the globe may have proceeded, it is ad

                 it all
mitted by          parties, that such

to  their present level, the last remaining portions                them,                        of
which left our district, must have flowed out through the
valleys, which       this time open
                          at                 the ocean.    Consequently

 ing these circumstances, the only point which is left unsettled
 by the former, is decided by the latter, and the whole scheme
 becomes clear and uniform; but by persisting in keeping them
 separate, we are bewildered in a maze of inexplicable mysti
 cism, and embarrassed amidst a chaos of imaginary strata and
  supposititious diluvian remains.             So also by pursuing these
 principles, the subsequent conversion of this aestuary into a
  range of solid and productive land, exhibits the continued ad
  vance of the same operation;                     its
                                              progress displays the result

  Hence,    if we find    deposits    that are actually restricted within
 those limits, the legitimate inference                   is,

of my Observations, referred to one bed, a section of which,
being laid open, showed “that it gradually shelved off to a
point as it receded from the valley, and soon terminated.”
Since that time it has been completely cut away by the chalk
diggers, and not a vestige of it is now left. In another pit                                        I
noticed two layers; the lowest not much above the surface of
the chalk, consisting of broken shells, mixed in an indurated
mass of gravel and ferruginous sand; and the upper about ten
feet higher, composed principally of the Buccinum undatum.”
and Turbo littoreus loosely imbedded in a white quartzose
sand. On my last visit to this spot I found the latter entirely
exhausted for the space of about fifty yards, except a small
portion not more than six inches deep and seven feet in length,
which it was evident, that the next excavation would altoge
ther remove.               If
                    to these decisive cases we add the striking
fact, that no traces whatever of corresponding beds are dis
cernible in any upland situations, where the strata have been
actually explored, we have a right to infer from such circum
stances, that these marine deposits are confined to the basins
of the valleysl. It is far however from my object to contend,
that they are          all

                                     of

 caution in drawing conclusions from the specimens exhibited
 in them. None are more easily imposed upon than the vir
 tuoso;-none look at Nature with a more contracted ken than
 the mere student of curiosities.     Let us for instance suppose,
 that Mr. Taylor had presented to one of these repositories of
 wonders a nicely fractured stone, neatly labelled “Granite,
jrom the Black Meg Rock, near Beeston, on the coast of Norfolk.”
 Some traveller in search of the scientific, espies this amongst
 the other treasures of the geognostically stored glass-case, and
 enters a minute description of it in his note-book.          At the
 next conversazione he details to his   listening  coterie the newly
 discovered   fact, that mountains of granite  exist in Norfolk, and
 silences every sceptical inquiry, by appealing to this publicly
 displayed portion of Black Meg as an “absolute proof” of
 his assertion.       I
                     should wish to be informed how such an in
 ference would be more rash, more unfounded, more prepos
terous, than the assumption, that the recent shells of the Nor
wich Valley must belong to the Crag stratum, because “the
British Museum contains the tooth of a Mastodon,” which was
found there, and because a few other “travelled fragments”
of a more ancient bed may perchance be dispersed amongst
them. In the one instance Mr. Taylorimmediately perceives that
 all the boulders and pebbles          primitive rocks, which
                                                 of                                       lie   on

 floods and the German Ocean, by their own close resemblance

XLVI.     Description of two remarkable Ores of Copper from
     Cornwall.  By WILLIAM PHILLIPs, F.L.S. F.G.S. &c. *
     With an Analysis of the same, by M. FARADAY, F.R.S. &c.
A MASS         consisting of a few hundred pounds weight of a
     very singular kind of copper ore, was lately found in a
vein in Condurrow mine, which is situated in granite, and
about half a mile south of the old and celebrated copper mine
called Dolcoath, which is near to Camborne in the county of
Cornwall.
   In the aspect of the mass in question there is nothing indi

 substance be heated in the open air on platina foil, nearly the
 same effects and appearances are produced, but the residue is
 black from the superficial oxidation of the copper. If the sub
 stance be heated upon carbonaceous matter, or by the reducing
part of a blowpipe flame, then a reduction of part of the ar
senious acid takes place, and a metallic residuum containing
more arsenic than in the former case is produced, and which
is consequently more fusible.
    This substance dissolves entirely in nitric acid, the portions
of metal, &c., which are not naturally in the state of oxide,
being oxidized at the expense of the acid. When pulverized
and acted upon by cold muriatic acid, arsenite and muriate of
copper are found in solution, apparently without the evolution
of hydrogen, and metallic arsenic remains undissolved.
    I have little doubt that the substance is a mechanical de
posit, and   I  find it to vary somewhat in composition. 34.5
grains being heated carefully in a tube, the loss of water and
of arsenious acid was ascertained, and then the metallic resi
duum, weighing 22:45 grains, was dissolved in nitromuriatic
acid; the sulphuric acid formed was separated by muriate of
baryta, and the sulphur in it was ascertained; the excess of
baryta was then removed, and afterwards the oxide of copper
thrown down by caustic potash, and ultimately the arsenic
acid formed thrown down by nitrate of lead. The proportions
were as beneath:
               34°5 parts consist of         100 parts consist of
             Water . . . . . . 3-1                   8°987

    The manner in which these substances are arranged in the
mineral is uncertain, and may be put several ways. It is pro
bably a mixture of metallic arsenic, arsenite of copper, oxide of
copper, a little copper pyrites; one or more of these substances
being in combination with water.

limed and crystallized as in the former case; the quantity was
however small, and the rest of the mineral fuzed at a red heat
into a substance which, when cold, was brittle, gray, and by
examination proved to consist of copper and arsenic, in com
bination with a small quantity of sulphur, and a trace of iron.
I  have no doubt that the gray metallic hard substance is an
arseniuret of copper, but the difficulty of separating it perfectly
from the accompanying bodies will interfere with an accurate
determination of              its
                     composition.                                                                     .

nothing of sufficient strength could be driven with so limited
a space to work in.
   Mooring-blocks are likewise objectionable in shallows, as
where a vessel draws much water she is liable to run foul of
them, and thereby sustain considerable damage,      an evil that
is avoided  by  making mooring-anchors   with  only one fluke.

NEXT   use
             to that of nails, there are few things in more general
            amongst    artificers than screws. I do not recollect
seeing in any publication the results of any experiments on
the force necessary to draw screws of iron, commonly called
wood screws, out of given depths of wood. Having here
tofore published the force necessary to extract nails driven
into wood, the following results of my experiments on the force
required to extract screws, made some time ago, may be of
some interest.
   The    screws   I  used were about two inches in length, 1%;
diameter at the exterior of the threads,          Tº  diameter at the
bottom, the depth of the worm or thread being Tàu, and the
number of threads in one inch = 12. They were passed
through pieces of wood, exactly half an inch in thickness, and
drawn out by the weights specified in the following table: , ,
            Dry beach . . . . . .                  . 460 lbs.
             Ditto ditto . . . . . . . . 790                           -
             Dry sound ash . . . . .                  790
             Dry oak . . . . . .                      760
             Dry mahogany                 -  -        770
             Dry elm       . . . . . .                655
             Dry sycamore         . .    .   . . . 830
   The weights were supported about two minutes before the
screws were extracted.
    I have also found the force required to draw similar screws
out of deal and the softer wood about half the above.
    From which we may infer, as a rule to estimate the full
force of adhesion, in hard wood...200,000 dºt = f;
                   and in soft wood...100,000 d8 t = f;

                                                 f    being the force in pounds to extract
        may from the above experiments observe the approxi
       We
mation to perfection in the art of screw-making; for had the
screw been greater in diameter, there would have been a waste
of material; or had it been less, it would have been not suffi
ciently strong, which may be proved as follows:
   The cohesion of wrought iron has been found from a num
ber of experiments to be about 43,000 pounds per cylindrical
inch; and as the smallest diameter of screw used in my experi
ments was 15, it would have been torn asunder by a force of
about 968 pounds; or if the hard wood had been 5-8ths of an
inch thick, into which it had been screwed, the screw would
have been broken, instead of forcing        passage out   the                      its                               of

the north, towards the south.             At Lowestoft, the sand hil
locks gradually decline from the Corton extremity towards the
Ness, from nearly twenty feet in height at first, to a few inches
over the shingle. The same at Yarmouth, where the high
sand-hills decrease from Caister southward, and cover (as the
engraving exhibits) scarcely one half the entire bank. With
regard, therefore, to the origin of one large portion of the
blown sand, it is perfectly obvious that it has travelled south
wards from the great depositories in the cliffs and hills, situ
ated to the north of these points; other portions are continually
added by that which is drifted by the wind from the beach,
and is retained by the plants which appear to be designed to
perform that particular office.          It is also obvious that these
embankments commence at their northern extremities.
   The process which has been detailed, is not hypothetical,
nor has it been coloured for the sake of harmonizing with a
favourite theory; it is the result of some years attention to the
circumstances which, requiring very little of the assistance of
man, have formed those bulwarks around our coast that rival
in stability many of his boasted works.
    One word as to the source whence the materials are derived,
 which Mr. Robberds conceives inadequate “to produce an
average elevation even of one inch,” over the peninsula of
 Yarmouth.
   It is impossible, when considering attentively the ever-shift
ing bed of the German Ocean; the enormous extent of                                               its
shoals; the multitude                      its
                                   sand-banks; the powerful tendency
                                      of
of  the north-east      winds,   and the great tidal current from the

cess received from the alluvium of the adjacent high grounds,
the deposits by land-floods, and the final covering of peat, was
estimated to the utmost probable extent of those contributing
causes.     It is agreed that a solid substance has been substi
tuted for a fluid; the surface of which solid substance,                                                  in
cluding these accretions, is ascertained to be below the level
both of the adjacent rivers and of the ocean.                 Those ancient
receptacles, formerly filled with water, are now occupied, to
the depth of from 10 to 20 feet, with that description of de
posit common to                  all

   The proofs, physical and historical, having been scrutinized
with caution, and as Mr. Robberds is pleased to add, with
candour, it would appear that the depression of the sea, to the
extent assigned, is far from a necessary consequence deduci
ble from that evidence.    It has been shown” that the bed of
marine shells, at an elevation of 40 feet, alleged to be similar
to existing races in our seas, and marking out the line of an
ancient beach, belong chiefly to non-existing species, and to
the highest in the series of anti-diluvial formationsl.    The
circumstances relating to these testacea, on which much stress
was laid, and which probably suggested the first hints whereon
to found the hypothesis, not being again adverted           not                                          to,  it   is

 304        Mr. R. C. Taylor                 on the Embankments of the German Ocean,
 ence, and candid inquiry, will not unfrequently tend, and
            how essential to geological speculations is the
 vious collection and strict examination of facts.
      It will
          be remembered that the subject of debate was, not
so much the level of the ocean, as the validity of the proofs
contained within, and adduced from, the district under con
sideration, and an examination of those data which were urged
                                                                                                                    con

as strong indications of the gradual depression of the waters.
Possessing much local acquaintance with the field of inquiry,
 Ientered into the discussion with some confidence; and the
evidence being unsupported by facts drawn from a wider
       of observation, the investigation appeared, as indeed it
professed, restricted to this district peculiarly.
   When in pursuance of the plan sketched by Mr. Robberds,
the proofs selected from other shores and from more distant
regions are arranged, we shall possess better and more abun
dant criteria by which to form our judgement: a more extended
and interesting field will be opened to our contemplation, and
the opinions of the author will be more satisfactorily developed.
     I
     shall not weaken the interest which a consideration of the
prominent features of this discussion has created, by combating
minor points of difference; being unwilling to appear too te
nacious in subordinate details. § am well content to leave it
to the decision of those, whose judgement in matters of science
we are accustomed to respect.    Whatever that decision may
be, we shall have had the mutual satisfaction of contributing,
through the medium of an amicable controversy, and apart
from         its
        speculative portions,      more accurate knowledge

feet to the Ohio bottom, which is low and swampy near the hill.
This descent is probably made by the debris and earth rolling down
from the hill, and gradually accumulating for ages, so as to cover a
larger portion of the sandstone rock below the surface, than now
appears above.    The Ohio river no doubt once washed the base of

         ON THE FASCINATION OF SNAKES; BY MR. NASH.
   I   have often heard stories about the power that snakes have to
charm birds and animals, which, to say the least,                 I
                                                          always treated
with the coldness of scepticism, nor could I believe them until con
vinced by ocular demonstration.          A case occurred in Williams
burgh, (Mass.) one mile south of the house of public worship, by the
way side, in July last. As             I
                                   was walking in the road at noon-day,
my attention was drawn to the fence by the fluttering and hopping
of a robin red-breast, and of a cat-bird, which upon my approach
flew up, and perched on a sapling two or three rods distant; at this
instant a large black snake reared his head from the ground near
the fence. I immediately stepped back a little, and sat down upon
an eminence; the snake in a few moments slunk again to the earth,
with a calm placid appearance, and the birds soon after returned
and lighted upon the ground near the snake : first stretching their
wings upon the ground, and spreading their tails, they commenced
fluttering around the snake, drawing nearer at almost every step,
until they stepped near or across the snake, which would often move a
little or throw himself into a different posture, apparently to seize his
prey, which movements, Inoticed, seemed to frighten the birds, and
they would veer off a few feet, but return again as soon as the snake
was motionless.       All that was wanting for the snake to secure the
victims seemed to be, that the birds should pass near his head, which
they would probably have soon done, but at this moment a waggon
drove up and stopped. This frightened the snake, and it crawled
across the fence into the grass; notwithstanding, the birds flew
over the fence into the grass also, and appeared to be bewitched to
flutter around their charmer, and it was not until an attempt was
made to kill the snake that the birds would avail themselves of their
wings and         fly   to
                       forest one hundred rods distant.
                         a
    The movements of the birds while around the snake seemed                       to
be   voluntary, and without the least constraint; nor did they utter
any distressing cries,        appear enraged,
                               or                      as

any thing else,               I
                    will not attempt to determine; possibly this power
 may be owing to different causes in different kinds of snakes.     But
so far as the black snake is concerned, it seems to be nothing more
 than an enticement or allurement with which the snake is endowed
to procure his food.
   In the month of June, 1823, in company with a friend,            had                                 I
just crossed the Hudson river, from the town of Catskill, and was
proceeding in a carriage, by the river, along the road, which is here
very narrow, with the water on one side and a steep bank covered
 with bushes on the other. Our attention was in this place arrested
by a number of small birds, of different species, flying across the
road and then back again, and turning and wheeling in manifold
 gyrations, and with much chirping, yet making no progress from
 the particular place over which they fluttered.     We were not left
long in doubt, when we observed a black snake of considerable size,
partly coiled and partly erect from the ground, with the appearance
of great animation, his eyes brilliant, and his tongue, rapidly,and
incessantly brandished. This reptile we perceived to be the cause
 and the centre of the wild motions of the birds, which ceased, as
soon as the snake, alarmed by the approach of the carriage, retired
into the bushes; the birds, however, alighted upon the neighbouring
 branches, probably awaiting the re-appearance of their tormentor
and enemy. Our engagements did not permit us to wait to see the
issue of this affair, which seems to have been similar to that observed
by Mr. Nash.-AMERICAN Editor.—Silliman's Journal, June 1827.

carbonate of potash; 4thly, probably a little albumine; 5thly, in the
human saliva, a fatty matter containing phosphorus; 6thly, soluble
salts, consisting of acetate of potash, the presence of which, how
ever, cannot be ascertained by any direct means, but only by               in
cineration; carbonate of potash, which in the sheep occasions the
salivá to effervesce with acids; it is probably in the state of bicar
bonate. The saliva of the sheep contains it in the greatest quantity;
then that of the dog, and lastly, human saliva; phosphate of potash,
in the greatest quantity in man and the sheep, and least in the dog;
sulphate of potash, which exists in the three kinds of saliva in very
small quantity; muriate of potash, an alkaline sulphocyanuret, there
is most of it in human saliva, a very small portion in that of the
sheep and dog's saliva is probably free from it; the muriate in man
is almost entirely that of potash; in the dog and sheep it is muriate
of soda, with very little muriate of potash; the contents of the sa

            planet entirely fluid cannot have a permanent
figure unless          all

this property except the elliptical spheroid oblate         the poles                  at

                                  every planet, could we suppose
it entirely fluid and homogeneous.        But the consequences we
have mentioned cannot          deduced from the single principle,

planets, the problem is simplified extremely, as we are per
mitted to reject the square and other powers of the fraction
expressing the proportion of the two forces.            By taking ad
vantage of this simplification Legendre proved, in the Mém.
de l'Acad. des Sciences 1784, that the elliptical spheroid is the
only figure deducible from the equation of the outer surface
of a planet entirely fluid. The process of Legendre has been
practically executed only as far as the first power of the cen
trifugal force: but it is shown that the calculation may be con
tinued to any required degree of exactness; that there is only
one series expressing the radius of the spheroid; and, conse
quently, only one figure which will answer the conditions of
the problem, although the nature of that figure is not precisely
ascertained.     M. Poisson has lately remarked that the figure
in   question   must be an elliptical spheroid, the radius being
expanded in a series; because, when the centrifugal force is
very small, it is known that the conditions of equilibrium can
be fulfilled by an elliptical spheroid, and by one such figure
only, which must therefore coincide with the single figure
found by the other process.        But there is some reason to de
mur with respect to M. Poisson's argument, inasmuch as the
 equilibrium is not equally sure in the two cases. In the el

                                  in reply to M. Poisson.                                              325
gendre is insufficient to prove the equilibrium of a homoge
neous planet.     The only question that remains to be consi
dered, in order to enable us to form a correct judgement of
his investigation, is to inquire whether the figure determined
by the equations (1) and (2) be necessarily an elliptical sphe
roid.       If
            this shall be found to be the case, it must be occa
sioned  by  the influence of some principle that has escaped
notice.
     A  little reflection will soon convince us that the value of y
deduced       from the equations (1) and (2) can possibly be no
other than the radius of an elliptical spheroid expanded in a
 series.     This is in reality a mathematical consequence of the
discovery of Maclaurin.            An elliptical spheroid of any oblate
 •ess will be in equilibrio, as was proved by that geometer,
when it revolves with a proper rotatory velocity. The same
mass of fluid may, therefore, assume every variety of the form
mentioned, from the sphere to the most extreme oblateness,
and still be in equilibrio in every case, provided the rotation
be adapted to the figure. Now the equation (1) is common
to   all  the spheroids         equilibrio, expressing generally the re
                                   in
lation between the oblateness and the centrifugal force.                                                    It
follows, therefore, from the received principles
                                                                              in of

if we set out from any one                 the spheroids
                                                  of            question, we
may thence find the whole suit                related  figures

their common equation.
    The investigation             Legendre falls exactly under the de

it is impossible by means of that equation to deduce from the
sphere any other figure beside the elliptical spheroid.     we                                   If
set out from any other initial figure but the sphere, or, more
generally, from any other figure but one of the elliptical
spheroids into which the same mass of fluid may be moulded,
it will be impossible to obtain any solution of the problem of
a homogeneous planet by means of the equation (1) alone.
   The rationale of the analytical process of Legendre is un
doubtedly such as we have just explained. It is founded on
the connection that necessarily subsists between              the ellip            all

introduction of new matter, I will now, with your permission,
limit myself to a few remarks necessarily suggested by Mr. Rob

pears applicable to the case, am certainly open to the charge
of adhesion to the modern school of geology. Most English
geologists have, for the sake of convenience,              but without

                                                their existence. But

                                                                   and,

 and,     course, the latter never penetrate into the older for
          of
 mation. Consequently, the extent of these beds, internally,
 would be governed by the distance at which the plane of the
 one is intersected by the slope of the other.    The principal
 excavation is that at  Whitlingham,   which              I
                                                 understand has
 been worked from time immemorial, and the face of the chalk
hill has been removed at least 100 yards. Yet have col                I
lected, and now possess, from this perpendicular face in the
beds overlying the chalk, numerous specimens of testacea. In
some parts of this excavation, intermediate between the chalk
and sand, was a bed, about a foot thick, of coarse angular
flints, much resembling those which interpose almost uninter
ruptedly between the plastic clay and the chalk, and contain
ing shells. The deposits above the chalk at this place have
also produced remains of the elephant, mastodon, deer, whale,
and small fish *.
   Mr. R. ascribes the presence of extinct species of shells to
their accidental admission; and with equal facility the ani
mal remains, of which I enumerated four or five genera from
a variety of localities (although I am somewhat humorously
made to announce a solitary, but “prodigious” specimen,)
are likewise fortuitously introduced from some “earlier” stra
tum.
   From the observations              I have been
                                         enabled to make, both
in the Norwich beds and in distant     parts  of the formation,
the animal remains are commonly blended with the mass, or in
the detritus immediately overlying; by which circumstance we
may conjecture that they were partly of contemporaneous and
partly of subsequent origin, with the testacea.
   The area occupied by the crag extends, with few interrup
tions, from the borders of Essex, along the eastern side of
Suffolk, over an average width of about seven miles, contract
ing toward the north, and partially concealed there by diluvial
clay. In this southern or Suffolk portion the testaceous ex
uviae are astonishingly abundant, and are applied as a valuable
manure. Further northward we distinctly resume the traces
of this deposit:      beds then become thinner;

ceases, and the chalk attains   superior elevation.

                the circumstances, the general agreement      the                              of

                                             to

Norwich extremity.

netic system of our globe.
   The experiment was made as early as the 5th of April,
1741, by Professor Celsius, in Upsal, and the instrument
maker, Graham, in London.        Celsius found on that day the
needle becoming restless at 2 o'clock P.M., so that at 5 o'clock
it was 1° 40' more west than it had been at 10 o'clock A.M.
At 5 o'clock 18 minutes it had receded to the E. by 20, and
6 minutes later it went again 18' westward.           From that time
till half-past 8 o'clock next morning it went back to           usual                    its
position.         In

                    observe his needle        the same day,    on

the appearance of the sky, lying towards N.E. and S.W.
The 21st of April the sky was overcast.          At Stórdalen, near
Drontheim, where meteorological observations are made by
Mr. Heyerdahl, the rector, the 30th and 31st of March were
snowy, and the 1st of April, a cloudy sky; the 17th of August,
at 10 P.M. we had rain at Christiania; at Vadso, near War
dóchusw, at 9 P.M., by Mr. Stockfleth, the rector,’s observa
tion, the atmosphere was dull; the 21st at half-past 11,
cloudy; the 25th, at 11 o'clock 40 minutes, at Christiania,
clear, with aurora borealis, which was also observed by Mr.
Prebend Herzberg, at Hardanger; the 29th at midnight,clear,
a little cloudy near the horizon.       But in the meteorological
tables of    July, August,   and  September,  communicated during
my absence by Mr. Holmboe, the lecturer, on a journey round
the gulf of Bothnia, the observation occurs:         “In the latter
days of August, aurorae were seen on several evenings,” which,
according to what I have been told by Mr. Holmboe, had
been unobserved by himself, but seen by others.           The 10th,
 Mr. H.    saw,   at Christiania,  a beautiful arch of aurora below
 Ursa Major, and therefore the same which had been seen a
little before at Leith. The 7th of October in the evening, the
 sky was overcast at Christiania; the 3rd and 4th of November,
 it snowed there in the evening: at Bergen, however, an
 aurora was seen by Mr. Bohr. The 22nd, the sky at Chris
 tiania was clear, but no aurora is noticed.
    Mr. Holmboe's observation relative to the many aurorae
 boreales seen in the latter part of August, makes it very pro
 bable that they appeared during the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd, of
 that month; which were the days when the irregularities of
 the needle were observed in Paris, without any aurorae having
 been noticed in Edinburgh; and we should consequently not
 be obliged to assume with M. Arago, “that there are other
 unknown causes which act on the motions of the magnetic
  needle.”
     The following observations, with respect to the above re
  marks of     M. Arago on the spontaneous action of the aurora
 on the   magnetic    needle in very distant places, are rather    in
  teresting.     From the 23rd till the 31st of August,     I resided
  at Haparanda, near Torneo. In order to discover whether
  the usual variation in magnetic intensity which I found in
  Christiania, was also observable near the arctic circle, I ob
  served from a window of the inn, the time of 300 horizontal
  oscillations with one of Dollond's cylinders, as follows.

to which all observations are reduced is fixed at = t, the tem
perature during the observation at = t, the time of oscilla

to the normal temperature is =                     – T.

     The sky not being   clear, no trace of the aurora borealis
could be seen in the     evening,  which was observed at Chris
tiania and Hardanger*.       It was just the time when M. Arago
noticed an unusual irregularity in the motion of the magnetic
needle. Thence we may conclude: 1. That the irregular va
riations in the central direction of the magnetic powers of the
earth, which evince themselves by the wandering of the mag
netic needle in a certain part on the surface of the earth, is
also connected with a contemporaneous change in the magni
tude of the power's intensity.   2. That these irregular changes
show themselves at the same time in places at great distances
from each other (the distance between Paris and Tornea is
about 300 geographical miles), and probably extends from
pole to pole. 3. That therefore they do not consist of any lo
cal action on the needle of the material substance emanating
from the surface of the earth, which forms the aurora borealis;
but are caused by a general disturbance of the whole globe:
i.e. by a removal of the equilibrium in the whole system of
magnetic powers, which is again a cause of the polar lights.
   As it is probable that M. Arago will proceed in his daily
observations of the deviation of the needle, I shall, in order to
contribute something towards our knowledge respecting the
connection of the aurora and magnetism, note for the future
with more care than hitherto, even the smallest traces of au
rora that may appear in Christiania; and          have also re                   I

    1. The columns of light shooting up from the northern
horizon towards the zenith are not connected, but consist of
short parallel rays (or, as Dalton observes, cylinders of light),
whose direction nearly coincides with that of the dipping
needle.      For when these columns of light pass by the zenith,
they seem to be broken off on that point, and form what is
called the crown.         Let NS (Plate III. fig.                        1.)

branch of the Aloéan family), but gives a monographical sketch
of the subject, and an enumeration of      the species and va    all

    Mr. Haworth's Description of new      Succulent Plants.      345
 genus Gasteria.      This however was, and even still remains,
 an unrivalled   figure of the Gasteria carinata.
    In 1759, the well-known Dr. (afterwards Sir John) Hill, of
 “voluminous memory,” published his Hortus Kewensis (the
 first public list of a Garden, now the richest in the known
 world), in which he gives but twelve species of his genus Aloe,
 one of which afterwards became the Aletris uvaria, and latterly,
 the type of the genus Tritoma; and one other, the Agave vir
 ginica of Authors.      And of Sir John's ten remaining Aloes,
 only one (his Aloe disticha) belongs to the genus Gasteria.
     Nevertheless it must not be forgotten, that although Sir
 John Hill enumerated but twelve species of Aloe; Miller, in
 the last edition of his Dictionary, had published the year be
 fore (1768), what he considered as 23 species of Aloe; of which
 however, one is the above-mentioned Tritoma uvaria, and an
 other the aforesaid Agave virginica.       And of the remaining
 twenty-one, three only belong to Gasteria, the subject of our
 present Decade; viz. No. 13, Aloe linguiforme (meliùs lingui
Jormis); No. 20, Aloe verrucosa; and No. 21, the above
 mentioned Aloe carinata.
     Prior to that period, Linnaeus had published, in 1764, the
 second edition of his Species Plantarum, enumerating in it
 eight species of Aloe only; and one of these was Tritoma
 uvaria; a remarkable proof this, of the inferiority of his judge
 ment to that of Dillenius and Miller,-on those subjects only
 perhaps. And yet, like them, he had recently seen the then
 matchless Gardens of the Dutch. On another occasion he
 exclaimed, “Vidi equidem, widi his oculis puerilibus olim, nec
 res fallit.”
     Aloe disticha is the only species which Linnaeus gave in
 the year 1764, which belongs to the genus Gasteria; but it
 must not be concealed, that he distinctly separates it into
 three marked varieties, two of which form two sections in the
 present Essay; and the third, by the best editor of the subse
 quent edition of the same work of Linnaeus of 1764, became
  Willdenow's genus Rhipidodendront                   -
     Prior to this aera, however, it should be stated that Boer
 haave (the greatest physician of the time, and of whom the wri
 ter's uncle, Dr.Hardy, was the last surviving pupil) had figured
  one species belonging to Gasteria, and described three others.
  And that Commeline and Tilli had figured two each; al
  though Munting in 1680, in his History of Aloes, the Aloi
  darium, had not given one.
     In the year 1789 the first edition of Aiton's Hortus Kewensis
  appeared, in three volumes octavo,     a work which for  itsaccu

racy has been called Classical in this country. It gave us still
but thirteen species of Aloe, and amongst these but four species
belonging to the present genus Gasteria; viz. verrucosa, cari
nata, maculata, and lingua; and did not make a single section
of the genus Aloe for them, nor even for the aforesaid genus
Bhipidodendron.
       Three years after this period, in 1792, (although                        I had long
                                     I

gives six species of the genus Gasteria”.
   In 1812, in the Synopsis Plantarum Succulentarum, I gave
twelve species of Gasteria and two varieties, dividing them
into two sections.
   In 1817, His Serene Highness the Prince de Salm Dyck
published, as the division of Aloe called Curviflora, in his
Catalog. Raison. nineteen species of Duval's genus Gasteria,
with many varieties; and very kindly presented to me a copy of
his work.     Some of the varieties and even species, however,
he afterwards relinquished in another work, which he also
presented to me; viz. Observationes Botanica in Horto Dykensi
notatae, published in 1821, in which he gives without any sec
tions   (etinter alia) twenty species     “Aloes Curviflora, Gas

        work unknown to the writer, and a name which,

        Kewensis, so well represented and figured in Patter
        son's Travels in Caffraria, in four separate tables, &c.
           It must be further observed, that our present plant
        (the Al. disticha & of Linn.) does not appear to be
        the Aloe linguiforme (meliùs linguiformis) of Miller, or
       A. lingua of Ait. Hort. Kew.—my own publications—or
       those of other English writers: nor do           even suppose         I

           Obs. This very singular plant was published as
        above, on its recent arrival from Africa, and its native
        leaves described; which have altered since amazingly:
        and to our extreme surprise the plant produced last
        autumn the strong tall flower-stem and bractea of a
        common Gasteria, and soon after evolved the proper
        flowers of one, with more coloured tips than usual |
        Wherefore,            its
                            first specific name being occupied,                        I

         of the very blunt leaved Gasteria denticulata (disticha,

         neatly spotted; and rough-edged                   their points,
         with one side thicker than the other, and rougher and
         blunter tubercled there than elsewhere; indicating,

every attention—an observation after sun-set was for at least
nine months in twelve incompatible with health, and one at
noon or a few hours later would necessarily have been so
often interrupted, that it would have been an incumbrance
rather than otherwise.            During many of our heavy rains it
(the hygrometer) has shown several degrees of dryness, but
this has invariably occurred with the wind at N. or N.W.; at
S. or S.W. it has seldom reached a degree before deposition
has taken place; and this apparent discrepancy                             think,                   is,

LIX.      Description of the Skulls of two apparently undescribed

animals, the species were enveloped in such complete con
fusion that it was impossible to distinguish one from another;
and    all
        these authors have proved that the best characters are
to be drawn from the examination of the skull.
   Having recently      occasionan                    to

perhaps the other) having been collected from quite                  different             a

resemble, have been induced

to offer some external characters which will distinguish it from
the White Beluga of the North Seas, to which the skull is so
nearly allied. It may perhaps be one of the species recently
described by Quoy and Gaimard, as they saw them floating in
the water.

their dissimilarity is obvious.
    Under the head of Attraction we look in vain in Dr. Fyfe's work
for any account of the doctrine of definite proportions or atomic
theory. It is singular that so great an omission should have been
committed by Dr. Fyfe, knowing as he must the very important
changes which this doctrine has effected in the science of which he
was treating : for not only has it reduced the facts which were known
previously to                 its
                       existence,      order and regularity, but has given

 of water. Here       the oxigen of the water unites with the zinc, and
 the  hydrogen   is set free ; the oxid then combines with the sulphuric
 acid, to form the sulphate.     The hydrogen obtained by this process,
 is much purer than that got by iron. It has less unpleasant odour,
 and it is of less specific gravity.   By evaporating the solution in the
 retort, crystals are obtained.     This is the mode by which the purest
  white vitriol is prepared; but that of commerce is generally procured
  by a process similar to that by which green and blue vitriol are formed,
 by exposing the ore of zinc and sulphur to air and moisture, by
  which both combine with oxigen to form sulphuric acid and oxid,
 which unite, and form the sulphate.”
     In the first place the hydrogen is not quite pure, for it is not
 free from smell; and at p. 108. Dr. Fyfe allows that the smell of hy

I have   also stated, that the disinfecting solution may be evaporated
to dryness and retain bleaching power. He observes, that “notwith
standing the perfect manner in which the chlorine may be separated.
by crystallization and slow evaporation, yet it is certain that by quick
evaporation a substance apparently quite dry may be obtained which
i.   possesses strong bleaching power.”        He considers that the car
  onate of soda acts as a more simple substance with the chlorine :
when, however, excess of chlorine is passed into a solution of car
bonate of soda, carbonic acid is evolved, and muriate and chlorate
of soda are formed, in the same manner as when caustic soda is em
ployed. With respect to Dr. Granville's opinion, Mr. Faraday con

after adding a few drops of sulphuric acid, the mixture is to be
boiled.
    If the fluid contains a nitrate, the blue colour will be discharged,
or only rendered yellow if the quantity of nitrate is very minute. Dr.
Liebig states that by this process nitric acid may be detected when
there is not more than a four-hundredth of it present; by adding a
little common salt to the fluid before applying the heat, even a five
hundredth of nitric acid may be readily detected.—Ann. de Chimie,

             SEPARATION OF SELENIUM FROM SULPHUR,
    According to Berzelius these substances may be readily separated
 by the following process.      When sulphuret of selenium is fused with
 carbonate of potash, the alkali not being in excess, the fused mass
 dissolved in water, leaves selenium undissolved and free from sul
 phur.     Some of the sulphuret of selenium from Lukawitz in Bohemia
 was dissolved in potash, and the solution was converted into hypo
 sulphite by exposure to the air at the temperature of 65°Fahr., f                                                 14.

   M. Colladou has also ascertained by means of an instrument which
he invented; first, That the alteration of temperature is not exactly
proportional to the change of volume which gases suffer: secondly,That
when the volume of the gas is inconsiderable, the increase of tem
perature indicates the diminution of volume: thirdly, That a dilated

  M. Unverdorben                     finds that when manganesate                 of potash is distilled
with a little anhydrous sulphuric acid, that manganesic acid is evolved
in the form of a red transparent gas, which dissolves in water, form
ing a red solution. The gas frequently decomposes spontaneously
in the retort, with explosion, producing oxide of manganese and
oxygen.
   Manganesate of potash was analysed by distilling it with excess of
sulphuric acid, collecting the oxygen disengaged, and estimating the
proportion of protoxide of manganese and salts of potash remaining
in the retort. According to these experiments the acid consists of

      DRACINE,-A NEW SUBSTANCE FounD IN DRAGON’s-BLOOD.
     M. Melandri finds that the colouring matter of Dragon's-blood is
  soluble in alcohol and oil, and also in hot water, but in small pro
  portion: the aqueous solution is bitter, astringent, and of a fine
  purple colour ; by cooling, it becomes opake and red. By the tests
  of gelatine and sulphate of iron, it does not appear to contain either
  tannin or gallic acid.
     A portion of dragon's-blood was dissolved in strong alcohol, the
  solution was evaporated till it was much concentrated, and then
  poured into cold water, but in which a spongy mass was precipitated;
  this after being washed with cold water was saturated with water con
 taining rºw of sulphuric acid, and at about 61° of Fahr. chemical
  action appeared to occur. The sediment, being well washed with
 water, was of a fine red colour, varying according to the state of
  aggregation ; it was tasteless and inodorous, flexible, and became
 fluid at 131°Fahr. This substance, called by the discoverer Dracine,
 has some analogy with the vegeto-alkalis, although                    affinity for                     its
 acids       but

LXV.      On the Dispersion      of Light.     By M. RUDBERG, of

INexplanation
       investigating the principle, according to which, for the
                    of the dispersion of light on the system of un
dulations, we must suppose that when the light passes from
the air into a more refractive medium, the lengths of the
undulations are much contracted, in fact much shorter,-I have
found that the following relation appears to exist between the
length of the undulation of a certain colour in the air, and the
corresponding one in any other substance:
                              L=   a. l ";
l  being the length of the undulation in the air, and L that in
another substance; and lastly, a, m two numbers which vary
only with the nature of the substance.
    I have taken the lengths of the undulations in the air as de
termined by M. Fraunhofer, (Gilbert's Annals, 1823, p. 337)
viz.         In the red,      C = 0.00002422 of an inch.
                     orange, D = 0.00002175

                     violet, H = 0-00001464
    The lengths of the undulations in other substances being
always in the inverse ratio of the indices of refraction, I have
 inserted them in the first column of each of the following tables,
 according to the indices of refraction which M. Fraunhofer
 has published, in his Memoir on the determination of refrin
 gent and dispersive power (Schumacher's Astronomische

      Although the differences between the calculated and the
observed lengths are very small, they are not without influence
when we wish to pass from the lengths of undulation to the
indices of refraction. But the lengths of undulation in the air
not being themselves certainly accurate to a thousandth, and
the indices of refraction having a precision at least ten times
greater,     I
            have taken the relation between the indices such as
it is derived from the supposed ratio to the lengths of undula
tion, and have then compared it with observation.       Calling
the index of refraction N, we have:

         Gentlemen,
      object of this little invention was to construct an in
THE
  strument by which the quantity of rain might be regis
tered for a long period, and observed at any shorter intervals,
without any manipulation which might require the attention
of a person skilful in such matters.
    Iwished to place rain-gauges at different stations where
machinery worked by water-power was employed, that might                                 I
compare the effect of various states of the weather upon the
efficiency of the engines; and I was desirous of having an                                          in
strument, of which a common observer could give a correct
report, and which would perform correctly, without any ma
nagement or interference, for a considerable length of time, and
which would thus of itself check the reports which might be
made at intervals. Others may find uses for such a contri
vance; and therefore as it seems to answer           purpose very       its
well,   I send you     description  a       you deem of   worthy

 hands, which indicate the quantity that has passed through

    The whole is inclosed in a japanned tin case, of which the

 into a smaller funnel and pipe, which conducts it to a water

wheel A, having three buckets.               One of these buckets is al
ways detained in a position to receive the flow of water by the
bent lever and weight B, which presses against two of the
three pins c c c,          keeps the wheel still, until a quantity of
 water has entered the bucket sufficient to raise the weight,
when it instantly escapes; and the next bucket is presented in
the same position, to receive another charge, being detained
 by the next pin coming in contact with the lever. A slight
 spring d is attached, which takes the pin as it rises to retard
 the velocity of the wheel, and to prevent                   overshooting           its                           its
 proper position. For the same reason the lever                       slightly                       is
 notched where the pins rub against                   their passage.
                                                                   it    in

they exist in chemical combination?         am inclined to think I
that these crystals are not fluo-iodic acid, and I am convinced
that they contain no ammonia; for on pouring sulphuric acid
into the solution (A) boiling in a platina crucible, I observed
a yellowish gaseous substance arise, which condensed in the
form of a yellow crust on the sides of a glass receiver: havin
dissolved this crust in water and evaporated the solution, §
obtained yellow crystals perfectly similar to those already de
scribed.

more imperfect; but being on a journey, am unable to pursue      I

esteem my attempts not altogether useless, you will greatly
oblige me by giving them a place in your Journal; for it seems
to me no abuse of the attention of chemists to direct it to new

chromate of silver was of a deep red colour, and when dried
weighed 0-6 grain.

  To  the solution which passed through, nitrate of barytes                                          .
was added, sulphate of barytes precipitated, which when heated
weighed 54.09 grains.
        14-75 : 5. :: 54-09 : 18.33 = sulphuric acid.
  The solution was now evaporated to one half, and sulphate
and muriate of soda added so as to separate the excess of
barytes and silver in solution: the precipitate was separated,
and carbonate of soda added to the solution which passed
through: carbonate of zinc fell down, which when dried weighed
14.45 grains; 14.2 grains when heated   -  to redness were re
duced to 9-7 grains:
               14:2: 9-7 :: 14:45            :   9'87 = oxide of zinc.
50 grains of the crystals were heated in a small platina cruci
ble over a spirit-lamp, and found to lose 12.6 grains. This
was water.   By this heat the chromic acid cannot be decom
posed; but on exposing the dry salt to a strong red heat, an
additional loss of 0-1 grain was sustained; and on digesting
the dry mass in water, an insoluble precipitate remained of
oxide of chrome.     To the clear solution 51.5 grains of pure
carbonate of potash  were added; the carbonate of zinc was se
parated, and the solution evaporated to dryness: sulphuric
acid was then added to decompose      the carbonate       all

solution which passed through had a deep red colour, and on
cooling deposited crystals of a fine grass-green colour in the
form of oblique rhombic prisms, with the acute angles trun

on analysis it proved to be very similarly composed, for b

  A similar salt  may be obtained  by  mixing   chromate of pot
ash and sulphate of copper.   It is of a light green colour, and
has precisely the same form as the salts already described. In
every instance after the first crop of crystals had been re
moved, and the solution further evaporated, bichromate was
formed.
   The crystalline form of                    all   these salts appeared           to   be   the

  430              Mr. R. Phillips  on  Nitric Acid
  pare nitric acid of the greatest strength,     I  mixed in a retort
  70 parts of nitrate of potash with an equal weight of sulphuric
  acid of sp. gr. 18442 at 60°. The heat was continued for
  eight hours; during the latter four of which, the contents of
  the retort were in complete fusion, and in the quarter of an
  hour previous to discontinuing the operation, only one drop
  of nitric acid was obtained.
     The nitric acid procured was of a yellow colour, with a tint
  of red; it weighed 46.13 parts, and the salt remaining in the
  retort amounted to 92.87 parts, showing that one part only
  of the 140 of nitre and sulphuric acid employed was lost du
  ºf    the operation.
                                                             I
     The sp. gr. of the nitric acid at 60° was 1:5033, and found
 by one experiment that 615-4 grains of it decomposed 456-8
 of carbonate of lime; and by another 586-8 decomposed 435-6
 of the same substance. These results agree almost precisely,
 and show, that 46:13 parts, the whole quantity of acid produced
 from 70 of nitre, would dissolve 34-24 parts of carbonate of
 lime. An atom of nitre being represented by 102, the atom
 of acid 54, which it contains, is equivalent to 50 or one atom
 of carbonate of lime; the acid contained in 70 of nitre should
 therefore dissolve 34-31 of this substance, from which, if we
 deduct 34:24, the solvent power of the acid actually obtained,
 there will be a deficiency of only 00:07 of a part,-a loss which,
 considering the nature of the operation, will be considered as
 very small. As 50 of carbonate of lime are equivalent to 54
 real nitric acid, 34-24 the quantity dissolved by 46:13 of the
 liquid acid, indicate 36-98 of real acid, the product therefore
 consists of                                                        -

                                                                    :

    I have   mentioned   that the bisulphate of potash remaining
in the retort    weighed   92.87 parts: now 102 or one atom of
nitre   decomposed    by   two atoms of sulphuric acid 80, would
yield 128 one atom of anhydrous bisulphate of potash, or
if  combined with 9, one atom of water, it would be 137; as
then 102: 137:: 70:94—exceeding the quantity I obtained
-
                                                                  by

                      and a peculiar Sulphate of Potash.                                               431
by only 1:13 part. We may then regard the various products
of the operation as follows:
          2 atoms of nitric acid, combined with
          3 atoms of water, and
          2 atoms of bisulphate of potash, containing
             2 atoms         of water.
Supposing, however, two atoms of nitre to be decomposed by
four atoms of sulphuric acid, the above products appear to con
tain one atom too much water; for the strongest sulphuric
acid consists, as is well known, of an atom of acid and one of
water.   It will, however, be observed, that I made use of sul
phuric acid of         sp.
                    gr. 1-8442; and this, according     Dr. Ure's                           to
table, with which my experiments nearly agree, consists                                                     of
nearly 79.1 acid, and 20.9 water. Now         compound       four   a                            of

consist very nearly     78.1 acid, and 21.9 water, differing only
                             of
one per cent from the composition                          of
                                        the acid which used,                                I               as
inferred from Dr. Ure's table: this circumstance will of course
account for the presence                of

It ascends obliquely on the west, to that part of the ridge of
the mountain called the Saddle, 2655 feet high, which is over
spread with columns similar to those just mentioned, except
that they are mostly lying prostrate: it also forms the basin in
which the Goat's Pool at the bottom of the crater is contained.
   On the northern side of the pool is a kind of mound con
sisting of a rock composed of chlorite, calcareous spar, quartz
and glassy felspar.   The calcareous spar is white, or of a dull
purplish colour. There are several of these beds; of which
the upper is a kind of conglomerate imbedding roundish masses.
of the same kind of rock, but harder, and with a smaller pro
portion of calcareous spar, and large angular pieces of slate.
 Below this is a bed harder and more compact than the former,
and arranged in irregular columns like starch. This rests upon
 a more slaty rock of the same kind.        .
    All these beds decompose by exposure to weather through
the decay of the calcareous spar, showing the greater part of
the mass to consist of this ingredient: some of the decomposed
pieces are very light and spongy, and                          I
                                               presume are the sub
stance which by some persons has been described as cellular
lava. The relation of these beds to the columnar porphyry
which precedes them                I
                             have not been able satisfactorily to
make out in this     place;  but upon the whole am inclined to           I
think that they rest upon the porphyry, as this latter rock makes
 its appearance      on

436            Mr. A. Aikin's     Notes on the Geological
lumns.    Between every two steps of porphyry lies a bed or
step of green calcareous rock disposed in rude irregular co
lumns; and, still lower down, is the same calcareous rock in
coarsely slaty beds, resting on hummocks of soft and not very
crystalline greenstone, and interstratified with common and
  indurated slate. The beds rise N.W. at an angle of about 85°.
      The point or projection of the mountain next to the west of
  Twrr mawr is called Mynydd Coeswyn, and presents appear
  ances very similar to those described.      The top is slate, rest
  ing on a very hard compact porphyritic greenstone in thick
  curved tabular masses, which are rudely subdivided into rhom
  boidal columns, the convex side of the curve being outwards.
  At the foot of the porphyry are beds of common blue slate
  rising W. by N.; then comes the green calcareous rock, im
  bedding angular pieces of slate; then nearly vertical beds of
  a heavy black slate; then imperfectly slaty grey schist; then
  beds of the green calcareous rock in which the general slaty
  structure may be seen at a little distance, but also passing into
  the large lenticular and obscurely columnar structure. These
  latter beds rest immediately on columnar greenstone; which
  at the plane of junction, but no where else, incloses or has                    in
  volved masses of the calcareous rock, so cellular as to appear
  like large sponges.
      A very remarkable mountain (the name of which could               I
  not discover, and which I therefore for distinction’s sake call the
   Stony Mountain) extends for about two miles parallel to Cader
   Idris, forming the northern boundary of the little valley in
   which the Goat's Pool and another small lake are situated.
  The height of it is about 1700 feet, and it is distinguished from
  most others in   its neighbourhood         by
                                           several characters.       On
  looking towards Cader Idris from Dolgelle, the white roundish

is   such, that only one peak     Cader Idris appears beyond and

phyritic slate, and this latter on imperfect amygdaloid, which
itself rests on the columnar basaltiform trap.
   On descending from Geygraig to Dolgelle by the edge of
the valley of the Aren, first occur craggy hummocks of massive
trap more or less columnar, surrounded by slaty trap in man
tle-shaped strata, and covered in different parts by beds of a
shining micaceous clay-slate.       Near Dolgelle the river flows
over beds    alternately   slaty and massive; the former are                                    di
stinctly steatitical, and will probably be considered as pot
stone; the latter differ from them in being harder and con
sisting of a larger proportion of quartz.     Sometimes they con
tain carbonate of    lime,  and then effervesce briskly for a short
time with acids.

   On tracing up the Dolgelle river, the Ynnion, for a few miles
towards Bala, no rock occurs in situ except massive crystalline

  found beds of the same kind of rock as appear at Dolgelle in
the bed of the Aren, some of which are sufficiently calcareous
to burn into a reddish-brown sandy lime, and which therefore
may perhaps be called limestone: it contains no organic re
mains. Beds very similar to these, and in                      probabilityall                   a

has been found, it is scarcely possible to ascertain how far they are
related to existing species.     Four kinds of teeth, some palates, scales,
fins, and vertebrae, are described by Mr. Mantell.
    These strata contain the remains of at least three very distinct kinds
of Chelonian reptiles; viz. a fresh-water species allied to the Triomyr;
an unknown species of Emys, resembling a fossil fresh water turtle
found in the Jura limestone; and a marine species of Chelonia, re
lated to the fossil turtle of Maestricht. These are well described and
figured in the work.
    “SAURIAN ANIMALs, or Lizards.         Of the family of the Saurians,”
observes Mr. Mantell, “the bones, teeth, and scales, of at least four
genera of gigantic species, have been discovered in the strata of Tilgate
Forest, namely, CRocodiLE, PLEsiosaurus, MEGALosAURUs, and
IGUANoDoN ; but hitherto no connected portions of their skeletons
have come under our observation.        The teeth, both in form and struc
ture, present such striking differences as to be readily distinguished
from each other, and from those of existing species; but the bones
possess so many characters in common, that when we consider the
broken and detached state in which they occur, and their intermixture
with the debris of turtles, of vegetables, of fishes, and of shells, the
difficulty of the attempt to identify the bones of the respective animals,
seems almost insurmountable to observers so distant from any collec
tion of comparative anatomy, as ourselves.         We therefore claim the
indulgence of the reader should the results of our investigations appear
to be in some respects inconclusive and unsatisfactory; since, under
such circumstances, rigorous conclusions must not be expected.         We
shall first describe the teeth, and such of the bones as are referrible,
with but little doubt, to one or other of the above-mentioned genera;
 and afterwards notice those osseous remains, which we are unable to
 appropriate with any degree of certainty or probability.”
    The Crocodilian remains in the Hastings strata consist of the teeth,
 scales, vertebrae, ribs, some bones of the extremities, and os frontis of
 a species first stated by Mr. Mantell to approach very nearly to the
 crocodile with concave vertebrae found at Havre, and since pronounced
 by Cuvier to be almost identical with the fossil crocodile of Caen,
 which belongs to the Gavials.
     Of the Megalosaurus Bucklandii, a gigantic animal, the remains of
 which were first discovered by Dr. Buckland in the Stonesfield-slate,
 the teeth, ribs, vertebrae, and other bones, have been found in the
 strata of Tilgate Forest.
    The remains of the Iguanodon, a gigantic herbivorous Saurian dis
 covered by Mr. Mantell himself, are described at some length, and
 portions of nine engravings devoted to the illustration of them.

  have hitherto been noticed, is in the immediate vicinity of Tilgate

parts of which mutually correspond, and concur to produce a certain
definite purpose by reciprocal re-action, or by combining towards the
same end,' it follows from the peculiar structure of the fossil teeth
alone, that the muscles which moved the jaws, and the bones to which
they were attached, were widely different from those of any of the
living lizards; and consequently the form of the head of the Iguano
don must have been modified by these causes, and have differed from
those of existing reptiles.       Since the vegetable remains with which
the teeth of the Iguanodon are associated consist principally of those
tribes of plants that are furnished with tough thick stems, and which
probably were the principal food of the original animal, we may be
permitted to remark, that this peculiar structure of the teeth seems to
have been required to enable the animal to accommodate itself to the
condition in which it was placed. Hereafter, perhaps, some more
fortunate observers may discover a portion of the head and jaw, and
be able to confirm or refute our conjectures.”
   Some bones, &c., supposed to be referrible to the Iguanodon, are
next described; and among them a horn, apparently belonging to
that animal.
   “We have now to request the reader's attention,” observes Mr.
Mantell, “to a very remarkable appendage, with which there is every
reason to believe the Iguanodon was provided. This is no less than a
horn, equal in size, and not very different in form, to the lesser horn

   Observations connected with M. de Gimbernat's communication.
 By John Murray, F.S.A. F.L.S. &c. &c.
    This paper relates to the extraordinary production discovered by
 M. Gimbernat in    the thermal waters in the island of Ischia; which,
when recently cut from the rock, resembled raw flesh; it soon putri
fied, evolving ammonia. Dr. Schoner, of Copenhagen, was of opinion
 that it might be allied to Oscillatoria thermalis.
    A letter was read from the President, appointing R. Brown, Esq.,
Vice-President, in place of the late venerable Dr. Goodenough Lord
 Bishop of Carlisle. . .
   A letter from General Hardwicke was read, On the trees found at
great depths in peat bogs in the county of Armagh.
    Sir W. Betham states that these bogs are full of fine timber, chiefly
oak and fir.    Some cones accompanied the letter, which were stated
by Mr. Lambert (from the chair) to be those of the Pinus sylvestris,
though the cones are smaller than usual, approaching to the size and
form of those of Pinus Pumilio.
   A letter from J. Creswell, Esq. F.L.S., stated that a fish weighing
one cwt. had been taken in the river Exe, unknown to the oldest
fishermen.    It is supposed to be the fish called Ombrina in the Me
diterranean; the Sciacna cirrhosa Linn., Umbrina of Cuvier.

   Cape Fairweather is near the southern extremity of a range of
coast, occupying between two and three degrees on the east of Pata
gonia; a great part of which is described in the Admiralty Chart, as
being “like the coast of Kent, and consisting of steep chalk hills;”
one of the prominences being named, from this supposed resemblance,
“Beachy Head.” This, however, from Capt. King's statement,
would appear to be erroneous:–the whole coast examined by
him, was found to be composed of horizontal strata of clay, which
may be traced for several miles in unbroken continuity; the cliffs
being from 300 to 400 feet in height, and entirely bare of vegetation.
Some of the specimens, however, from this quarter, consist of a white
marl, not unlike certain varieties of the lower chalk; and with these,
are portions of a greenish sand-rock, much resembling that of the
upper green-sand formation, and of a clay having many of the pro
perties of fuller's earth. The pebbles of the shore consist of quartz,
red jasper, hornstone, and flinty slate; but do not contain any stone
resembling chalk flint.       .

     The vicinity of Mount Tarn and Eagle Bay, about midway between
 ‘Port Famine and Cape Froward, affords also porphyritic and crystal
 line rocks, abounding in hornblende, or hyperstene; with grauwacke,
 siliceous slate, and gray splintery limestone.          The slate of Mount
 Tarn contains traces of organic remains.—The specimens from the
 south side of this eastern branch of the Strait consist of mica-slate
 approaching to gneiss, found at the entrance of St. Magdalen's Sound;
 and at Card Point on the south-west of St. Gabriel's Channel. The
 rocks at Cape Waterfall near Card Point, are of clay-slate; and the
 shores of Admiralty Sound afford granite and various porphyritic rocks;
 including clinkstone-porphyry, and greenish compact felspar. , Capt.
 King mentions his having observed also reddish quartzose-sandstone,
 resembling that of the old-red-sandstone formation of Europe: and he
 remarks, that the soil over this rock is barren, while that above the slate
produces luxuriant vegetation; beeches of great size growing there
 within a few feet of the water-side.      In general, the hills in this part
 of Terra del Fuego appear to be of slate: they rise to the height of
3000 feet, and are covered with snow and ice. Mount Sarmiento,
 however, which is more than 5000 feet high, appears, from the shape
of    its summit,           volcanic; and was called

 the sandstone is compact, micaceous and siliceous, and associated
 with a slaty rock. Near Ockham, and N.N.W., of Paington, the
 lowest beds lose their red colour, becoming more schistose; and
 these, as well as the grit and slate of Meedfoot Sands, seem to pass
 into grauwacke. The old red sandstone is extensively overlaid by
 unconformable beds of the new red conglomerate at Chelston near
  Cockington, and in other places.
    4. Grauwacke.—At Westerland, there is a schistose and micaceous
 variety of grauwacke, containingstems of encrimites, corals, and bivalve
 shells.                                  -
    5. Trap Rocks,—The connection of these rocks with the disturbed
 state of the stratified deposits, constitutes the chief interest of the
 tract described in this paper. A small headland, east of Babbacombe,
 consists of greemstone containing much iron pyrites, and traversed
 by veins of quartz, jasper, &c.; the contiguous limestones being
 semi-crystalline. On the west of the same place, another headland is
 composed of porphyritic greenstone, and occasionally amygdaloidal :
 —and here the trap is protruded upwards into the overlying argilla
 ceous slate of the carboniferous limestone; the adjacent beds of shale
 being broken, much contorted, and some portions of them even                in
 cluded in the mass of trap; whilst the limestone in the upper part of
 the cliff also is much dislocated.      In the inaccessible cliffs near Oddi
 combe    Sands,   the   trap has intruded itself among the limestone and
 shale, the beds of which are much altered in character, and so broken
 up near the summit, that they are with difficulty distinguished from
 each other.     The largest mass of trap on this part of the coast is at
 Black   Head;     it is remarkable as inclosing a large detached portion
of the contorted limestone.                                                     -
    Near to a   great   fault at Oddicombe    Sands,  the  argillaceous slate is
 elevated to the top of the cliff, and the adjoining new red conglome
rate also rises, as if forced up by the same movement which had
affected the slate.                                                  -           -
    The author conceives that the appearances of the coast which he
has described, point out two distinct geological epochs:—1st. That
of the formation of the new red conglomerate, after the limestone
and shale had been partially broken up. 2ndly. The intrusion of the
trap, at a period subsequent to the deposition of the conglomerate,
and new red sandstone.          And besides attributing the disturbed state
of this  region   to the   operation of trap, the author is disposed to refer
to the same period and agency, the great dislocations in the oolitic
series on the east of the tract which he has described ; , and to con
nect with the convulsion by which he supposes that disturbance to
have been produced, the greater catastrophe which elevated the
chalk of the Isle of Wight, and even, possibly, that which threw up
the main ridge of the Alps.                                                    :

 large portion of the turf having recently been removed, the surface of
 the rock is now seen to be scored with parallel lines, precisely similar
 to those observed in other places, and described by Sir J. Hall, Dr.
 Buckland, &c. And in this case, although the surface of the ground
 is very unequal, and the dip and bearings of the denuded strata vary
 considerably, the direction of the markings is uniformly from N.N.W.
 to E.S.E.
    3. Hebrides, and Mainland of the West Coast.—Pitchstone, a
 mineral not previously found in Scotland in association with the more
 recent stratified rocks, has been discovered by Professor Sedgwick
 and Mr. Murchison in two places; forming portions of trap dykes,
 one of which cuts through the lias and inferior oolite at Carsaig Mull;
 the other traverses the cornbrash and forest marble, at Beal near
 Portree in Skye. The identity of the various secondary strata in the
 Isles of Mull, Skye, Pabba, Scalpa, Rasay, &c., is now established by
 the numerous organic remains which they have been found to contain,
 many of which belong to new species, but the greater number are well
 known as characteristic fossils of the oolitic formations in England.
    The former vast, and perhaps continuous, extent of these deposits
 on the western coast, is further rendered probable, by their having
 been observed by Professor Sedgwick and the author, on the N.E.
 coast of Mull, at and near Tobermory; and at Applecross on the west
 coast of Ross-shire. In the latter place, lias-limestone, similar to that
 on the opposite shores of Skye and Rasay, rests conformably upon the
new red conglomerate ; and as the same fact had been previously
remarked on the east coast, near Cromarty, evidence is thus af
forded that the members of the oolitic series of Scotland, generally,
were of subsequent formation to that great mechanical deposit; being
                                                                                              to its

                 Fourteenth Annual Report of the Council.
     Pursuant to the resolution passed at the last annual meeting, the
 third volume of the Society's Transactions has been sent to the press;
 but the Council are sorry to report, that owing to various unavoidable
 delays, it is not yet completed; 300 pages, however, have been
 printed, and the Editors have pledged themselves that the volume
 shall be published during the present year.
    The Council have the satisfaction of again announcing the con
 tinued prosperity of this Institution; and of the Museum in particu
 lar: indeed so great has been the increase of minerals during the last
 three years, that a new arrangement of the Museum had become ne
 cessary; which has been performed by the Curator with his usual
 zeal and ability.
    Since the last anniversary, Sir Charles Lemon, Bart. has presented
 a numerous and valuable collection of organic remains from various
 parts of the countries bordering on the Mediterranean. These or
 ganic remains, together with those from the Malvern Hills, (presented
 by the same gentleman on a former occasion,) have been arranged in a
 new cabinet, in connection with those of the Paris Basin, of Sussex,
of the Isle of Wight, and other places; the whole forming a series
illustrative of this department of geology, in which the - Museum was
defective previous to these various donations.
    The thanks of the Society are also due to another of              members,        its
 Dr. Davy, for excellent specimens              rocks, lavas, and various vol
                                                  of
canic productions, which                    he
                                   himself collected last autumn,         Sicily,           in
the Lipari Islands, and the neighbourhood                Naples.   ofThese mi

                                         magnet, and the magnet round the
wire in two separate vessels, might be simplified by making the
wire and magnet to rotate round each other in one vessel, and the
plan    I adopted is as follows: ABCD is a glass vessel with a hole
in the bottom, through which passes the wire EF with a hook at
  Fig.   1.
E,   and a cup at F. To the hook E is affixed by means of a thread,
the magnet GE floating nearly perpendicular in mercury; HG is a
copper wire bent at H into the form of a hook, and amalgamated
at both ends to insure perfect contact with the mercury in the glass
vessel, and also with the hook H of the support HI which screws
into the mahogany stand KL. The apparatus being thus arranged,
a single zinc plate, six inches square, placed in a copper vessel with
 diluted nitrous acid, and a communication being made by means of
a wire between the negative or copper side of the battery and the
cup I, also another communication with the positive or zinc of
the battery with the cup F, the wire and magnet will immediately
commence a rotatory motion about each other, and that too in the
direction of the arrows represented in fig. 2, viz. the wire HG will
move in the direction of Y, and the magnet in the direction of Z.

    One of the most remarkable properties of the cyanuret of chlorine,
is that of crystallizing in long transparent needles at 0°Fahr. ; and
at about 20° or 25° above this it becomes liquid, or under a pressure
 of four atmospheres, and it remains so in tubes hermetically sealed.
   When bottles containing cyanuret of mercury, either moistened with
or dissolved in chlorine, are exposed to the sun's rays, no cyanuret of
chlorine is obtained; but instead, if a yellow oily fluid is formed,
which is denser than water, and which is probably a mixture of chlo
ride of azote and protochloride of carbon, it is readily converted by
heat into azote, carbonic acid, muriatic acid, and perchloride of carbon.
j
Without the assistance of heat the same effects are produced, but very
slowly; it yielded by analysis an atom of chlorine and one of cyanogen,
which is the same composition as that stated by M. Gay Lussac.—

                   EXAMINATION OF CINCHALONA.
   M.  Tilloy of Dijon states that in 1825 about 500 pounds of Kina
 Kalissaya were imported into France: it was fine in appearance, very
distinctly bitter, and by analysis yielded the same proportions of co
louring and fatty matter as in good bark of the same kind; but it
         no quina. M. Tilloy gives the following as a ready process
for  determining   whether bark contains quina. Take one ounce of
bark reduced to coarse powder, and put it into twelve ounces of                             al
cohol of sp. gr. 867, and heat to about 110° to 120° for an hour;
pour off the alcohol, repeat the digestion with fresh alcohol, mix the
liquors, and add acetate or subacetate of lead sufficient to precipitate
the colour of the kinic acid; set it by, filter, add to the liquid a few
drops of sulphuric acid to separate the lead of any acetate which may
have been used in excess; filter and distil: there remains sulphate
or acetate of quina. according to the quantity of sulphuric acid em
ployed, mixed with a fatty matter, which adheres to the vessel, pour
off the solution and add ammonia to            it,
                                          which immediately precipitates
the quina; but    if

    General Observations.—The first part of this month to the 8th was fine
and dry, and the latter part humid, wet, and windy. On the 8th, 9th, 10th,
and 28th, nearly 3% inches of rain fell here, when chronic rheumatism
and colds were prevalent complaints in this town and neighbourhood.                    A
northerly wind on the 13th lessened the temperature of the atmosphere
considerably, and made it a winter-like day; but a South-west wind with
rain on the following day increased it again, and it kept up warm till the                                                                   .
27th, afterwards it was cold to the close of the month, with hoar-frost in
 the mornings.
    On the evening of the 17th a faint appearance of an aurora borealis was
observed here; and one at Manchester on the evening of the 6th in the
 moon-light.                                                   -               -
    It is remarkable that in the morning of the 18th, linear, ramified, and
converging plumose cirri appeared beneath beds of cirrocumulus in round
flocks; and these modifications were beautifully tinged with prismatic co
lours, both within and two or three degrees without a solarshalo, whose
horizontal radii were respectively 223 degrees.             In the afternoon of the
 19th, a beautiful rainbow appeared from a quarter before five till five o'clock.
The diameter of the interior bow to the outside of the colours measured
          8° 5',
84°       and        the exterior, 101° 10', and their distance from each other
                             of
was       17'.    The colours

                                                      of
green, and faint blue, beneath which four narrow parallel bows appeared
of   a deep red, with collateral modifications           colours, which bows were           of
formed              by
               successive reflections from the interior bow.       The breadth       the                                              of
exterior bow was nearly two degrees, notwithstanding the nimbus,                  which                                          in

the order           those of   the exterior, which showed that the former was
formed              by
               reflection from the latter. The sun was               the horizon, and                            in
