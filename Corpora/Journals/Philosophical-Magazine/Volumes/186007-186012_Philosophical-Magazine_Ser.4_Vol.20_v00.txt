I.    On the Relation between the Radiating and Absorbing Powers
     of different Bodies for Light and Heat. By G. KIRCHHoFF+.
A BODY  same as
               placed within a covering whose temperature is the
                      own, its    unaffected  is                      by
                                                    radiation, and must
therefore absorb               as
                        many rays                   as
                                            emits. Hence it      has long                 it
been concluded    that,     the same temperature, the ratio between
                                      at
the radiating and absorbing powers                bodies    of    all
                                                             the same,            is
it being, however, assumed that bodies only emit rays                 one                          of
kind.    This law has been verified experimentally, especially                                              by
MM.        deProvostaye and Desains,

homogeneousness                 of
                         the emitted rays could           least             at                 be      so   far
assumed, inasmuch         they were as                all
                                          invisible. Whether the same
law holds good when bodies emit rays             different kinds (which,

found that the law       questioninextends      this case also, provided
                                                                 to

rays     understood, and that the absorbing power            estimated                   be

                             the same kind.     Taken     this way, the
with reference                                                                  all in

proof      this principle, and then develope certain remarkable
           of
     º
consequences that immediately follow therefrom, which partly
explain phaenomena already known, and partly suggest new ones.
    All bodies emit rays, the quality and intensity              which                        of
depend         on

is sufficiently charged with electricity, or when it is phospho
rescent or fluorescent.  Such cases are, however, here excluded.
   When a body encounters rays from without, it absorbs a por
tion of them and converts it into heat. But, besides this species
of absorption, there may, under certain circumstances, be others,
as, for example, when a body is phosphorescent     or fluorescent.
It    is,
       however, here assumed that    absorbed rays are converted    all
into heat.

From which it follows, either that fa is nothing for every value
of a, or that it is infinitely great when a vanishes.    But when a
vanishes, A becomes infinite.      Recollecting then the meaning of
fa, and recollecting also that p is a proper fraction, and that
neither e nor el can become infinite when A increases without
limit, the second alternative cannot be admitted, and therefore
for every value of A we must have
                            e=e'.
   §4.       If
            the pencil which proceeds from the black body C
through the openings 1 and 2 consisted partly of rays polarized
in a plane, the plane of polarization of the polarized portion must
rotate when the body itself rotates about the axis of the pencil.
Such a rotation must therefore affect the value of e. But since,
by the above equation, no such effect can be admitted, it follows
that no part of the pencil can be so polarized.        It can also be
shown that no   part of the pencil can be  circularly polarized.  We
shall not give the proof of this here. Without this it will be
admitted that black bodies can be imagined so constituted that
there is no more reason why they should emit rays circularly
polarized in one direction more than the other. All the black
bodies hereafter mentioned are supposed to be of this kind, viz.
that they emit no polarized rays whatever.
   § 5. The magnitude indicated by e depends, not only on the
temperature and length of the wave, but also on the form and
relative position of the openings 1 and 2.        Let wi and we be

first and third of these portions are correct when C is in such a
position that a finite portion of the pencil proceeding from 2
through opening 1, and incident on C, is by C reflected back

14 Prof. Kirchhoff                 on the          Relation         between      the     Radiating and
constant the function                        I
                             can have no strongly marked maxima
and minima for waves of different lengths. Hence it follows that
if the spectrum of a red-hot body presents discontinuities or
 strongly marked maxima or minima, the power of absorption of
that body, regarded as a function of the length of the waves, must
present similar discontinuities or strongly marked maxima and
minima.      Spectra with strongly marked maxima may be ob
tained by placing various salts in the flame of a Bunsen’s lamp.
Chloride of lithium affords interesting results in this respect. If
a bead of this salt be melted in a platinum ring and placed in the
mantle of the gas-flame, the spectrum of the flame (when
unaffected by the presence of other salts and not too brilliant) is
a single bright red line of light, formed of waves whose length is
about the arithmetic mean of the lengths of the waves corre
sponding to the lines B and C of Fraunhofer.        For waves of this
length the radiating power of the flame is very considerable,
while for waves of lengths corresponding to the other visible
colours it is imperceptible.   Accordingly, the power of absorption
of the lithium-flame must be great for waves of this length, but
very small for those constituting the other visible rays.        there                                       If,

moreover, in the case of salts which produce flames having such
maxima, it is the metal that determines the nature of the spectrum.
Imagine a body of very high temperature, in whose spectrum the
double line D does not appear, surrounded by a gaseous atmo
sphere of somewhat lower temperature.         sodium be present in         If
the latter, the spectrum   of the whole system  so constituted will
contain the double line D. From the occurrence of these lines, the
presence of sodium in the atmosphere may therefore be concluded.
Now the sun is undoubtedly a body of this description*; and
therefore,from the occurrence of the lines D in the solar spectrum,
 the presence of sodium in the sun’s atmosphere may be concluded.
    An objection may perhaps be urged against the justice of this
 conclusion. “The cause of the line D is,” it may be said, “to
 be sought for in the atmosphere of the earth.”     This objection
 may, however, be disposed of on the following grounds:–
    (1) The necessary quantity of sodium in the gaseous form
 can hardly be present in our atmosphere, and the gaseous form
is necessary to produce the effect in question.
    (2) If the line D depended on our atmosphere, it would
become more strongly marked when the sun approached the
horizon. I have, however, never observed any such change in
the distinctness of these lines, though in the case of some of the
neighbouring lines, such changes are very conspicuous.
    (3) If the line D were not caused by the physical constitu
tion of the sun itself, it would exist in the spectra of       the                                        all
fixed stars    sufficient brightness; but according

18 Prof. Kirchhoff on the Relation between the Radiating and
incident rays whose plane of polarization is parallel to the axis
of the plate, than of those whose plane of polarization is per
pendicular to that axis.                  If
                                      it be granted that the tourmaline
retains this property when red-hot, then rays emitted in a direc
tion perpendicular to               its
                                 surface must                         be

plane passing through the optic axis, and therefore perpen
dicular   to what       called the plane

line. I   have    experimentally     tested this    striking  deduction from
the law here demonstrated, and have confirmed                     truth.      Theits
tourmaline plates employed bore considerable heat   a                  Bunsen’s       in  a
lamp for some time without suffering any permanent alteration,
except that they appeared                      on

cloudy   at the edges.      They retained the property            transmitting   of
polarized light even when red-hot, though                    considerably less
                                                                           toa

                    alower temperature.         This appeared         observing           on
through    a  doubly-refracting prism,               red-hot platinum wire

so produced were             unequal intensity, though the difference
                              of
between them was much less than when observed through                        plate               a
of the  ordinary     temperature.       To the      doubly-refracting      prism
was then given that position                        in
                                              which the difference              the                 of

two equal red-hot bodies,            which the upper possessed

true of such a body; but it is true if the body is enclosed in a
black covering of the same temperature as itself, since the same
considerations that led to the equation in question on the hypo
thesis that the body C was not fluorescent, avail in this case even
if the body C be supposed to be fluorescent. To be convinced
of this, it is only necessary to consider that if the magnitude E
eould have two different values in the two arrangements of the
system represented in fig. 3, the difference of these values could
only be an infinitely small quantity.

   1. Since the appearance of the above paper in Poggendorff's
Annalen,   I have received information of a prior communication
closely related to mine. The communication in question is by
Mr. Balfour Stewart, and appeared in the Transactions of the
Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. xxii. 1858. Mr. Stewart has
made the interesting observation that a plate of rock-salt is
much less diathermic for rays emitted by a mass of the same
substance heated to 100° C., than for rays emitted by any other
black body of the same temperature. From this circumstance
he draws certain conclusions, and is led to a result similar to
that which     I
               have established concerning the connexion between
the powers of absorption and emission. The principle enun
ciated by Mr. Stewart                  is,
                             however, less distinctly expressed, less
general, and not altogether       strictly proved

20    On the Radiating and Absorbing Powers of different Bodies.
ject by M. Foucault to the Soc. Philom. in 1849 is reproduced
 by M. Werdet, from the Journal de l’Institut, in the April Num
ber of the Ann. de Chim. et de Phys.
    M. Foucault’s observation appears to be regarded as essentially
                                                            I
 the same as mine; and for this reason take the liberty of draw
 ing attention to the difference between the two. The observa
 tion of M. Foucault relates to the electric arch between charcoal
 points, a phaenomenon attended by circumstances which are in
 many respects extremely enigmatical. My observation relates
 to ordinary flames into which vapours of certain chemical sub
 stances have been introduced.     By the aid of my observation,
 the other  may be accounted for on the ground of the presence of
 sodium in the charcoal, and indeed might even have been fore
  seen.  M. Foucault's observation does not afford any explana
 tion of mine, and could not have led to         anticipation. My    its
observation leads necessarily    the law which  to
                                                have announced            I

22         Prof. Maxwell on   the Process     of Diffusion of two or
sist of this definite motion of agitation, combined with the general
motion of translation.
    When two gases are in communication, streams of the two
gases might run freely in opposite directions, if it were not for
the collisions which take place between the particles. The rate
at which they actually interpenetrate each other must be investi
gated.    The diffusion is due partly to the spreading of the par
ticles by the molecular agitation, and partly to the actual motion
of the two opposite currents in mass, produced by the pressure
behind, and resisted by the collisions of the opposite stream.
When the densities are equal, the diffusions due to these two

&c. are functions of x, to find the quantity of matter transferred
across the plane of yz, due to the motion of agitation alone.
     Ifthe number of particles, their velocity, or their length of
path is greater on one side of this plane than on the other, then
more particles will cross the plane in one direction than in the
other; and there will be a transference of matter across the
plane, the amount of which may be calculated.
    Let there be taken a stratum whose thick
ness is da, and area unity, at a distance a from
the origin.    The number of collisions taking
place in this stratum    in unit of time will be                                           dºc

   Prop. XX. To find the rate of diffusion between two vessels
connected by a tube.
   When diffusion takes place through a large opening, such as
a tube connecting two vessels, the question is simplified by the
absence of the porous diffusion plug; and since the pressure is
constant throughout the apparatus, the volumes of the two gases
passing opposite ways through the tube at the same time must
be equal.   Now the quantity of gas which passes through the
tube is due partly to the motion of agitation as in Prop. XIV.,
and partly to the mean motion of translation as in Prop. XV.
   Let us suppose the
volumes of the two ves
sels to be a and b, and
the length of the tube
between them c, and its
transverse sections. Let

gas, and bwith the second

     Since the capacity of the tube is small compared                                           with that of
the vessels, we may consider                        #      constant through the whole
length of the tube. We may then solve the differential equation
in p and a ; and then making p-pi when a =0, and p-p',
when we c, and substituting for pi and p' their values in terms
of y, we shall have a differential equation in y and t, which being
solved, will give the amount of gas diffused in a given time.
   The solution of these equations would be difficult unless we
assume relations among the quantities A, B, C, D, which are
not yet sufficiently established in the case of gases of different
density.   Let us suppose that in a particular case the two gases
have the same density, and that the four quantities A, B, C, D
are    all   equal.

           When two perfectly smooth spheres strike each other, the
      force which acts between them always passes through their                                             cen
      tres of gravity; and therefore their motions of rotation, if they
      have any, are not affected by the collision, and do not enter into
      our calculations.   But, when the bodies are not spherical, the
      force of compact will not, in general, be in the line joining
      their centres of gravity; and therefore the force of impact will
      depend both on the motion of the centres and the motions of
...   rotation before impact, and    will affect both these motions after

 38                The Rev. S. Earnshaw on the Velocity
    In the spring of 1851, when I was living in the small village
 of Conisborough about five miles from Doncaster, there occurred,
 one Sunday evening about 5 o'clock, a thunder-storm which lasted
 about half an hour.        It was not different from other thunder
 storms, except that it was terminated by a flash of lightning of
 great vividness, which was instantly (i.e. without any appreciable
 interval between) followed by an awful crash, that seemed as if
 by atmospheric concussion alone it would crush the cottages to
 ruins.                                                         I
           Every one in the village, as found afterwards, had felt
 at the moment of the crash, as                        I
                                        felt myself, that the electric
 fluid had   certainly  fallen somewhere in the village. Indeed it
 seemed   impossible   for any one to think otherwise than that his
 meighbour's cottage had been struck, and his own had had a
 narrow escape. But, to the surprise of everybody, it turned out
 that no damage had been done in the village, but that that flash
 of lightning had killed three sheep, knocked down a cow, and
 injured the milkmaid who happened to be milking the cow, at a
 distance of more than a mile from the village.          I was at that
 time under a physician’s orders not to think about anything,
 but I remember thinking that it was very singular the lightning
should fall at such a distance, when I should have expected                                                  it,
from the received theory       sound,    offall    the village. Professor

Montigny’s memoir records similar, and yet more striking
instances, which have come           his knowledge

report reached him           seconds, though according

point struck       by
                   the electric fluid being nearly equidistant from
one another. Other cases, less striking perhaps, but quite
agreeing with this, are recorded        the memoir; and after reading
                                                      in
them and    remembering     my own   experience,     cannot but consider I

                                                      I          will soon                    it
is be
    established    as   a   law       ofnature, that the sound    thunder-clap      of   a
    propagated         with   far      greater rapidity than ordinary sounds.
We shall presently            see     what light theory throws upon this point.

                                  of the Sound of Thunder.                                                           39
article by the assumption of the musical type of the sound-wave.
The result shows that all audible musical sounds are transmitted
with the same velocity:     and, as the equation of motion in art. 3
is linear, it follows that every sound which can be considered as
a combination of musical sounds, will be transmitted with the
same velocity: and as in general any ordinary function of t can
be expanded in the form A'cos        t-Ha')      cos(k" t-Ha") +....,
                                                        (k'               +   A"
it follows that            all
                     ordinary sounds are made         musical sounds             up    of
and transmitted with the same velocity.

Hence it is probable that there is no sound which is propagated
faster than a thunder-clap, the genesis of which by the electric
discharge being extremely violent and almost instantaneous, and
accompanied by a large development of heat.
    If the theory here advanced be true, the report of fire-arms
should travel faster than the human voice; and the crash of
thunder faster than the report of a cannon.

   It will be admitted, think, that the expression for the

velocity in equation (8) is capable of furnishing any required
amount of velocity. The difficulty of putting it to the test of expe
riment lies in our utter inability to say, in              proposed case, what
is the value of a. All that it seems              possible  to do is to observe
v, and thence calculate a by the equation referred to ; and then
to judge, by the comparison of different observations, whether
the calculated values of         a-a-'     seem to agree with the observed-
violence of the electric discharges.

It melts in boiling water to a thick oil, which is insoluble in
water, and may thus be freed from succinic acid.    It is dissolved
by boiling alcohol, from which it separates, on cooling, in small
crystals. It decomposes by distillation.    Analysis gave for it

cinateof glycol, and is the first well-defined example in which a
diatomic radical is substituted for the two atoms of replaceable
hydrogen of a diatomic compound.
   Bauer has obtained * oxide of amylene, the compound cor
responding to Wurtz's oxide of ethylene t. The preparation of
this body is very troublesome, owing to the difficulty of pre
paring bromide of amylene, and, therefrom, amylglycol.            To
prepare bromide of amylene, amylene is placed in a long-necked
globe, surrounded by a freezing mixture, and a calculated
quantity of bromine gradually added. When the action is com
plete, the liquid is shaken with dilute potash, then washed with
water, dried, and allowed to stand over chloride of calcium. It
boils at 170° to 175°, but decomposes at that temperature.       For
the preparation of amylglycol, it is sufficient to keep it at 160°
for some time. Bauer observed that this liquid contained some
hydride of amyle, C*H*, and some brominated amylene, C*H*Br,
but both these pass off almost entirely below 100°.
   Bauer found, as has been observed by the writer of these
notices, that acetate of potass cannot be used advantageously in
the preparation of amylglycol.       The action of bromide of
amylene on acetate of silver is slow, but complete. It is effected
by making acetate of silver into a paste with glacial acetic acid,
gradually adding the bromide of amylene, and after the first
action is over, heating the whole to 100° for a few days.       It is
then  distilled, the portion above 140° being  collected separately.
When this is treated with potash and distilled, amylglycol is
obtained.
   When hydrochloric acid gas is passed into amylglycol, the
liquid becomes               and the further action of the gas
                          coloured,
converts it into a black viscous mass, which decomposes on di
stillation. Aqueous hydrochloric acid acts with great energy on
amylglycol at ordinary temperatures, forming several chlori
mated compounds,     among which is hydrochloric amylglycol,

        M. Kolbe   on the Constitution    of Organic Compounds.      45
    Oxide of ethylene was prepared by Wurtz by the action of
potash on hydrochloric glycol ; for the preparation of oxide of
amylene, Bauer treated amylglycol with diluted hydrochloric
acid, and then mixed the crude product thus obtained, which
consisted mainly of hydrochloric amylglycol, with potash, and
distilled the mixture. The distillate consisted of water with a
layer of an oily liquid. This was removed, dried, and repeatedly
rectified.   It boiled at 95°, but could not be freed from traces of
a chlorinated compound.         The analyses and determination of
the vapour density left no doubt that it was oxide of amylene,
Gº H109, corresponding to oxide of ethylene, C*H* 9.                 Its
formation may be thus expressed:—
        2 (C5H1   Cle) + K*0–2 KCl +2 C3H100+                H* 9.
          Hydrochloric           Chloride of    Oxide of
           amylglycol.           potassium.     amylene.
    Oxide of amylene boils at about 95°, and has the spec. grav.
0.8244; it burns steadily with a yellow flame. It has an agree
able etherial odour, and a bitter taste.       It is insoluble in water,
but dissolves in    alcohol, in ether,   in  amylglycol,   and in acids.
 Heated with acetic acid, it is converted into acetate of amyl
glycol.
    In  a series of recent communications, Kolbe has developed
certain views of the constitution of several of the principal series
of organic compounds. These views are supported by a wide
variety of illustrations from organic chemistry; and several         in
teresting investigations have been undertaken by Kolbe and his
pupils in order to test their validity. Without going too much
into detail it is impossible to give the grounds on which these
views are based; but the investigations to which they have given
rise will probably be intelligible from the following statement.
    Organic compounds he considers to be derived from inorganic
compounds, and usually resulting from them by simple processes
of substitution.      Carbonic acid plays the most important part
among those inorganic compounds which serve as starting points
for organic bodies.      Liebig had already pointed out (in 1847)
that many important compounds, alcohol, sugar, formic acid,
 stood in close relation to carbonic acid, and were derivable from
it by the substitution of hydrogen for oxygen. It must be con
sidered certain that starch, sugar, gum, the vegetable acids, &c.,
which are found in plants where the decomposition of carbonic
acid takes place, are formed, at any rate indirectly, from this
carbonic acid. This idea of the connexion between these bodies
and carbonic acid is rendered antecedently probable by the
relations of these formulae, and by their mode of occurrence;
 and it has been made more probable since it has been found

   Kolbe extends these views to explain the constitution of some
bibasic acids which stand in close relation to those of the acetic
acid series.     He derives these acids from the compound group,
a double atom     of carbonic acid, 3. 3.         O4.     When two of the
extra-radical atoms of oxygen are replaced by a diatomic radical
(for example, ethylene and homologous or corresponding carbo
hydrogens), we obtain acids of the succinic series, and the analo
gous acids, pthalic acid, &c. Thus:

   Now, malic and tartaric acids differ from succinic acid by con

   Dessaignes, in a letter* to the Secretary of the Académie des
Sciences, announces that he has effected the transformation of
tartaric acid into succinic acid by treating the former acid with
iodide of phosphorus.     Dessaignes’ view of the relations of these
acids does not differ from those of Kolbe.    The paper in whicht
the latter chemist developed his views, and in which he announced
that Schmidt was occupied with the above experiments, appears
to have been unknown to Dessaignes.
   These experiments of Schmidt and of Dessaignes acquire an
additional interest at the present time, when Perkins and Duppat,
by an experiment the reverse of that of Schmidt, have converted
succinic acid into tartaric acid. This has been done by means
of bibromosuccinic acid. When the silver salt of this acid is
boiled with water, it decomposes, forming bromide of silver and
tartaric acid. Thus:
          C*H*Brº Agº Os--4HO=C8H8O124-2Ag Br.

     The reaction is thus exactly analogous to that by which chlor
acetic acid is converted into glycolic acid.

your readers should know that the measurement of actinism by

imagines. By reference to my old sketch alluded         you will                                                    to,

   We now come to the paper actinometer, which offers the very
great advantage that the sensitive substance and the registering
material are one and the same.      Nothing, in fact, can well be
simpler than the apparatus. The sensitive paper, ruled with lines
to correspond with the seconds and minutes and hours, hours,
days, and weeks, weeks and months, or whatever other intervals
are to be observed, is made by clockwork to pass (either firmly
fixed and revolving on one roller of large diameter, or otherwise)
behind a hole or slit which admits the light, the intensity of
which will be of course registered by the differing degree to
 which the different parts of the paper are affected by it”.
    The main difficulties attending this system of actinometry are,
 1st, the difficultyof securing uniform sensitiveness in the same, and
still more in different samples of paper, even when similarly sen
sitized; 2nd, corresponding uncertainties in development, where
development-processes        are used; 3rd, the difficulty of keeping
paper unaltered in                   its
                             sensitive condition, and this both before
and after the solarization (as we may wish                  develope several         to

may be generally observed that, using the ordinary style of papers,
the best plan, where the paper is intended for a long observation,
is not to use development, and not to make it too highly sensi
tive, also to sensitize it as if it were a very weak paper for the
ordinary positive printing. Where, however, it is intended for
registry of seconds or minutes, we must use a more highly sen
sitive printing-paper, or have recourse to an after-development of
 it; and it is here also, when we wish to have sets of successive
 observations made from slips cut from one sensitive sheet (to en
 sure uniform value of colour), that our difficulty is felt.
    Suppose we have two, three, or four slips, each one repre
 senting, say, a different hour with the variations during it”.
 Here there may be no very great difficulty in one way, as sup
 posing the hours successive, there is hardly time for the paper to
go far wrong; but suppose they are successive days instead, we
 see the relative value of the periods on each day, but are at a
 loss to estimate their value compared with another day. The
 simplest plan which suggests itself is to check the value of the
 hour observations by day observations, of the day observations by
 week observations, and so on, the observations of the longer
 periods being made, as they conveniently can be, on much weaker
 and consequently much better-keeping paper; and these dif
  ferent sets of observations will enable us to eliminate not
  only errors produced by the sensitive paper going wrong by
  keeping, but original differences in the quality of the papers
  before sensitizing, as well as in the chemicals, and, what with all
  care is most difficult to avoid, in the manipulation and in the
weather.

in fixing), with            all  care and study     time, and keeping the liquid

Arithmetic in Theory and Practice for advanced Pupils. Part the
   First. By J. BRook SMITH, M.A. London: Macmillan and
   Co. 1860.
     LTHOUGH Mr. Smith's arithmetic can scarcely be said to meet
       any urgent demand, inasmuch as we already possess several ex
cellent works of the same kind, it deserves to take its place amongst the
small number of sound educational works. The first part, the only one
yet published, contains a lucid and correct exposition of the prin
ciples of numeration, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divi
sion,   of the theories of the greatest common measure and least
common multiple, and of some of the more elementary properties
of numbers with respect to their divisibility.
    In such a treatise we do not, of course, expect to find new matter;
our demands are limited to a few necessary qualities, such as clear
ness, precision, conciseness, good arrangement of the several parts,
and at least so much originality in the general treatment of the sub
ject as is necessary to support the book's claim to a separate existence.
With respect to the two first of these qualities, this treatise has far more
than average merits; in the third quality it does not excel so much,
for the numerous theorems scattered throughout the book might, we
think, have been better “welded” together. In point of arrange
 ment there is much merit and some originality, a greater space than
 usual having been devoted to the very useful and interesting sub
jects of the criteria of the divisibility of numbers and of their decom
 position into prime factors.                           -
    With respect to general treatment, one of the author's chief objects
 has been to render his demonstrations purely arithmetical.           To do
                                                all
                                          symbols and     conduct his proofs
                                                                              to to
 so he has been induced to discard
 by  means     particular numbers, striving always
              of                                           make the general
 law apparent        the particular example.

                                                      some cases, and for
 young pupils especially, this method has its advantages, but                                              in
 other cases       clumsy and open
                  it   is                  suspicion.
                                                    to   Mr. Smith appears
to   have mistaken      little the true character

       “On    the Electric Conducting Power of Alloys.”        By A.   Mat
 thiessen,  Ph.D.
                   I
    In this paper have given the determinations of the electric con
 ducting power of upwards of 200 alloys, and have found that the
 metals employed may be divided into two classes, viz.      –
    A. Those metals which, when alloyed with each other, conduct
 electricity in the ratio of their relative volumes.
    B. Those metals which, when alloyed with one of class A, or with
 each other, do not conduct electricity in the ratio of their relative
 volumes, but always less.
    The alloys may be divided into three groups; viz.
    1. Those made of the metals of class A with each other.
                                                           –
    2. Those made of the metals of class A with those of class B.
    3. Those made of the metals of class B with each other.
                                                     I
    From the experiments described in the paper have tried to deduce
 the nature of alloys, and have arrived at the following conclusions:—
    A. That most alloys are only a solution of one metal in the other;
for,                                                     -
    1. On looking at the curves belonging to the different groups, we
see  that each group of alloys has a curve of a distinct and separate form.
Thus for the first we have nearly straight lines; for the second, the
conducting power decreases always rapidly on the side of the metal
belonging to class B, and then turning, goes almost in a straight
line to the metal belonging to class A; for the third group we find a
rapid decrement on both sides of the curve, and the turning-points
 united by almost a straight line.
    2. On examining that part of the curve where the rapid decrement

eddy, the eddy itself being caused by the meeting of very extensive
bodies of air, moving in nearly, but not exactly opposite directions,
one of which gradually overpowers, or combines with the other, after
the rotation.
     On the polar half of the cyclone, continually supplied from that
side, the visible effect is a drying up and clearing of the air, with a
rising barometer and falling thermometer; while on the equatorial
 side, overpowering quantities of warm moist air—rushing from
comparatively inexhaustible tropical supplies—push                     towards the
north-east as long as their impetus lasts (however originated), and
 are successively chilled, dried, and intermingled with the always
 resisting, though at first recoiling, polar current.                   After such
 struggles these two currents unite in a varying intermediate state
 and direction, one or other prevailing gradually.
     Very plain and practical conclusions are deducible from these
considerations:—
     One, and the most important, is that in a gale which seems likely
 to be near the central part of a storm, that should be (of course)
 avoided by a ship which has sea room ; a seaman, facing the wind,
 knows that the centre is on his right hand in the northern hemisphere,
 on his left in the southern ; he therefore is informed how to steer.
     Another valuable result is that telegraphic communication can
give notice of a storm’s approach, to places then some hundred miles
distant, and not otherwise forewarned.

     “Notes of Researches on the Polyammonias.”—No. VII. On
the Diatomic Ammonias.                By A. W. Hofmann, LL.D., F.R.S.
     In    continuing    my   inquiries  into the nature of the organic bases,
I   was led in the commencement of the year 1858 to repeat some
experiments on the action of dibromide of ethylene upon ammonia,
which M. Cloëz” had published in 1853. The repetition of these ex
periments compelled me to contest not only the formulae of M. Cloëz,
but also the general interpretation which he had given to his results.
     I  have not hesitated to communicate my conclusions to the Royal
Societyt.
     M. Cloézt shortly            afterwards discussed my observations, and
pointed        out the arguments which induced him to maintain his
formulae and his interpretations.
     I  have not replied to these remarks.           M. Cloéz having stated in
the same note that he was still engaged with his experiments and
that his inquiry was nearly completed,              I  discontinued my experi
ments on the action of dibromide of ethylene upon ammonia, fully
persuaded that the chemist, to whom we are indebted for the first
observation of this reaction, in continuing his experiments would
arrive at the same results which           I had myself obtained.
    In    discontinuing      the discussion with M. Cloëz,        I  was not freed
from the        obligation    of proving the general thesis of my note, viz.

                Dr. Hofmann             on the      Diatomic Ammonias.                  67
 the formation of diatomic bases by the action of diatomic bromides
 on ammonia.        I have given the proof in several communications*
 addressed during the last two years to the Royal Society, and
 especially in a notet describing some new derivatives of phenylamine
 and ethylamine published during last summer.                        The formation of
 these bodies, their analysis and their transformations, have, believe,         I
 settled the question at issue in a satisfactory manner.
    These researches have been the subject of some remarks on the
 part of M. Cloézi, from which it appears that this chemist has
 interpreted my silence as a tacit admission of defeat; he rejects the
 formulae which     I have given for the diatomic derivatives of phenyl
amine and      ethylamine,       and blames me for having continued my
researches on the diatomic bases without having previously replied
to his observations.
    Under these circumstances               I  have been compelled to resume the
investigation of the action of dibromide of ethylene upon ammonia,
and to reply, after nearly two years have elapsed without M. Cloéz's
paper having been published, to the series of objections which this
chemist has raised against the theory of the diatomic bases.
    Since this continuation of my experiments throws considerable
light upon this new class of compounds, I beg leave to submit them
to the judgment of the Royal Society.
    In order to render more intelligible the line of argument which
M. Cloéz has brought forward against the diatomic notions, it will
be useful to recapitulate in two words the subject of our controversy.
    M. Cloéz admits that in the action of dibromide of ethylene upon
ammonia, the molecule of ethylene splits into radicals belonging to
three distinct groups, viz. the formic, acetic, and propionic series;
these radicals acting upon one molecule of ammonia, in which each
of them replaces one equivalent of hydrogen, give rise to the forma
tion of three primary monamines, viz. Formenamine, Acetenamine,
and Propenamine.
   According to the view which I defend, the molecule of ethylene
remains intact in the reaction, acting upon two molecules of ammonia
in which 2, 4, or 6 equivalents of hydrogen are replaced respectively
by 1, 2, or 3 diatomic molecules of ethylene; the dibromide of
ethylene gives rise to the formation of three diamines belonging to
the same family, a primary, a secondary, and a tertiary diamine.
   Expressed in formulae the two views may thus be represented:—

   Let   us  now examine the objections which M. Cloëz has brought
forward against my argument.             “According       the hypothesis          to                                 of

action, occasioned by the intervention of heat. My experiments do
not confirm this opinion.     A mixture of dibromide of ethylene and
alcoholic ammonia allowed to stand for some time at the ordinary

   In discussing the numbers which have obtained in analysing the
hydrate and the hydrochlorate of the first base, M. Cloéz quotes the
results on which he founds his own formula.         A glance at these
figures will show unmistakeably that they agree much better with
my formula than with the one which he defends. The following

retical values required by each formula:-

  The results which M. Cloéz has obtained        the analysis     the       in                  of

I    have since examined several other salts   ethylene-diamine, and   of
the results         fully confirm the conclusions drawn from my former
analyses.          It

These numbers require no commentary.
    It is not, however, in the results of analysis that M. Cloéz finds
the chief support of his views; he quotes an observation which at the
first glance appears fatal to the diatomic notions.
    “But there is,” continues M. Cloëz, “a capital fact (un fait
capital) which completely settles the question at issue : this is the
vapour-density of the free base.”
    This density has been found by experiment to be 1:42.
    “The theoretical density calculated for my formula, referred to
4 volumes, is 1-315; the modified formula of M. Hofmann, likewise
referred to 4 volumes, gives the theoretical density of 2.699.
    “These results appear to me decisive, and                I do not hesitate to
maintain      the formula of the new series of bases, of which                I first
pointed out the formation.”                              -
    I  entirely agree with M. Cloéz as to the importance of the deter
mination of the vapour-densities, but             I  certainly arrive at a very
different   interpretation     of his result.
                                                                  I
    In repeating the experiment of this able chemist, have arrived,
as might have been expected, at exactly the same number. But this
number refers to the hydrated base, and it is easily seen that the
hydrated molecule, when in the state of vapour, must occupy 8
volumes.       In calculating the theoretical density corresponding to
the diatomic formula when referred to 8 volumes, we arrive at the
number 1:35, which coincides in fact with the number obtained by
experiment.
    It is obvious that under the influence of heat the hydrated base
splits into anhydrous base (4 volumes) and water (4 volumes),
                       C, His N, O,      F C, H. N,+2HO,
and that, instead of taking the vapour-density of the intact hydrated
 molecule, M. Cloéz has determined the density of a mixture of an
hydrous base and water, which on cooling combined again, repro
 ducing the hydrated compound. And here I must recall the observa
 tions of several chemists, especially those of M. Bineau, of M.
 Kekulé, and of M. H. Saint-Claire Deville, each of whom has had
 the opportunity of explaining the anomalous vapour-densities in the
 transitory decomposition of the compounds submitted to experiment;
 and   I would quote particularly a note by Professor Kopp", in which
 this distinguished physicist has treated the question of anomalous
 vapour-densities in a general manner.

   view, a vapour-density of 1:45 should have been found.
      The preceding experiments, although fixing in a satisfactory
   manner the composition and the equivalents of the two diammonias,
   do not unveil their molecular constitution—their degree                                           of substi
   tution.
        I
        have endeavoured to solve this problem by submitting them to
   the action of iodide of ethyle, a process which   first used for simi      I
   lar purposes, and which has since become of general application.
   This process, moreover, could not fail to furnish a final decision
   between the two theories.
      In considering with M. Cloëz the two bases as primary monamines
   belonging respectively to the formic and to the acetic groups,
                             C, H                              C, H,

   it is evident that each of them must be capable of absorbing success
   ively 1, 2, or 3 equivalents of ethyle, and of yielding three ethylated
   bases, two volatile, and one fixed.   On the contrary, if the bases were
   products of the successive substitution of the same molecule for the
   hydrogen of two equivalents of ammonia, if they were respectively a
   primary and a secondary diamine,

   the first       of the two must likewise give rise to the formation of three
   bases, whilst the second one would produce only two.
     Experiment has verified this latter anticipation.      In submitting
   ethylene-diamine to the alternate action of iodide of ethyle and oxide
   of silver, I have succeeded in obtaining two volatile ethylated bases,
   and a third one, which is fixed. These compounds are well defined ;

discovered about six years ago, but the true nature of which he failed
to recognize. To complete the series, it remains only to examine
the third volatile base and the oxide of tetrethylene-diammonium.
   The observations which I have the honour of submitting to the
Royal Society coincide in every point with the first note upon this
subject which            I
                    presented nearly two years ago.       have simply                      I

   In conclusion may state a fact which has also been observed
by M. Cloéz, viz. that the action of dibromide of ethylene upon
ammonia gives rise to the formation of bases not directly belonging
to the series which we have discussed.    In searching for the method
                                                      I
of purifying the ethylene bases, have been obliged to examine also
the terms of the other group; but since these substances do not
necessarily belong to this part of the inquiry, omit for the present        I
to enter more fully into their examination.
    “On the Forces that produce the great Currents of the Air and of
the Ocean.”      By Thomas Hopkins, Esq.
   In this paper the writer pointed out the fact that we have at
present no satisfactory evidence in books of what are the immediate
causes of the great currents of the air and of the ocean; and he
maintained that the liberated heat of condensing vapour is the cause
of these currents. He then proceeded to show that                  the great                    all
winds terminate        comparative

where much vapour has been condensed; and contended that such
vacua enable and cause heavier air           press and flow towards the

   An electro-magnet is placed at C, and is constructedso as to allow
the two helices to be separated; and by these means the larger vessel
can, if required, be placed between them, and any portion of the
luminous discharge may be thus exposed to any part of the magnetic
field.
   When the terminals of an excited induction coil are attached to
the wires    of either of the    above vacuum-tubes A or B, luminous
discharges     are obtained, the negative wire ball or plate being
  covered with a luminous cloud-like glow extending towards the
 positive; but the stratifications are not developed, except by the
 magnet, and these become more clearly defined as the magnet is
  caused to approach, or as the power is increased, when they are de
  flected according to the direction of the discharge, or of the polarity
  of the magnet. But with the induction coil, no matter how          I   re
  duced the   intensity of the  discharge,  or varied that of the electro
 magnet, in no instance could I produce in these, or in any of my
 vacuum-tubes, a similar result to that which Mr. Grove obtained in
 the vacuum-tube so unfortunately broken; the experiment evidently
 requires a certain balance of power between the electric discharge
 and that of the magnet, and this         I
                                         had hitherto been unsuccessful
 in obtaining.

                                               have recently had carefully
 cleaned and recharged with rain-water; the luminous discharge in
 both the vacua A and B was obtained with less than 1000 series,
 and this discharge, as well as that from the full series of the battery of
 3520 cells, was under certain conditions, hereafter described, entirely
 destroyed or interrupted by the power of the magnet.
     At first the interruption or break in the luminous discharge ap
 peared to be caused by the sudden action of the magnet, as if it were
 merely momentarily blown out, for the discharge recovered itself
 while it remained under the influence of the magnet—the luminous
 discharge under this condition gradually reappearing stratified and
 strongly deflected; but   I  subsequently ascertained that, by carefully
 adjusting the intensity of the battery discharge, and the force or power
 of the electro-magnet, this recovery in the discharge could be en
 tirely prevented.
     On approaching the vacuum A towards the electro-magnet, the
 luminous discharge from the battery assumed the same form as that
from the induction coil; but when the vacuum was placed between
the helices, so as to permit the armatures or poles of the magnet
to touch one or each side of the glass vessel at about      its centre, the
discharge disappeared;     as  soon   asthe  magnet   was removed,  or  the
 vacuum-tube withdrawn from         its
                                      influence, the luminous discharge
was reproduced.
     To test whether a    complete disruption       of
                                                    the electrical current
had taken place, two gold-leaf electroscopes were attached, one     to  the
zinc and the other   to  the copper terminal      the water-battery; the
                                                   of
leaves diverged with considerable energy; connection was then made
from the electroscopes    tothe wires     of
                                         the vacuum-tube; the luminous

discharge became visible, and the leaves of both electroscopes par
tially collapsed; the vacuum-tube was then placed as before, between
the armatures of the electro-magnet, and immediately the magnet
was excited, the luminous discharge disappeared, and the leaves of
the electroscopes diverged to their original maximum extent, thus
proving the disruption to be complete.
     If  the smaller tube B is placed across both poles of the magnet,
the luminous discharge at                         its

  It  is natural     inquire whether the doctrines

tutions, which are essential for the association           organic products,  of
may not throw some additional light upon the simpler compounds                                             of
mineral chemistry, when viewed           unitary molecules; and particu
                                                         as

                                                the mineral acids and their
salts, which have hitherto constituted the strongholds            the electro              of
chemical,     binary, theory
               or                              of
                                    combination.
   The doctrine        series affirms that chemical compounds may
                          of                                                                               be
arranged       series, the successive members
               in                                       each             of

   The doctrine          of
                      substitutions affirms   that,     very  many       in
                                                                     chemical
compounds, one          more atoms may

atoms      groupings, and that the new bodies, resulting from this
          or
displacement, correspond           constitution with the normal bodies

                                 Dr. Odling on Acids and Salts.                                                 79
from which they were derived. The doctrine of substitutions affords
great assistance to the doctrine of series; for when, as frequently
happens, a gap exists in any series, that gap can almost always be
filled up by a substitution-representative of the missing body.
    (a.) There are four acid compounds of hydrogen, two volumes of
  each of which contain one volume of hydrogen, namely:
                        HF Fluorhydric acid.
                        HCl Chlorhydric acid.
                         HBr Bromhydric acid.
                        HI Iodhydric acid.
 When two volumes of chlorhydric acid, for instance, are acted upon
 by a red-hot iron wire, the chlorine is absorbed by the iron, and one
 volume of hydrogen gas liberated.      The two volumes of chlorhydric
 acid yield one volume of hydrogen, or the original bulk of gas is
 reduced to one-half by the absorption of         chlorine.   The above    its
 four acids may              be
                    looked upon                           as
                                      substitution-representatives, one
of another.
   Chlorhydric acid yields the following series                                    of   oxides, convertible
into each other by mutual metamorphosis:—
                     HCl     Chlorhydric acid.
                     HClO Hypochlorous acid.
                     HClO’ Chlorous acid.
                     HClO’ Chloric acid.
                   HClO" Perchloric acid.
When chlorhydric acid, HCl, oxidated      permanganic acid, hypo
                                                     is                  by
chlorous acid, HClO,   produccd; and, conversely, chlorhydric acid

may       be     reproduced           by   the deoxidation          of   hypochlorous acid.                 Hypo
chlorous acid, when heated, breaks up into chloric acid, HClO", and
other products.  When chloric acid    deoxidated by nitrous acid,
                                                                is                                              it
becomes chlorous acid, HClO’; and when oxidated               the positive                   at

volumes      each of which, however, contain two volumes
                                 of                                hydro                               of

HClO", and H’SO".       Bibasic characters are manifested as decidedly
by the sulphurous and sulphydric acids.
   (y.) There are four other binary compounds of hydrogen, two
volumes of each of which, however, contain three volumes of hydro
gen, namely:             H*N Ammonia.
                         H*P     Phosphamine.
                         H* As Arsenamine.
                         H*Sb Stibamine.
When the two volumes of phosphamine, for instance, are acted upon
by a red hot iron-wire, the phosphorus is absorbed by the iron, and
three volumes of hydrogen gas are liberated. Two volumes of chlorhy
dric acid yield one volume of hydrogen; two volumes of sulphydric
 acid yield two volumes of hydrogen, while two volumes of phos
phamine yield three volumes of hydrogen; and this is a most import
ant distinction between the three classes of hydrides to which these
hree gases respectively belong.        Again, two volumes of gaseous
ammonia, when decomposed by the Ruhmkorff spark, become con
verted into three volumes of hydrogen and one volume of nitrogen;
or the original bulk of the ammonia becomes doubled.
   In the phosphorus series of oxygen acids there is but one gap, and
this can be filled up by the chlorine- or the ethyl-representative of
the missing body.

   Brodie has ascertained that oxychloride of phosphorus, Cl*PO, may
be obtained directly by passing oxygen gas through boiling terchloride
of phosphorus, or trichloro-phosphamine, Cl*P. The union of tri
ethylphosphine, Et'P, with oxygen, to form the oxide of tri-ethylphos
phine, Et"PO, constituted one of Hofmann's earliest experimentson the
phosphorus bases. Proceeding to the actual oxides of phosphamine, it
is doubtful whether hypophosphorus acid, H°PO", has been obtained by
the oxidation of phosphamine;      but, on the other hand, phosphamine
is readily obtainable by deoxidating hypophosphorous          acid with
nascent hydrogen; while by oxidating hypophosphorous acid, phos
phorous and phosphoric acids are successively produced. Phosphorous
acid, H°PO", results from the slow oxidation, and phosphoric acid,
H*PO", from the rapid oxidation of phosphamine.       Conversely, phos
phamine may be obtained by the deoxidation of each of the two last
mentioned acids. Here again, then, is a series of naturally associated
and mutually convertible bodies, represented by the simplest possible
formulae, by formulae which do not express any speculative view
whatever, but merely indicate the indisputable fact that these bodies,
or their representatives, differ from one another in composition, by
the successive increments of one, two, three, and four oxygen atoms.
   Phosphoric acid, H° PO", is the representative in the phosphorus
series, of sulphuric acid, H°SO", in the sulphur series, and of per
chloric acid, HClO", in the chlorine series; but whereas perchloric

    Considering the relations of ammonia and phosphuretted hydrogen,
H*N     and H*P respectively, and the relations of marsh-gas and sili
ciuretted hydrogen, H°C and Hº Si respectively, there should exist
nitrates and carbonates having the general formulae M*NO" and
M“CO* respectively, corresponding to ordinary phosphates and
silicates having the general formulae M'PO" and M*SiO' respec
tively. It is observable, however, that in addition to ordinary
phosphates and silicates, there are other phosphates and silicates,
known respectively as metaphosphates and metasilicates, which differ
from the ordinary salts by the loss of an atom of base, and that it is
these metasalts to which ordinary nitrates and carbonates correspond,
thus:–
       Phosphate            M'PO*—M*O=MPO'                                Metaphosphate.

  3. “On some Foraminifera from the Upper Triassic Clays of
Chellaston, near Derby.” By T. Rupert Jones, Esq., F.G.S., and
W. K. Parker, Esq., M. Micr. Soc.
   Bluish-grey specimens of the mottled clay from the pits at Chel
laston, 3 miles south of Derby, whence the alabaster is obtained,
yielded abundance of minute Foraminifera, a few Entomostraca
(Cythere), some Otolites, and spines and plates of small Echinoderms,
together with fine siliceous sand and pyritous granules.       Of the
Foraminifera nearly one-half consist of a small variety of Rotalia
repanda, namely R. elegans, D'Orb.        The next most numerous
group are the Nodosarinae, including varieties of Nodosaria, Denta
lina, Marginulina, Vaginulina, Planularia, Frondicularia, Flabellina,
and Cristellaria. The genus next in numerical force is Nubecularia.
Polymorphina, Bulimina, and Lituola are represented by a few indi
viduals.

which show a conformable sequence of strata from the Old Red
Sandstone of Foths to the yellow sandstone and cornstone of Lossie
mouth and Burgh Head, the author first stated that the siliceous
marly rocks, or so-called “cornstones” of Glassgreen, Linksfield,
Spynie, Inverugie, and Lossiemouth are in reality very dissimilar to
the cornstones of Foths and Cothall; and he then pointed out the
improbability of the so-called cornstone of Glassgreen continuing to
dip north-westwardly under the sandstone of the Quarry-wood Ridge,

probably faulted against the lower             Holoptychian sandstone, which
latter towards Spynie was shown                     surmounted to    the Repti

    Beyond Spynie Loch, northward, the author supposed that another
fault had again brought                        up
                                       the sandstone with Stagonolepis and
Hyperodapedon            at

                     cover the sandstone.

   M. CAPPA.
           two products, which by their physical properties appear to
THESE be cotannite, are of a yellow colour and not lustrous. The two
specimens were marked A and B, and the results obtained were:—
  A. Chlorine; sulphuric, and traces of silicic acids; lead in large
quantity; copper, and a small quantity of sodium.
   B. Chlorine, copper, and lead.
     A, from      its
                physical and chemical properties, might        considered                  of be

    is well known that certain substances possess the property of
               definite colours to flames in which they are heated.
When the coloured light thus produced is analysed by a prism,
spectra  exhibiting differently coloured bands or lines of light
are seen.   Upon the occurrence of these lines of light an en
tirely new method of qualitative chemical analysis can be based—
a method which greatly enlarges the scope of chemical reactions,
and points to the solution of problems hitherto unapproachable.
In the present paper we shall confine ourselves to the application
of this method to the detection of the metals of the alkalies and
alkaline earths, and to the illustration of the value of the
method in a series of examples.
   The bright lines in the flame-spectrum are seen most plainly
when the temperature of the flame is highest, and               illu                        its

the bodies with which the metals employed were combined, the
variety in the nature of the chemical processes occurring in the
several flames, and the wide differences of temperature which
these flames exhibit, produce no effect upon the position of the
bright lines in the spectrum which are characteristic of each metal.
   The following considerations show how much the temperature
of these various flames differ. An approximation to the tempe
rature of a flame is obtained by help of the equation

                    Analysis by Spectrum-observations.                    93
      In order    to prove still more conclusively that each of the
   above-mentioned metals always produces the same bright lines
   in the spectrum, we have compared the spectra represented in
  the Plate with those produced when the electric spark passes
   between electrodes made of these metals.
      Small pieces of sodium, potassium, lithium, strontium, and
  calcium were fastened to fine platinum wires and melted two
  by two into glass tubes, so that the pieces of metal were sepa
  rated by about 1 to 2 millims, and the platinum wires were
  melted through the sides of the glass tubes.              Each of these
  tubes was placed in front of the spectrum-instrument, and
  by means of a Ruhmkorff's induction apparatus, sparks were
  allowed to pass between the pieces of metal inside the tube;
  the spectrum thus produced was then compared with that given
  by a gas-flame in which the chloride of the metal was brought.
 The flame was placed behind the glass tube.                By alternately
  bringing the induction apparatus into and out of action, it was
 easy, without measuring, to convince ourselves that in the
 brilliant spectrum of the electric spark, the bright lines of the
 flame-spectrum were present in their right position.              Besides
 these lines, other bright ones appeared in the electric-spark
 spectrum; some of these were produced by foreign metals present
 in the electrodes, others arose from nitrogen, which filled the
 tubes after the oxygen had combined with a portion of the
 electrodes%.
     From these facts it appears certain that the appearance of
 the bright lines represented in the spectra on the Plate may be
 regarded as absolute proof of the presence of the particular
 metal.    They serve as reactions by means of which these bodies
 may be recognized with more certainty, greater quickness, and
in far smaller quantities than can be done by help of any other
known analytical method.
     The spectra drawn on the Plate represent those seen when
the slit was of such a width that only the most conspicuous of
the lines of the solar spectrum were visible, the magnifying
power of the telescope C being a fourfold one, and the light of a
moderate degree of intensity.         These circumstances seem to us
to be the most advantageous when it is required to make a
chemical analysis by means of spectrum-observations.                    The
    * On employing on one occasion with strontium-electrodes a tube filled
with hydrogen instead of nitrogen, the stream of sparks changed rapidly
into a continuous arc of light, whilst a grey pellicle covered the inside of
the tube.    The tube was opened under rock-oil, when it was found that it
was   empty,  the hydrogen having disappeared. . This gas appears, at the
enormous temperature of the electric spark, to have decomposed the oxide
of strontium which was not completely removed from the metal.

94          Professors Kirchhoff and Bunsen on Chemical
appearance   of the spectrum can under other conditions vary
considerably.        If
                   the purity of the spectrum be increased, many
of those lines which appeared before as single ones are split up
into several; thus the sodium line is divided into two separate
lines.  If the intensity of the light, on the other hand, be                      in
creased, new lines appear in several of the spectra represented in
the Plate, and the relation of the brightness of the old ones becomes
altered. In general an indistinct line becomes brighter upon
increasing the illumination, more rapidly than does a brighter
line, but not to such an extent that the indistinct line ever
overtakes in intensity the brighter one.         A good example of
this is seen in the two lithium lines. We have only observed
one exception to this rule, namely in the line Bam, which by
light of small intensity is scarcely visible, whilst Bay appears
plainly, but by light of greater intensity becomes more visible
than the latter. This fact appears to us of importance, and
we intend on a future occasion to examine this point in detail.
   We now proceed to describe the peculiarities of the several
spectra, the exact acquaintance with which is of practical im
portance, and to point out the advantages which this new method
of chemical analysis possesses over the older processes.
                                            Sodium.
  The spectrum-reaction of sodium is the most delicate of all.
The yellow line Na a, the only one which appears in the sodium
spectrum, is coincident with Fraunhofer's dark line D, and is
remarkable for           its
                   exactly defined form, and for                its
                                                      extraordinary

                   the line.                     In
                                   this case too, the weaker lines
produced        by
               other bodies, when near the sodium line, are
discerned with difficulty, and are often first seen when the
sodium reaction has almost subsided.

must be brought into the flame whilst the observer is looking
through the telescope.         The lithium lines are often only seen
during a few moments amongst the first products of the volati
lization.
     In the production of lithium salts on the large scale, in the
proper choice of a raw material, and in the arrangement of
suitable methods of separation, this spectrum-analysis affords
most valuable aid. Thus it is only necessary to place a drop
of mother-liquor from any mineral spring in the flame and to
observe the spectrum produced, in order to show that in many of
these waste products a rich and hitherto unheeded source of
lithium salts exists.      In the same way during the course of the
preparation any loss of lithium in the collateral products and
residues can be easily traced, and thus more convenient and
economical      methods of preparation may be found to replace
those at    present  employed”.
                                 Potassium.
     The volatile potassium compounds give, when placed in the
flame, a widely extended        continuous spectrum, which contains
only two characteristic lines, namely, one line, Kao, in the
outermost red approaching the ultra-red rays, exactly coinciding
with the dark line A of the solar spectrum, and a second line,
 Ka B, situated far in the violet rays towards the other end of
the spectrum, and also identical with a particular dark line
observed by Fraunhofer.           A very indistinct line coinciding
with Fraunhofer's line         B, which,   however, is only seen when
the light is very intense, is not by any means so characteristic.
The violet line is somewhat pale, but can be used almost as
well as the red line for the detection of potassium. Owing to
the position of these two lines, both situated near the limit at
which our eyes cease to be sensitive to the rays, this reaction
for potassium is not so delicate as the reaction for the two
metals already mentioned. The reaction became visible in the
air of our room when 1 gramme of chlorate of potassium
mixed with milk-sugar was burnt.            In this way, therefore, the
    * We obtained by such an improved method from two jars (about 4
litres) of a mother-liquor from a mineral spring, which by evaporation with
sulphuric acid gave 1*2 of residue, half an ounce of carbonate of lithion of
the purity of the commercial, the cost of which is about 140 florins the
pound. A great number of other mineral-spring mother-liquors which we
examined showed a similar richness in compounds of lithium.

 100           Professors Kirchhoff and Bunsen on Chemical
          º
experiment, a quantity of strontium may be thus detected equal
to the      part of a milligramme in weight.
  The chlorine and the other haloid salts of strontium give the
best reaction. The hydrated oxide and the carbonate of stron
 tium give the action less vividly, the sulphate less distinctly,
 whilst the compounds of strontium with the non-volatile acids
 give either a very slight reaction or else none at all.      Hence it
 is well first to bring  the bead of substance alone into the flame,
 and then again after moistening with hydrochloric acid.             it   If
 be supposed that sulphuric acid is present in the bead, it must
be held in the reducing part of the flame before it is moistened
with hydrochloric acid, for the purpose of changing the sulphate
into the sulphide, which is decomposed by hydrochloric acid. In
order to detect strontium when combined with silicic, phospho
ric, boracic, and other non-volatile acids, the following course of
procedure gives the best results.      Instead of fusing with carbo
nate of sodium in a platinum crucible, a conical spiral of plati
num wire is employed; this spiral is heated to whiteness in
the flame, and dipped whilst hot into finely powdered dried
carbonate of sodium, which properly should contain so much
water that a sufficient quantity adheres to the wire when it is
once dipped into the salt.      The fusion takes place in this spiral
much more quickly than in a platinum crucible, as the mass of
platinum requiring heating is small, and the flame comes into
direct contact with the salt.      As soon as the finely powdered
mineral has been brought into the fused soda by means of a
small platinum spatula, and the mass retained above the fusion
point for a few minutes, the cooled mass has only to be turned
upside down, and knocked on the porcelain plate of the lamp
in order to obtain the salt in one coherent bead. The fused
mass is covered by a piece of writing-paper, and then broken by
pressing it with the blade of a steel spatula until the whole is in
the state of a fine powder.     The powder is collected to one spot
on the edge of the plate, and carefully covered with hot water,
which is allowed to flow backwards and forwards over         it, that,
                                                                   so
after decanting    and  rewashing the  powder  several times,        all
                                                                   the
soluble salts are extracted without losing any     ofthe residue.             If

                   Analysis by Spectrum-observations.               101
     The reactions of potassium and sodium are not influenced by
the presence of strontium.         Lithium also can be easily detected
in presence of strontium when the proportion of the former
metal is not very small. The lithium line Li 2 appears as an
intensely red sharply defined band upon             a less distinct  red
ground of the broad strontium band Sr 8.
                                  Calcium.
     The spectrum      produced by calcium is immediately distin
guished from the four spectra already considered by the very
characteristic bright green line Ca 3. A second no less charac
teristic feature in the calcium spectrum is the intensely bright
orange line Ca a, lying considerably nearer to the red end of
 the spectrum than either the sodium line Na a, or the orange
 band of strontium Sr. a.        By burning a mixture consisting of
 chloride of calcium, chlorate of potassium, and milk-sugar, awhite
 cloud is obtained which gives the reaction with as great a degree
 of delicacy as strontium salts do under similar circumstances.
 In this way we found that        wº       of a milligramme in weight
 of chloride of calcium can be detected with certainty. Only the
 volatile compounds of calcium give this reaction; the more vola
 tile the salt the more distinct and delicate does the reaction be
 come.      The chloride, bromide, and iodide of calcium are in this
 respect the best compounds. Sulphate of calcium produces the
 spectrum, after it has become basic, very brightly and continu
 ously.     In the same way the reaction of the carbonate becomes
 more    distinctly  visible after the acid has been expelled.
      Compounds of calcium with the non-volatile acids remain         in
 active in the flame; but if they are attacked by hydrochloric
 acid, the reaction may be easily obtained as follows:—A few
 milligrammes of finely powdered substance are brought on to
 the moistened flat platinum ring in the moderately hot portion
 of the flame, so that the powder is fritted, but not melted on to
  the wire; if a drop of hydrochloric acid be now allowed to fall
 into the ring so that the greater part of the acid remains hang
  ing on to the wire, and if then the wire be brought into the
  hottest part of the flame, the drop evaporates in the spheroidal
  state without ebullition. The spectrum of the flame must be ob
  served during this operation; and it will be noticed that at the
  moment when the last particles of liquid evaporate, a bright
   calcium spectrum appears.        If the quantities of the metal pre
   sent are  very   small,  the characteristic lines are only seen for a
   moment; if larger quantities are contained, the phaenomenon
   lasts for a longer time.
      Only in the silicates which are decomposed by hydrochloric
   acid can the calcium be thus found.         In those minerals which

102                  Professors Kirchhoff and Bunsen on Chemical
are not attacked by that acid, the following method may be best
employed for the detection of calcium.     A few milligrammes of
the substance under examination, in a state of fine division, are
 brought upon a flat platinum lid, together with about a gramme
 of fluoride of ammonium, and the mixture is gently ignited until
of is all
     the fluoride       volatilized. The slight crust
                           is                                  salt remaining             of

                                                         acid, and the excess

   9.  Mosanderite from Brevig, and Tscheffkinite from the

104         Professors Kirchhoff and Bunsen on Chemical
Ilmengebirge, showed, when treated alone, the sodium reaction;
on the addition of hydrochloric acid, the lines Ca a and Ca 8
appeared.
    10. Melinophane from Lamoe gave the line Na a when placed
alone in the flame; with hydrochloric acid the lines Ca a, Ca 6,
and Li & became visible.
    11. Scheelite and sphene give, on treatment with hydrochloric
acid, a very intense calcium reaction.
    12. When small quantities of strontium are present together
with calcium, the line Sr 8 may be most conveniently employed
for the detection of this metal.       In this way the presence of
small quantities of strontium can be easily detected in very many
sedimentary limestones.       The lines Na a, Li a, Ka a, especially
Li are observed as soon as the limestone is brought into the
     2,
flame.     Converted by hydrochloric acid into chlorides, and
brought in this form into the flame, these minerals give the
same bands; and not unfrequently the line Sr 8 is also distinctly
seen.     This latter appears, however, only for a short time, and
is in general best seen when the calcium spectrum begins to fade.
    In this way the lines Na'a, Lia, Kaa, Ca a, Ca 3, and Sr 8
were found in the spectra of the following limestones:—
    Limestone from the Silurian at Kugelbad near Prague.
Muschelkalk from Rohrbach near Heidelberg.              Limestone from
the Lias at Malsch in Baden. Chalk from England.
    The following limestones gave the lines Naa, Lia, Kaa, Cace,
Ca 6, but not the blue strontium band Sr 8:—
    Marble from the granite near Auerbach”.        Limestone from the
Devonian at Gerolstein in the Eifel. Carboniferous limestone
from Plamitz in Saxony. Dolomite from Nordhausen in the Harz.
Jura kalk from Streitberg in Franconia.
    From these few experiments it is evident that a more extended
series of exact spectrum analyses, respecting the amount of stron
tium, lithium, sodium, and potassium which the various limestone
formations contain, must prove of the greatest geological im
portance, both as regards the order of their formation and their
local distribution, and may possibly lead to the establishment of
some unexpected conclusions respecting the nature of the oceans
from which these limestones were originally deposited.

106         Professors Kirchhoff and Bunsen on Chemical
position.    As the potassium, sodium, lithium, and barium salts
volatilized, their spectra became fainter and fainter, and their
peculiar bands one after the other vanished, until, after the lapse
of a few minutes, the lines Caa, Ca S, Src, Sr 8, Sr y, and Sr 8
became gradually visible, and, like a dissolving view, at last
attained their characteristic distinctness, colouring, and position,
and then, after some time, became pale and disappeared entirely.
   The absence of any one or of several of these bodies is at once
indicated by the non-appearance of the corresponding bright lines.
   Those who become acquainted with the various spectra by
repeated observation, do not need to have before them an exact
measurement of the single lines in order to be able to detect the
presence of the various constituents; the colour, relative position,
peculiar form, variety of shade and brightness of the bands are
quite characteristic enough to ensure exact results, even in the
hands of persons unaccustomed to such work. These special
distinctions may be compared with the differences of outward ap
pearance presented by the various precipitates which we employ
for detecting substances in the wet way. Just as it holds good as a
character of a precipitate that it is gelatinous, pulverulent, floccu
lent, granular, or crystalline, so the lines of the spectrum exhibit
their peculiar aspects, some appearing sharply defined at their
edges, others blended          off
                              either      at
                                        one    both sides, either similarly

                                               so   in
we employ only those lines which are produced                           by

X.    On the Bases produced by the Destructive Distillation of Peat.
         By ARTHUR H. CHURCH and Edward Owen +.
      HE    crude material which furnished the bases described in
        the present communication was obtained by the destruc
tive distillation of Irish peat. The operation was performed in
a blast-furnace, according to the patent of Mr. Rees Reece, the
carbonaceous residues of former operations constituting the fuel
employed.       The distillation was conducted at the lowest possible
temperature, avoiding thereby any undue carbonization of the
turf prior to the formation and liberation of                            its
                                                           volatile products.

wished to offer an exhaustive account of the complex basic fluid
which we have worked upon ; the entire absence of any previous
knowledge of the bases produced by the destructive distillation
of peat must be our excuse for the imperfections of the present
                                                                   255   275

     A  few tentative experiments were first made as to the nature
and    composition   of the basic oils by means of their platinum
salts. But our attention was soon mainly directed to the most
volatile fraction collected between 95° and 97°, and the boiling
point of which was almost constant at 97°. This liquid was in
reality separated by an interval of 23° from the next higher
fraction, while any more volatile bases that might originally
have been present in the distilled oil had been lost in the
various operations to which it had been subjected. To this body,
which subsequent examination proved to be a pure base, we
have assigned the name cespitine. We proceed to detail our
 analyses and experiments, and to give some account of the pro
 perties of the new base and its derivatives.
                                Cespitine.
     The fraction 95° to 100° of the 8th rectification was dried
 thoroughly with caustic potash and redistilled,—the portion
 coming over between 95° and 97°, which constituted ºths of
 the whole, being employed for experiment.              A considerabic

orange-yellow crystalline precipitate first formed was then
poured in and the mixture set aside to crystallize. Several crops
of magnificent orange-red shuttle-shaped crystals were suc
cessively obtained, and these, after washing with alcohol and
ether, gave the following results on analysis:—

   These numbers agree pretty closely with those required by
the theory, C19H4N Cl, PtCl2, while the excess of platinum
obtained in analyses III. and IV., made with a salt recrystallized
by the aid of heat, is probably to be explained by the result of
an experiment in which we have proved that the cespitine pla
tinum salt yields a platinized derivative when boiled with water.
Before proceeding to describe this new substance, we give the
results furnished by an analysis of the pure base cespitine.

   The platinum salt of cespitine, which is but slightly soluble
in cold water, dissolves readily in boiling water; and the solu
tion, if kept in steady ebullition for half an hour, deposits bril
liant pale yellow scales, the supernatant liquid becoming colour
less.
   During this transformation hydrochloric acid is evolved in
considerable quantity, and may be readily detected at the mouth
of the vessel. The reaction proceeds as follows:—
          C19H14N Cl, PtCl2=C10H18 Pt N Cl2 +H Cl,
and is perfectly analogous to the change produced in the pla
tinum salts of pyridine and picoline by ebullition with water,

    An attempt        to   prepare the bichloride        of   plato-cespityl-ammo

114         Messrs.   A. H. Church           and E. Owen on the Bases
nium, for so we provisionally name the salt just described, by
the direct union of cespitine and bichloride of platinum, led to
no definite result. The bichloride of plato-cespityl-ammonium
is not altered by continued ebullition, but may be crystallized
from boiling water.
   The metamorphosis of the platinum salt of cespitine pointed
to an essential difference between that base and amylamine; and
this difference is the more remarkable, since the true amylamine
has been detected by Greville Williams and by Anderson among
the products of the destructive distillation of several organic
substances.      An experiment was made, however, in order to
establish this distinction more conclusively. One volume of pure
cespitine was digested in a sealed tube at 120°C. for several
days with 8 or 10 volumes of iodide of ethyle.            On opening the
tube no    escape   of  hydriodic  acid  gas  occurred,   but on shaking
up    its
        contents with    water,  and evaporating    the aqueous   solution,
a  syrup was obtained which did not show the least tendency                                 to
crystallize even       vacuo over sulphuric acid; the iodide
                      in                                             ethyl      of

amylamine.     And when this iodide was acted upon by oxide of
silver, and the hydrate thus produced combined with hydro
chloric acid, an excessively soluble chloride was obtained, which
did not exhibit a trace of crystallization when evaporated to dry
ness, and had in fact no character in common with that of the
highly crystalline and difficultly soluble chloride of diamyl
anana Orllum.
   Cespitine is isomeric not only with amylamine, but also with
diethylmethylamine and dimethylpropylamine; and since it has
been found to contain no replaceable hydrogen, it seemed pro
bable that it might be one of the nitryles just mentioned.              But
cespitine is entirely unacted upon by nitrous acid, not a trace of
any alcohol being produced, and the original base being recover
able by distillation with potash.        In our ignorance of the true
constitution of cespitine we have supposed it to contain the tri
atomic radical (C19H%)", although the unusually large propor
tion of hydrogen casts a doubt upon such a view. All our ex
periments with cespitine lead us to believe that it bears the
same relation to the true amylamine as picoline does to aniline,

   The filtrate from the pyridine salt yielded another crop of

amount was, however, insufficient for an analysis.
   The pyridine platinum salt yielded pale yellow flocks of the

  IV. 0.278 grim. gave 0-0916 grim. platinum=32.95 p. c.
   The platinum salts of the next fraction gave slightly different
numbers, indicating a mixture of picoline and lutidine.      The oil
had been collected between 145° and 150°, and amounted to not
less than 60 grammes.

The largest quantity of collidine distilled over between 180° and
186°; altogether about 200 grammes were collected. The entire
absence of aniline from the peat bases was proved by several
careful qualitative experiments; while the platinum determina
tion made with the salt of the 180°–185° fraction (III. above)
gave a per-centage differing from that of the aniline salt by as
much as 2.84 per cent.         In this fraction, aniline, the boiling
point of which is 182°, should have been found had it been
present.
   The examination of the fractions above 190° and up to 210°
has not led to any very definite result. Not only are the oils above
this point difficult of combustion, but they are not capable of
furnishing crystalline salts. Concentrated hydrochloric solutions
of the various fractions which came over in the 10th rectification
between 190° and 215°, gave no precipitate with a strong solu
tion of bichloride of platinum, even after the addition of alcohol
and ether; nor could any double compound be prepared, either
with the chloride of uranyle or of cadmium. The compounds pro
duced with sulphuric and oxalic acid are colourless gummy masses.

sary to say that, according to received opinions and experiments,
no current passes and no electricity takes place.     was led by                 I
some theoretic considerations  to think that this rule might not
be without an exception; and the following experiment realized
my views.
   A Florence flask, well cleaned and dried, was filled two-thirds
full of distilled water with a few drops of sulphuric acid added
to   it,
       and placed          outer vessel containing similar acidulated

water which reached           the same height

                   inch below the surface       the interior liquid;
                                                                 of                                      a
similar coated wire was dipped into the outer liquid, and this
and the wire which passed through the cork were brought
respectively into connexion with the extremities     the secondary          of
coil  of   Ruhmkorff apparatus.
           a                       Upon   the latter being excited

platinum points, proving clearly that electrolysis took place not
withstanding the interposition          the glass. of The portions     the                       of
flask above the liquid, both outside and inside, were perfectly dry,

   With distilled water unacidulated could observe no effect I                                           of

upon intercepting communication with the battery for ten

                                         the evolution took place again;

the direction          of

from the outer vessel and tapped, minute bubbles rose from the
interior surface.       When a tolerably thick test-tube was used
instead of the Florence flask, a very slight effect of electrolysis
 could be detected; and when the outer wire was removed to a
 short distance from the surface, sparks passed, but not of half the
length of those with the Florence flask.               When, however, a
large phial of somewhat greater contents than the Florence flask
 was used, the effects were the same as with the latter, showing,
as   Iexpected, that surface is an important element in the success
of the experiment.
    There seems little doubt from the above experiments that the
electrolysis was effected by induction across the thin glass of the
Florence flask; and                its

XIV.     Preliminary Notice on Thirteen Systems of Crystallization
    in the Mineral Kingdom, and their Optical Characters.       By
    Professor  BREITHAUPT,   of Freiberg, Councillor of Mines”.
Th;tourmaline
     important discovery made by Councillor Jenzsch, that
              had two optical axes (Poggendorff’s Annalen,
vol. cviii. p. 645), certainly delighted no one more than myself.
Soon after reading that account it occurred to me that the same
character must be found in those crystals of apatite and idocrase
in which I had more than ten years since observed the asymme
trical condition of the pyramidal planes with respect to the base.
Reich found the two optical axes beautifully distinct in a
fine crystal of apatite from Ehrenfriedersdorf,          Pollachites
haplotypicus (see my “Mineralogy,        vol.      277), having     ii.   p.                        at
one pole    asmooth basal plane, and      the other good cleavage
                                                          at                     a
plane.   I  estimate the angle that the two axes make       degrees                    at
                                                                                       6
at   the least.
     The same applies, though              in   a    less degree,          to    the apatite from
Schwarzenstein         in
                the Zillerthal                   in      Tyrol, which, however,                I  have
not measured; perhaps     this    in             case     the axes are only              2     degrees
apart.
   The apatite from St. Gothard, Pollachites galacticus, which
I had measured, was polished, and then found that presented
                                                     I                                 it
the same characters      the one from Schwarzenstein.

   M.  Lingke, the  optician     the University, was kind enough
                                           to
to cut and polish for me two plates                           of
                                          the green idocrase from
Piedmont (Idocrasius calaminus,        M.      652); and found two

   When     I had obtained these results,      received  letter from
                                                               I                     a

   These differences are certainly the smallest and most difficult
           I
which have had to determine, especially when the crystals pre
sent only one termination, and where perimetrical measurements
are impossible.
   It would have been more than wonderful, if one had wished
for such a difference of angles, to have found them, especially
in so many crystals,                all
                             which had their symmetry destroyed

expected      sought for. Nevertheless             reason why some             no

found   having  their  planes symmetrically    arranged; but those

have most certainly, without exception, two optical axes.      This
much      is    certain, that tetragonal and heavagonal substances, whose
pyramidal and rhombohedral planes are arranged              absolutely              in    an
symmetrical order, cannot, have two    optical aves.
I     discovered the peculiarities      idocrase     quiteof different         in          a
manner from that          which Col. von Kokscharoff did those of

clinochlore; for      investigated these bodies without

optical axes             of
                   idocrase were made known.        On the contrary,
Col. von Kokscharoff first found          clinochlore with hexagonal

found          by
             new measurements that, with the same hexagonal
base, the terminal planes were asymmetrical and differed consi
derably from his former measurements.          This second trial may,
however,            be
                considered very satisfactory.        He will now see the
wrong                     doubting the correctness           my measure

one axis, belong to the hexagonal system. And now my mea

differences of more than 30 minutes appeared in the inclination
of the rhombohedral planes. Why have not these measurements

     It may happen, and          I think it is probable, that pentago
mal dodecahedrons may exist          in other species, perhaps in Gers
dorffite, and    I  fully expect it  will be found in Hauerite, which,
however, does not belong to that genus.            In this case an espe
cial primary form does not exist.
     If iron pyrites and cobaltine could be rendered transparent,
they would be found to have one optical axis that coincides with
their hexagonal axis.
     I am   here reminded that Sir David Brewster recognized bo
racite    forty-one    years ago, as having one optical axis which co
incided with a hexagonal one.
     It appears very likely that the form of boracite, which has up
to this time been regarded as a trigonal dodecahedron, may not
be a simple form, but a combination of figures with one axis.
I   stated at the above-mentioned meeting of the 17th of January,
that this was my belief; and the measurements which have been
made since that time on some pretty clear crystals, have proved
        I
that was right.
     At first the cube, the pentagonal dodecahedron, and the tetra
hedron gave their proper angles; but            I afterwards found that
though three of the planes on the three-edged angles gave the
proper inclination towards the hexahedral planes for the trigonal
                                                                  l
dodecahedron, and exactly represented              the formula    *. the*
fourth differed materially.                                     -
      The first three gave the angle 144° 44', reckoned according
                     I
 to the formula
                     #;     it ought to  have been  144°44'8"; but the
 fourth gave 144° 17', a difference of 27 minutes: the crystals
 presented     no difficulty to the measurer.
      These figures, therefore, when placed upright on their hexa
 gonal axis, resolve themselves into an acute hemimorphous sea
 lenohedron, and into an obtuse hemimorphous rhombohedron,
 which we will designate as R; this last form is again more ob
                                                               1

                                                               *.    The
  figures of the hemimorphous scalenohedron, and of the trigonal
  prism (the last reminds one of the same form in tourmaline),
  are placed in such a manner round the three hexagonal poles as
 the formula requires, and form # =# of the planes belonging
  to a deltoid icositetrahedron.         The hemimorphous R, on the
  other   hand,   gives  ºr=} of the    planes of another deltoid icosite
  trahedron.       The figures must in this case be held in the same
   way as they were before examined; and the hexahedron or the
   rhombohedron of the rhombic dodecahedron can now be taken as

the general primary form, and the R as the especial primary
form.
   The crystallographer must in future take a hexagonal axis as
the principal one in boracite, as well as in the above-mentioned
pyrites. The value of the form R is easily calculated; from the
angles it contains, it appears that the inclination of the planes
to the principal axis is 70° 59'.

                                       then, we use the formula

are divided into four groups after the old ones:–

   The same analogy which led me to suppose that dioptase had
two optical axes, has also reference to the tungstates of lime,

parent crystals can be obtained, they will be found to have two
optical axes.
   The translator has had a letter from Professor Breithaupt,
wishing him to add the following remarks to this paper.
   “The tungstates of lime show two optical axes beautifully.                                                       I
have measured Hessonite and found the variation to be 12 mi
nutes, while in almandine and melanite it was only 6 minutes.
   “Further, mellite or honeystone shows two optical axes, and
is also very decidedly asymmetrical in the same way as idocrase,
though with a greater difference in    angles.                its

     Schmidtº, in a preliminary notice, states that experiments he
  has made show that these acids are not identical. At the same
  time he describes the action of nitrous acid on sulphanilic acid.
  By this action a new body is formed which crystallizes in needle
  shaped crystals.     It has the formula C*H*N*S*0°, and may
  be regarded as phenylsulphuric acid in the phenyle of which
  two atoms of hydrogen are replaced by two atoms of nitrogen:

with a little water, were shaken in a stoppered bottle for some
time, so as to saturate the ether with hydrochloric acid. When
the solution formed by the decolorization of the chlorophyll by
bases was shaken with this solution, a remarkable change took
place; the ether retained the yellow matter, and the hydro
chloric acid the blue colouring principle.    The two colours were
thus   isolated; but if now alcohol in excess was added, which dis
 solves both the yellow and green colouring matters and their
solvents, the solution became of the original green tint.
    To the yellow matter soluble in ether, Fremy gives the name
phyllowanthine, and to the blue colouring matter the name phyllo
cyanine.     To the other yellow body which results from the change
of  phyllocyanine,  he gives the name phyllowantheine.
      he blue and yellow colouring matters may be obtained
directly from chlorophyll by adding the ether and acid mixture
directly to the alcoholic extract of the leaves. The green first
becomes brown and is then resolved into phyllocyanine, which
dissolves in the acid, and phylloxanthine, which dissolves in the
ether. This interesting experiment may also be made directly
with the leaves.
    Fremy found that the yellow colouring matter formed in the
young shoots is the same as that resulting from the decom
position of chlorophyll.      It may be extracted by alcohol, and
partially resolved into yellow and a little blue colour by means
of hydrochloric acid and ether.       Leaves which become yellow
in  autumn,   then only  contain phylloxanthine.

    Adopting, therefore, the above equation, and applying it to
the seven lines B, C, D, E, F, G, H, we obtain, in Mr. Ponton’s
notation, the following seven equations:—

                              e(h+a+h)= H.
    In these, b, c, &c., B, C, &c. are supposed to be determined
by observation.        We have thus remaining as unknown quanti
ties   e, a,  b, c,  &c. (nine in all), which require to be determined.
    In order to accomplish this, it is necessary to make two addi
tional assumptions. These assumptions are quite arbitrary, and
have no relation to physical science.
    The first of these is made by Mr. Ponton in page 167, where
he assumes as true the following equation:
                    (3B+2C+D)–(F+2G+3H)                   ,
                     (30+2c--d) — (f--2g+3h)            Tº
    An inspection of the        seven equations given above will show
that this assumption implies that the following equality subsists:
    This equation, which is the immediate consequence of Mr.
Ponton’s first assumption, he seems to regard as the general
expression for a law of mature, which he denominates the semel
bis-ter law (see page 172). . The second assumption is also made
in page 167.
    Calling            B+C+D+E+ F-- G+H=S,
it is   assumed that
                       b+   c  + d -- e -- f --  g + h =s,
                                  *T*-a
                                    ze – “.
 An inspection of the same seven equations will show that this
assumption implies that
                      b, + c, --d--e, -kf.--g,--    h, <U+2192>0.
    This consequence of his second assumption appears also to be
 recognized by Mr. Ponton as a law of nature in page 168, where
 it is  said,  “In   every case the motive energy gained by the one
 set of waves is exactly balanced by the loss sustained by the
 others; so that the sums of the positive and negative extrusions
 being each denoted by X, these two quantities are always equal.

. . . . This, which may be called ‘the law of equal transference,’
is first to be recognized; and it is found to prevail in    media,                                all
whether regular     peculiar.”
                            or
  It  thus appears  that Mr. Ponton regards “the law         equal                                     of
transference” and     the semel-bis-ter law

THE      “On the Movements of Liquid Metals and Electrolytes in the
  Voltaic Circuit.”       By George Gore, Esq.
      1. It has long been known that when a globule or layer of pure
  and clear mercury is placed upon a smooth mon-metallic surface, a
  watch-glass for example, and covered to a small depth with a watery
  electrolyte, sulphuric acid in particular, and two terminal platinum
  wires from a voltaic battery are dipped into the electrolyte, one on
  each side of the globule, the mercury makes a movement towards
...the negative wire, and a rapid and continuous stream of the super
  natant liquid flows from the negative to the positive electrode over
  the surface of the mercury, and back again by the sides of the con
  taining vessel.     Also that when a small drop of a watery electrolyte,
  especially sulphuric acid, is placed upon the surface of pure and dry
  mercury, the latter connected with the negative pole of a battery,
  and a platinum wire from the other pole momentarily immersed in
  the electrolyte, the drop of liquid is suddenly repelled and spreads
  over the surface of the mercury.
     2. These phenomena have been examined by Herschel”, Erman,
  H. Davy, Runge, Pfaff, and otherst, and some of the results have
  been recorded in the 1st volume of ‘Gmelin’s Handbook of Che
  mistry, page 486 (published by the Cavendish Society); but no
  definite cause of the movements seems to have been discovered.
  Herschel has, however, shown that the continuous movement of the
  supernatant liquid is unaffected by the approach of strong magnets,
  and that it is influenced by the chemical nature of the electrolyte;
  also that      its
                  direction    notably influenced
                                     is                   the presence by  vari          of
  ous metallic impurities        the mercury.

 A           of Newton's fusible
        portion                    alloy was melted under a layer 4th of
an inch deep of a solution of chloride of zinc, and the ends of the
platinum wires from the battery immersed in the supernatant liquid
until the alloy cooled and solidified; the zinc solution flowed from
the negative towards the positive wire as long as the surface of the
alloy remained in the liquid state, and ceased to flow immediately the
surface of the metal solidified.      Also a drop of a strong solution of
caustic  potash   placed   upon  the melted fusible alloy, the latter con
nected with the     negative  pole and the former with the positive pole,
exhibited the usual     momentary     repulsions as long as the surface of
the alloy remained fluid.               I
                               therefore conclude that both the substances
must be in a liquid state.

 mersed in the supernatant liquid; a steady negative flow occurred in
 each case.    2nd. Cadmium was similarly treated under fused cyanide
 of  potassium,  and a positive flow obtained.       3rd. Cadmium, lead,
 Britannia-metal, and fusible metal were melted separately, small pieces
 of cyanide of potassium placed upon them and melted, the metal con
 nected with the megative platinum wire, and the positive wire dipped
 into the melted cyanide; positive repulsions took place with each
 metal on making contact.                  I
                                   conclude from these experiments that
 the power of rotating under the influence of an electrolytic currentis
 a general property of metals and alloys when in a liquid state.
    11. That the mass or body of the metal is not essential to the
 production of the movements, is evident from the fact that the move
 ments have been readily obtained with thin layers of mercury upon
 amalgamated zinc (7) and copper plates.
    12. I have endeavoured to obtain the movements without the
 presence of an electrolyte, by passing an electric current through a
 small globule of zinc fused upon the surface of bismuth, but the
 ready mingling of the melted metals, and their rapid oxidation, pre
vented a reliable experiment being made.
    13. It has already been shown, in the instances of fused salts upon
 melted metals (10), that the presence of water is not a necessary
 condition of the phenomena.
    14. The power of producing the movements is a general property
 of electrolytes as well as of liquid metals; I have experimentally
 found it in the following classes of substances:—organic           and in
 organic acids; water; aqueous solutions of caustic alkalies*; alkaline
 carbonates, bicarbonates, borates, hypophosphites, phosphates, sul
 phides, hyposulphites, sulphites, sulphates, bisulphates, iodides, bro
 mides, chlorides, chlorates, nitrates, and silicates; salts of alkaline
 earths and of alumina; salts of tungsten, molybdenum, chromium,
uranium, manganese, arsenic, and of the malleable heavy metals; also
 with fused salts, aqueous solutions of organic salts, and solutions of
salts, in alcohol.    The salts of tungsten, molybdenum, chromium,
uranium, and manganese, generally gave the weakest and most
variable results; whilst sulphuric acid and solutions of alkaline
cyanides yielded very strong and definite movements.              In feeble
cases of motion the    globule  of mercury  should be   placed in a narrow
porcelain boat, and a strong solution of the substance added until
the metal is only covered at         sides with the liquid

a thin layer of it is requisite (15): the electric current must pass
from the electrolyte into the metal, or vice versd (16), but need not
pass both into and out of it by the electrolyte (17); the electrodes
are not essential (18); the movements are not electro-magnetic (19),
they are dependent upon the quantity of the electric current (20),
and are intimately connected with electro-chemical action (21); the
movements of the metal and electrolyte are mutually dependent (22),
and the momentary movements are of the same nature as the con
tinuous ones (23).

         B. Conditions of the continuance of the Movements.
     26. With regard to the continuance of the movements:—1st.
In some cases the metal becomes covered with an insoluble film,
produced by ordinary chemical action of the liquid, which prevents
the continuance of the action; this occurs particularly with mercury
in strong solutions of sulphides, iodides, bromides, and chlorides.
2nd. If the positive wire is connected with the mercury and the
negative wire with the liquid previous to placing both the wires in
the electrolyte, films are in nearly                        all
                                       cases instantly produced (but
not with strong sulphuric acid) and interfere with further action;

   the solution, and       many such cases the mercury creeps
                                 in                                      pecu                 in  a

than those of the electrolyte : the movements of the liquid are best
observed by means of charcoal or asphaltum (5), and those of the
mercury by the aid of a few parallel scratches upon the under sur
face of the watch-glass.
    29. The directions of flow of the metal and liquid are intimately de
pendent upon each other, for in every instance the metal moves in an
opposite direction to the electrolyte (see also 22); and in those cases
 where two opposite flows of the liquid towards the centre of the vessel
 occur (as with a solution of sulphate of potash), the globule of
 mercury is elongated at both ends into a pointed shape, and           two                           its
 ends point toward the two electrodes,                            its
                                                  largest diameter being

 its acutest apex under the strongest flow. The relation between the
 metal and liquid     apparently
                       is              dual    polar character, the move

the act of deposited substances dissolving in the mercury, for they
occur equally well whether hydrogen gas is set free and escapes or
alkali-metal is deposited and dissolves in the mercury, until in the
latter case the diminished mobility of the globule interferes with the
result.
   33. Considerable difficulty was experienced in examining liquids
by the second method, in consequence of the rapid and in many cases
instantaneous oxidation or filming of the metallic globule; but by
using very dilute liquids and immersing the negative wire from
seventy-two small Smee's elements during only a moment at a time,
this difficulty was in most cases sufficiently overcome to allow di
stinct starts of the mercury to occur in the particular direction

metallic globule upon the movements obtained by the 1st method, in
the following manner. The globule of mercury was first connected
with the positive pole and the liquid with the negative pole for about
ten seconds, and then the wires placed as in method l ; a temporary
negative flow was produced for a few moments with certain liquids,
apparently in consequence of the mercury absorbing a minute portion
of an electro-negative constituent of the solution (?), and that sub
stance causing a negative flow in the succeeding operation until the
whole of it was redissolved. The following liquids exhibited this
phenomenon of reversion :-very dilute solutions of nitric acid, nitrates
of ammonia, potash, soda, baryta, 'strontia (not of magnesia, appa
rently on account of viscosity of the mercury being produced), lime,
zinc, lead, cobalt, nickel, copper, and dioxide of mercury; also
sulphates of ammonia and potash; hypophosphite and diphosphate
of soda; and, strongest, the alkaline nitrates;–but not dilute solu
tions of caustic potash, soda, baryta, or lime; carbonates or bi
carbonates of potash or soda; carbonate of baryta; chlorides of
ammonium, potassium, sodium, barium, strontium, magnesium, or
calcium; iodide or bromide of potassium; sulphites of potash or
soda; biborate, hyposulphite, or sulphate of soda; sulphate of
lime; arsenic acid; cyanide of potassium ; oxalate of ammonia. The
battery used was a series of 72 small Smee's elements. It appears
from these experiments, that the direction of flow obtained by im
mersing the positive wire in the electrolyte and the negative one in
the globule is strongly influenced by the chemical composition of
the metallic globule.
    42. The chemical nature of the globule exercises an equally
powerful influence upon the direction of the movements obtained b
the second method. If the mercury was first connected with the me
gative wire and the solution with the positive wire for a few seconds,
and then the connexions reversed or made as in method 2, a temporary
and strong positive flow of the electrolyte for a few moments was
 obtained, apparently in consequence        of the mercury absorbing a
little alkali-metal or other electro-positive constituent of the liquid,
 and that substance causing a positive flow of the solution until the
 whole of it was redissolved.     This positive flow did not occur while
 there was above a certain    quantity of the alkali-metal in the mercury.
 The reversions were obtained in the following liquids:–dilute and
 strong solutions of caustic potash; weak solutions of caustic soda,
 baryta, and lime; carbonate of baryta; chlorides of potassium,
 sodium, barium, strontium (not of magnesium, owing to viscosity
 of the globule), and calcium; iodide and bromide of potassium;
 sulphites of potash and soda; biborate, hyposulphite, and sulphate
 of soda; sulphate of lime; arsenic acid; cyanide of potassium; and
 oxalate of ammonia; also in solutions of hypophosphite and diphos
 phate of soda;-but not in very dilute mitric acid, nitrates of am
 monia, potash, soda, baryta, strontia, magnesia, lime, uranium, zinc,
 cobalt, nickel, copper, or dioxide of mercury; sulphates of ammonia,
 potash, or alumina.     It is worthy of notice that these two series are
 almost precisely the reverse of those named with method 1 (41);
 i.e. those liquids which have the property of reversing the flow of

one method have not that property with the other method, except
hypophosphite and diphosphate of soda. The explanation suggested
(34), of the      cause of the true movements of methods 1 and 2 does
 not appear applicable to these phenomena of reversion.
    43. Herschel has shown that with pure mercury in solutions of
 alkalies or of sulphate of soda (vide Gmelin's ‘Handbook,’i. 490,492),
if a little alkali-metal be introduced into the globule by connecting
 the latter for a few moments with the negative wire (the other wire
being in the solution), a positive flow occurs on placing both the
wires in the electrolyte with the mercury between them, and con
 tinues until      all
                     the alkali-metal      redissolved; and that similar effects

frequently with mercury into which some alkali-metal has been
deposited.
     46. The general phenomena of the movements may be briefly
redescribed thus:—A. When both the wires are in the electrolyte,
and the mercury between them, several cases occur : 1. With a
strongly alkaline liquid, a positive flow of the solution from the
positive wire over the mercury to the negative wire occurs; 2. With
a strongly acid liquid, a negative flow of the solution takes place;
and 3. With a solution of a neutral or slightly alkaline salt, espe
cially of a salt composed of a strong acid and a strong base, two
flows occur, a negative one from the negative wire towards the centre
of the mercury, and a positive one from the positive wire towards
the centre of the mercury,              the negative one being generally the
 strongest.       If in this 3rd case the mercury contains any impurity,
 or if a substance be caused by any means to dissolve in the mercury,
 the movements are notably affected: an electro-positive substance
 (zinc, alkali-metal, &c.) increases the positive flow so as partly or
 completely to overpower the negative movement; and an electro
 negative substance increases the negative flow, in a few instances, so
 as to overpower the positive movement.                   These influences are also
 frequently detectable when liquids are used of alkaline or acid reac
 tion, as in cases 1 and 2.
     B. When the negative wire is in the mercury and the positive
 one in the liquid, two cases occur : 1. With pure mercury, the

   The following communication was read:—
   “Outline of the Geology of part of Venezuela and of Trinidad.”
By G. P. Wall, Esq.
   The district examined by Mr. Wall extends from the 8th degree
north latitude to the sea, and eastward of the 69th meridian.            It
includes the Serranía (as the mountainous       region  is termed) and the
Llanos or plains to the south. The Serranía is a portion of the
Littoral Cordillera, and is continuous with the main ridge of the
Andes; to the east it extends into the northern part of Trinidad.
   The most ancient rocks in Venezuela consist of mica-schists and
gneiss, and compose the author's “Caribbian Group,” so called on
account of these rocks forming for a great distance the southern
boundary of the Caribbean Sea. This term was previously adopted
for the same series of mountain-rocks in Trinidad, where their
eastward extension had been already studied.         These strata consist
of—1st, a series of micaceous and siliceous schists, various in aspect
and constitution; 2ndly, sandstones, coarse and micaceous, fine
grained and without mica; 3rdly, shales, ferruginous, micaceous,
and carbonaceous.
   These schistose rocks are highly distorted.         In the western por
tion of the district they have a breadth of about 30 miles, and rise
to the height of 8000 feet; to the east they form lower ridges and
a narrower belt.     They are interlaminated with numerous irregular
bands of   quartz.   Evidence is not wanting of the segregation of the
quartz having been subsequent to the formation of the strata, but
previous to the disturbances that the schists have undergone.
   White and blue limestones, generally crystalline, but sometimes
compact, occur in the schists in Venezuela, but still more abundantly
in Northern Trinidad. Some of the schists are granatiferous; and,
from the presence of smaragdite, they sometimes form an eklogite.
   Gneiss also is present, and is markedly interstratified with the
mica-schists.    The transition is occasionally gradual; but more
usually it is sudden and abrupt. The gneiss sometimes assumes
the irregular structure of granite, but is still distinctly bedded.      It

is occasionally auriferous.   Very small proportions of copper-ores
and argentiferous galena exist in some localities
   The Serranía also comprises another great group of strata, flanking
the “Caribbian * rocks on the south, and in the eastern district
rising to a height of more than 7000 feet, with a breadth of from
30 to 40 miles. These consist of sandstones, fossiliferous limestones,
and shales; and form the group provisionally termed “Older
Parian” by the author, from the circumstance of          occurring on          its
the shores of the Gulf of Paria.  In Trinidad       traced as narrowit   is              a
belt across the island.
   Alternating with the sandstones and limestones are thick beds

have been intensely disturbed.      Though the fossils can rarely                                       be
separated from the matrix, yet some were fortunately obtained from
near Cumaná, -namely, Trigoniae and small Gasteropoda. Mr.
Etheridge, F.G.S., suggests that most probably they indicate                                            a
Lower Cretaceous age. These Lower Parian rocks extend west
ward into New Granada; and are probably related          the Neocomian         to
rocks  of Bogotá.

Parian strata are often interstratified and alternate with rocks of
igneous origin.    The base       these pyrogenic rocks varies from

 enough to form eddies, or the liquid behind the obstacle comes to
 rest, and these are stationary and almost immoveable points.
    These are good conditions for the formation of ice at the bottom
 of rivers. The eddying motion produced by obstacles brings cold
 water to the bottom and cools the sides; and the molecules of water
 behind the obstacle exert their adhesive force and crystallize.      But
 to produce these effects an intense and continuous cold is necessary.
    In conclusion, the author attributes the formation of ground-ice to
 obstacles in the current, which on the one hand, by the eddying
 motion, cause the water below 0° to sink to the bottom and cool the
 sides, and on the other hand produce stationary parts in which the
 crystallizing power can exert                               its

1.         their communication which appeared in the August
     IN   Number of this Magazine, Professors Kirchhoff and
                                                                   .
Bunsen have furnished us with some very interesting and
important facts regarding the spectra of different kinds of flame:
the following is one of these:—
   “It  appears,” they say (while describing the effect produced
upon flame-spectra by the presence of small quantities of metals
or bodies containing metals), “that the alteration of the bodies
with which the metals employed were combined, the variety in
the nature of the chemical processes occurring in the several
flames, and the wide differences of temperature which these
flames exhibit, produce no effect upon the position of the bright
lines in the spectrum which are characteristic of each metal.”
   2. Now when the particles of the body which mingle with
 and characterize the flame are exceedingly divided, we may with
 much probability (as far as the quality of the radiated light is
concerned) regard them as ultimate particles or molecules: the
spectra exhibited will then afford us the means of approximately
ascertaining what kind of light the molecules of certain sub
stances give out when heated.      It thus appears that we have
grounds for supposing that the ultimate particles of different
substances which possess in common some characterizing metallic
element, give out the same quality of light when introduced into
flame.
   3. It becomes interesting to know if we have any means of
detecting a similar property of bodies (should such exist) having

170       Mr. B. Stewart                    on the Radiative Powers                         of Bodies    with
reference to radiant heat rather than to radiant                                             light—if    we can
by any method ascertain whether there are bodies the particles
of which give out the same quality of heat at the same tempera
ture.    A law which flows from Prevost’s theory of exchanges, as
proved by the author in a paper published in the last volume of
the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, affords, it
is believed, a method of ascertaining this fact.
   4. This law asserts that when a number of bodies exist in an
enclosure at a uniform and constant temperature, the heat ab
sorbed by any particle is equal to that emitted by it; and that
this equality subsists with regard to every individual description
of heat which goes to form the heterogeneous                                                 radiation of that
temperature.                     -
    5. Let us now suppose two plates M and N, composed of two
different substances more or less diathermanous, to be hung up
side by side in such an enclosure of which the temperature is=t;
and for the sake of simplicity we may conceive the walls of the
enclosure to be covered with lampblack, a substance which
radiates, but which does not reflect heat.           Let us also suppose
that the refractive indices of the two plates are the same, or nearly
 so; and finally,                at let
                         limit our consideration          those rays which              to
enter each plate      right angles  us       surface.         may to   its
                                                                      shown                  It         be
that the same quantity         heat will flow through the substance
                                                of
of  each plate.

   Now the quantity of heat An absorbed by the first elementary
slice of M = Amamör, and for N this is = Amb,8t'.    Hence from
(3) it follows that the quantity of the heat An absorbed by an
elementary slice of M is equal to that absorbed by a similar
slice of N. Hence the quantity of heat Am which is absorbed in
passing through a thickness of M=t is equal to that which is
absorbed in passing through a thickness of N=T'; and the same
equality subsists with respect to any other description of heat
which forms part of the heterogeneous radiation of the tempe
rature t.
    Hence it follows that, with the above relations between the
thicknesses of the plates, the portion of lampblack heat of the
temperature t which passes the one plate is equal in quality as
well as quantity to that which passes the other.
    10. It thus appears that if there are bodies of which the ulti
mate particles or very thin plates radiate the same quality of heat
at the temperature t, and if such thicknesses of these bodies be
taken that they           all
                         pass the same proportion                          of
                                                            the incident heat
for   any   one  ofthe  rays  which   compose    the  heterogeneous      radia
tion   of  that temperature, then they will also pass the same pro
portion for any other          these rays.

   “One-tenth of a grain of common salt, carefully weighed in a
balance indicating rinth of a grain, was dissolved in 5000 grains
of distilled water. Two perfectly similar slips of platinum-foil
were then carefully ignited by the Bunsen lamp until they ceased
to tinge the flame with yellow light; for to obtain the total
absence of yellow light is apparently impossible.      One of the
slips was dipped into the solution of salt, and the other into                                       di
stilled water, the quantity of the solution adhering to the slip
being considerably less than gºth of a grain, and both slips were
held over the lamp until the water had evaporated.     They were
then simultaneously introduced into opposite sides of the flame,
when the slip which had been dipped into the solution of salt
invariably communicated, to a considerable portion of the flame,
a bright yellow light, easily distinguishable from that caused by
the slip which had been dipped into pure water.         It is thus
proved that a portion of chloride of sodium weighing less than
fººth     of a grain, is able to tinge a flame with bright yellow
light; and as the equivalent weights of sodium and chlorine are
23 and 35.5, it follows that a quantity of sodium not exceeding
smººth of a    troy grain renders        presence      its

it refers to my brother M. Henri St.-Claire Deville, who has been
able to obtain enormous temperatures by other methods than
those of M. Gaudin.
     Imay be further permitted to mention, in reference to the
historical part of the question, that I was the first to show that
quartz-glass has a density of 2:22, which is therefore 0:17 lower
than that of the crystalline quartz from which it is derived.
     Iinsist upon this fact; for it is by no means isolated. For
         its

                the properties which sulphur assumes under these
conditions.

    Slow cooling, or to speak more generally, a slow and gradual
mode of formation, allows the molecules to become associated
under circumstances in which each takes with it the normal
quantity of heat; from this a stable equilibrium results, at any
rate under the actual conditions of temperature. In the case of
sulphur, for example, octahedral or normal sulphur is formed of
2:07 spec. grav., which is quite stable at ordinary temperatures;
while the two others, soft or vitreous sulphur and insoluble
sulphur, become more or less transformed into octahedral sulphur,
either spontaneously or by simple actions of contact.
    It must also be added that the fourth condition, prismatic
sulphur, whether prepared by fusion, or crystallized from a
hot solution of ether, alcohol, chloroform, or benzole, &c., cor
responds to a condition in which the molecules, although
possessing more heat than the normal quantity, maintain their
equilibrium a certain time, and are then rapidly changed below
a certain temperature.        But the curious part of this        that this                   is,
temperature         not constant, but varies with the nature
                       is                                               the                             of

 provided that the liquid, heated at least to 80 degrees, undergoes
 a sudden cooling.
     Without further insisting on these ideas, which more and
 more confirm my researches made during the last fifteen years,
 may they not be applied to the consideration of the subject which
 H. Rose has treated in his memoir : As he justly remarks,
 the capital fact is that which results from a research of M. Schaff
 gotsch 4 in 1846; that is to say, that quartz in             natural                    its

of eruptivity in               the manner      of sulphur, at the limit of which we
find the mineral waters and their sources.        But these experi
ments do not  directly apply,  in my  opinion, to the case in which
quartz, like that of the granites, is a substance eruptive in the
manner of the lavas.     For the silica obtained by these philoso
phers has always been crystallized; and it is superfluous to show
that it would be false to assume that crystallized silica could not
be obtained in any other way.
   Supported by the possible and even probable superfusion of
quartz, M. Fournet has endeavoured to explain how that this
body in a great many cases, more especially in granite, solidified
after other substances which were more fusible than itself. From
well-known facts, M. Elie de Beaumont has shown” that there
was nothing improbable in such a hypothesis. If Mr. Faraday,
working with small quantities and under unfavourable conditions,
could retard the solidification of sulphur by nearly 100 degrees
(its fusing-point being 109°), what is there astonishing in the
assumption that quartz, which perhaps melts at 2000 to 2500
degrees, could be maintained in the soft state as low as 1000 to
 1200 degrees, and that under conditions which must be assumed
to be favourable?                  I
                       will add that M. Fournet’s opinion, which,

    Rose himself, who first presented this objection, does not seem
                         any considerable value; for        addst,        may                 he                “It

is a very singular and complicated equilibrium, an idea of
which may in some measure be obtained if we represent it
by a certain number of indeterminate equations, for the solu
tion of which one condition is wanting.              But this condition
must be sought for in the study of the phaenomena of igneous
fusion.
     M. Rose justly recommends geologists not to advance, without
weighty and powerful motives, hypotheses which are in contra
diction with the known laws of chemistry.                 But may not
geologists well recommend chemists, who bring to these difficult
questions the aid of their special knowledge, to submit their
solutions to the control of natural facts?           However ingenious
these solutions may be, whatever support they may find in
laboratory experiments, the first and indispensable condition of
their adoption by a naturalist would be their agreement with
 observed facts.
     But there are fundamental analogies, which no geologist since
 Hutton has refused to recognize, between the oldest granite and
 the most recent eruptive rocks, the volcanic lavas.        This will be
 readily admitted by any one who has seen, or has even merely
 read a description of a flow of Vesuvius or Etna, of the amphi
 genic or doleritic veins of the Somma or of the Wal del Bove;
 the trap-dykes and melaphyr of Scotland or of the Palatinate;
 the Elvan of Cornwall; the quartziferous porphyry of Saxony or
 of Morvan; lastly, some of the granitic veins so frequently met
 with in the latter places, and in innumerable others.
     It is true that these general analogies of formation, the
 establishment of which was one of the triumphs of the end of
 the last century, do not amount to an absolute similitude: the
 mineral elements, for example, vary from one group of rocks to
 another. The presence of quartz, especially, has not been observed
 in any true flow of lava, but it exists in the trachytes of the
  Siebengebirge and of Mont-Dore:               I
                                             have found it in the dole
  ritic rocks of Guadaloupe; some considerable tracts of this latter
 island, and of Martinique, are covered with a reddish earthy crust
 which is full of innumerable fragments of transparent quartz,
 arising, like  it,  from the decomposition          of
                                                 the volcanic rocks.   It
 likewise occurs with Labradorite          the doleritic trachyte which
                                           in

most abundant element of these deposits.    It constitutes, so to

under the same circumstances.                               An ordinary wave is therefore
essentially different from the other; and the difference between
them may be made to rest on the properties here pointed out.
The second kind of wave is not and cannot be a wave of the
first kind. They may also be distinguished by this property—
that the length of a wave of the ordinary kind is always greater,
and that of a wave of the minute kind always less, than          -

distance between two       particles of the air.
    17. Equation (11) shows that for any value of v there is a
corresponding value of k; but as in the preceding investigations
k was taken to be essentially positive, the only admissible values
of v are those which                     lie

190                        The Rev. S. Earnshaw on the
bility, and if the genesis should be so managed as to begin from
k=0, and to be capable of changing to fresh values of k, then,
from the beginning, sounds corresponding to parts of the curves
CB and CD about C would be heard together; but as the
genesis  went on, the sounds corresponding to the curve CB
would get less and less intense, and those corresponding to CD
more and more intense; and the former would gradually become
inaudible, and the latter too loud to be borne. Those corre
sponding to A B, if perceived at all, would be most sensible for
parts near to B.
   23. Hence the portions both of C B and CD which are appli
cable to the hearing powers of human beings are very limited,
and begin from C in both cases.       But it has been supposed by
Wollaston that the Grylli take up the faculty of hearing where
we lay it down; and there may be animals which take it up
where the Grylli lay it down; and it is thus conceivable that the
whole curve C B is portioned out among different orders of ani
mals from man to the minutest insect.       But the curve A B, for
the reason  pointed  out in art. 16, may not belong to waves which
affect the organ of hearing at all, but may appeal to some other
sense, of which we are probably not possessed, but which is
suited to the wants of the minute creatures which the micro
scope has difficulty in revealing.
                          The Analogy              of Sound      and Light.
   24.    It   is admitted on experimental grounds that a certain
degree    of analogy exists between sound and light; and it has
been considered    allowable to consider the latter as being due to
the undulations of an elastic medium consisting of particles
separated by finite intervals.     Hence the preceding investigations
and  results, after the  necessary  alteration of numerical constants,
will apply  to the aethereal medium.         There is therefore a maxi
mum limit to the number of free vibrations which the particles
of the aethereal medium can execute per second; and every num
ber from zero to this limit is possible. For this medium also, as
for air, there are two types of wave-disturbance—the circular
and the exponential; and three distinct classes of waves, corre
sponding to three different velocities of transmission for every
value of k. There             fact, is, triplicity
                                          in           light; and every

me of attempting the photographic representation of the solar
disc as it appeared from this station under the several phases of

photographic surfaces were usually employed, for the chemical
and visual foci had previously been ascertained to be very nearly
coincident. The aperture of the object-glass was now stopped
down until, with a diaphragm of 25 inch, the exposure to the
powerful action of direct sunlight was rendered manageable; and
in order to secure an easy and sufficiently rapid means of opening
and closing this small aperture, a card of about 6 inches square

 graphy (non-commissioned officers, Royal Artillery) were found
 extremely     valuable in conducting the fixing and subsequent
 operations, taking from my hands the plate immediately after the
 development of the picture.
     In viewing the photographs thus produced, it may be stated
 that several of them exhibit very clearly the position of the solar
 spots, and that in many cases the lunar mountains are to be seen
 sharply defined against the bright face of the sun. A passing
 cloud rendered the “first contact” so imperfectly visible that no
 opportunity for opening the camera was presented; but the plate
 representing the moment of maximum obscuration, and the phases
 both immediately preceding and following, are fortunately amongst
 the most successful of our photographic results; and further, on
 comparing the present series with the disc of the sun taken at
 the period of the former eclipse, March 15th, 1858, in precisely
 the same apparatus, the diminished size of the image consequent
 on the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit is very strikingly exhibited.
                                I
     As a concluding remark, beg to call attention to the unusual
 magnitude of a group of spots visible upon the sun's disc on the
 9th instant. They were readily seen without the assistance of
 the telescope, as a dark patch situated rather low in the southern
 hemisphere.      I  have succeeded in securing three concordant
 photographic proofs representing their appearance at noon and a
 little later, which, besides exhibiting the principal group as an
 aggregate of dark spots disposed generally in a horizontal line,
 indicate likewise the position of several smaller ones irregularly
 distributed over the face of the sun, and only visible with optical
 aid. It cannot be said that any distinct indications of faculae
 are afforded by these or the other photographs taken on the
occasion of the eclipse.

         XXV.     On the Thickness of the Crust of the Earth.
By    the Venerable   JoHN HENRY PRATT, Archdeacon of Calcutta.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
 I
       GENTLEMEN,
                     I
      ADMIT that did use the principle pointed out by Professor
       Jellett in the note to his communication in your May
Number, and in so doing was wrong; and therefore the part of
my argument against Professor Haughton's investigation in the
Irish Transactions, which depends upon that step, falls to the
                                                                    -
ground.
    But this does not affect the objection which I brought forward
in two of my communications (May 1859, p. 329, and October

                             the Crust         of the Earth.                      195
 1859, p. 259), viz. that his investigation does not concern the
question of fluidity and solidity, but only of densities.
    Even if Professor Haughton knew the law of density of the
fluid nucleus, and also knew every circumstance regarding the
solid portions of which the crust is composed, excepting only the
total thickness, his equations would not give any information
regarding that thickness.       The constants involved in the ex
pression for the law of the fluid density (which must be two at
least, except in the impossible case of homogeneity) would still
be arbitrary; and his three equations (the two appertaining to
the outer and inner surfaces of the crust, and the third given by
the value of the mean density) would involve at least four un
known quantities. The expression for the thickness would
thus come out a function of one or more arbitrary constants, on
which the density of the fluid nucleus depends. The greater this
density the greater must be the thickness, and vice versd. The
problem, in fact, which Professor Haughton's equations would
solve is this: if the materials of the earth follow one or more
known laws of density (for the density of the crust may be dis
continuous) down to a certain depth, and another known law
below that to the centre, what must that depth be that the total
mass may be what we know the earth's mass and dimensions to
be      He introduces no physical principle into the problem
characteristic of the different properties of a solid and fluid
mass, such a principle as that which Mr. Hopkins introduces,
viz. that the fluid parts pressing against the solid shell give it a
precessional motion, which is a matter for external observation
and measurement; or such a principle as this (which would
suffice if experiment had determined the law), viz. the relation
between pressure and temperature which serve just to produce
solidity.   Professor Haughton treats the question more mathe
matically than physically.       He shows that without an exact
knowledge of the laws we cannot have an exact solution.          But
 this we knew before as a matter of    course, and it did not require
Laplace’s analysis to prove              it.

                              to    be

                         has described a new hydrocarbon. He calls it
         acetylene, or  quadricarburetted    hydrogen.      It has the for
mula    C*H*,    and is the  prototype  of the  hydrocarbons     Cº. H”.
     Acetylene is produced whenever olefiant gas, alcohol vapour,
 ether, aldehyde, or even wood-spirit are passed through a red
 hot tube. It is also formed when chloroform acts upon copper
 at a red heat: it is contained in illuminating gas.           Ether yields
 it in largest quantity.                                                    -
     In order to obtain it pure, it is formed into a compound with
 subchloride of copper.        This compound is identical with a red
 detonating body obtained by passing the gases arising from the
 decomposition of alcohol by the electric spark or by heat, into an
 ammoniacal solution of subchloride of copper.           It was discovered
 by M. Quet, and examined by M. Böttger; but neither of these
 chemists analysed the gas which is liberated when this body is
 treated with hydrochloric acid. This gas is acetylene.
     It is a colourless gas, somewhat soluble in alcohol, with a cha
 racteristic disagreeable odour.        It burns with a very luminous
 fuliginous flame.       Mixed with    chlorine,  it detonates almost    in
 stantaneously, with deposition of carbon, even in diffused light.
 It cannot be liquified. Its density is 0.92. Its formula, C*H*,
 corresponds to four volumes.

  It  combines with bromine, with sulphuric acid, with the ele
ments of water, and with hydrogen, to form derivatives parallel
to those of olefiant gas.
  Acetylsulphuric acid is formed like ethylsulphuric acid, when the
gas is agitated for a long time with concentrated sulphuric acid.
The mixture, saturated with carbonate of baryta, filtered and
evaporated, yields crystallized acetylsulphate of baryta.       the                      If
mixture is distilled instead of being saturated, a peculiar liquid
is obtained somewhat more volatile than water, very alterable
and endowed with a peculiar odour, and soluble in 10 to 15
parts of water.    It is acetylic alcohol, C*H*O°.
   Acetylene may be changed into olefiant gas by causing the
nascent hydrogen produced by the action of zinc on ammonia to
act upon the compound of acetylene and copper.         The olefiant
gas thus formed is mixed with hydrogen and a little acetylene,

   Berthelotº has effected the direct synthesis of iodide of ethyle.
A thin sealed tube containing about 20 cubic centims. of a satu
rated solution of hydriodic acid, is introduced into a long-necked
globe of about a litre capacity; the globe is filled with dry ole
fiant gas and hermetically sealed. The tube in the inside is then
broken, and the flask heated for fifty hours to                            a   temperature
of 100°.
  The flask is then opened, the contents treated with a solution
of potash; the product, washed, dried, and rectified, yields
about 4 grims. of pure iodide of ethyle.
   M. Cahours           has   publishedt an extended memoir on organo
metallic radicals.            We can only find space for a few of the more
interesting results.
   When iodide of ethyle acts on alloys of tin and sodium con

formed, mixed with a large quantity of an irritating          smelling          oil

Frankland and Buckton.       It is not a radical, for it does not
unite directly either with oxygen, chlorine, or iodine.    Cahours
describes a number of the salts of the owide of  stanethyle, which
is obtained by decomposing iodide of stanethyle by ammonia.
They are mostly obtained by directly combining the base and

    Magnesethyle.—Magnesium filings are placed in a long glass
tube with iodide of ethyle. The reaction set up is moderated by
cold water, the tube then sealed before the blowpipe, and heated
for some time to 120° or 130°.
    The crude product in the tube is distilled in an inert gas; and
after suitable rectification, a colourless liquid with an alliaceous
odour is obtained, which takes fire in the air, and decomposes
water with violence: at the same time the hydrocarbon C*H”
is obtained.    It decomposes into C*H* and C*H*.

stilled in hydrogen, is colourless, and possesses an odour like
turpentine; it fumes in the air, and decomposes water with
 violence, producing alumina, hydriodic acid, and a gas which
burns with a pale blue flame.      It boils between 340° and 350°C.
    The formula of this   body  is Cl*H*Al4I*=A1*I*,      Ale(C4H4)3.
 It takes fire spontaneously in oxygen and in chlorine. It is
 energetically attacked by zincethyle, yielding an inflammable
 liquid which is probably aluminethyle.
    Iodide of methyle attacks aluminium in a similar manner.
 Glucinum appears to have the same comportment.

that chloride of zinc acted with considerable      energy  on gly

chloride of calcium, an insoluble etherial layer rose to the sur
face, which, when dried and rectified, was found to boil at 110°.
It is polymeric with aldehyde and oxide of ethylene:       vapour                     its

boils at 100°, disengaging hydrochloric acid gas, and the tem
perature gradually rises to 190°, when nothing but a black
residue is left. The distillate between 140° and 148° consists
mainly of a chlorinated derivative of valerianic aldehyde,
Gº Hº Cl* 9. It forms a crystallized compound with bisulphite
of soda. No chloride of valeryle, Gº H9Cl6, is produced in the
reaction.
   When chlorine acts upon valeral in the sunlight, the result is
the same; but if the chlorine is in excess, the crystallized com
pound with bisulphite of soda is not obtained.
   Cahours obtained a body, chloramylal, by the action of chlo
rine upon amylic alcohol, for which Gerhardt has proposed the
formula C*H* Cl* 9.    Kündig repeated Cahours’ experiments,
and obtained a compound similar to that from valeral.
   Hübner and Geuther have publishedº some investigations on
acroleine. For the preparation of acroleine, 200grims. of glycerine
were treated in a retort of 20 cubic centimetres capacity with 400
grms. of bisulphate of potash.       The product amounted to from
25 to 28  grims. of pure  acroleine.
   When pentachloride of phosphorus is mixed with acroleine, a
brisk action is set up unattended by the disengagement of gas.
The parts boiling below 100° are mixed with water, which precipi
tates a colourless etherial                 oil

mula C14H10O3=C6H4O2,204H8O3.                It is decomposed by
potash into acroleine and acetate of potash.
   When acroleine is treated with bisulphite of soda, a solution
is obtained which does not possess the odour of acroleine.     It
does not disengage acroleine when treated with carbonate of soda,
nor sulphurous acid when treated with sulphuric acid.
   Freund has made a series of experiments+ on the synthesis of
acetone.   By the action of chloride of acetyle on zincethyle, he
obtained a liquid difficultly soluble in water, and with an odour
resembling that of acetone.    The boiling-point was found to be
between 77°5 and 80°-5. When agitated with a concentrated
solution of bisulphite of soda, it became warm and gave a cry
stalline compound.

               PONCELET’S    method of approximately representing
            surd forms, and more particularly the square roots of
homogeneous      quadratic functions by linear functions of the
variables, is given in Crelle's Journal, vol.xiii. 1834, pp. 277–291,
under the title “Sur la Valeur approchée des radicaux.”. By
this method, as applied to two variables, the resultant of two
forces in a plane may be approximately expressed as a linear
function of             its
                   two components,       case fully considered a     M.                         by

within the segment, shall be the least possible.        From this it is
immediately seen to follow, that the portion of the surface cut

    The only real difficulty in extending M. Poncelet's method in
 the manner pursued in the above unpretending study, con
sisted in forming a clear preconception of the mode in which
any given system of limits require for the purpose in view to
be regarded, viz. as enveloped, so to say, in a single condition
 (no wider than absolutely necessary) expressed by a linear equa
tion between the given surd function and the variables which
enter into it.
     I
     may in conclusion just observe that if the relative values of
the variables be limited, not by a system of conditions giving
rise to a polygonal area of limitation, but by a condition ex
pressed by the positivity of a single homogeneous function of
the variables of any degree, the variable point will then be limited
by the intersection of the sphere with a cone, and we should
have to solve a preliminary geometrical problem of circumscribing
a spherical curve by the least possible circle,   a question which                    I
have neither leisure nor inclination to    discuss,  but to which                     I
believe Mr.  Cayley   has paid some attention.
   Before taking final leave of my readers and the subject,                          I
devote a word to the inverse case of Three Rectangular Forces.
This is the case where the resultant and two of the rectangular
components are given, and it is the third component which is to be
expressed linearly in terms of them. In this case an approximate
expression is to be found for V2*—y”—a”, and the geo
metrical locus which replaces the sphere becomes an equi
lateral hyperboloid of revolution of two sheets.
     If
      the variable point be supposed to be limited to a segment of
one sheet of the hyperboloid cut off by the plane Aw--By--C2 = 1,
the discriminant of 2*—y”—a” being 1, and                     its

by means of the equation to a plane drawn through three points
on the hyperboloid, the coordinates      of one of which are found
by writing

     following communication was read:—
THE“On    Vacua as indicated by the Mercurial          Siphon-gauge and
the Electrical  Discharge.”   By      J.
                                     P.  Gassiot,  Esq.,  F.R.S.
   That the varied condition of the stratified electrical discharge is due
to the relative but always imperfect condition of the vacuum through
which it is passed, is exemplified by the changes which take place
in the form of the striae while the potash is heated in a carbonic
acid vacuum-tube.      In order, if possible, to measure the pressure
of the vapour, I had a carefully prepared siphon mercurial gauge
sealed into a tube fifteen inches long, at an equal distance between
the two wires A, B.
   This tube was charged with carbonic acid in the manner described
by me in a former communication. When exhausted by the air-pump
and sealed, it showed a pressure indicated by about 0.5 inch difference
in the level of the mercury; the potash was then heated; the mercury
gradually fell, until it became perfectly level.
   Dr. Andrews (Phil. Mag. February 1852) has shown, that with
a concentrated solution of caustic potassa, he obtained with carbonic
acid a vacuum with the air-pump so perfect as to exercise no ap
preciable tension, as no difference in the level of the mercury in the
siphon-gauge could be detected.
   On trying the discharge in the vacuum-tube after the potash had
cooled, I  found it gave the cloud-like stratifications, with a slight
reddish tinge; consequently not only was the vacuum not perfect,
as denoted by the form of stratification, but in this tube the colour
denotes that even a trace of air remains,—probably that portion in the
narrow part of the siphon-gauge, which, from            its
                                                      position, was not
displaced   bythe carbonic acid.
   The potash was subsequently heated until the discharge was
reduced  to a wave-line, with very narrow striae;       in
                                                     this state moisture
is seen adhering    to
                     the sides    the tube; but even

     The authors, by acting with chloride of benzoyle on sycocerylic
 alcohol, obtained the corresponding benzoate of sycoceryle; and by
 employing chloride of othyle (acetyle), have prepared the acetate of
 sycoceryle which was identical with the original crystalline constituent
 of the resin.
     By treating sycocerylic alcohol with nitric acid, an acid was pro
 cured which appears to be sycocerylic acid.
     The products of the action of chromic acid on sycocerylic alcohol,
were a white crystalline neutral substance and a body crystallizing
in large flat prisms.           The latter appears to be the sycocerylic
 aldehyde.

of nitrogenous acids which are generated by the action of nitrous

in the substitution of one equivalent of nitrogen for three equivalents
of hydrogen in two molecules of the amidic acid.

    Under the influence of various agents these new acids undergo
remarkable changes, amongst which the transformation produced b
the mineral acids deserves to be particularly noticed.                      If the acid
C, H, N, O, be gently heated with strong hydrochloric acid, nitrogen
gas is evolved, the yellow colour of the original acid disappears, and a
red body separates, which may be separated by filtration and purified
by treatment with animal charcoal.                     Both the physical properties
and the   analysis  of the substance thus obtained, prove it to be pure
chlorobenzoic acid.      The hydrochloric mother-liquor on evaporation
deposits crystals of the hydrochlorate of benzamic acid.

    On comparing these coefficients with those found by previous ex
perimenters, we find that they agree very closely in those cases where
commercial metals have been employed.                             But when we come to those
metals which we employed in a pure state, such as lead, tin, zinc,
silver, copper, bismuth, antimony, cadmium, and gold, we find a
marked difference, which we attribute to our experiments having
been made with pure metals; and we are confirmed in this view by
several series of experiments made with impure or commercial
metals.
    We give in our paper several series of experiments which prove

£34                                           Royal Society:—
forth.     Efforts which                  I
                            have made to produce electrometers to
fulfil certain conditions of sensibility, convenience, and constancy,
for various objects, especially the electrostatic measurement of gal
vanic forces, and of the differences of potential required to produce
sparks in air, under definite conditions, and the observation of natural
atmospheric electricity, have enabled me now to make a beginning of
absolute determinations, which                         I
                                    hope to be able to carry out soon in
a much more accurate manner.       In the meantime shall give a slight                     I
description of the chief instruments and processes followed, and state
the approximate results already obtained, as these may be made the
foundation of various important estimates in several departments
of electrical science.
   The absolute electrometer alluded to above, consists of a plain
metallic disc, insulated in a horizontal position, with a somewhat
smaller plane metallic disc hung centrally over      from one end       the         it,                               of
beam      of balance.     metal case protects the suspended disc from
                                  A
currents   of a
             air, and from irregular electric influences, allowing    light                                       a

pended from the balance above,        move     and down freely, through
                                                         to                at

neighbourhood,   will be sufficiently described in another communi
cation to the Royal Society.    Slight descriptions of trial instruments
of this kind have already been published in the Transactions of the
Pontifical Academy of Rome”, and in the second edition of Nichol's
Cyclopaedia (article Electricity, Atmospheric), 1860.
     Ihope soon to have another electrometer on the same general prin
 ciple, but modified from those hitherto made, so as to be more
 convenient for accurate measurement in terms of constant units.
 In the meantime I find, that, by exercising sufficient care, can                                                I
 obtain good measurements by means of the divided ring electro
 meter of the form described in Nichol's Cyclopaedia.
    In the ordinary use of the portable electrometer, a considerable
 charge is communicated to the connected inside coatings of the
Leyden phials, and the aluminium index is brought to an accurately
 marked position by torsion, while the insulated metal case surround
ing it is kept connected with the earth.             The square root of the
reading of the torsion-head thus obtained measures the potential, to
which the inside coatings of the phials have been electrified.                                                         If,
now, the metal case referred                           to

the square root              of
                        the altered reading                              of

paring the indications of the portable electrometer with those of
the divided ring electrometer, and by evaluating those of the latter

duce an electromotive force (or, which is the same thing, a difference
of potentials) equal to that indicated. Hence the attraction between

already supplied Dr. Buckland and others         some extent with ma      to

242                         Geological Society:—
terials for the history of the Cave-period) are in the Carboniferous
Limestone; and, with the exception of that of Spritsail Tor, which
is on the west coast of the peninsula, they all occur between the
Mumbles and the Worm's Head. The most important are “Bacon
Hole,” “Minchin Hole,” “Bosco's Den,” “Bowen's Parlour,”
“Crow Hole,” “Raven's Cliff Cavern,” and lastly the well-known
“Paviland Caves.”      Bone-caves at the Mumbles, in Caswell Bay,
and in Oxwich     Bay   formerly existed; but the sea has destroyed
them.    One cavern named “Ram Tor” between Caswell Bay and
the Mumbles, presumed to be ossiferous, remains unexplored.
   Before proceeding to describe the bone-caves and their contents,
the author briefly noticed a raised beach and talus of breccia, which
Mr. Prestwich had lately traced for a mile along Mewslade Bay,
westward of Paviland; and he pointed out their important relation
ship to the marine sands and overlying limestone-breccia found in
several of the Gower Caves.      Dr. Falconer also referred to Mr.
Prestwich's recent discovery  of some patches of Boulder-clay on the
highland of Gower, and in Rhos Sili Bay.
    “Bacon Hole” was first treated of. It has been worked out by
 Colonel Wood, and described by Mr. Starling Benson.             On the
 limestone-floor of the cave are:—(1) a few inches of marine sand,
 abounding with Litorina rudis, L. litoralis, and Clausilia nigricans,
 with bones of an Arvicola and Birds; (2) a thin layer of stalagmite;
 (3) two feet or less of blackish sand, containing a mass of bones of
 Elephas antiquus, with remains of Meles tarus and Putorius (vul
garis?); (4) one to two feet of ochreous cave-earth, limestone-breccia,
and sandy layers, with remains of Elephas antiquus, Rhinoceros hemi
 tacchus, Hyaena, Canis lupus, Ursus spelatus, Bos, and Cervus; (5)
 irregular stalagmite, partly enveloping a huge tusk of an Elephant
 imbedded below it; (6) limestone-breccia and stalagmite, from 1
 to 2 feet thick, with bones of Ursus and Bos; (7) irregular bed of
 stalagmite, 1 foot or more, with Ursus ; (8) dark-coloured super
ficial earth, kept soppy by abundant drip, with bones of Bos, Cervus,
 Canis vulpes, horns of Reindeer and Roebuck, together with shells
of Patella, Mytilus, Purpura, Litorina (probably brought into the
cavern as food by birds), and also pieces of ancient British pottery.
The marine sand at the bottom of “Bacon Hole” was analogous to
that on the rocky floor of the San Ciro Cave, near Palermo; but
contained fewer species of Mollusca. The uppermost layer of sta
lagmite is about 30 feet above high-water.        The Elephant-remains
belonged to at least three individuals, one of which was adult, and
one young with milk-dentition.                                     -
    “Minchin Hole” is the grandest and most spacious of           allthe
Gower     Caves, being  170 feet  long, by   70 feet where  widest,  and
35   feet high at   the entrance; here the section gave—(1) Loose
limestone-breccia,  3   feet; (2) Yellow cave-earth,   9    inches; (3)
Sand, 1   foot; (4) Blackish sandy loam containing abundant remains
of   Rhinoceros, Elephas, and Bos, 2} feet; (5) Greyish-yellow ma
rine sand, varying                          to feet, and resting on the
                    of in
                        thickness from  1    4
rocky floor. Some        the lower jaws of Rhinoceros from this deposit
exhibit Litorina and comminuted shells imbedded      in   the encrusting

      On the Ossiferous Caves     of the Peninsula of Gower.                243
matrix: and the black sand yielded Helia hispida similarly attached.
In the interior, the cave-earth was thicker, and the black sandy
loam more unctuous.       The mammalian remains were closely analo
gous with those from Bacon Hole; but the Elephant remains (E.
 antiquus) were fewer, and those of Rhinoceros hemitochus were more
numerous and better preserved, including two skulls. No remains
of Elephas primigenius or of Rhinoceros tichorhinus were met with
in Bacon Hole or Minehin Hole.
   “Bosco's Den” is a cavernous fissure, of great interest, between
“Bacon Hole” and “Minchin Hole.” It is about 70 feet high,
and has been worked out by Col. Wood, who, having succeeded in
reaching a hole called (by the quarrymen) “Bacon's Eye,” found it to
be an angular opening (2} feet in diameter) at the top of one of the
great vertical fissures in the limestone, and leading into a fine cavern.
 Beneath it the fissure was filled up with a mass of angular fragments
 of limestone (with bones, teeth, and land shells) impacted in ochreous
loam, about 20 feet in height, resting on a solid platform of breccia,
beneath which the fissure had to a great extent been washed out by
 the sea.   On enlarging the aperture, by undermining the projecting
mass of loam and breccia, a cavity was found extending 76 feet
backwards, with a width of from 7 to 16 feet, and a general height
of about 15 feet. A line of fissure runs along the angle of the roof,
and towards the outer part of the cavern the crack widens into an
irregular flue, which had evidently communicated with the surface:
here the cavern rises to a height of 40 feet. When first opened,
the eastern wall only of the cavern was found to be coated with
stalagmite.    The floor was tolerably smooth, and shelved down gra
dually from the mouth to the extremity, the deposits being thicker
outwards.     The floor having been excavated down to the hard brec
cia, there were observed :-(1) at the top, a bed of sandy peat or
turf, formed chiefly of bits of sticks and comminuted vegetable mat
ter, about 1 foot thick, except under the flue, where it formed a low
conical heap.    In or on this peaty covering were bones of Ox and
Wolf, and bones and broken shed antlers of Deer, of species or
varieties allied to the Reindeer (Cervus Guettardi and Cerv. priscus).
 (2) Stalagmite, regular, but usually less than a foot thick.             At
 one spot it rose into a boss 2    ft.   3in. high, which was found         ina
 shattered condition, the fragments being loose, but still        in  place.
 This must indicate—1st, the operation         ofsome shock since the for
 mation  of  the stalagmite, and even since the peat began              to    be
 formed; and 2ndly, the absence  2 1      drip     in

 to Cervus Guettardi, were collected. The lower chamber was pene
 trated by Col. Wood, Dr. Falconer, and a friend last September, and
 found to have been washed out by the sea to a depth inwards of 31
 feet; and at its extremity they met with a compact mass of marine sand
 and gravel, about 9 feet thick. The solid breccia forming the roof
 of the lower, and the base of the upper cave, increases in thickness
 from 6 feet at the outside to a greater depth inwards. Its materials
 correspond with the bed of angular débris observed by Mr. Prestwich
 on the raised beach of Mewslade Bay.

caves was depressed. The raised beach at Mewslade Bay, which
appears, according to the evidence of Mr. Prestwich, to be of later
date than the Boulder-clay, has without doubt partaken of changes
of level similar to what the caves and their contents have under
gone, although, the marine deposits in the caves not being at a uni
form level, either in relation to each other or to the raised beach, it
is probable that there have been locally unequal depressions of level
in comparatively modern times. The author thinks that the sea
has effected but a comparatively slight inroad on the cave-deposits
and raised beach; and hence he infers that they belong to a rela
tively modern epoch,-seeing also that they are probably of later
date than the Boulder-clay period, and rest on marine sands con
taining existing species of shells.

remarks to the remains of Elephas primigenius and human bones that

the last ten or eleven months in any way                                have arisen from solar
magnetic disturbance, which there is some reason perhaps for sup
posing, and this, again, from the position of the planets above-named
in conjunction, there is reason to fear there may not be much
amelioration in our weather for some months to come, seeing that
Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn will remain some time longer in much
the same relative position.
   M. Rudolph Wolf of Berne has shown that those years remark
able for abundance of solar spots have also been more than com
monly rich in aurorae boreales. The great auroral display at the
commencement of September 1859, occurring about the time for
the return of sun-spot marimum, and which seems to have been
visible over the greater portion of both hemispheres, appears to have
been the precursor of a great meteorological disturbance: in Eng
land and Northern Europe more than an average amount of cold,
wind, and rain have prevailed ever since; in North America and India
more than an average amount of drought and heat. The opinions
of philosophers differ respecting the influence of a paucity or an
abundance of solar spots upon the temperature and seasons of the
earth; the probability         there  is,
                                        simply      general disturbance,

arising from increase            of

obtained by these physicists, the author thinks that they do not
confirm their explanation, according to which the vibration com
municated to the soldering of two heterogeneous bodies directly
produces an electric current.    He thinks that the production of the
heat  precedes that of the electric current.   It is seen, on examina
tion, how the existence of the current is connected with the vibration
—that the current ceases with the vibration, but not directly as if it
had been interrupted by cutting the wire.
   It appears natural to consider the electric effect observed in these
experiments as a resultant of the heat disengaged at the surface of
contact of two heterogeneous bodies which tend to enter into a

                ON THE DENSITY OF ICE.                  BY M. L. DUFOUR.
  The question of the density of ice is certainly not settled. The data
of different authors vary considerably, and         even the latest researches
have not led to very concordant results.            In 1807, Placidus Hen
rich found this     density   to be 0.905;   subsequently    it was found by
Thomson to be 0.94          ;  Berzelius,  0-916;    Dumas,    0-950; Osann,
0.927; Plücker and Geissler, 0.920; C. Brunner, 0.918; and lastly,
H. Kopp, in 1855, found that it was 0.909. These divergencies,
expressed in the increase of volume at the moment of congelation,
correspond to values between            and Tºr.
   In a series of researches on the congelation of water and of saline
solutions, the author has had occasion to investigate the density of
ice. The method which he has chosen, in order to avoid the serious
difficulties incident to the use of the ordinary methods in the case of
ice, consists in forming a liquid in which ice floats in equilibrium,
and then determining the density of this liquid. The liquid was a
mixture of water and alcohol, and                      all
                                                  necessary precautions were
            avoid,                possible,                        Preliminary

trials      bodies      known    density  showed that the method gave                       an
approximate value which was not more than 0.002 from the true.
The ice was quite free from air, and was obtained from distilled
water boiled for some time. The method gave                    ready means
                                                                        a                   of
determining the highest and lowest level                 the density
                                                              of           each        of

examined, 0.922          0.923 was certainly the highest, and 0.914 the

               The metal is made to fall from a jet in a thin
stream into a cup,  the jet being half an inch or thereabouts above
the surface of the metal in the cup. The upper reservoir and
the lower vessel are in connexion with the two wires of a Bun
sen’s battery.   As the galvanic force traverses the thin stream
of mercury,  it scatters and diffuses it in vapour with the produc
tion of a most intense light. For obvious reasons the gaseous
mercury is confined in a well-closed glass cylinder; and this is
made of sufficiently small diameter to become hot in the neigh
bourhood of the electric flame, and thus prevent the condensa
tion of the mercury on         it.

were generally altered         in colour; but the following substances of
known composition are more instructive in the contrast between
the colours they then exhibited and those they display by day
light.
   Crystals of protosulphate of iron appeared absolutely colour
less instead of pale bluish green,
   The blue sulphate of copper, and the yellow chromate of pot
ash, were only enhanced in the brilliancy of their colours.
   Bichromate of potash became of a yellow instead of a red
orange, and dull instead of bright.
   Red prussiate of potash showed a yellow powder, and dingy
orange crystals.
   Chloride of cobalt gave a dirty-brown instead of a pale-red
solution.
   Nitrate of chromium, though in such strong solution as to
appear red by sunlight, was only dark dull green.
   Amorphous phosphorus showed scarcely any red, or other
colour, but presented a dark metallic appearance.
   Iodide of mercury was not scarlet, but of a brown colour, very
glistening, suggesting the idea of scales of tarnished silver.
   Gold looked like brass,
    Cochineal in aqueous solution appeared violet in a thin stra
 tum, red brown in a deep one,
    A decoction of coffee with milk, as usually drunk, assumed a
 dirty green hue,
    A solution of bisulphate of quinine, uranium glass, and cer
tain diamonds, exhibited the phaenomena of fluorescence more
beautifully even than by sunlight.
    Among substances that had much the same colour by daylight
 and by the mercury flame, may be mentioned blue cobalt salts,
 yellow nitrate of uranium green chlorophyll, and purple aniline
 dye, permangamate of potash and murexide,
    On analysing this light by means of Prof. Powell's refraction
 goniometer, I found it to consist of a number of separate and
 variously coloured rays. This appearance is represented in
 Plate   III.fig. 1, the angle of the prism being 45°. None of the
lines are of any appreciable breadth; that                      is,

Way's apparatus. Thus through his kindness probably had             I
the advantage of examining a purer as well as a far more bril
liant mercurial light than any previous observer.
   Attention is being particularly directed at the present time to
the fact that the luminous bands of some artificial flames coin
cide exactly with dark lines in the solar spectrum, and that cer
tain flames absorb light of the same refrangibility as they emit.
With reference to the latter phaenomenon,                      I
                                                  have looked at
the double   spectrum  of the sun  shining  through   the mercury
flame; but the rays from the metal were too intense to permit
of any evidence of absorption of the solar beams in the same
place. A glance at the preceding Table will show that a bright
line occurs in the spark of mercury as in many other artificial
lights just where D occurs in the solar spectrum; another ray
appears to have the same refrangibility as the most prominent
line between G and H, namely G 33: otherwise there seems to
be no coincidence.

 his other indices be treated like Gladstone's, they exhibit the
 same close agreement with the exponential law, and in like
 manner conform to the regular type, as respects the laws of
 extrusion.
     Thus treated, Powell’s observations attemp.22°-5C. give, with
 the exponent n=3:1, the following values: log sa=0.1955608,
 and an=0.008324, whence arise these indices:—

Excluding H, the differences             between     these and the observed
indices are
      B+           C—            D+             E-            F+           G

 a result still more favourable than with Gladstone's observations.
     Powell’s observations at temp. 14°C., yield with exponent
n=3-4, log      ea =0.1979154,       and a, =0.006895; but a better
equalization of errors is obtained by making an=0.006886.
 Hence arise the following indices:—
        B        C          D           E            F           G         H .

Excluding H, the differences between these and the observed
indices are
      B+           C-            D–             E+             F–          G+

     Those at temp. 10°C., yield with exponent n=3, log e,
0-1971516, and a-0-008815; but a better equalization of errors
                                                                               -
is obtained by making a-0-008840.                    Hence arise the follow
ing indices:—
        B        C          D            E            F           G         H

Excluding H, the differences between these and the observed
indices are
      B+           C-            D–             E--           F+           G+
  0-000458      0-000455      0-000086       0.000289      0-0004:32   0-000442.
     The differences in these two latter cases exceed those in the
 two former. Still, they are within the probable limits of error
 for single observations, and are but slightly in excess of those
 incident to mean observations.
     In judging of these results, allowance must be made for pro
 bable variations of temperature or mechanical agitations occur
 ring in the course of the experiments.               A change of 1° C. will
 alter an index in this medium           by   about 0.001 on an average;
 so that a variation of a fraction of a degree, occurring while the

                            the Laws             of Chromatic Dispersion.                                       257
observations are in progress, may produce a considerable effect
in augmenting or diminishing the apparent extrusions of the
fixed lines, and in altering the relations of the indices to each
other.    In this manner we may account for the differences in
the  proportion  of extrusion, and the consequent variations in
the exponent, in the three observations by Powell, and for the
better agreement of one set than another with the exponential
law.

mental errors; for an inaccuracy in the determination of the
three assumed as the basis of calculation may be of such a cha
racter as greatly to increase the discrepancies between the ob
served and calculated indices of the other lines, and even to
make them appear to exceed the legitimate bounds of probable
error.   Cases, however, may occur in which it may be necessary
to rest contented with determining the other five indices from
three being given.

medium which produces the irrationality, more correctly than
do the extrusions arising when only seven lines are taken into
the account. But this point cannot be satisfactorily ascertained
until recourse be had to such a method of experiment as shall
exhibit the irrationality apart from the dispersion.
   Indeed it is manifest that, for the further elucidation of the
laws of refraction and dispersion, it is needful to resort to a
totally different method of experiment from what has been
hitherto pursued, and to adopt such arrangements as shall pre
sent the effects of the refractive, the dispersive, and the extrusive
powers of the medium, each separately and distinctly.            The
variations of each   power, produced    by  change   of temperature,
may then be studied with some reasonable prospect of arriving
 at precise and satisfactory results,

  It  must be observed that this increase of range is effected by
the action of two independent forces, viz. the force of floatation
of the cup, and the gravity of the mercury in the tube; whereas
in the common wheelbarometer, the change of barometric column
is simply multiplied by mechanical transmission.

follows, the tubes being uniform in section, that the graduation

that the same observation applies to the scale C. Equations
(1) and (3) express the range r of the instrument, estimated on

   There are then certainly considerable difficulties in the way of
accounting for the spot-period of 11.1 years, if we suppose that
Jupiter's sidereal period of 11.8 years necessarily regulates                                                      it.

    Should future investigation prove that this peculiar conjunc
tion of Mercury and Venus is something more than a mere co
incidence, taken in connexion with the interval of 11.1 years
between the solar-spot maxima, it will not fail,          think, to create  I
surprise that two such small planets should produce apparently
so strong an influence upon the sun, as that required to regulate
the periodicity of his spot-energy; it would have been more
natural to suppose that the intensity of the planetary disturbance
or effect would at least have been to some extent proportional
to the masses, and inversely as the squares of the distance. One
can only suppose that Mercury (and probably Venus similarly,
though to a minor extent), owing to his extreme density, possesses
a metallic constitution highly favourable to electro-magnetic
action; he may indeed intrinsically be a more powerful magnet

a difficulty in knowing the precise time for a revolution of the
sun on his axis, the period varying (I presume as measured by
the spots on his surface) as much as two days in certain regions
or latitudes, in excess of the equatorial. Still the influence and
position of the planet Mercury may have considerable magnetic
effects.
    It must  also be borne   in mind, while attempting to connect
planetary influences through mass-attraction, with the secular
returns of spot-marimum and minimum, that those periods are
not, as far as they have hitherto been examined, precisely regular
or fixed; the average, taken from before 1800 to 1860, gives,
according to Wolf, a period of 11.1 years; but from the years
1826 to 1850, the best observations made by Schwabe show that
the period was then a decennial one, with maxima in 1828, 1837,
and 1848, and minima in 1833 and 1843; and Sabine states
“that during the same period the solar magnetic variations show
likewise a decennial period strictly coincident with the solar spots.”
XXXIV.       On the Elastic Force   of Vapours.    By M. REGNAULT.
     [The important researches     of M. Regnault on the Elastic
Force of Vapours under various conditions, abstracts of which
have been given in the Numbers of this Magazine for October
 1854 and January 1855, have just appeared in full in the
twenty-sixth volume of the Mémoires de l'Académie. In calling
attention to their publication, in the Comptes Rendus for June 11,
 1860, the author at the same time communicates an account of
 some further developments which he has given to a part of this
research—that which treats of the tension of saturated vapours
in vacuo, a translation of which we proceed to lay before our
readers.-EDs.]
    The various apparatus which I have used in these researches
 are described in the original memoir.          I will merely remark
 that they refer to two different methods.
    The first, which  I call the statical method, consists in deter
 mining the pressure which is equal to the elastic force of a vapour
 at rest disengaged from a liquid in excess. In the second method,
which is called the dynamic method, the vapour is always in motion,
and a determination is made of the temperature of the vapour
 continually emitted by the liquid boiling under different pressures.
    Both methods give the same results,
    1. When the liquid is quite homogeneous.           This is not the
 case when it is impure; the presence of the smallest quantity of
 a volatile foreign body is immediately seen in the non-superpo
 sition of the two graphic curves which belong to one or the other
of these methods.

    2. Where the liquid does not possess a great molecular cohe
 sion; for otherwise the liquid boils in an intermittent manner
 with violent jumpings, and the determinations by the dynamic
 method become very uncertain.
     Both methods have been successfully applied to most of the
 volatile liquids taken for experiment, and              have been able    I                                to.

the much simpler formula
                              log F-a+ba'.
This consideration, and the great resemblance which the graphic
ls;
curves belonging to different substances bear to each other when
         is taken for ordinates, lead me to think that the law of
variation of the tensions of vapours with the temperatures would
appear under a very simple form by taking as an independent
variable, not the temperature such as we define it in a completely
arbitrary manner, but another element which would be in a direct
relation with the constitution of each body, and whose origin
would be fixed for each of them.
   The Tables of the elastic forces of the vapours of alcohol,
ether, chloroform, bisulphide of carbon, and essence of turpen
tine have already appeared in this Journal. In the new Table
these tensions are determined for every 5 degrees; and there
are further determinations of the tensions of benzole, quadri
chloride of carbon, C*Cl*, of chloride, bromide, and iodide of
ethyle, of methylic alcohol, essence of lemon, acetone, and oxalic
ether. In the following Tables we shall give the tensions of

    The temperatures refer to the air-thermometer. The ebulli
 tion of mercury is regular enough at pressures below that of the
 atmosphere.         Under the atmospheric pressure, jumpings com
 mence, and they increase in proportion as the pressure increases:
 under a pressure of ten atmospheres the shocks are so violent
 that they produce a noise like that of a hammer striking an anvil.
 Every moment the apparatus may be expected to burst into
 pieces.

    The condensation of the gases was effected in the same appa
ratus which served to determine the tensions, and which was so
arranged as to be quite freed from the last traces of air or any
other gas which it might contain. The liquefaction of sulphurous
acid is readily effected at the ordinary atmospheric pressure, when
the apparatus is placed in a cooling mixture.                   For ammonia and
sulphuretted hydrogen the apparatus is placed in a mixture of
ice and crystallized chloride of calcium, and then the gas com
pressed with a hand force-pump.                         Care must be taken that
the   ordinary    grease     of the     pumps    is   replaced by fixed oils which
are not saponifiable.            By a pressure of 2 to 3 atmospheres the
desired     quantity    of  liquid    ammonia is obtained; but for sulphur
etted    hydrogen       the   pressure        must be raised to 7 or 8 atmo
spheres.

tion of the immediate impulse; and at the boundary furthest
from the electrified sphere, there must, for the same reason, be
an excess of molecular attraction from without to within above
the opposite molecular repulsion. Thus the further side of the
sphere is electrified negatively. The opposite electricities would
plainly have been induced if the first sphere had been electrified
positively. These inferences are in accordance with well-known
results of experiment.

the electrified sphere, which supplies the pulling or pushing
force by which the electric condition of the other sphere is gene
rated. On the removal of the former, the electric state of the
latter would immediately vanish, for the same reason that, in the

Wulº                has continued his researches on oxide of ethylene,
            which have led to further interesting results.
   It combines directly with acids and neutralizes them. Oxide
of ethylene also unites with acids, forming basic salts. When
it is treated with anhydrous acetic acid, acetate of glycol is
formed. When this body has been separated by fractional di
stillation, a considerable quantity of a liquid boiling above
200° C. remains.          By working on large quantities, three pro
ducts may be obtained from this liquid, which can be regarded
as basic acetates of oxide of ethylene, and which really are ace
tates of polyethylenic alcoholst.
   The first product boils at about 250°, and is the acetate of
diethylenic alcohol, formed in accordance with the reaction:

   Thus one, two, three, or four atoms of oxide of ethylene can
unite with one atom of anhydrous acetic acid (which is equiva
lent to two atoms of hydrated acetic acid) to form in the first
case a neutral acetate (diacetate of glycol); in the other cases
acetates, more and more basic, which give rise to more and more
complicated polyethylenic alcohols.       The same acetates are
formed  by the action of ordinary acetic acid on oxide of ethylene,
but in this case water is eliminated.
    Oxide of ethylene unites directly with diacetate of glycol
 (ethylenic acetate) to form polyethylenic acetates—a reaction per
fectly comparable to the transformation of acetate of lead into
 basic acetate when the neutral salt is digested with oxide of
lead.    Thus:

        M. Lourenço      on some new Polyethylenic Alcohols,       293
an acid potash salt is obtained which closely resembles cream        of
tartar. The salt is anhydrous, and contains C*H* K9°.
   The oxidation of triethylenic alcohol is accompanied by the
same phaenomena as that of diethylenic alcohol.             By suitable
treatment two lime-salts are obtained: one, slightly soluble in
cold water, is identical with that just described; the other is
more soluble in water, and forms silky tufts like asbestos., The
composition of this salt is C*H*Ca” 9°. Its aqueous solution
gives a white precipitate with nitrate of silver; this precipitate,
decomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen, yields a liquid which
contains a new acid, and which does not crystallize, but after
evaporation forms a syrupy mass.
   Comparing these acids with the polyethylenic alcohols from
which they are formed, relations of a very simple character are
found to exist between them, analogous to those which exist
between alcohol and acetic acid; a certain quantity of hydrogen
disappears and is replaced by an equivalent quantity of oxygen.
When glycol is transformed into glycolic acid, we may assume
that the radical ethylene, C*H*,is changed into glycolyle, C*H*9;
in the case of diethylenic alcohol, we may suppose that both the
ethylene radicals are converted into glycolyle.             Diethylenic
alcohol thus becomes diglycolic acid.       The acid formed from tri
ethylenic alcohol is similarly derived; two ethylene radicals are
converted into glycolyle, while the third remains intact.       In this
manner diglycolethylenic acid is obtained. The following formulae
exhibit these relations:—

     Seleniute of Nickel, NiO, SeO3+6Aq—Thesecrystals resemble
 the corresponding sulphate, as has been shown by Mitscherlich.
 They lose four equivs. of water at 100°.
     Seleniate of Nickel and Potassium, KO, NiO, 2SeO44-6Aq.—
 Obtained by the spontaneous evaporation of a solution of the
 two salts. They lose four equivs. of water at 100°.           The analo
 gous sulphate is not perceptibly altered at 100°.
     Seleniate of Cadmium, CdC, SeO°--2Aq.—These crystals differ
 both in form and composition from those of the corresponding
 sulphate. They lose 1 equiv. of water at 100°.
     Weber has described the formation of oxychloride of selenium
 and of the alum of selenic acidº.         The former body is obtained
 by distilling chloride of selenium, SeCl°, so that it comes in con
 tact with an equal volume of selenious acid. The two bodies
 combine to form white vapours of oxychloride of selenium,
 which is redistilled over selenious acid.
    It is a yellowish liquid which fumes in moist air; it has the
 density 2:44, and boils at about 240°. It dissolves readily in
 water, forming hydrochloric acid and selenious acid.            Its compo
 sition may be expressed by the formula SeCl*-i-SeO", according
to which it is a compound of selenious acid and of chloride of
selenium. It may also be considered as being selenious acid
in which an atom of oxygen is replaced by an atom of chlorine.
Oxychloride of selenium is also formed by the action of a small
quantity of water on chloride of selenium.
    It was found impossible to prepare a compound corresponding
to Regnault's chlorosulphuric acid. Chlorine is without action
on dry selenious acid.
    To prepare selenic acid, selenite of soda was fused with nitrate
of potass, the mixture treated with nitrate of lead, and the pre
cipitate of seleniate of lead decomposed by sulphuretted hydro
gen.     The solution of selenic acid was concentrated, and a
quarter of it neutralized with carbonate of potass; the remaining
three quarters were digested with pure hydrate of alumina. The
mixed liquids were left to spontaneous evaporation, and after the
expiration of twenty days, beautiful crystals were obtained. Their
composition was Al” O°, 3SeO’, KO, SeO3+24HO. The crystals

  It will be observed that the glass ball G need not greatly ex
ceed the size of the bulbs of some of our ordinary thermometers;
and the whole length of the instrument may be 5 or 6 inches
less than that of a barometer.
   These formulae are sufficiently exact for determining the pro
portion of the different parts of the instrument; but it is neces
sary that we should determine the amount of the disturbances
arising from the expansion of the mercury and glass.

XXXVIII.       On the presence of Arsenic and Antimony in the

     BELL, Analytical Chemist to the Hospital for Consumption,
     Brompton*.
 SOME
           monthsago                I
                          had a specimen of iron pyrites from coal,
   or coal   pyrites as it is familiarly called, sent to me, to exa
                                    I
mine for arsenic, and was somewhat surprised to find in it the
quantity of arsenic which                     I
                               did, arsenic not being generally set
forth in the analysis which                    I
                                have seen of such pyrites, although
my own impression was that, if looked for in a proper manner,
it would be found.
   Having been informed that the coal associated with this
pyrites crops out in the beds of the streams and rivers of the
district from which my specimen of coal pyrites was sent, it
 occurred to me that if the sand from the beds of such streams or
 rivers were carefully examined, arsenic would be found in                                      it.

 should I get, in most instances, if not in all, anything like the
 quantity which the sand contains.
    The process which                         I
                                 adopt is as follows:—The sand is first
dried by means of a bath at not too high a temperature, and
sifted, if necessary, through a coarse sieve, to remove anything
larger than sand; the portion for the experiment                     then weigh               I
out.          I
            seldom require more than two ounces of the dry sifted
sand.             I
             then ascertain that my hydrochloric acid is free from
arsenic (or rather how far it is contaminated with                       for                      it,    it       is

 306     Presence  of Arsenic and Antimony in Streams and Rivers.
 exactly as   I have described in testing the acid, only, instead of a
 drachm,    I use a less quantity, proportionate to the acid used and
 the distillate obtained.       After one piece of copper is coated, it is
 withdrawn and another substituted, and so on until no more
 coating takes place; much evaporation of the liquid is made up
 from time to time by a little boiling water.
    When antimony is in the distillate, it deposits more readily
 than the arsenic upon the copper, and the first pieces coated
 have more of a purple or blue tint than the steel-grey colour of
 the arsenic.
    The remainder of the distillate may be tested by a Marsh’s
 apparatus, heating the gas as it passes through a quill-tube
 drawn to a fine point, in order to get the metallic arsenic de
 posited upon the tube.
    The metallic arsenic, deposited in this way from the residue of
the distillate from two ounces of the sand, is in many instances
of sufficient quantity to dissolve or sublime and examine by other
tests.
    The sands which       I   have examined have been selected with
much care; and in most cases, when taken from the beds of streams
or rivers, they have been taken above where they could receive
contamination from coal-pits or works, or contamination of any
description whatever:       I  append a list of them, in order that any
one may repeat the experiments.
    I am indebted to Mr. Woodcroft, of the Great Seal Patent
Office, for the first eight specimens, and to Mr. George Phillips,
of the Inland Revenue Laboratories, for the next four specimens,
both these gentlemen having taken much interest and trouble in
the matter.      For most of the other specimens I am indebted to
                                    I
kind friends, and one or two have procured myself.

XXXIX.    Meditation on the Idea of Poncelet's Theorem.    By
  J. J.SYLVESTER,   M.A., F.R.S., Professor of Mathematics in
  the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich%.
       ITHERTO     Poncelet's theorem has been regarded as a
        method sui generis and complete in itself; but in truth it
is but the first germ or rudiment of a vast and prolific alge
braical theory; and not only so, but the principle which it con
tains admits of applications of the utmost value in various
dynamical and analytical questions, which it is surprising should
have been allowed to lay so long dormant.         For the present,
however,       I
            mean to confine myself to a very brief indication of
one direction in which the theorem admits of being generalized.

   These numbers demonstrate an unexpected and a very remarkable
result,    that greater electromotive force per unit length of air is
required to produce a spark at short distances than at long. When
it is considered that the absolute electrification of each of the op
posed surfaces * depends simply on the electromotive force per unit
length of the space between them, or, which is the same thing, the
resultant electrostatic force in the air occupying that space, it is
difficult even to conjecture an explanation.        Without attempting to
explain      it,
             we are forced       recognize the fact that

   The difference between the numbers shown in these two Tables
and in Table II. above, are probably due in part to true differences
in the resistance of the air to electrical disruption; but variations
in the electrometer, which was by no means of perfect construction,
may have sensibly influenced the results, especially as regards the

     1. Measurement of quantities of electricity.—The unit quantity
 of electricity is such a quantity, that, if collected in a point, it will
repel an equal quantity collected in a point at a unit distance with a
 force equal to unity.
     [In British absolute measurements the unit distance is one foot;
and the unit force is that force which, acting on a grain of matter
during a second of time, generates a velocity of one foot per second.
The weight of a grain at Glasgow is 322 of these British units of
force. The weight of a grain in any part of the earth's surface may
be estimated with about as much accuracy as it can be without a
special experiment to determine it for the particular locality, by the
following expression:—
    In latitude A average weight of a grain
          =32,088         × (1   +:005.133x sin” x) British absolute units.]
    2. Electric density.—This term was introduced by Coulomb to
 designate the quantity of electricity per unit of area in any part of
                                                                                                                                 *

 through an aperture in the          case or cage, with the conductor whose
 electricity is to be tested. In every properly constructed electrometer,
 the electric force experienced by the moveable part in a given position
 cannot be electrically influenced except by changing the difference
  of potentials between the principal electrode and the uninsulated
 conductor or conducting system in the electrometer. Even the best
  of ordinary electrometers hitherto constructed do not fulfil this con
 dition, as the inner surface of the glass of which the whole or part
 of the enclosing case is generally made, is liable to become electrified,
 and inevitably does become so when any very high electrification is
 designedly or accidentally introduced, even for a very short time;
 the consequence of which is that the moving body will generally not
 return to        its
                 zero position when the principal electrode                perfectly                            is

that direction. Since the average electrostatic force in the line joining
two points at which the values of the potential are equal, is nothing,
the direction of the resultant electrostatic force at any point must be
perpendicular to the equipotential surface passing through that
point; or the lines of force (which are generally curves) cut the
series of equipotential surfaces at right angles. The rate of varia
tion of potential per unit of length along a line of force is therefore
equal to the electrostatic force at any point.

denote the distance between the metallic surfaces on each side of the
stratum of air at any part, and V the difference of potentials.     It is
easily shown that the resultant electrostatic force is sensibly constant
through the whole distance, from the one surface to the other; and
being in a direction sensibly perpendicular to each, it must (§ 9)

   These results, as well as those shown in the preceding Tables,
demonstrate a much less rapid variation with distance, of the electro
static force preceding a spark, at the greater than at the smaller
distances.    It seems most probable that at still greater distances the
electrostatic force will be found to be sensibly constant, as it was
certainly expected to be at         alldistances. The limiting value
which the results shown        in  the last Table seem        point must

  in a point or a ball, and the lower end in a gold-leaf electroscope, it
  seldom showed the existence of atmospheric electricity.      But when
  the lower end was connected with a dry pile condensing electroscope,
  signs of electricity were always obtained, sometimes positive and
  sometimes negative; and this is the only means by which, with a
  fixed rod, the nature of the atmospheric electricity may always be
 obtained. Before commencing the experiment, it must be ascertained
       instrument is in the natural state; this is the case when, after

 touching both plates and then separating them, the gold leaf remains
 at rest. In the second place, the electricity must be collected first
 by the upper, and then by the lower plate, in order to ascertain that
 the two results agree.     After each experiment both plates of the
 condenser must be connected with the ground, and separated from
 one another by an uninsulated metallic foil. These precautions are
 essential in detecting the small traces of electricity usually met with
 in the atmosphere.                                        -

 point or in a ball; the quantity varies little, but seems less with a

    4th. When a flame, or an incandescent ball, or even ignited
 charcoal is placed on the point, the electricity which was negative is
 changed into positive. . If the atmospheric electricity is positive,
 flame and incandescent metals simply increase the intensity. The
 hotter the flame, the greater the quantity of electricity. The effects
 of a spirit-lamp exceed those of an oil-lamp. Hence flame is liable
 to introduce a source of error, when- used in making observations on
 atmospheric electricity. .

     object of this paper is to communicate an experiment
THEwhich  seems to have an important bearing on the theory
of binocular vision.
   Wheatstone, it will be rememberedit, has called in question
the doctrine of identical retina-points, on certain grounds con
nected with stereoscopic vision.    A body of suitable dimensions,
especially at the distance of distinct vision, will, he says, appear
simply solid, though it is obviously impossible that the corre
sponding points of the images received by the two eyes can fall
on the corresponding points of the retinae. This objection, how
ever, has not prevailed on physiologists to abandon the doctrine
of corresponding retina-points, since that doctrine is confirmed
by many other considerations.    Brücke, indeed, has advancedf
an explanation of stereoscopic vision which has hitherto been
generally regarded as sufficient, and which at first sight appears
to afford a solution of the difficulty. According to Brücke, the
eyes during vision are never at rest, but are constantly making
small movements, by means of which the images of continually
different points of the body regarded fall successively in the two
eyes on corresponding     points of the retinae; and thus single
vision arises, since the images  of points which fall on parts of the
eyes that do not correspond escape consciousness, because in
general the recognition of double impressions is resisted. The
impressions, however, perceived by corresponding retina-points

cylinder            of     straight and smoothly polished
                         metal,         as                              possible,                        as

other      right angles.

different from that in an eye at rest, while on the other hand
the image of a real object must be the same in an eye in rapid
motion as in one at rest. As now the virtual image of the
point of reflexion moving along the curve is precisely identical
as to form with the curve itself, it is impossible that the eye
can make any sensible movements.         Or to express the same
thing in other words, no movement of the eyes would bring two
virtual images on to corresponding retina-points, which do not

 towards the conclusion of the third paragraph, we saw only the
 circle and not the conic section in the plane perpendicular to the
 ground line, and passing through the axis of s (w-0). Imagine
  (Pl. IV. fig. 6) that with the eye A we only saw the rays a
 and & ; with the eye B the rays b and 8 (so that the points in
,order are a b, 2 8); then, on looking with both eyes, should
 we perceive stereoscopically        the points a b and a 3, or the
 points a 6 and b a 2 It is clear that if the point b & were
  seen, the rays a and 8 would impinge on very different points

 theory), so that they would not be stereoscopically united,—so

however, there has been no method for directly determining                                                   sul
phuret of antimony by the method of volumetric analysis. This
is attempted to be solved by the following process. The sul
phide of antimony, whether precipitated by sulphuretted hy
drogen from solutions containing antimonic acid or oxide of
antimony, is decomposed by boiling hydrochloric acid in such
a manner that for every equivalent of antimony three equivalents
of sulphuretted hydrogen are liberated.     Consequently the de
termination of this gas is a measure for the antimony, and                                                    its
accurate estimation affords      indirect method    andetermining                    of
that body.    Hence the real point            accurate volumetric is      an
estimation    sulphuretted
                    of       hydrogen.    This can     effected                           be                  in
several ways.

be used    in the dilution, and that the determinations must be
made as rapidly as possible.   The transient red colour produced
on the addition of iodine to a sulphuretted hydrogen solution
containing starch, is only feeble when the solution is greatly
diluted; it rapidly disappears, and does not prevent the true
iodine reaction.
   The details of the process are as follows:—
   The sulphide of antimony which has been precipitated by
sulphuretted hydrogen from a solution containing tartaric acid*,
is collected on a filter of Swedish paper and completely washed
out, the last washings being with hot water.
   The filter with the partially dried precipitate is carefully
removed from the funnel, and pressed into such a form that it
can be conveniently introduced into the neck of a small flask.
With a little practice this is effected without breaking the filter,
and without any loss; it is of course easier when the precipitate
is quite dry, for then it occupies less room.
   In decomposing the sulphide of antimony and collecting the
sulphuretted hydrogen, an apparatus may be used similar to
that which Bunsen has described in his paper on iodometric de
terminations. The size of the flask varies with the quantity of
sulphide of antimony: for quantities of 0-3 to 0-4 grim. SbS", a
flask of 100 cubic centims. capacity is sufficient; for 0.4 to 1
grim. SbSº, the capacity may be 200 cubic centims.     The bottom
of the flask must be  circular, the neck sharply tapering off, long,
narrow, and cylindrical.     The retort which serves as receiver
must have two large bulbous enlargements blown in the neck:
the bulb part of the retort must be filled with water freed from
air; and from 30 to 50 cubic centims. of caustic ammonia must
be added, according to the quantity of the sulphide of antimony.
   The sulphide of antimony is then introduced into the flask,
hydrochloric acid mixed with one-fifth      volume          its
                                                      water added             of
in excess, the gas delivery-tube affixed, and then the distillation
commenced.

.   .  A higher degree of accuracy than this is obtained by collect
    ing the sulphuretted hydrogen gas in a solution of arsenite of
    soda, and determining the rest of the arsenious acid by solution
    of iodine.
       Mohr was the first to propose the combination of an alkaline
    solution of arsenious acid with iodine, and he prefers this in
    many respects to Bunsen’s method.         cannot unconditionallyI
    agree with him.    If any alteration is to be made in Bunsen’s
    original method, the only reasons for which would be the great
    dilution required, and the changeability of the sulphurous acid,
    hyposulphite of soda ought to be preferred to arsenite of soda.
    The reasons urged by Mohr against          use are not perfectlyits

  846              M. R. Schneider      on the Volumetric
      In using it the    above method may be modified as follows.
      The same    apparatus    is used for decomposing the sulphide of
  antimony and collecting the sulphuretted hydrogen. A solution
  of arsenious acid, prepared by dissolving arsenious acid (purified
  by resublimation) in water, pure soda being added until a neu
  tral or feebly alkaline reaction is set up, is placed in the receiver.
  The solution is so strong that 1 cubic centim, contains about
  0.005–0:006 grim. of arsenious acid, and it is compared with a
  solution of iodine which contains a known quantity of iodine#.
  According to the quantity of sulphide of antimony, 50, 100, or
  200 cubic. centims. are used. The latter quantity would be
  quite sufficient for the sulphuretted hydrogen disengaged from
  1.5 grim. sulphuret of antimony.
      From the hydrochloric acid gas which passes along with the
  liberated sulphuretted hydrogen into the receiver the liquid soon
 becomes acid, and then sulphuret of arsenic is deposited.                   The
  decomposition of the sulphuretted hydrogen is rapid and com
 plete.     Chloride of antimony does not distil over if the distilla
 tion be not continued too long. Nor are any organic substances
 formed by the action of the boiling hydrochloric acid on the paper,
 which might subsequently exert a reducing action on the solution
 of iodinet.
     As soon as the liquid in the retort is cold, it is transferred to
 a measuring-flask, some solution of tartaric acid is addedf, and
 the flask filled up to the mark. After this liquid has been filtered
 an aliquot part is measured off, and after saturation with bicar
 bonate of soda the quantity of arsenious acid is determined by
 solution of iodine.
     The calculation of the result is very simple.               If the volume
 of solution of iodine corresponding to the arsenical solution
 taken be called V, the volume of iodine solution corresponding
 to the arsenical solution after the distillation be called 0, and the
    * This is best effected by adding to a known quantity of the arsenical
 solution a few drops of hydrochloric acid till it is feebly acid, and then
 excess of bicarbonate of soda, some solution of starch, and finally solution
of iodine.
    t  A paper filter, 2 inches in diameter, was boiled in hydrochloric acid,
and the vapour disengaged collected in water to which 8 cubic centims.
solution of arsenic (10 cubic centims. = 23:3 cubic centims. solution of
iodine) had been added.      After the distillation, the arsenical solution (after
the addition of bicarbonate of soda and of starch) required 187 cubic cem
tims. solution of iodine.     Now 10:8 = 23:3: 1864.
    f  The error in the volume caused by the suspended sulphide of arsenic
is so small, that in the majority of cases, and where unusually large quan
tities of substance are not operated upon, it may be neglected.
    The sulphide of arsenic precipitated from a hydrochloric acid solution
persistently retains some chlorine, doubtless as chloride of arsenic, even
after washing. This is not the case when the solution contains tartaric acid,

                                 [With a Plate.]
 THE
            apparatus to which       I  have given the above name is        in
         tended for the    following     purposes:–
     1. To represent interferences, and spectra in different-coloured
 lights, both separately and combined.
    2. To imitate the phaenomena of dichroism both in the case
 in which the dichroitic crystals are viewed through a double
 refracting arrangement, as, for example, Haidinger's dichroitic
 lens, and also in the case of the phaenomena produced when the
 dichroitic crystals themselves are used as analysers         in  a polarizing
 arrangement.
    3. To combine elliptically, circularly, and rectilinearly polar
 ized and unpolarized light, not in such a manner that the one
 is produced by the polarizing, and the other by the analysing
 arrangement, but so that they traverse the doubly refracting
 media simultaneously, and are then submitted to any analysing
 arrangement.
    a b, fig. 1, Plate IV. is the three-sided brass prism of my
 polarizing apparatus (Farbenlehre, page 202), moveable in a
 brass case on an ordinary telescope-stand, in horizontal and
 vertical directions. At      one end there is the lens with the polar
 izing mirror cd, and at      the other end at a the analysing Nicol
 with the ocular. heg       f  is the dichrooscope, which can be placed
 in one of the ordinary        slides which carry the other arrange
 ments, in which case these other arrangements (the polarizing
 Nicol and the circular-polarizing mica plate) may be placed on
 one side.
    The dichrooscope is a four-sided brass box 81 millims. long,
 75 millims. high, and 70 millims. broad. The posterior side of the
 box represented in the figure is closed, and in the middle of this
 side there is a cylindrical piece in which a rod is inserted.           This
 rod is attached either to a piece of glass ef, or to a moveable glass
 disc, which can thus be exchanged for one another.                 The piece
of   glass or the disc are turned by means of a knob which pro
jects from the outside of the box, after the end of the rod
which reaches out of the cylindrical piece has been tight
ened by a screw, but not so as to prevent rotation.              In the open
sides of the box hf and         fg     coloured glasses can be inserted,
while he, when other slides are not used, is destined to receive
cooled glasses or crystals, or a large rotating circular-polarizing
plate of mica. The sides hf and           gf  can be closed by slides; and
slides can be  placed   in he which have a longitudinal slit for prism

apparatus with feeble  light the phaenomenon is greatly attenuated,
and in  ordinary daylight  is not apparent, for the red rings then
quite disappear,     Dichromatic combinations by superposing
different-coloured glasses are impossible with many colours, for
a pure red and a pure green glass become then quite opake,
These evils are obviated by the arrangement (c). By combining
monochromatic and dichromatic glasses, which are placed at hf
and fg, any desired union of colours for polychromatic illumina
tion may be obtained, which by covering either h             fg are          for
immediately decomposed into their components.           Indeed, by
combining a red and a green  .
                                  glass, Newton’s rings  with white
light at once appear.
   To make this more apparent, I have given in figs, 2, 3, 4,
5 the appearance of two crossed, plane, polished gypsum
crystals in red, yellow, green, and blue light, in which the
white lights in the figure must be considered as appearing in
the corresponding colour of the dark interference lines. If two
of these figures are imagined to be superposed, we obtain the
phaenomenon of the combined illumination.          As the square
which is common to both the      gypsums   shows five interference
lines in red and seven in blue, the alternation of red and blue
lines is then directly apparent, for the diagonals of both colours
appear black.    A very instructive phaenomenon is obtained,                                 if,

on looking at a brightly illuminated aperture on a flame through
two crossed glass gratings held close before the eye, there is seen
the splendid phaenomenon of the spectra distorted in the form of
quadrants, which Fraunhofer has depicted in the sixth plate of
his grating-experiments.
   These obliquely distorted spectra may be shown to be connected
with the apparent deflection of light depending on the length of
the wave, by interposing a monochromatic, dichromatic, or                                       tri
coloured glass,    in which cases the unchanged figures of the
aperture at regular distances are seen to form systems of qua
drants with mutual edges; in the first case there is one, in the
second two, and so on.    In using the dichrooscope, the circular
aperture is in a slide at he.    It is viewed from the distance of
distinct vision, through   gratings  rotating on each other. The
                                                  f

apparatus with feeble  light the phaenomenon is greatly attenuated,
and in  ordinary daylight  is not apparent, for the red rings then
quite disappear,     Dichromatic combinations by superposing
different-coloured glasses are impossible with many colours, for
a pure red and a pure green glass become then quite opake,
These evils are obviated by the arrangement (c). By combining
monochromatic and dichromatic glasses, which are placed at hf
and fg, any desired union of colours for polychromatic illumina
tion may be obtained, which by covering either h             fg are   for
immediately decomposed into their components.           Indeed, by
combining a red and a green glass, Newton’s rings with white
light at once appear.
   To make this more apparent, I have given in figs, 2, 3, 4,
5 the appearance of two crossed, plane, polished gypsum
crystals in red, yellow, green, and blue light, in which the
white lights in the figure must be considered as appearing in
the corresponding colour of the dark interference lines.           two           If
of these figures are imagined to be superposed, we obtain the
phaenomenon of the combined illumination.              As the square
which is common to both the        gypsums     shows five interference
lines in red and seven in blue, the alternation of red and blue
lines is them directly apparent, for the diagonals of both colours
appear black.     A very instructive phaenomenon is obtained,                          if,

         have preferred to retain the same arrangement of the
apparatus as in the preceding case.
  We shall most readily appreciate the phaenomena which now
appear, if that which is obtained in the calc-spar plate with a
certain-coloured light and with coincident planes of reflexion of
 the polarizing and analysing mirror be considered as applied to
 the phaenomena which this plate exhibits when it is looked at in
 light of another colour, the mirrors being crossed. The rings
 are a combination of two coloured systems of rings with a light
 and a dark cross, and which therefore appears brightly coloured
in the colour corresponding to the bright cross. The succession
of colours of the rings is consequently highly peculiar, and is
very distinct when well-annealed glasses are examined.               If
                                                                     it be
 desired to imitate the phaenomena seen when a dichroite, dichro
itic mica, a rubellite, repidolite, or smoky quartz is employed as
analysing arrangement, we have merely to use the proper
coloured glasses.      In the first case the cross appears blue; in
the second it appears red with preponderating green rings; in
rubellite the cross is the red of the alpine rose; in repidolite
deep grey and almost black, as in dark smoky quartz, while the
rings appear brownish yellow. What we shall obtain by turning
the Nicol 90 degrees is manifest if we imagine that the phaeno
menon of the dark cross for one colour is changed into the light
cross, and, on the contrary, the phaenomenon of the light cross
for the other colour is changed into that of the dark cross.
It is especially beautiful when an achromatic prism of calc-spar
is used as analysing arrangement with a red and blue glass,
The systems of rings, one with the blue and the other with the
red cross, then partially intersect one another.
    An idea is obtained of the colours which result from the com
bination of the system of rings, if a longitudinal slit is inserted on
the side towards the eye, and this is viewed through a prism
of rock-crystal. By the intermixture of both spectra, colours
are obtained which would not be expected from the components,
corresponding to the investigations of Wünsch and Helmholtz.
The active components are, however, obtained in the most differ
ent intensities if a rotating Nicol is interposed between the prism
of rock-crystal and the eye.                                    -

by removing the slide, the cross whose arms are on one side of a
 different colour than the other.
    The polarizing apparatus which I have described gives an
objective representation of the phaenomena.        It is simply neces
sary to concentrate an intense light on the aperture of the
polarizing Nicol through an objective, and to remove the ocular
from the analysing nearer to the polarizing Nicol. The light
emerging from the analysing Nicol is caught on a white surface,
on which the rings are represented in corresponding size.                                                    I

phaenomena,   the glass plates are placed   that these planes         so                                     of

College Tower of the University of Glasgow. A divided ring
electrometer was used at the last-mentioned station; an elec
trometer adapted for absolute measurement, nearly in the form
now constructed as an ordinary house electrometer, was used in
the lecture-room.     Four students of the Natural Philosophy
Class, Messrs. Lorimer, Lyon, M'Kerrow, and Wilson, after
having persevered in preliminary experiments and arrangements
from the month of November, devoted themselves with much
ardour and constancy during February, March, and April to the
work of observation.     During periods of observation, at various
times of day, early and late, measurements were completed and
recorded every quarter minute or every half minute,       the con
tinual variations of the phaenomenon   rendering solitary  observa
tions almost nugatory.    During several hours each day, simulta
neous observation was carried on on this plan at the two stations,
A comparison of the results manifested often great discordance,
 and never complete agreement.          It was thus ascertained that
 electrification of the air, if not of solid particles in the air (which
 have no claim to exclusive consideration in this respect), between
 the two stations and round them, at distances from them not
 very great in comparison with their mutual distance, was largely
 operative in the observed phaenomena.         It was generally found
...that after the indications had been negative for some time
  at both stations, the transition to positive took place earlier by
  several minutes at the tower station (upper) than at the lecture
 room (lower).     Sometimes during several minutes, preceded and
 followed   by positive indications, there were negative indications
  at the  lower, while there were only positive at the upper. In
these cases the circumambient air must have contained negative
  (orresinous) electricity,      horizontal stratum
                                      if

On the Laws of Absorption          of Liquids   by Porous Substances.       365
linen, &c., were prepared for experiment in the following man
ner: after being cut to their desired widths, and in some cases
graduated, stout platinum wires were attached to their lower
extremities, to give them a uniform tension and to sink these ex
tremities in the liquid; they were then steeped in boiling distilled
water, and afterwards thoroughly dried by evaporation; and im
mediately before being used they were suspended for about an
hour in the atmosphere, saturated with the vapour of the liquid.
The ascent of the liquid was, for the most part, observed by
means of a cathetometer; but in some cases the strip itself was
graduated.    The space S, moved over by the liquid through the
pores of the absorbent, is the elevation of the liquid line on the
absorbent measured from the level of the surface of the liquid
in which the absorbent is immersed. This liquid line was some
times best observed by transmitted light, at other times by re
flected light.   Plate IV. fig. 8 represents the apparatus which
was, for the most part, employed in these experiments:—
   A B a glass jar having a welt at the top ground smooth to
receive the ground brass plate CD; S a stuffing-box attached
to the plate, through which passes the stout wire FG, support
ing the absorbent G Kimmersed in the liquid                BK;   E a stopcock
communicating, when required, with the stopcock of an air-pump;
LMa water-bath maintained (when required) at a constant tempe
rature by means of a jet of steam. The sliding wire, FG, enables
us to raise or depress the absorbent as may be required; and
the stopcock E and ground plate enable us to keep the absorbent
suspended in an atmosphere saturated with the vapour of the
liquid, or it may be in a vessel exhausted of air. The apparatus
was modified to suit peculiar circumstances.      In experimenting
with such substances as turpentine, or with linseed oil, the vessel
A B was exhausted of air by means of the air-pump, and then
the external air was allowed to enter the vessel through a tube
filled with dry chloride of calcium.   The absorbent having been
for some time  suspended   in this dry air,          its
                                                lower extremity,                K,
was immersed   in the        oil   by
                              depressing  the sliding wire            F    G.

  The liquid used     this experiment was water.  The absorbent
                      2 in
was unsized paper,   inches    width, close
                                        in   texture, and weigh

   It will   be observed how very nearly the velocity, as determined
by the formula       v*              coincides with the velocity found by                    ex

HA).           been lately engaged in the analysis of several
       London waters, we took occasion to examine them by the
recently published method of Bunsen and Kirchhoff; and since
this spectrum-analysis adds two new constituents (i.e. lithium
and strontium) to those already known, the results obtained may
not be uninteresting to some of the readers of the Philosophical
Magazine.     If a small portion of the dry residue of any of the
waters examined is brought into the flame of an apparatus such
as described in Bunsen and Kirchhoff's papert, the lines Lia and
K & are seen with more or less distinctness as soon as the first
glare of the sodium and calcium spectrum is somewhat dimi
nished. After the Li, K, and Na have volatilized, the calcium
lines come out with increased brilliancy; and if the wire is now
dipped into HCl and again brought into the flame, the limes Sr a
and Sr y are seen, as well as a very brilliant calcium spectrum.
The strontium lines come out generally with greater brilliancy if
the wire, before being moistened with HCl, is held for some time
in a reducing flame, easily obtained by closing the air-holes of
the Bunsen’s burner. In some of the waters, especially the deep
well waters, the line Liz is somewhat masked by the bright so
dium and calcium spectra: it              is,

   Tungstic acid exists         two distinct modifications—one inso

luble   in
         water    (ordinary  tungstic  acid), and modification soluble    a
in water (metatungstic acid).        And there are two corresponding  -
groups     ofsalts.
   The tungstates, the salts                  of
                                      the insoluble modification, have
been  repeatedly    investigated.    The alkaline salts are somewhat
soluble     water; those
           in                    the alkaline earths and metals, which
                                    of
are obtained       by
                    double decomposition, are insoluble, amorphous
or crystalline precipitates.      These tungstates are characterized                             by
the fact that,   when treated with         stronger mineral      organic
                                                                                         of or

usually been considered acid salts, Scheibler assigns the formula

forms beautiful large monoclinic prisms.
    Tungstate     Potass, 3KO, 7WO°4-6Aq, crystallizes in small,
                   of
difficultly soluble, scaly crystals.
    Tungstate of Lithia, 3LiO,7WO°4-16Aq, crystallizes in easily
soluble, very beautiful large monoclinic prisms.            º
   Metatungstates.—The only salt of this class hitherto described
is the ammonia salt discovered by Margueritte.
   The solutions of these salts are not decomposed by acids with
separation of a yellow or white hydrate of tungstic acid.           The
metatungstates     are formed from the        tungstates  by  adding   a
strong acid to their solutions as long as the precipitate redissolves,
—or better still, by continuously boiling the tungstates with an
excess of hydrate of tungstic acid. This hydrate is obtained by
the double decomposition of tungstate of soda with chloride of
calcium, and digesting the precipitate which is formed with
hydrochloric acid.
   The metatungstates are very soluble, and crystallize only when
the solution is very concentrated.        The alkaline salts crystallize
in octahedra.       The ammonia salt melts in water like phos
phorus;      its
              solution strongly refracting. Its formula
                              is                                 NH*O,          is

   Heintz has communicated * some experiments of Richter on
the preparation of artificial boracite.   200 grms, of a mixture of
chloride of sodium and chloride of magnesium were mixed with
5 grns. of a compound of boracic acid and magnesia, obtained
by precipitating a boiling solution of sulphate of magnesia and
borax by carbonate of soda. To the mixture thus prepared 10
grms. of finely powdered boracic acid were added, and the whole,
well mixed together, heated in a platinum crucible. The fused
mass was heated with dilute hydrochloric acid, which left undis
solved a crystalline powder.     This powder was seen under the
microscope to consist of two kinds of crystals, some of a pris
matic form, while others were tetrahedra and octahedra.           On
digesting this mass for several days with hydrochloric acid, the
former were dissolved, while the latter were scarcely if at                        all

   After the operation the borax glass presented two layers—the

 upper a colourless glass, and the lower an opake white mass. In
 the clear glass and on the sides of the crucible there were inter
 spersed individual brown crystals, which were left undissolved
 when the whole mass was treated with hydrochloric acid : the
 white mass also left after this treatment a heavy hard powder,
 seen under the microscope to consist of crystals like the larger
 Ones.
    A crystallographical examination of the larger crystals was
 made.     Though small, they were frequently found as well deve
 loped as the most perfect crystal models. Their form was that
 of a dimetric prism with a pyramid. Hence, if this is correct, the
 oxide of thorium is isomorphous with oxide of tin and titanic
 acid.    It is a binoxide, Th()*, and not Th9 and Th”0°, as has
hitherto been supposed.
    A similar experiment was made with tantalic acid, by fusing it
with microcosmic salt under the same circumstances.                 The slag
contained a      crystalline  powder  consisting    of tantalic acid, besides
some individual larger needles of the same substance, the form of
which on examination was found to be that of a rhombic prism.
    In  his researches on oxide of amylene”, Bauer obtained hy
dride of amylene as an accessory product in the preparation of
amylene.        It is not possible to separate these substances by frac
tional   distillation,    as their boiling-points are too near; but by
acting on the mixture with bromine, bromide of amylene,
C*H*Br”, is formed, while hydride of amyle remains intact.
Bromide of amylene boils at 170°, and hence the latter body is
readily separated by fractional distillation.
    When chlorine is passed into hydride of amyle, a brisk action
is set up, the gas is absorbed, hydrochloric acid gas is liberated,
and considerable heat is disengaged.             The first product of the
action is chloride of amyle, C*H" Cl; when this body, which
boils at 102°, is separated by fractional distillation, and chlorine
gas passed into the residue for several hours, the liquor becomes
very thick: when it is distilled it begins to boil at 180°, and
the thermometer rises quickly to 230°, and remains for some
time between this point and 240°.             It afterwards rises to 300°,
and then decomposes, leaving a black residue.               The body which
distils between 230° and 240° has the formula C*H*Cl*, and is
the chloride of trichlorinated amyle formed in accordance with
the equation

resembles the chloride of trichlorinated amyle.

          M. Boutlerow     on the occurrence    of Acrylic Acid.       381
acid yielded acetic and butyric acids. Rigault.* has recently sub
mitted mucate of lime to fermentation, and has found that the
products were exactly the same as with citric acid.
   By the action of sodium-alcohol upon iodoform, iodide of me
thylene is formed. Boutlerow, who examinedf this question,
has repeated; his experiments on a larger scale, and has found
that two organic acids are also formed. When the crude product
of the action was mixed with water, iodide of methylene was pre
cipitated; and when the supernatant liquor was distilled with
excess of tartaric acid, an acid distillate was obtained, which was
neutralized with soda and evaporated to dryness.              On treating
this mass with    hydrochloric   acid,  an   oily liquid  separated  which
was submitted to fractional distillation.         The first portion boiled
at a little over 100°. It was found to consist of acrylic acid. Its
silver salt had the characteristic serrated form of acrylate of silver,
and was reduced on boiling.        The analytical results confirmed
this conclusion.
   The other portion of the distillate boiled between 195° and
198°, but was decomposed by further rectification.                 It is a
colourless, thickish fluid, with a taste suggestive of both acetic
acid and Pelargonium zonale.          It decomposes carbonates, and
forms with the alkalies and alkaline earths soluble crystalline
salts.    It has the formula C*H*0°. Boutlerow considers it to
be analogous to Heintz’s new acid S, and calls it valerolactic
acid.   The small quantity formed has, however, prevented the
determination of this point.
   Gerhardt expressed the opinion that furfurol was the aldehyde
of pyromucic acid. Schwanert and Schulz have recently found ||
that this hypothesis is correct. According to Schulz, furfurol
by treatment with oxide of silver is converted into pyromucate
of silver, with the separation of metallic silver. Schwanert has
found, on the other hand, that freshly prepared furfurol forms a
crystalline compound with alkaline bisulphites when it is mixed
with a concentrated solution and left to spontaneous evaporation
over sulphuric acid.
   By the destructive distillation of mucate of ammonium, Mala
guti obtained a body of the formula C*H*N*0, which he called
pyromucamide.        Schwanert has investigated this body, and con
siders it to be the amide of a new acid, carbopyrrolic acid.

examine” the acids contained in gum benzoin. They found that
benzoic acid is not contained in all varieties of the resin.    In
some cases, especially in the benzoin from Sumatra, an acid was
found which crystallized differently from benzoic acid, and melted
under hot water to a clear oil, yet by oxidation yielded                                                   oil   of

    7th. A map of the “atmospheric lines” compiled from the
independent observations of the two authors.         These lines and bands
are visible only when the sun is rising or setting, that is to say, when
his beams traverse a long stratum of our atmosphere. In some cases
they are merely the deepening of bands seen at any time, in other
cases they are bands which appear for the first time when the sun
is close to the horizon.     Professor Piazzi Smyth has represented some
of these lines in his delineations of the spectrum as observed from
the Peak of Teneriffe, whence he had the advantage of seeing the
sun at an altitude of –1° 1. The most remarkable of the atmo
spheric lines are situated in the orange and yellow spaces, and one
band just beyond D is discernible in the diffused light of a dull day
at any hour, though it covers what is about the brightest part of the
prismatic image obtained from direct sunshine. The western sky
after sunset exhibits these phenomena in a striking manner, and with
some variations that do not appear to depend altogether on the
absence or presence of moisture, although when the sun looms red
through a fog these lines also make their appearance.          They are in
no  respect  due to the mere reduction in the     quantity of  light.
   The dispersion and absorption of the more refrangible rays by the
atmosphere, and by fogs, smoke, and such media as dilute milk and
water, is a quite independent phenomenon.
   8th and 9th. Enlarged views of A and B, when the light is acted
upon by a long passage through the atmosphere.
    10th. A map of the spectrum, exhibiting on a large scale the dark
lines and bands which were seen by Sir David Brewster when nitrous
acid gas is interposed between the prism and the source of light.
Their position is identified by the insertion of the principal lines of
the solar spectrum. They differ considerably from a smaller drawing
of the same by Professor W. A. Miller, who employed a deeper
stratum of the red gas.
   The light of the moon, which is only that of the sun reflected from
her surface, exhibits          all

  phosphorus,      a given weight of the platinum salt, 0:547 grim., was
  oxidized with mitric acid, and gave 0.458 grim. of sulphate of baryta
  = 11 per cent. of sulphur, and 0.266 of pyrophosphate of magnesia
  =6:01 per cent. of phosphorus.           I also ascertained the presence of
  these two substances by heating a certain quantity of the platinum
  salt with strong caustic ley, when a liquid, volatile and inflammable
  alkaloid was obtained, whilst the sulphur * and phosphorus remained
 combined with the alkali and were easily detected.           I satisfied myself
 during these researches, which have lasted more than twelve months,
 that no sulphuretted nor phosphuretted hydrogen was given off; and
 my researches, as far as they have proceeded, tend to prove that the
  noxious vapours given off during putrefaction, contain the N, S, and
 Ph of the animal substance, and that these elements are not liberated
 in the simple form of ammonia, and sulphuretted and phosphuretted
 hydrogen.       I also remarked during this investigation, that, as putre
 faction proceeds, different volatile bodies are given off.
     Before concluding, I may add, that when the platinum salts are
 heated in small test-tubes, they give off vapours, some acid and
 some alkaline, possessing a most obnoxious and sickening odour,
 very like the odours of putrefaction; and that at the same time a
 white crystalline sublimate, which is not chloride of ammonium, is
 formed.

     The following communications        were  read:—
     “On the Electrical Phenomena which accompany Muscular Con
traction.”      By Professor C. Matteucci.
     Dr. Radcliffe has recently communicated to the Royal Society
 some observations on the nature of the electrical phenomena accom
 panying muscular contraction.          It is known that M. du Bois-Rey
mond admits that the muscular current diminishes during contrac
tion, and that he attributes the phenomena indicated by the galva
nometer to the momentary predominance of currents due to the
   olarization of the electrodes of platinum over the muscular current.
   n my last memoir on Electro-physiology, which was communicated
to the Royal Society and appeared in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1856, I proved that these phenomena take place independently
of the existence of secondary currents of the electrodes, and hence     I
concluded, at least as regards the muscles of frogs, that during con
traction there is a current, or rather an instantaneous electrical
discharge, which takes a contrary direction to that of the relawed
gastrocnemius, and in general to that of the current which is found
on applying the extremities of the galvanometer to the extremities
of the limbs of a frog.
    In order to avoid the influence of secondary polarity, M. du Bois
Reymond, and after him several other German physiologists, have
    * Some of the platinum salt was treated with C S2, which did not remove any
free S, and the beautiful orange-yellow colour of the precipitate showed    the
                                                                                -

Electrical Phaenomena accompanying Muscular Contraction.                                                                389
thought it expedient to contract and tetanize the gastrocnemius
before closing the circuit of the galvanometer; the deviation thus
obtained is feebler than that which is due to the current of a muscle
in repose, but never in a contrary direction to that due to this
                                      -
current.
     Ihave already remarked * that this result accords with that
which is obtained by the ordinary experiment, in which the muscular
current is in circulation previously to the contraction of the muscle.
In fact, we know that by continuing to keep the muscle in contrac
tion, above      when the muscle remains tetanized, the electric phe

during contraction, towards zero, but only more slowly than        would                                         it

possible before the contractions: this object is best ensured in the
following way:-I prepare the frog by reducing it to two thighs,
leaving a single lumbar nerve in order to obtain contractions in one
of the thighs. Instead of saturated solution of sulphate of zinc,                                        I
employed a weak solution of this salt, in order to avoid any alteration
of the surface of the muscles; and finally, in order to maintain exactly
the same points of contact between the two electrodes and the two
near points of the middle portion of the thigh,             employ two fine     I
woollen cords or two thin     strips of card-board fixed with sealing-wax
on a  plate  of  glass  and soaked in the same solution.          The experi
ment is made       by  applying  the   glass  plate with a certain pressure
on the   thigh, so that the two cords on one side touch the thigh, and
on the other are placed in contact with the cushions of flannel or
card-board which are immersed together with the electrodes, accord
ing to the method followed by M. du Bois-Reymond.
     Ithink it useful to describe in a few words a little apparatus
which affords a good deal of facility for making these experiments.
It consists in a small square block of wood, with a cavity deep
enough to receive the electrodes and the cushions.               It is hardly
necessary to say that this cavity is coated with a varnish of sealing
wax and divided in the middle by a glass plate.            Another cavity in
the same block serves as a recipient for the two thighs; the sciatic
nerve extends beyond the block, and rests on two platinum wires
which communicate with the pile or with the electro-magnetic ma
chine.    The communication between the thigh and the electrodes is
established by means of the glass plate in the manner above de
scribed, that            is,

the needle are observed through            telescope (lunette).

among other things of the muscular movements resulting from the
action of a galvanic current upon a motor or mixed nerve, Pro
fessor Claude Bernard says that some of the more important of
these movements have been overlooked, and he quotes an account
of some investigations by Dr. Rousseau of Wezy, which do away with
certain very perplexing variations in the order of these movements.
  The movements resulting from the action of a galvanic current upon
nerve are usually divided into the three periods of double, alternate,
and single contraction which are set down in the following Table:—

   Now Dr. Rousseau shows that the order of contraction set down
in the second Table is due to the action of this derived current. He
shows, also, that by excluding the derived current (which he does
by means of an ingenious triple arrangement of poles called the
“rhéophore bifurqué”), the order of contraction becomes one and
the same in the case where the nerve is divided and lifted up at its
end, and in the case where the nerve is arranged in a loop, the order
being that which is set down in the first Table.
  On inquiring into these matters experimentally, the author finds
reason to believe that Professor                          Bernard         has wandered into some
degree   of           and that the path of inquiry opened out by Dr.
                      error,
Rousseau is not     only   a right path, so far as       discoverer has tracedits
it  out, but that         leadsit     the explanation
                                               to          some very curious    of
alternating movements which have not hitherto been described. He
has been led, also,        form certain conjectures respecting the modus
                                to

to  simplify this very difficult and complex subject.

a piece   of wet string or paper, by a strip of the animal's skin, by a
piece   of wire, or by any other conductor, it matters not what, the
contractions occur alternately in the two legs just as they did before
the nerve was divided.        Nay, it may be argued from the following
experiment, that reflex nervous action has nothing to do in producing
these alternations.     Divide the lumbar nerves on one side, not where
they emerge from the spine, but where they pass into the thigh ;
raise the divided end of the nerve, and place it across the poles of
the galvanic apparatus.         In this case the circuit of the derived cur
rent is broken, and the action of this current is therefore put out of
the question.      In this case, the nerve acted upon by the current is
still in connexion with the spinal cord, and through the cord and the
nerves proceeding from this cord, with the limb on the opposite side;
and hence it might be supposed that the current might irritate the
cord, and so provoke contraction in the limb on the opposite side.
 But the simple fact           is,
                             that the current may         passed inversely
                                                                        be                           or
directly without producing contraction anywhere, except now and

    Let the following diagram and table represent the case in which a
 loop of sciatic nerve is acted upon by the direct primitive current,
 a being the nerve, PN the poles of the galvanic apparatus, the black
 arrow the primitive current, the dotted arrows the derived current;
 and it will be seen that the portion of nerve between the negative
 pole and the leg is acted upon by an inverse derived current, and
 that the thigh is traversed by a direct derived current.        Thus—

in the leg when the current ceases to pass.

 Dr. Radcliffe on the Action of a Galvanic Current upon Nerve.                     397
 to the leg, is direct derived current. The diagram will also seem to
 show that the thigh ought to contract at the end of the current, for
 the thigh is traversed by inverse derived current.     In fact, however,
 the  thigh does not contract either at the   beginning  or at the end of
 the current; and this perhaps is not to be wondered at ; for the
 author finds that contraction attends upon the beginning of a direct
 current of a given strength for some time after it has ceased to
 attend upon the end of an inverse current of the same strength.
    3. The modus operandi of galvanism upon a motor or mixed nerve
 is a subject beset with difficulties; but some of these difficulties do
 not appear to be altogether insurmountable.
    (a) In looking at the movements belonging to the first period—
 that of double contraction (vide Table I.)—it is not difficult to find
a reason which will in some degree explain how it is that contraction
is confined to the beginning and end of the current.       It is not diffi
 cult to see that the beginning and ending of the galvanic current in
 the nerve may involve certain changes in the strength of the nerve
 current, and that these changes may in their turn give rise to
momentary induced currents in the nerve and in the neighbourhood;
for such momentary currents are induced, not only when a current
begins to pass and when it ceases to pass, but also at the moments
when it undergoes any change of strength.       It is not difficult to see,
also, that the muscular fibres to which the nerve is distributed may
be the seat of some of the secondary currents thus induced, and that
these fibres may be thrown into contraction by these currents.        Nor
is it difficult to see—if the contraction be thus connected with the
induced currents—that there will be no contraction in the interval
between the beginning and ending of the inducing galvanic current;
for if the inducing current exhibits no variation in strength, there is
no secondary current induced in this interval.
    (b) It is, perhaps, too much       expect
                                          to      present full explana

tion of   the second  period    of
                                contraction—of that period, that                      is,
which the contraction alternates      the beginning

   The second fact is furnished by Professor du Bois-Reymond in an
experiment in which the two ends of a long portion of nerve are
placed upon the cushions of two galvanometers, and the middle of
the nerve is laid across the poles of a galvanic apparatus.    Looking
at the needles of the  galvanometers  before passing  the galvanic cur
rent, they are seen to diverge under the action of the nerve-current;
and from the direction of the divergence, it is evident that this cur
rent passes from the end to the side of the nerve.      Looking at the
needles while the galvanic current is passing, one needle is found to
move still further from zero, the other is found to return towards
zero. Let A B be the nerve; let the arrows a a' and b b' be the

Dr. Radcliffe on the Action of a Galvanic Current upon Nerve.                                                                 399
tinuous and induced currents are made to act upon the nerve. Thus
the induced currents produce contraction if applied after the direct
continuous current, but not if applied after the inverse continuous
current.   Nay, it would even seem as if the direct current is actu
ally favourable to contraction; for a solution of salt, which of itself
is too weak to produce tetanus when applied to a nerve, will have
this effect when a direct current is made to pass through another
portion of the same nerve. In performing this experiment, Professor
Eckardt proceeds as follows:–First of                   tetanizes       frog's      all     he

   When the inverse current passes, there is no contraction at the
beginning of the current, for the influence of this current upon the
nerve-current is one which antagonizes contraction; when the inverse
current ceases to pass there is contraction, for then the influence
which antagonized contraction is removed. When, on the other
hand, the direct current passes, there is contraction at the beginning
of the current, for the influence of the current upon the nerve-current
is one which favours contraction; when the direct current ceases to
pass, there is no contraction, for then the influence is no longer one
which favours contraction.
   (c) In the third period—that of single contraction—the muscular
movements resulting from the action of a galvanic current upon
nerve are at first sight somewhat perplexing; but with a little
thought, it may be seen that the same key will apply to their.
interpretation.                                                    , -

underlying the boulder-clay between Cruden and Slains, on the

shelly sands and gravels he has since more carefully examined, and
he refers them to the age of either the Red or the Mammaliferous

   “On some      small fossil Vertebrae from near Frome, Somersetshire.”
By Prof. Owen, F.R.S., F.G.S.
  In this communication Prof. Owen described three minute Verte
brae  discovered by Charles Moore, Esq., F.G.S., in an agglomerate
occupying a fissure of the Carboniferous Limestone near Frome
in Somersetshire, in company with teeth of a small Mammal allied
to the Microlestes of Plieninger.     The vertebrae are stated to cor
respond in size with the teeth of Microlestes; but to have Reptilian
characters, especially in their biconcave structure,       a character
common in Mesozoic Saurians, but rare in the existing genera.
There appears to be but very slight grounds for supposing that such
a character may have ever belonged to any Mammals, although some
of the existing Monotremata have peculiar vertebral modifications
somewhat resembling, in these respects, the structural features of
Reptiles.     In their large and anchylosed neural arch, however, these
little vertebrae present a mammalian character.
    Remains also of small Saurians and Fishes occur in considerable
numbers with the vertebrae in question, as well as the more rare
mammalian teeth.

dynamic effects                 are      seen    under theseand it is notconditions,
evident a  priori that the slow movement of      electricity is subject to
the same laws as that which    regulates electric currents. The object
of this memoir is to show that Ohm's law, which applies to a
constant current, applies also to the slow propagation of electricity
in cases in which the electric flow may be considered to be constant.
He has found that the mode of propagation is the same in both
cases, and that the results attained in studying the case of imperfect
conductors, throw great light on important questions in reference
to true currents.
   The instrument which serves to measure the tension is a gold
leaf electroscope; the separation of the leaves is determined by
means of a telescope and a scale. The author employs two different
methods for measuring the intensity of the electric flow.        The
method of the duration of the flow consists in  giving  such a charge
to the electroscope that the gold leaves take a position A; it is put
in communication with the ground by means of the conductor
through which the electricity flows, and the time t is measured
which elapses while the gold leaves pass from the position A to
another position B. Q being the quantity of electricity lost by the

time.       The conductor is                    removed        and the experiment is repeated,

intensity        of electric flow in the conductor employed.
                        the                                           The
second method consists in employing a discharging electroscope
the gold-leaf of which comes in contact with a small copper ball
communicating with the ground. The conductor in which electricity
is propagated puts a reservoir of electricity in connexion with this
electroscope; and the intensity of the flow may be obtained from the
number of             its
                discharges       given time.

    3. The conductor must have such dimensions that the flow is
considerable.
    4. Before commencing each experiment, the tension of the appa
ratus must be kept constant for some time, in order - that the con
ducting wire may attain a permanent state.
     Variation of the tension in different parts of the conductor.—The
tension of the string, which at one end is connected with the
electroscope, and at the other with the ground, has half the tension
of the source. It has been found, moreover, that, by employing
the method of discharges, the dynamic charge of a string, that is to
say, the quantity of electricity with which it is charged while the
discharge takes place, is half the static charge, or the charge which
it has while in connexion with the source of electricity not insulated
from the ground.
    The laws of derived currents have been verified by the same
method, by connecting the electroscope with the ground by several
strings simultaneously, and by forked strings.
     The intensity of the flow is proportional to the tension of the source,
if   the extremity of the string is in contact with the ground.—The
gold-leaf electroscope was graduated so as to determine two tensions,
 which were in the ratio of 1 to 2; and the method of discharges
 showed that the intensity of the flow was perceptibly in the same
ratio.
     The intensity of the flow is proportional to the section of the con
ductor.—A first series of experiments showed that the flow did not
vary, when the section of the conductor was constant, even when
 the surface varied.       With cotton threads, whether insulated or
 bound together, the intensity of the flow was not modified. The
 same result was obtained with a silk ribbon, which was successively
 folded so as to form a plain surface, rolled several times on itself,
 and lastly rolled once so as to form a cylindrical sac.
     A second series of experiments was made by using columns of oil
 of different lengths and sections, and measuring each time the corre    -
                               -
 sponding flows.
     On the dynamic charge.—The meaning of this term has been
 explained, and it has been seen that it is double the statical charge.
 This result agrees with Ohm’s law on the distribution of tensions
 on the course of a conductor, and shows at the same time that the
  dynamic charge, like the statical, is distributed on the surface of
 the conductor. The author has endeavoured to confirm this principle
 by other experiments, showing that the dynamic discharge depends
 on the surface of the conductor, and not, as with the flow, on the
 section solely.     Thus the dynamic discharge of ten insulated cotton
 threads bears to these threads united in a bundle the ratio 2 to 1.
  Analogous results have been obtained by using silk ribbons in
  different shapes.—Annales de Chimie et de Physique, vol. lix. p. 5;

   DESCRIPTION OF AN APPARATUS FOR GENERATING HYDROGEN,
      CARBONIC ACID, AND SULPHURETTED                HYDROGEN.     BY G.
      GORE, ESQ.
    Having frequently during the last two years found the following
apparatus of great convenience in generating hydrogen, carbonic
acid, and sulphuretted hydrogen for lectures and other purposes, I
beg leave to submit a description of it to the readers of the Philo
sophical Magazine.                                           ‘FF
    A is a large glass jar with a capacious hol
low glass stopper B (shown in section) fitted
perfectly gas-tight; C is a perforated and
 greased cork fitted into the central hole of the
 stopper; a cylindrical rod of glass, D, of very
 uniform diameter, and slightly enlarged at the
 ends to a knob-like form,passes tightly through
 the cork, and supports by means of a ring E
 and hook F (see separate sketch), a copper or
 leaden bucket G ; the bucket is perforated at
 its sides, and has also radial slits in its conical
 lower end to admit the acid water; the hollow
 stopper has two small openings—H to re
 ceive a cork, and I to receive a bent exit-tube,
 J, for the escape of the   gas; K and K'is a sec
 tion of an annular leaden weight placed for the
 purpose of preventing the pressure of the en
 closed gas lifting the stopper; and L is a small
 clamp-screw to prevent the rod D slipping
 downwards by accident. The rod D should be
 rather thick, to prevent risk of fracture; and the
 brass ring E, which supports the hook F, should
 be sufficiently loose upon the rod to turn round
 freely.   The different parts of the sketch are
 drawn of their relative sizes.
     For hydrogen a copper bucket is used, and
 for sulphuretted hydrogen a thin leaden one.
 The bucket and its contents, i. e. granulated
 zinc, chalk, or sulphide of iron, in small frag
 ments, can be readily lowered and sustained at
  any depth of immersion in the acid water, and
  a steady flow of gas obtained: for hydrogen I
  have most frequently used a mixture of 2 mea
  sures of hydrochloric acid and 1% of water, or a

 equally applicable here, as are also the same contrivances for pho
 tographic registry, with trifling alterations corresponding to the dif
 ference between expansion and condensation of gas.
     Having alluded to the application of convex lenses to increase the
 sensitiveness of actinometers, I may as well add that, to avoid the
 concentration of heat as well as light, we must, at least when opera
 ting with the sun's rays, make them pass, either before entering or
 after leaving the lens, through some medium which will intercept (or
 metamorphose) the heat rays, e. g. blue glass or coloured solutions,
 or some one of those salts (either solid or in solution) which are
known for their adiathermic properties, or else we may have the lens
itself constructed of one of these substances.
    In conclusion, the amount of success which has already attended
the efforts to measure what we may for convenience call the cyanic
actinism, suggests the desirableness of attempts being made to obtain
some similar system of registry (either by properly prepared papers,
or liquids, or gases) of the strength of that opposite influence lower
down in the spectrum which has been made known to us by Dr.
Draper and Mr. R. Hunt; and our success thus far may then suggest
further the possibility of our being able separately to identify and to
contrive some measurement for some of the many other powers pro

                             ARSENIC IN COAL.
    At a recent meeting (Oct. 16) of the Manchester Literary and
 Philosophical Society, Dr. R. Angus Smith gave a short account of
 his examination of coal pyrites for arsenic.       He stated that although
 the knowledge of the existence of arsenic in the iron pyrites found
 in coal may not be considered perfectly novel, it certainly does not
 seem to be known that arsenic is so widely disseminated as to form
 an ordinary constituent of the coals burnt in our towns; and chemists
 of celebrity have held, and now hold, it to be absent there. He
 had examined fifteen specimens of coal in Lancashire, and found
 arsenic in thirteen.      He had also found it in a few others; but Mr.
 Binney having promised a collection, properly arranged, the exa
 mination will then be made more complete.           Mr. Dugald Campbell
 had also  lately  found arsenic in coal   pyrites;  this had a very direct
 bearing on our sanitary knowledge, as we must now be obliged to
add arsenic to the number of impurities in the atmosphere of our
large towns.      It is true that he had not actually obtained it from the
atmosphere; but when the pyrites is burnt the arsenic burns and is
carried off along with the sulphur.       One or two coal brasses (as they
are called) contained copper, a metal that is also to some extent
volatilized, as may be readily observed wherever copper-soldering
takes place.     Although an extremely small amount of copper is car
ried up from furnaces, it is not well entirely to ignore         it.   The
amount   of   arsenic, however,    is probably not without considerable
influence; and we may probably learn the reason why some towns
seem less affected than others
                                    bythe burning  of       by
                                                       coals,   examining
the amount    of  arsenic burnt     well
                                   as     assulphur.

LV. On        the Form of Satellites revolving at small distances from
               their Primaries.   By DANIEL WAUGHAN*.
                     planets which revolve at comparatively small
        distances from great central orbs, experience very singular
effects from akind of disturbing action, which is either wholly
imperceptible on the primaries themselves, or is only manifested
in producing an alternate rise and fall of their extensive occans.
The powerful attraction of Jupiter must cause his nearest satel
lite to feel a tidal force several thousand times greater than that
which every day swells our terrestrial waters; and the variation
of gravity on the surface of the small world, from this disturb
ance alone, may be estimated as nearly five times as great as our
own globe exhibits in consequence of                            its
                                                diurnal movement.

 and each of these is the equation         of a conic passing through -  the
 three cubic centres.
    If  two of the three centres coincide, then the conics all touch

 will be a line passing through the last-mentioned point and one
of the other points of intersection: k or 6 will of course be de
termined by a cubic equation; and if this has a pair of equal
roots, the conics will touch. But the equation of the line, com
bined with those of the two conics, gives

    These strings or veins are described as entirely composed of
 this mineral in a state of great purity, but very narrow, seldom
 attaining the breadth of more than 2 inches across. The spe
 cimen which was examined appeared to represent the entire
 thickness of such a vein, and is a mass of about 1% inch across,
 composed of the pure mineral free from gangue or extraneous
 metallic compounds, but having                             its

  In the Analysis A                the arsenic was determined from the amount
of arseniate of magnesia and ammonia, previously dried at 212°F.,
obtained by dissolving 11.01 grs. of the mineral in nitrohy
drochloric acid, supersaturating with ammonia, and afterwards
adding chloride of magnesium along with chloride of ammonium.
The silver was determined by cupellation, and the copper reck
oned as loss.
  In   the Analyses B, C, and D, the silver was, as before, esti
mated by cupellation with lead; but the arsenic, on the con
trary, was reckoned as loss after determining the copper present
by the blowpipe as follows:—
   From 1 to 2 grains of the mineral were fused upon charcoal
in reducing flame along with a very small amount of borax
glass and a previously tared globule of pure gold, the globule of
gold being from 3 to 4 grains in weight: when perfectly fused,
the united globule was separated from the adherent borax-glass
by dipping it into water after solidification, but whilst still hot,
This globule was then placed in a charcoal bore, and, after fusion,
very carefully treated with a gentle oxidating flame as long as
arsenical flames were evolved, and until the instant when the
greenish appearance peculiar to melted copper when pure was
observed, when it was found to have eliminated all the arsenic,
and there remained a perfectly malleable red metallic button of
an alloy of gold and copper, the weight of which, less that of the
globule of pure gold added, gave the amount of copper and silver
present in the ore; and deducting from this the proportionate
quantity of silver found by cupelling with lead a separate portion
of the mineral, the quantity of copper present was ascertained.
   The results obtained by this method are very accurate; and it
can frequently be used with advantage in determining copper in
compounds of this metal with arsenic when free from sulphur.
Iron and gangue do not affect           accuracy,   its
                                                      they are slagged    as
off easily    the fusion with borax-glass.

LIX. A         Theory of Galvanic Force.                         By Professor CHALLIs, F.R.S.*
          AVINGargued in previous communications that the laws
        of Light, Heat, Gravity, and Electricity may be conse
quences of the dynamic action of an elastic fluid medium, I
proceed now to apply the principles of the same theory to the
facts of galvanism. As it is hardly possible that so comprehen
sive a theory could escape the contradiction of facts, unless it
were well founded, every extension of it to new classes of facts
without meeting with contradictions, and without the necessity
 of new hypotheses, adds greatly to the evidence for its truth,
 In art. 18 of the “Theory of Electric Force,” given in the Oc
 tober Number,             I
                    have shown that electrical attractions and repul
 sions might be explained consistently with hydrodynamic action
by the hypothesis of aetherial currents,             Now it is this very
hypothesis which is required for explaining by the same kind of
action the laws of galvanism,             It must be assumed, on the
hydrodynamical theory, that there exist in the neighbourhood of
 the earth steady atherial currents, which within considerable
 spaces may be considered to be of uniform velocity and density,
By the solution of Problem II., in the “Theory of Attractive
Forces” contained in the Philosophical Magazine for No
vember 1859, it appears that these currents would produce no
motion of translation of small solid spheres, such as the ulti
mate atoms of bodies are assumed to be.                But the same cur
rents    might,   under the circumstances stated in art. 18 above
referred        to,
              give rise        steady secondary currents, which, not
                                         to
 being uniform            velocity and density, might

internal atomic actions are equal and opposite at any point of
the interior if the density of the body be uniform.              Hence,
besides the rapid gradations of density near the boundary, which
give rise to the superficial attractions and repulsions, there must
be a much slower gradation of density throughout the interior
of the substance; and as the atomic and molecular repulsions
are much more affected by difference of density than the mole
cular attractions, the force of gravity is counteracted by repul
sions, and the density consequently decreases from the lower to
the upper part of the body. Now it is clear that in this example
the deviations of the superficial atoms, and those of the interior
atoms, from their undisturbed state, are mutually dependent, and
that     all
           are connected with the molecular action          the point of                at

be anticipated that the action between a solid and a fluid would
be considerable, on account of the dissimilarity of their super
ficial molecular conditions.     If a chemical affinity exists between
the solid and the     fluid, the disturbance may be expected to be
still greater, because such affinity exhibits itself by a tendency
in the superficial action so far to disturb the atoms as to put
them into new relations. The action between two gases (as
oxygen and hydrogen) which tend to combine might produce
sensible secondary currents, while no such effect would follow
from the contact of two gases (as oxygen and nitrogen) which
have no chemical affinity.       These are, in short, facts of experi
ence which are at once seen to be in accordance with the theory,
if it may be assumed that the secondary atherial currents of the
theory are the same as the galvanic currents of eaperiment.
     On this assumption the theory explains the fact that sub
stances which generate galvanic currents are good conductors of
electricity, and exhibits the connexion of the development of
electricity with the generation of the currents.
     3. It appears from experiment that different substances have
 different powers of transmitting galvanic currents. There are         .
 conductors and non-conductors of galvanism, as of electricity;
 and, generally, the substances which conduct electricity also
 conduct galvanic currents. Air is a non-conductor as well of
 galvanic currents as of electricity. The ratio of the two con
 ductive powers does not appear to be the same for different
 substances.     It does not belong to the present theory to inquire
 into the reasons for these facts, which are mentioned here only
 because they bear upon the subsequent             explanation of the
 hydrodynamical theory.
     For instance, it may be asked, if the origin of galvanic cur
 rents be such as the theory indicates, why do not the same
 attractions and repulsions of light bodies take place in the
 neighbourhood of the voltaic battery as in the neighbourhood of
 a body whose electricity is excited by friction ? To this I reply
 that the induced electricity at any point of the voltaic battery is
 very much feebler than the electricity induced when the original
  disturbance of the superficial atoms is caused by friction, and
  the currents due to a feeble induction are proportionally feeble.
  Any perceptible motive power of partial currents, acting through
  the air, may be prevented by the non-conductiveness of the air
  itself, and the insulation of the battery. But when the separate
  streams excited at a great number of points (as in a large
  battery consisting of numerous cells) are, as it were, concen
  trated in an electrode of fine wire, considerable motive power
  acts through the air, as is evident by the known action of such
  electrodes on each other when, being arranged so as to be near

and parallel to each other, they are at the same time free to
II.10VC.
     4. The question as to whether the galvanic currents owe
their origin to the contact of dissimilar substances, or to che
mical action, has been much discussed on experimental grounds.
Looking at it from the point of view of the hydrodynamical
theory, the conclusions that will be come to are, that the cur
rents are due to the mutual molecular actions of dissimilar
substances in contact; that chemical affinity between the sub
stances augments the molecular actions, and consequently the
strength of the currents; and that chemical combination, or
analysis, is not necessary for the generation of the currents, but
may be a consequence of them.           I consider the theory to be in
complete accordance with the two following inferences, which
occur in an exposition of the experimental evidence bearing on
this point by Mr. Gassiot (Philosophical Transactions, 1844,
p. 39).     “Elective affinity is greatly concerned in the antecedent
action, of which chemical combinations, when the circuit is
closed, are the consequence” (§ (26)).         “The higher the che
mical affinities    used, the  greater was the evidence of the deve
lopment of tension * (Note at the end of the Paper).
     5. The explanation which the hydrodynamical theory gives of
the chemical action consequent upon the generation of the cur
rents, will be best stated after a more particular consideration
of the nature of the currents, considered as instances of steady
fluid motion. The origin of the movement being at the battery,
and the current flowing from the right hand through the battery
to the left hand, the fluid will be impelled on the left hand, and
will be drawn on the right hand.           It will enter the conductor
at one pole, and issue out at the other; and by this circum
stance the two poles will be permanently distinguished.           The
direction of the stream       depends  on the order of the   elements,
the stream resulting from a difference of action of the elements;
and if the order be not the same throughout the battery, op
posing streams will be generated.           Now it does not appear
possible for steady currents to give rise to forces adequate to
produce chemical analysis, except by considerable changes of
velocity within small spaces.        By hydrodynamics, the variation
of    pressure  dp  in an   elementary   portion ds of a line s drawn
in the direction in which the stream flows, is proportional to
 —WaW, dW being the corresponding variation of the velocity V

of the stream is accompanied by a decrement of pressure, and
consequently an accelerative force, in the same direction; and,
on the contrary, a decrement of the velocity in the direction of
the stream produces an accelerative force in the opposite direc

   7. Let us now consider the process of generation of aetherial
currents, and their dynamical action, in the experiment of the
galvanic battery.    It will suffice to take the simple case of a
plate of zinc and a plate of copper immersed in an acid solution.
The chemical action between the fluid and zinc may be such as
to produce analysis of the fluid anterior to any galvanic current,
while no such action takes place at the surface of the copper.
This difference between the relations of the metals to the fluid is
an essential condition of the generation of a current.     The che
mical  affinity between the acid solution and the    zinc,  causes a
change of position of the superficial atoms of the latter, and
puts it into an electric state, the action of the fluid taking the
place of friction in the phaenomena of ordinary electricity.                                                      If

the zinc plate were alone immersed in the fluid,      the points
 itssurface would           the same electric state; but being

of lateral action.   The velocity within the wire is also increased
by the contraction of the channel by the occupation of space by
the atoms.     Now as the axis of the electrode thus becomes a
line of maximum velocity, and therefore of minimum density,
there must be a tendency of the contiguous fluid to flow towards
this axis.   But if this motion actually took place, the stream
would immediately be stopped.       Hence this tendency must be
counteracted   by  a uniform circular movement kept up by the
accelerative force due to the decrement of density towards the
axis. Thus the resulting motion will be in spiral lines about the
electrode.  This conclusion will be put to a severe test when we
come to consider the mutual action of galvanic currents and
magnets.
   11. It is readily seen from this theory why the current flows
as soon as two wires connected with the poles of a battery are
put in contact; for by the action of the battery the fluid is im
pelled along one wire, and drawn along the other, and the circu
lation of the stream results from the junction. Simple contact
suffices to produce the effect, apparently because it provides an
axis for the spiral movement, which, as explained above, is ne
cessary for maintaining the current.      It is not so easily seen
why there is no current unless the poles are brought into con
mexion.    When the ends of the wires are in air, it is sufficient
to  say that the air, being a non-conductor, stops the flow of the
current, the explanation of the non-conductive property being
not at present under consideration.          But the experiments of
Mr. Gassiot have     proved  (Phil.  Trans, vol. cxlix, part 1. p. 156)
that a perfect vacuum is a non-conductor.            The explanation of
this fact must be drawn from the laws of movement of the aethe
                                             I
rial fluid. On this point have the following considerations to
offer.   Assuming that galvanic currents are identical with a the
rial currents, experience shows that the conductive property of
a substance allows an aetherial stream to permeate freely through
 its whole interior, and, supposing                   insulated, that

 vanic discharges, the former being abrupt and violent streams

 continuous effect of            disturbed state of the interior atoms.

 These conditions           the superficial and the interior atoms are,
                             of
 however,        intimately connected, that when the galvanic current
                so

440            Prof. Challis on a Theory of Galvanic Force.
is flowing in a closed circuit, it must be supposed that very
minute and rapid electric discharges are taking place at the
same time.
   16. The light and heat accompanying electric and galvanic
discharges may, according to the Undulatory Theories of Light
and Heat which I have proposed, be ascribed to vibrations of the
atoms of acriform or solid bodies, excited by the dynamic action
of aetherial currents. When the electrodes terminate in charcoal
points, the dynamic action is increased both by the condensation
of the streams due to the pointed form, and, on approaching the
points, by the impulse given to the streams in consequence of
the opposite states of electricity of the terminals.
   It seems to be a sufficient explanation of the voltaic arc, to
say that the         air

                             Dr. P. L. Rijke on the Inductive Spark.                                       441
 stroys the symmetrical arrangement of the density of the aether
about them; and since when they are distant from each other
the density decreases towards their axes, on their being brought
near, the space between them becomes a position of minimum
density, towards which they are consequently attracted.               the                             If
currents pass in opposite directions, by their interference they
produce an excess of density between the electrodes, which are
consequently repelled, as is known experimentally. The inter
ference of the transverse motions would produce the contrary
effects.   It seems, therefore, that the observed attractions and
repulsions are due to the excess of the longitudinal above the
transverse action of the currents.
    20. It is scarcely necessary to say that the velocity of a gal
vanic current in an electrode is very different from the velocity
with which the commencement of the current, or any interruption
of      it,   as
             the use

                         the electric telegraph, would       propagated                  be
along the electrode through space. The latter velocity,              hy                               on
drodynamical principles, would            comparable with the velocity

of   transmission      light through solid substances, and would

a  substance     the same density
                          of            the electrode.      as

current of air or gas. Another French philosopher, M. Perrot,
afterwards discovered” that the heating power of this luminous
atmosphere is much greater than that of the true spark; and at
the same time he found the means of completely separating the
atmosphere from the rest of the spark. For this purpose M.
Perrot opposed to one of the electrodes another of a
and found that, by suitably regulating the distance of the extre
                                                                                                    #.
mities of the latter from the former, he could establish an atmo
spheric current which carried the luminous atmosphere towards
that branch of the V-shaped electrode which was more remote
from the opposite pole.    Under these circumstances the lumi
nous atmosphere appeared only at this latter branch, the other
branch receiving the ordinary spark. About the same time
M. du Moncel submitted the inductive spark to the action of
powerful electro-magnets, and discövered that while the ordinary
spark is entirely unaffected by magnetic force, this luminous
atmosphere appears affected in precisely the same manner as the
voltaic arc under similar circumstances.

444                 Dr. P. L. Rijke on                         the Inductive             Spark.
which resist the effect of the ordinary spark: thus, for example,
gunpowder can be exploded by the spark of a Leyden jar, if the
electric fluid is first passed through a wet cord.   Now these are
precisely the characteristics that have been recognized as existing
in the luminous atmosphere of the inductive spark.
   6. According to the theory here advanced, we ought to be able
to augment the luminous atmosphere at the expense of the true
spark, and, conversely, the spark at the expense of the atmosphere,
as   follows:—

concluding, from the foregoing facts, that in the inductive spark
the point of light is to be attributed to the recomposition of the
electric charges accumulated in the extremities of the secondary
wire, while the luminous atmosphere is produced by the electric
fluids contained in the parts of the wire nearer to                                            its   middle point.

general, the oxides of the precious metals, &c.; sometimes, even,
these decompositions are accompanied by a sudden disengage
ment of heat, as is the case with the chloride, iodide, and
sulphide of nitrogen.
   Decompositions which are attended with disengagement of
heat are evidently an eaceptional case, and embarrassing even to
some of the most plausible theories of chemical combinations.
They characterize in a general manner the compounds of nitro
gen, which are never formed directly, or by the simple and
immediate contact of their elements.       The accuracy of this
observation is evident for the majority of explosive nitrogenized
substances, which are resolved into simple bodies at the moment
of their destruction. But for non-explosive nitrogen compounds,
it may be deduced from this important fact, which is confirmed
by MM. Favre and Silbermann, that protoxide of nitrogen in
the phaenomena of combustion which it produces, developes more
heat than the oxygen which it contains would furnish if burnt
alone. It is clear that protoxide of nitrogen, and therefore other
compounds of the same class, disengage heat at the moment of
their destruction.
   If two combustion                     are made with the same quan

tities of potassium   and  sulphur,    employing     in succession crystal
lized octahedral   sulphur  and soft   sulphur,  the latter will disengage
a larger quantity of heat than the octahedral sulphur, and the
difference will be precisely equal to the quantity of heat observed
by M. Regnault when he heated soft sulphur to 92°, and observed
 its temperature spontaneously rise          110°. The quantity

bear a certain relation to the quantity of dissimulated heat which
the bodies retain under the influence of tempering; they also
retain them in a state of unstable equilibrium, which is physically
characterized by a diminution in the density, and is exhibited
by the greater or less facility with which they revert to the

   This mode of expression introduces great simplicity into the
scientific language relating to this question, but it does not
involve a new idea.      It has often guided me in connecting phae
nomena of total or    partial  decomposition, phaenomena of ebulli

solids or liquids.                 I

into the calculation in the slight corrections which must be made
in the temperatures to allow for the heat absorbed by the vessels,

made at a high temperature.

the   product   is necessary for the corrections) there is determined
the   temperature   of combination of two liquid bodies, the density
of the two bodies at the initial temperature, and, lastly, the co
efficient of expansion of the body from the initial temperature to
a point somewhat higher than the temperature of combination ;

the disengagement of heat produced during combination, and
arising from this solidification, might be considerable without
any change in the volume, or without any sensible variation in
the distance of the compound.
   Pursuing the comparisons which have made between affinity I
and the force of cohesion, and supposing (which is in accordance
with prevalent ideas, especially in organic chemistry”) that each
molecule of hydrogen and chlorine is double, we see in fact that
everything I have said about compound bodies and their disso
ciation applies to hydrogen and to chlorine. They are in the same
physical state as water dissociated at 1000°; and at the moment
at which they combine, by rendering it sensible they lose a
quantity of heat corresponding to that which the dissociated
vapour of water ought to give up, in order to revert to          ordi                            its

460           Prof. W. Beetz on                 the    Molecular Changes
contradictory results might be removed, if the experiments were
carried on under precisely similar circumstances.   Add to this,
that Koosen” and von Feilitzscht      came, on entirely different
grounds, to the same conclusion, viz. that the ratio                                   *     was       not
constant, but approximated to a limit; and the old view of the
separation of neutral magnetism present in inexhaustible quan
tities, must be regarded as altogether inadmissible, as must also
be the case with the hypothesis of the separation of two electric
fluids capable of being set in motion in quantities without
limit about the molecules of the magnetized body.
    There remains, therefore, the choice between two hypotheses—
    1. That magnetization      is due to the separation of two
magnetic or electric fluids, which are only present in limited
quantities.
   2. That it is due to the change of position of the molecules
of the body magnetized, whether these are to be regarded as
molecular magnets on account of the simple separation of the
two fluids, or on account of the molecular currents continually
circulating about them.
   As above remarked, the observations that have been made
concerning the law according to which the magnitude ºn                                                    ap

              limit, render       probable that the latter

this, I made use of the method described by Böttger* to obtain
by the electrolytic process a coherent precipitate of iron, but
with this difference, that the precipitation was conducted between
the poles of a powerful magnet.           A cylindrical glass vessel was
divided   by  means of a     porous   partition   into two cells, each of
which contained a solution of iron           (sulphate  or chloride with
sal-ammoniac). In one cell a steel plate was plunged perpen
dicularly as the positive pole, in the other, parallel to the first, a
rectangular strip of plated metal of any kind as negative pole.
The longer side of the latter was horizontal, the shorter side
touched the side of the vessel. A strong magnet (sometimes a
magnet of seven plates and 50 lbs. attractive power, sometimes
a Logemann's magnet of 25 lbs. attractive power) was placed
horizontally on the table, so that the glass tube projected partly
between         its
                limbs, and the inner polar edge               the magnet             of
touched the outside              the  glass
                                      of      vessel exactly where the
negative plate lay against                  it   on
                                        the inside.      simple Daniell’s   A
battery served             as
                      electromotor.
    The iron plates thus obtained were hard             glass, and always   as
 magnetic.           In
                   fact, however,      strong     magnetic influence was
                                                 so          a

the    contrary,  almost   any   magnetic    force operating during the
 formation        the precipitate, was sufficient

polarity.     Every electrolytic iron plate, for example,        magnetic                 is
if  the cathode has been      placed              in

462                Prof.           W.       Beetz on the Molecular Changes
in the coil, and the deviation caused by it alone was determined;
and lastly, the magnetizing current was again passed through the
coils, first in one direction, then in the other, and the deviations
due to the temporary and permanent magnetism of the bar were
read off. The numbers given below are only comparable for the
same magnet, since the distance of each of the magnets was
always so chosen that the reading off of the scale might be as
practicable        as possible.
    Although in the above disposition of the experiment the pre
cipitated particles had the opportunity of arranging themselves
in regular order,                     I
                          nevertheless found, contrary to my first ex
pectation, a considerable difference between the temporary and
permanent magnetism.             In fact, however, assuming the hypo
thesis of    rotatory  atoms   equal  in magnitude and magnetic power,
such atoms could only retain their parallel position, on the
cessation of the magnetizing current, on one condition, namely,
that    all were     equal distances from each other.
                         at                                     this      not                  If               be

magnets the precipitated molecules will not                 arrange them                all

464.                Prof. W. Beetz              on the      Molecular Changes
least, is very improbable. On the hypothesis of moveable par
ticles, however, this difficulty entirely disappears, since the very
 natural supposition, that the particles of the magnet are at un
 equal distances from each other, completely explains the observed
 differences between different magnets.     Prom the same supposi
 tion it follows, moreover, that there never can be a magnet com
 pletely saturated with temporary magnetism.       The most power
 ful  magnetizing  currents will never be able to bring the axes of
 the particles into perfect parallelism with each other. The posi
 tion of the axis of each particle will depend on the resultant of
 the force of the current and the forces exerted on it by the
 neighbouring molecular magnets; so that, as the strength of the
 current increases, the temporary magnetism approaches asympto
 tically to a limit. It is sufficient to refer to W. Weber’sº re
searches on the magnitude                         of the ratio        * and the accompanying
graphic delineation of his results, to be convinced of the truth
of this fact.
   Additional vouchers for the truth of the hypothesis of rotatory
particles are furnished by the phaenomena which accompany the
reversal of the poles of a magnet.         From a series of experiments
in which a hard steel bar is magnetized by rubbing                  with                                  it,          a
magnet first            in
                     one direction and then         the other, Suchelett  in
came       tothe conclusion, that the primary magnetism                   the                                   is
strongest; that                  by
                          reversing the poles the magnetic power                                                       is
diminished, and, moreover, that              continues       diminish for
                                                             it                            to
every subsequent change that may               made, but only    be    fixed                          to    a
limit. Moserf,            communicating these experiments, adds the

 remark,        “It   very natural that the reversal

would certainly suppose that when, from any cause, the two
magnetisms had neutralized each other, the further effect of the
current –-I would be to induce a new and contrary separation
of the fluids.
   A comparison between the effects of alternate magnetization
on ordinary steel bars, and on magnets formed by electrolytic
precipitation, led me to the following results. With respect to
the temporary magnetism induced by means of magnetizing
currents, electrolytic magnets behave in general precisely the
same as ordinary steel bars.

 466                Prof. W. Beetz on the Molecular Changes
 wise, though in less degree, with the magnetism in the opposite
 direction. Neither in the case of the electrolytic magnets, nor
 in the case of the steel bars, was the magnetism induced by the
 stream     –Iever equal to that induced by the stream +I: the
 difference between the two kinds of magnets is in this respect
only quantitative ; but in the case of electrolytic magnets, the
difference between the magnetisms induced by the –m and + m,
currents is always greater than in the case of steel bars.        The
former may be compared with steel bars which have been first
magnetized by a powerful current, and have been alternately de
magnetized and remagnetized by a weaker one.              In divisions
7, 8, and 10, there are small deviations from the general course,
to which we shall refer hereafter.
    With regard to permanent magnetism, the electrolytic magnets
behave quite differently from ordinary steel-bar magnets.            a                                         If
steel bar is magnetized alternately in one direction and the
other, the positive as well as the negative magnetisms continually
decrease, so that the two extremes              between continually lie
narrowing limits, which

  Toronto; but     if (in correspondence with our mode of speaking in
  regard to another magnetic element, the Inclination) the south end
  of the magnet is employed to designate the direction of the motion
  in the southern hemisphere, and the north end in the northern
  hemisphere, the apparent contrariety disappears, and the directions,
  as well as the times of the turning hours, are approximately the
  same at both stations.
     The double progression in the diurnal variation, which was thus
  so distinctly and concurrently marked at stations so distant                  from
  each other, and at which the observations had been conducted                   with
  an elaborate care which would admit of no doubt as               to the   depend
  ence to be placed on their general results, was at that time in great
  measure an unexpected and even a startling phenomenon.                      In the
  well-known description given by M. Arago (in the instructions drawn
  up for the voyage of the ‘Bonite’ in 1836) of the general pheno
  mena of the diurnal variation in different parts of the globe, as then
  known, they are represented as consisting of a single progression
  only, with but one easterly and one westerly extreme, both occurring
  during the hours of the day; and no reference or allusion whatso
 ever is made to the existence of a double progression, or of a noc
 turnal interruption to the continuous motion in the one direction
 between the two extremes *. That the diurnal motion must be a
  consequence, in some way or other, of the sun's action, could not
 be doubted, from the fact that the period in which the variation
 takes place is a solar day; and whilst the progression was regarded
 as a single one in the twenty-four hours, it accorded sufficiently well
 with the prevailing motion, that the magnetic variations were pro
 duced by variations of temperature, to meet the general view, not
 withstanding the grave doubts and dissents which from time to
 time had been expressed by those who more closely examined the
 phenomena of particular localities.            As the existence of a well
 marked double progression at some stations on the globe could,
 however, no longer be disputed, the difficulty which now presented
 itself was to explain in what way this apparently double action of
 the sum was produced.
     On a careful examination of the diurnal motion of the declination
 magnet on different days of the years referred to at the commence
 ment of this paper, it soon became obvious that, both at Hobarton
 and Toronto, many days occurred in which the diurnal march was a
 single progression, the nocturnal retrogression wholly disappearing;
 and that there were many more days in which this was more or less
 approximately the case. It further appeared, on subsequently com
paring the observations of the same years at both stations, that the
days most distinguished by a large and even sometimes an extrava
gant interruption of the otherwise continuous single progression,
were generally the same days at both stations; and by extending
the comparison to other though less complete series of observations
    * From the omission on the part of M. Arago of any notice of a nocturnal
feature, it might perhaps be inferred that the diurnal variation at Paris is actually,
as described by him, a single progression : it seems very improbable, however,
that this should be the case, since the observations at Greenwich and Kew have
shown that the progression is double at those stations,

with the   means of making at least an approximate estimation of the
influence exercised by the uneliminated minor disturbances on the
laws which we may proceed to deduce for the class of observa
tions from which we have not been able to effect their perfect
separation.
   Adopting this method of partially eliminating the influence of the
magnetic storms in the observations at Hobarton and Toronto, and
proceeding in the first instance with the caution suitable to a first
experiment, an unnecessarily high value (as it subsequently proved)
was taken as that which should distinguish a perturbed observation,
and consequently but a small body of disturbed observations was
separated.    On a recalculation of the diurnal variation after the
elimination of these, and a comparison of the results with the diurnal
variation obtained previously from the whole of the observations, the
character of the influence of the magnetic storms was very manifest.
By the elimination of the larger disturbances, the interruption to a
continuous progression from the afternoon of the one day to the
morning of the following, was considerably diminished both in con
tinuance and amount.       A smaller separating value was then taken,
and    consequently  a  larger body of disturbed observations was
eliminated; the effect produced was a still further reduction of the
nocturnal feature. These first essays were sufficient to show that
the mean effects of the magnetic storms on the declination magnet,
both at Hobarton and at Toronto, attained a maximum in the early
hours of the might, and constituted at both stations a very con
siderable part, if not the whole, of the nocturnal portion of the
double progression which has been described.          By still further
diminishing the separating value, but still keeping it well within the
limits in which no complication of disturbing causes would be
hazarded, so little was found to remain of the nocturnal interruption,
that  I  ventured, in the 1st volume of the ‘Toronto Observations,”
published in 1845, to express the opinion that      “if  the whole in
fluence of the magnetic storms could be eliminated from the obser
vations, the residual portion of the diurnal variation would be a
single progression with but one maximum and one minimum in the
twenty-four hours.”
  The peculiar character of the magnetic storms (or disturbances as
they are sometimes called), and the periodical laws exhibited in their
mean effects, have been the subject of frequent investigations since
1845.    It is not necessary to notice on this occasion the results
of these further than as they are connected with the explanation of
the phenomena of the diurnal variation, which forms the subject
of this paper. It has been shown, by abundant evidence, that
though apparently casual in the times of their occurrence, the mag
metic storms nevertheless produce mean effects, which, when the ob
servations of more than a very few days are combined, are seen to be
of a highly systematic character in  allpartsof  the globe where their
effects have been examined —that the mean deflections which they
occasion have always their particular hours    of  extreme elongation,
with continuous intermediate progression :-that these hours are dif
ferent     different parts
          in              of  the globe, exhibiting apparently every

 Solar-diurnal                Variation of the Magnetic Declination at Pekin. 473
 possible variety:—that the disturbance diurnal variation, as for                                                       di
 stinction's sake it may be called, constitutes everywhere a sensible
 portion of the diurnal variation shown by the mean of the hourly
 observations from which no elimination of disturbed observations has
 been made:—that the diurnal variation so obtained is in fact a result
 ant of two diurnal variations superposed, both referable to the sun
 as their primary cause, but manifesting by the difference in the cha
 racter of the effects produced, a distinction in the mode of operation
 to which they are severally due. The disturbance variation is caused
 by deflections which are only of occasional occurrence; the more
 regular solar-diurnal variation is distinguished, on the other hand,
                                          its                                         its

tingent upon the direction of the magnetic meridian at each place,
and producing extreme deflections to the East and to the West twice
in the twenty-four hours, the turning hours being about six hours
apart, and stated to be appropriately represented by a formula of two
 terms, one involving the sine of the hour-angle, and the other the
 sine of twice that angle: the phenomena of the double progression
 at Toronto and Hobarton are thus viewed by him as “Types of all
 that happens beyond the limits of the torrid zone.”
     If I have represented M. Secchi's views correctly, and        think                 I               I
 have dome so, the question between the conformity to nature of his
  views and mine would be tested by the facts (when they should be
 known) of the diurnal variation at a station in the middle latitudes
  where the principal influence of the magnetic storms should take
  place, not in the hours of the night, but in those of the day.
  According to my interpretation of the phenomena at Toronto and
  Hobarton, such a station ought to exhibit a single progression; ac
  cording to M. Secchi's, a double progression with turning hours
  about six hours apart. Such a station would therefore furnish what
  might be deemed a crucial experiment.        In the extension of our ex
  perimental knowledge which might be expected to follow from the
  adoption by Her Majesty's Government of the recommendations of
  the Royal Society and of the British Association, which have been
  communicated to Lord Palmerston with so much earnestness of pur
  pose, and with so just an appreciation of their importance, by His
  Royal Highness the Prince Consort, as President of the British As
  sociation, it had been anticipated that it would not be long before
  the evidence derivable from such a station would be secured to us.

     If we examine these   figures, we perceive that the motion from west
to   east, commencing     at the turning hour between 1 and 2 in the
afternoon, though comparatively slow during the hours of the night,
is continuous and uninterrupted until the extreme easterly elonga
tion is reached between 8 or 9 in the following morning, and
that no other turning hours intervene between those of the extreme
easterly between 8 and 9 A.M. and the extreme westerly between
 1 and 2 P.M.
   The phases of the solar-diurnal variation, as they are shown by the
Pekin Observations, may be stated as follows:—The north end of the

into which the semiannual       differences merge.   The distinctive
characteristics of the first, viz. the disturbance diurnal variation,
have already been stated in the early part of this paper, together
with the evidence they supply of being due to some modification
of the solar action,-justifying their being treated as distinct and
separate from the affections which constitute the more regular
variation. . There are also distinctive characters in the pheno
mena of the semiannual inequality, and in those of the mean va
riation, which appear to point out a difference in the mode in which
the primary cause operates in producing the two classes of pheno
mena.      For the purpose of explaining this difference, we may em

Solar-diurnal                 Variation of the Magnetic Declination at Pekin. 479
of the annual   mean, by reason of a particular feature of the semi
annual   inequality  spoken of above. When, on the other hand, we
direct our attention to the semiannual mean from October to March,
we see the consequence of the superposition upon the annual mean
of the opposite semiannual inequality belonging to these months:
this is most particularly shown in the effect produced upon the semi
annual mean by the great semiannual loop which culminates about
6 or 7 A.M. This deflection, which is opposite in direction to that
appropriate to the hemisphere, prevails over it so far as to interrupt
the progression, which on the mean of the year is continuous, and to
produce a secondary maximum at about 7 A.M.            This opposite de
flection to that which is normal in the hemisphere, taking place at
the hours when the semiannual inequality is greatest, is a common
feature whenever, in the middle latitudes of either hemisphere, the
mean diurnal variation of the one hemisphere is combined with the
semiannual inequality which has the opposite analogy.          The hour
of principal discordance between them is always nearly the same,
being determined by that of the principal deflection on the semiannual
curve, which, as seen in the diagram, is nearly identical in solar time
in    all
       parts     the globe.

In  the different stations in the northern hemisphere, where the ex
treme deflections have been found to take place at the same hours of
solar time, the differences in the direction of the magnetic meridian
have not been less than 70°, equivalent to a difference of solar time
of between four and five hours.
     Iought not to close this paper without adverting to the success
which has attended Mr. Scatchkoff’s employment of native Chinese
as his assistants in the work of the Pekin Observatory, holding out
as it does an encouraging example to Directors of Observatories who
may be similarly circumstanced.     A very close test of the care and
fidelity with which observations have been made and recorded is fur
nished by the lunar-diurnal variation, deducible from them when they
have been re-arranged under the lunar hours to which they severally
belong.    Thus tested, the Pekin observations show no inferiority to
those of other stations which have been similarly examined.
   It is understood that the observations, which were discontinued at
Pekin at the end of 1855, are about to be recommenced, or have been
so already.   It is greatly to be desired that hourly obervations of
the Horizontal and Vertical Forces should be combined with those
of the Declination at this important station. The self-recording ap
paratus of the three elements which has been in action at Kew during
the last two years, has been found, by the reduction of         tabulated                             its

  On the Focal Power of Eyes for Horizontal and Vertical Rays. 481
 might, perhaps,       be induced to make similar contributions.             The
 adjustment of the eyes for different distances being intimately con
 nected with the question of stigmatism or astigmatism, I have included
 it in my analysis.
     If  I view a vertical and
 horizontal line, both equally
 strong and black,     I see them
 with medium distinctness at
 the distance of about 10
 inches.
     At the distance of about
   # inches,    I see the vertical
 line with greater distinctness
 and better definition—the
 greatest distinctness and best
 definition my eyes are ca
 pable of; but the horizontal
 line   I see indistinctly—with
 much less distinctness than
 that    with which      I  see any   part of the figure        at the  distance
 of   10 inches.     At the distance of      12 inches,    I  see the horizontal
 line with the greatest distinctness and best definition my eyes
 are capable of; but the vertical line         I  see indistinctly—with much
 less distinctness than that with which I see any part of the figure at
 the distance of 10 inches.        It thus appears that my eyes collect to a
 focus on the retina the rays which diverge horizontally at the distance
 of 8% inches; and the rays which diverge vertically at the distance of
 12 inches.      Whilst seeing the vertical line with perfect distinctness
 and definition at the distance of 8% inches,         I cannot alter the adjust
 ment of the eye so as to see the horizontal line more distinctly and
 the vertical one less distinctly; and vice versá, whilst seeing the
 horizontal line perfectly defined at the distance of 12 inches,          I can
 not alter the adjustment of the eye so as to see the vertical line
 more distinctly and the horizontal one less.
    In short, I find that I have no power of altering the adjustment of
my eyes.       I see vertical lines with perfect distinctness and definition
 only at the distance of 84 inches, and horizontal lines with perfect
 distinctness and definition only at the distance of 12inches, and both
vertical and horizontal lines simultaneously with medium distinctness
only    at the distance    of 10 inches.
    At the distance of about     7 inches I see the vertical line with medium
distinctness, but the horizontal line very indistinctly.
                                                 I
    At the distance of about 14 inches see the horizontal line with
medium distinctness, but the vertical line very indistinctly.
                                             I
    At a nearer distance than 7 inches see both lines indistinctly, but
the vertical less so than the horizontal.        At a further distance than 14
inches, on the other hand, I see both lines indistinctly, but the hori
zontal less so than the vertical.
    If  now  I  view two oblique lines, both of which are equally strong
              I
and black, see both legs with medium distinctness at the distance of
 10 inches.

      At            the distance of about
 8} inches      see the  two  I
 oblique lines equally well,
 but not so distinctly as at
 the distance of 10 inches.
          At         the      distance           of      12
 inches             I
          see the two oblique
 lines with much about the
 same distinctness as that
 with which I see them at
 the distance of 8% inches.
    It thus appears that                                      I
 cannot see either of the
 oblique lines with perfect
 distinctness and definition
 at any distance; but that
 I  can see them both simultaneously distinctly                 enough at any di
 stance from 8% inches to 12.              At a nearer distance than 84 inches,
 or a further distance than 12 inches, the distinctness diminishes, and
 that equally for the two lines.
          I
        cannot by any adjustment of my eyes vary the distinctness with
 which I see the oblique lines at a given distance.
     The preceding analysis of my sight shows that my eyes are not
 monostigmatic, that             are not capableis,      collecting       the rays of                          all                   of
 light which enter them                           to

 foci      which they bring the rays, viz. one focus for horizontal rays,
               to
 and one for vertical rays.
     The preceding analysis also shows that my eyes                 not possess any                      do
 intrinsic    power       adjustment   ofwhereby    they  can   bring        foci rays                             to

 above specified for horizontal and for vertical rays.

South   High-level  Sewer at Dulwich; with Notices of the Fossils
found there and at Peckham.”       By Charles Rickman, Esq.
   In the autumn of   1859, open  cuttings were made at Peckham, in
connexion with the “Effra branch of the Great South High-level
Sewer,” for the “main drainage " of the metropolis south of the
Thames; and in the following spring a tunnel (330 yards in length)
was being constructed under the Five-fields at Dulwich. The beds
exposed in both sections belonged to the “Woolwich and Reading
Series” of the Lower London Tertiaries (Prestwich).
   Four shafts were sunk to facilitate the driving of the tunnel; and
the following beds were exposed; but, as some of the beds are not
persistent, but die out even within the extent of the tunnel, the
several shafts differed as to the sections obtained from them.

  GENTLEMEN,+I observe that Mr. Stokes has some remarks         your                                                       in

lated in the September Number of your Magazine for 1859. As some
passages of this translation do not agree with the original, in order to
express my own views correctly I beg your permission to insert the
following corrections and explanations:—
   P. 187 of the translation, line 9, instead of it was read it would be.
   — 188, line 18 from below, instead of to another occasion read to
            the immediately following paper (in Poggendorff’s Annalen).

  improbable that any sensible error will arise from this assumption,
  especially if the thickness of the screen (soot or any other opake
 medium) may be neglected in comparison with the breadth of the
 apertures, though a further theoretical examination of the question
 would be desirable.      But both theories differ in what regards the
 propagation of the secondary waves after their having left the aper
 tures.    Mr. Stokes assumes that this propagation is the same as                                                   if
 the screen were not there; indeed he says (in the introduction of the
 Dynamical Theory of Diffraction), “It is an hypothesis (exceedingly
 probable à priori) that we may find the disturbance in front of the
 aperture by merely taking the aggregate of the disturbances due to
 all the secondary waves, each secondary wave proceeding as if the
 screen were away, in other words, that the effect of the screen is
 merely to stop a certain portion of the incident light;" and further
 (§ 31 at the end), “In determining the law of disturbance in a se
 condary wave we have nothing to do with the aperture.”                   On the
 contrary, according to the theory of M. Cauchy and that given in
 my paper, the secondary waves produced by the motion at the issue
 of the apertures must in proceeding satisfy the condition that the
 motion resulting from all secondary waves               on that side         is,

the surfaces of “rupture” or “of greatest energy of friction”

these conditions, and to prove that when they are satisfied (but
not otherwise) the results of the received theory are exact.

ranked among those whom have called the followers of Cou
lomb.     He is entitled to the merit of having perceived that the
received hypothesis rested on no solid foundation, and of having
been the first (publicly at least) to assert that the equations of
internal equilibrium must be resorted to for the satisfactory dis
cussion of the question; but, notwithstanding the sincere esteem
in which I hold the great abilities of this gentleman, have been                                        I
compelled to come to the conclusion, and trust to be able to
satisfy himself, that the use he has made of these equations is
illusory, and that his results bear upon their very face a demon
strable character of error.

    I may add the cursory remark as regards the value of the
total thrusts in the case more immediately before us, that [as
is apparent from the equation (a)] they will be represented in
relative magnitude by the radius vector drawn in the direction
of the line thrust upon, to meet, not the ellipse of pressures just
described, but another ellipse whose major and minor axes are
to one another in the duplicate ratio of the other two.
     If
      we wish, however, to present the above results in a form
more immediately translateable into the actual case of nature,
I mean that of space with three dimensions, it becomes expe
dient to use a different ellipse, or rather the same ellipse in
another position, to represent the stress at any point.

                           q     be     the pressure itself,    that  on                          so

it follows that the weight of water diffused through the upper

   Here it will be seen that the numbers expressing the diffusi
bility of the different solutions are very nearly in geometrical
progression.
   Hence we derive the following law:—If the per-centage of
starch contained in three different solutions be eagressed by an
ascending geometrical progression, the diffusibility of the solutions -
will be eagressed by a descending geometrical progression.
   The results of the following experiment are confirmatory of
this law.

    The following experiment was made to determine how far the
law of diffusion is affected by direct chemical action.
                               Eageriment       XIII.
    The absorbent used in this experiment was unsized paper
 saturated with a solution of 8 per cent. of carbonate of potassa
and then carefully dried, so that the paper was uniformly impreg
nated with the salt. The liquid was diluted sulphuric acid having
a specific gravity of 1:013.

    Hence it appears that the general formula, expressing the rate
of diffusion, holds true in cases where there is a known decided
chemical action.       It would seem that the ascent of the liquid
through the pores of an absorbent is in most cases attended by
chemical action.
    The diluted acid used in this experiment was found to have
the same diffusibility as distilled water, the formula of diffusion
being T=3.5 S" at mean temperature.                   The slow rate of diffu
sion of the diluted sulphuric acid in this experiment is not a
little remarkable.       In most cases direct chemical action tends to
accelerate the diffusion.
    The following experiment was made to determine the amount
of heat evolved by the process of absorption.
                               Eageriment       XIV.
    The bulb of a thermometer was infolded with dry unsized
paper,   which extended about one inch below the bulb. The
extremity of the paper was brought in contact with water placed
in  a small-mouthed bottle. The temperature of the water was
the same as that of the air, viz. 56°. As the liquid ascended
through the pores of the absorbent, the temperature, indicated
by the thermometer, gradually rose until it reached 61°, giving
a maximum rise of 5° due to the heat evolved by absorption.
    The naked bulb of a thermometer was inserted in some dry
plasterof paris placed in an evaporating dish. A sufficient quantity
of water, having the same temperature as the air, viz 56°, was
then poured into the dish; after the higher portion of the
plaster of paris had become wet by absorption, the temperature,

indicated by the thermometer, rose to 66°5, giving a maximum
rise of 10°5 due to the heat evolved by absorption.
   This change of specific heat, which always takes place during
the process of absorption, is doubtless indicative of chemical
action.
   It may be worthy of remark, that an absorbent may be used
again and again, with distilled water, without suffering any
change in      powerits absorption.  of

Of course the experiments with this apparatus were not made
without numerous precautions; it was more particularly neces
sary that the whole apparatus should be always under the same
conditions, so as to give off the heat imparted to it always in the
same manner.     For this it was necessary that the space sur
rounding it should always be at the same temperature. In
these experiments the temperature of the surrounding space was
15 degrees.
  In this way the following results were                                obtained:—
   1. The temperature which a thermometer ultimately assumes
in a space heated from above, differs when this space is filled
with different gases.
  2.       In hydrogen the                  temperature           is higher than in any other
8aS.
   3. In this gas the temperature is higher than in vacuo; and

    ROF. SCHROTTER                   has described” the occurrence                   of ozone
       in a specimen of fluor-spar which is found at Wulsendorf.
It is a darkish-blue variety, and when scratched or rubbed in a
mortar, it emits a powerful odour closely resembling that of
bleaching powder. The phaenomenon has long been known, and
has been ascribed to the presence of chlorous acid.
   On rubbing the mineral in a mortar, Schrötter observed that
the odour emitted was exceedingly like that of ozone. When it
was triturated in a mortar with iodide of potassium solution, the
liquor became brown from the liberation of iodine, and when a
piece of ozone test-paper was held over the mortar it became di
stinctly blue. This reaction might, however, have been produced
either by a chlorine compound or by ozone.       But when tritu
rated with water or with alkalies, although a powerful smell was
produced, no trace of a chlorine compound could be detected in
the liquid.
    When the mineral was triturated with chloride of sodium,
chlorine was liberated, as was evident from the smell, and also
by the fact that the reaction for chlorine was obtained when a
plate moistened with nitrate of silver was held over the mixture.
This must have been due to ozone, which has the property of
expelling chlorine from            of its
                                  compounds;           inconceivable that
                                                               it   is
any oxygen compound              chlorine could have the property                              of
liberating chlorine under these circumstances.               Besides, the
mineral, when triturated with pure wood-charcoal, emitted                                      no
odour, while,     as
                  a    control experiment showed, the reverse            the              is
case with   hypochlorite           of
                               lime.
    When the mineral was heated,           strong odour was perceived,
                                                  a

dark-blue    colour,  and  appeared           of

would at that high temperature be converted into ordinary
oxygen, which would be without action on the iodide.
   To determine the quantity of ozone, a given weight of the
mineral was triturated in a mortar with iodide of potassium, and
the liberated iodine estimated by means of hyposulphite of soda.

Rose on the Heteromorphous Conditions of Carbonate    of Lime. 517
   G. Rose+ has communicated the commencement of a series of
experiments on the circumstances under which the different forms
of carbonate of lime (calc-spar, Arragonite, and chalk) are formed.
When chloride of calcium was added to a fusing mixture of equi
valents of carbonate of potash and carbonate of soda, it dissolved
without effervescence; when a portion of the cooled mass was
placed in water it gradually dissolved, leaving a pulverulent
residue of carbonate of lime. Viewed under the microscope
shortly after treatment with water, it was found to consist of
small globules, which after twenty-four hours changed into well
formed individual or aggregated rhombohedra.
   When another piece was thrown into hot water and boiled, it
was seen to consist of microscopic prisms with occasional rhom
bohedra. This residue, on standing, gradually changed into
aggregations of calc-spar.
   The same results were obtained when calc-spar or oxalate of
lime were added to the fusing mixture, except that in the latter
case some carbonic oxide was given off.
   As calc-spar had not been directly formed in these experiments,
Rose, with Siemen’s assistance, repeated Sir James Hall’s cele
 brated experiment, by which marble is said to be obtained when
 chalk or compact limestone is heated in a closed vessel under
pressure. Fine chalk was pressed in a musket-barrel which was
hermetically sealed, and heated in a gas furnace, the temperature
of which could be raised so as to melt large masses of platinum.
During the experiment the barrel burst. On afterwards exami
ning the contents, the chalk was agglomerated into a compact
light-bluish mass, full of cracks. The experiment was repeated
with small pieces of calc-spar, but the same result was obtained.
It  appears  thence   that these substances are not changed into
distinctly crystallized calc-spar by being heated in a closed space.
Rose considers that Sir James Hall thought the compacted mass
to be crystalline marble.
   When a solution of carbonate of lime in carbonic acid water
was allowed to stand, a crust and a sediment gradually formed.
The latter consisted of chalk, the former was found to be com
posed of very perfect microscopic rhombohedra.
   When the liquid was placed on a hot stove, a disengagement
of gas commenced, which lasted for six or eight hours. In this
case the crust which formed consisted chiefly of acicular crystals
of Arragonite, while the deposit was nothing but well-shaped
rhombohedra.
   When the solution was evaporated, prisms of Arragonite and
rhombohedra, laminae and plates of calc-spar were obtained.

tents of the tube as sulphuric acid, and is determined in the
usual way, with obvious analytical precautions.
   The applicability of this method was shown by the analysis of
bisulphide of carbon, of sulphite of ethyle, and of many other
sulphur compounds, and gave very satisfactory results.
   Some sulphur compounds by oxidation with nitric acid yield
the sulphur in the form of sulphurous acid. These are best de
termined by fusion with nitrate of soda.
   With chlorinated bodies, a part of the chlorine is usually found
in the free state among the gases, and a modification of the
method is necessary. This consists in opening the tube under a
solution of sulphite of soda, by which the chlorine is absorbed
and immediately converted into hydrochloric acid, which is de
termined in the usual manner.
   Bromine and iodine can also be estimated by this method,
which is further applicable to the case of metallic sulphides. The
analytical results were found in     cases     allvery exact.  to   be

Soda, baryta, and strontia act in the same manner, but this is
not the case with lime. This doubtless arises from the fact
(which was proved by experiment) that it does not form cyanide
of calcium when heated to redness in a current of cyanide of
ammonlum.
   The action of the various receipts for cementation may be ex
plained by the formation of cyanides.     It will be found that in

other substances: they are in the same condition as racemic acid,
which was supposed to be inactive, until Pasteur showed the

  Among the oxidation products of gelatine and albuminous
substances, Schlieper observed the presence of an oily body with
an odour like that of cinnamic aldehyde.     It occurs along with
hydrocyanic acid, acetonitrile, propionitrile, valeronitrile, and
hydride of benzoyle. It was also found by Gückelberger among
the oxidation products of fibrine, albumen, and caseine. Fröhde
has investigated this body#, and has found it to be an aldehyde,
which by oxidation is converted into a new aromatic acid.
   He obtained it in greatest quantity by the oxidation of gela
tine by a mixture of sulphuric acid and bichromate of potass;
the distillate from this action was neutralized with carbonate of
soda, and the liquid evaporated to dryness: the soda salts were
decomposed with sulphuric acid, and the liberated solid acids
freed from the accompanying volatile fatty acids by filtration
and by crystallization. The solid acids contained the new acid;

He found that the chloride was in fact reduced, but that the re

a volatile stinking liquid, resembling mercaptan, and which, in
contact with oxide of mercury, forms a body, C*H* HgS*.

naturally endeavoured to finish tuning my fork by ear only.                                                    In
this, however,           I   found       I could not succeed;               and having               investi
gated    all
           the circumstances with the greatest care,        was led                    I                       to
the following remarkable conclusion.
I     observed that   fork which had tuned
                               a                      holding

right ear while the standard was held       my   left, when  compared
                                                                 to
with the fork used for the exact pitch, made one vibration too
many     inthe course      several seconds; while
                                       of               fork tuned by            a
being held       my left ear while the standard was held
                    to                                              my                                    to
right, vibrated less rapidly than the other. The fork          accurate                      in
pitch gave the lower note. Consequently hear               notes some I                all
what higher with my right ear than with my left.
 I    have since examined my musical friends, and         have not yet               I
found   one,  even among    part-musicians, whose ears are precisely
 alike  in estimating  the  pitch     musical notes.  of By continued

 which ear anyone hears the highest”.          this experiment have   In                             I
never yet failed.                 The person under examination holds                                  a    care

               brings them successively the one   the right, the                     to

         the left ear.     place my  right

                       sounds higher than the other.          the tuning                If
forks are     exchanged,    precisely   the same    phaenomenon    results
with respect both          the person under examination and
                                    to                                 the                                to

                                  as    experience  extends, most   people
 (here   in Cologne) hear higher with the right ear than with the
left.

                               content myself with simply asserting
   The reason for this difference of hearing is probably that the
external passage of the ear is set in vibration, like a speaking
trumpet, by the sounds that enter                                 it,
                                              and that this vibration
modifies the pitch       the entering sound more
                                    of                   less according           or
to  the form of the individual ear.
                                                                                                         to it, on
   The supposition that the waves         sound, before impinging

    following                  communications were read:—
THE“On    the                  Light radiated by heated Bodies.”                                 By Balfour
Stewart, Esq., A.M.
   In two papers read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh in the
years 1858 and 1859, and published in their Transactions,      have                                       I
described some experiments on radiant heat, which would seem to
involve an extension of Prevost's theory of radiation, known as the
theory of exchanges.
   As the paper which                     I
                           have now the honour to submit to this
Society will detail analogous experiments on radiant light,            may                                I
be permitted briefly to refer to those points in my previous papers
which are thus intimately connected with the present subject.
   In attempting to unfold the logical consequences of Prevost's
theory, certain properties of radiant heat present themselves to our
view, many of which are capable of experimental verification.
   The following are some of these ; and, for convenience-sake,                                                     I
shall follow up the statement of each (before proceeding to the next)
with a description of the analogous property of radiant light, as in
this way the similarity which exists between heat and light will be
most readily perceived.
   In the first place, the heat radiated by a thin plate of any sub
stance at a given temperature, is proportional to the absorptive
capacity of that substance for the heat of that temperature; or, in
few words,         its
                radiation    equal         absorption.

  A stratum of heated gas may likewise be instanced as a substance
which neither absorbs nor emits light to a sensible extent; and it has
similar properties with respect to heat.
   Let us now proceed to another consequence of Prevost's theory.
It is well known, from Melloni’s experiments, that thin plates of
various substances have the property of sifting the heat which falls
upon them; they stop certain rays, and allow others to pass, the
heat stopped being of one description, and the heat passed of
another.      Now, it may be shown to flow from the theory of ex
changes, that the heat radiated by a thin plate of any substance at a
given temperature is precisely that description of heat which the
plate absorbs when heat of that temperature is allowed to fall upon
it.   The heat which        it absorbs being that kind                       of
                                                                   heat which has

along with another glass, opaque or nearly so, which gives out light
of the ordinary description. They are heated together in the same
field of heat, and then viewed in the dark as they cool.       During
this  process the tint of each   changes,  becoming  somewhat redder
as the temperature falls.     A difference in the temperature of the
two glasses might therefore cloak or even reverse the peculiar differ
ence of tint which it is sought to establish, unless this is very
marked. This difficulty would be got over if we could by any means
compare glasses of different tints at precisely the same temperature
in the dark together; but I have not yet succeeded in contriving an
apparatus for this purpose.                                 -

   Let us now consider Prevost's theory with regard to bodies of

heat are   very bad radiators.      As variety        this experiment,

radiate only          83

   An analogy has thus been established between radiant heat and
light     in
         certain    their properties. Now two opinions have been en
                          of
tertained with   regard     light:—   to
   1st. Some have regarded                             as
                                      differing from radiant heat only
                                                 it                                                            in
wave length.
   2nd. Others have regarded the two          physically distinct, although
                                                                   as
possessing many properties         common.       in has even been thought
                                                                        It
that some kinds         light have
                            of           heating effect no     the bodies               on                     on
which they fall.
I    cannot but think that the facts just stated countenance the
former opinion rather than the latter: for Prevost's theory consists
of the three following hypotheses:–
   1st. That              an
                    enclosure
                     if            any kind     kept

perature, any body placed within the enclosure, and surrounded                                                 by
it   on   all
         sides, will ultimately attain that temperature.
   2nd. That          all
                   bodies are constantly giving out radiant heat,
                                                                                                              at

   The vacuum-tubes used were prepared by means of carbonic acid
(Philosophical Transactions, 1859, part 1. p. 137). For the sake of
reference I will denote these by the original numbers which I am
accustomed to attach as the vacua are completed:—in the following
experiments these were 146, 187, 190, 196, 202, and 219.
   No. 146 is 24 inches long and 18 inches in circumference, and has
a copper disc 4 inches diameter at one terminal and a brass wire at
the other: this vessel is figured in my last communication.     No. 187
and 196 (see fig. 1) are each about 6 inches long and 1 inch
diameter, with gas-coke balls # inch diameter, attached to the
hermetically sealed platinum wires, the wires being protected by glass
tubing as far as the balls, placed inside the tube 3 inches apart.

No.   190 has brass wires, and No. 202 silver wires attached to the
platinum : both these tubes (fig. 2) are of the same dimensions as
No. 187 and 196. No. 219 is 4 inches long, has gas-coke balls of
                                  Fig. 2.
about 4th of an inch in diameter, and l inch apart: the caustic

   With the inductive coil the discharge in  146 exhibits a large cloud
like luminosity on the plate, which in these experiments was always
made the negative terminal.     On the positive wire, minute luminous
spots were visible.  At intervals, apparently by some sudden energetic
action, flashes of bright stratified light would dart through the
vacuum; but by carefully adjusting the contact breaker, the discharge
could be made to pass, producing a white glow on the negative plate,
without to the eye affording any appearance of an intermittent
discharge.
   In 187 and 196 the stratifications were narrow from the positive

terminal, the negative ball being surrounded with a marrow halo of
light similar to that in fig. 1 A (p. 545), but smaller.        In 190 there
was a red tinge on the cloud-like discharge near the positive terminal;
on the approach of a magnet, two or three additional clouds were
brought out, the negative wire being covered with a luminous glow
extending to the sides of the tube parallel to the end of the negative
wire. 202 exhibited a remarkably well-defined cloud-like discharge,
the several clouds being clearly and distinctly separated.         No. 219 :
the    appearance   of the  discharge   in this tube was similar to that in
                                    Fig. 3 A.
 fig. 3A, with   a particularly brilliant glow around the negative ball, but
 without   any  stratifications from the positive.
     Having thus described the appearances of the induced discharge in
 these tubes, I now proceed to the description of experiments made
 in the same vacua, -1st, with the water-battery of 3520 cells; 2ndly,
 with the 512 series of Daniell’s constant battery; and lastly, with 400
 series of Grove’s nitric-acid battery.
   . With the water-battery, as     I  have stated in my previous commu
nication, the stratified discharge, similar in character to that of the
 inductive coil, was obtained, not only in 146 and the other tubes,
 º
 but also through 146 and any one of the others at the same time.
     From the risk of fracture, I have not ventured again to heat the
 potash in 146, but      I have invariably found that whenever the potash
 in any of the other tubes was heated, the discharge from the water
           instead of increasing in distinctness and brilliancy, entirely
 Ceased.
     The discharge from the water-battery through each of the tubes
 had the appearance of being continuous, and the needle of the
 galvanometer, placed on the circuit, showed a steady deflection.
 To test whether the discharge      was continuous,  I attached   No. 219 to
 my rotating apparatus (Philosophical Transactions, 1859, part 1.
 p. 158); the discharges were then clearly separated, so that even
 with this apparatus they were shown to be intermittent.
     As the water in the battery, after a lapse of some weeks, had
 partially evaporated, the action was so reduced that it would no longer
 pass through any of the vacuum-tubes except 219, in which it
 assumed the appearance in fig. 3 B.           In this state it remained for
 three or four weeks; and whenever from change of temperaturemoisture
 was deposited on the surface of the glass tubes, the luminous discharge
 disappeared when the tubes were touched by the hand or by a wire,
 reappearing as the hand or wire was withdrawn.            A portion of the
discharge from this battery was evidently lost by insufficient insulation,
reduced by accumulated dust and moisture.            I have not the requisite

facilities at command, but a thoroughly well-insulated battery of 3000
or 4000 series would produce effects well worthy of examination.

and disappeared in these experiments, first at one terminal and then
at the other, according as the cable was charged or discharged.
    After the cable had received the discharge to the greatest intensity
that could be obtained through the tube 219, the full charge of the
battery was then completed by cutting off the tube from the circuit
by means of a wire.          On removing the wire, and substituting the
earth for the battery, a discharge took place; but a residuary charge
was always found, which could not pass through the vacuum.                       If
this residuary was allowed to remain in the cable, and the battery
again substituted for the earth, no additional charge could be made
to pass from the battery through the vacuum-tube; but so soon as
this residuary was discharged, the cable again became charged
through the tube as before*.
    We were particularly fortunate with these experiments; for on
Mr. Wheatstone testing the capability or power of the battery, he as
certained that on taking from it only 32 cells, thus reducing the num
ber to 480, the discharge could not pass through the vacuum-tube.
                          Grove's   Nitric-Acid Battery.
    Each set of elements in the battery were inserted in a glass ves
sel with a stem 6 inches long; the stems were carefully cleaned and
dried. These precautions, with the high chemical affinity of the
elements, raised the tension of each terminal, as denoted by gold
leaf electroscopes, to nearly that of the larger series of the water
battery.      A succession of spark-discharges could be taken between
the     copper   discs of my micrometer-electrometer, one disc being
attached to the zinc, and the other to the platinum end of the
battery.
    In the following experiments, the different vacuum-tubes were
introduced between one of the copper discs and the battery, as also
a galvanometer.         By this arrangement the circuit could be gradually
completed without any risk of disarranging the apparatus, and the
 spark discharged obtained before the copper discs of the micro
meter-electrometer came into contact.
     “In   146, on the completion of the current, the discharge of the
 battery passed with a display of magnificent strata of most dazzling
brightness.       On separating the discs by means of a micrometer
 screw, the luminous discharges presented the same appearance as
 when taken from an induction coil, but brighter.                 On the copper
 plate in the vessel there was a white layer, and then a dark space
 about one inch broad; then a bluish atmosphere, curved like the

 coating of a Leyden jar, and the other with the prime conductor of an electrical
 machine, when the machine is excited a luminous glow will be observed round
 one of the balls, similar to that obtained during the charging of the cable by the
 voltaic battery, and the jar will become gradually charged.   On the excitation of
 the electrical machine being stopped, if a pointed wire is presented to the prime
 conductor, the jar will be gradually discharged, and the luminous glow appears
 on the other ball of the vacuum-tube; if several similar tubes are arranged in
 series, and the jar is discharged   through longer carbonic-acid vacua, the striae
 can be obtained in the latter.

plate, evidently three negative envelopes on a great       scale. When
the plate was positive, the effect was comparatively       feeble.”  The
preceding is an extract from notes made by the Rev.        Dr. T. R. Ro
binson, when he first witnessed the experiments in        my laboratory,
on the 5th of August, 1859.           With the same vacuum         I have
always obtained similar results.
    In 187 and 196 (fig. 1) with carbon-balls in the tubes, the discharge
of the nitric-acid battery elicits intense heat, and probably changes
 the condition of the vacuum.       On the 5th of August, 1859, “the
discharge in 187 presented a stream of light of intolerable brightness
 [I again quote from Dr. Robinson's notes], in which, through the
plate of green glass, with which he observed the phenomena, strata
could be observed. This soon changed to a sphere of light on the
 positive ball, which became red-hot, the negative being surrounded
by magnificent envelopes, whilst with the horseshoe magnet the
positive light was drawn out into strata. The needle of a galvano
meter in circuit was violently deflected, and the polarity reversed,
settling at a deflection of 45°.      On heating the potassa, the dis
charge again bursts into a sun-like flame, subsequently subsiding
into three or four large strata, of a cloud-like shape, but intensely
bright.”
   On a subsequent occasion I found that the discharge did not pass
for about a minute after the circuit was completed, when a fine glow
appeared on the negative ball, fig. 1 A. Around the positive ball
                                 Fig. 1 A.
there was a trifling glow, in a few seconds a momentary brilliant
flash, and the discharge ceased. The potash was then again heated;
the large negative glow reappeared, followed almost instantly by a
remarkably brilliant stratified discharge, with intense chemical action
in the battery, denoted by the evolution of nitrous fumes; at this
           I
moment separated the discs of the micrometer-electrometer, and thus
broke the circuit.
   I now    arranged the apparatus by attaching gold-leaf electroscopes
to both   terminals, and introduced the galvanometer, so as to enable
me to examine more carefully the action that would take place when
the potassa was heated.      On heating the potassa, the fine negative
glow (fig. 1 A) was again developed; the leaves of the electroscope
did not close; but as the negative glow increased, the needle of the
galvanometer was suddenly deflected, immediately (although the glow
continued) returning to zero; as more heat was applied a small globe

of light appeared on the positive (fig. 1 B), and the needle gradu
ally deflected 40° or 50°. On withdrawing the lamp, as the potash
cooled, the positive glow disappeared, the needle of the galvano

meter receded, the glow on the negative remaining more or less bril
liant,-this action and reaction alternating as the heat of the lamp
was applied or withdrawn from the potash.
   When the heating of the potash was further increased, four or five
cloud-like and remarkably clear strata came out from the positive
(fig. 1 C); and these were quickly followed by a sudden discharge
of the most dazzling brightness, which remained for several seconds.
The stratifications, which were conical in shape, I have endeavoured,
although very faintly, to depict in fig. 1 D. The needle of the gal

vanometerwas suddenly and violently deflected, striking with consider
able force the two corks placed to protect it on the compass card.
At the instant this discharge took place, and not before, the leaves of
the electroscopes collapsed. This, with the intense chemical action ob
servable in the battery, proved that the entire current was passing.
   The preceding experiment was repeated with tube No. 196, with
nearly the same results, the needle first deflecting 40° and then 80°.
On further heating the tube, the same sudden intense stratified light
appeared, after which the discharge ceased.                    -

              On the Luminous                    Discharge         of Voltaic Batteries.                      547
     No. 187 was then replaced in the circuit, and the                                  same phenomena
as already described were obtained.
     I now again avail myself of Dr. Robinson's notes of the experi
ments made on the 5th of August. Tube 190 is of the same dimen
sions as 187 and 196; but instead of the coke balls, it has brass
wires attached to the platinum.           In this tube (190) the luminous
discharge did not appear until the caustic potassa was heated, when
most dazzling strata were observed.          Dr. Robinson says,           had                           “I
to use a   dark-green  glass   to examine the strata; as      was observing,            I
the last stratum rolled leisurely away, like a globe of light, from the
others, to the negative glow, in which it appeared to dissolve.            As
the potassa cooled, the strata shrunk up and dissolved at the positive
wire, as did the glow ; and when the dark negative reached the
point,    all
            luminosity ceased.”
    On   a subsequent occasion the first discharge           the tube (190)          in
exhibited     fine purple negative glow, with two tawny cloud-like stra
              a

                  at             This discharge exhibited the fluorescence
of   the glass tube          remarkable manner. The circuit was then

                                  the galvanometer deflected about 65°,
but the leaves         the   of
                              electroscopes  were very slightly affected.

terminal wires or the charcoal points, the length of the arc being in
relation to the number of the elements of the battery.
    With the water-battery                      I
                                      have never been able to obtain the
slightest appearance of an arc-discharge; for whether the terminals
of the battery were the plates of my micrometer-electrometer, me
tallic wires, or charcoal, the result was the same; viz. clearly sepa
rated and distinct sparks, which continued until the water in the
cells had nearly evaporated.           With four hundred (each cell being
insulated) of Grove's nitric-acid battery, similar spark-discharges were
obtained between the plates of my micrometer-electrometer, without
producing the voltaic arc, although by a momentary completion of
 the circuit it was obtained with great brilliancy.
    In carbonic-acid vacuum tubes, and particularly in those in which
carbon-balls were inserted, the disruptive, as well as the voltaic arc
discharge (under the conditions described), was obtained from the
nitric-acid battery; and in both instances the stratified appearance
was observed, the difference being, that with the arc-discharge the
stratifications were far more vivid and brilliant, and the discharge
itself evidently more energetic. With the disruptive discharge, the
needle of the galvanometer was but slightly deflected, nor could any

   “On the Volumetric Relations of Ozone, and the Action of the
Electrical Discharge on Oxygen and other Gases.”        By Thomas
Andrews, M.D., F.R.S., and P. G. Tait, Esq., M.A.
   This paper contains the full details of the authors’ experiments
on the volumetric changes which occur in the formation of ozone.
From three distinct series of experiments, performed by different
methods, they show that when ozone is formed from pure oxygen by
the action of the electrical discharge, a condensation takes place, as
had already been announced in a former Note published in the
‘Proceedings.’      But the condensation is much greater than the earlier
experiments of the authors on the expansion by heat of electrolytic
ozone had indicated.         It        fact,   is, great, that
                                                     in            the allotropic

     The subjoined figure represents a carbonic
 acid vacuum tube of about ºr of an inch inter
 nal diameter, wound in the form of a flattened
 spiral.    The wider ends of the tube, in which
 the  platinum   wires are sealed, are 2 inches in
 length and about ; an inch in diameter, and
 are shown by the dotted lines; they are enclosed
 in a wooden case (indicated by the surrounding
 entire line), so as to permit only the spiral to be
 exposed.
     When the discharge from a Ruhmkorff's in
 duction apparatus is passed through the vacuum
 tube, the spiral becomes intensely luminous, ex
 hibiting a brilliant white light. Mr. Gassiot,
 who exhibited the experiment at the meeting
 of the Society, caused the discharge from the
 induction coil to pass through two miles of cop
 per wire; with the same coil excited so as to
   ive a spark through air of one inch in length,
   e ascertained that the luminosity in the spiral
 was not reduced when the discharge passed
through 14 miles of No. 32 copper wire.

    ON   THE ALLEGED PRACTICE OF ARSENIC-EATING IN STYRIA.
                           BY DR. H. E. ROSCOE.
 PROFEssoR Roscoe being anxious to obtain further definite informa
tion respecting the extraordinary statements of Von Tschudi, quoted
by Johnston in his “ Chemistry of Common Life,' that persons in
 Styria are in the habit of regularly taking doses of arsenious acid,
varying in quantity from 2 to 5 grains daily, was supplied, through
the kindness of his friend Professor Pebal of Lemberg, with a series
of letters written by seventeen medical men of Styria to the govern
ment medical inspector at Grätz, concerning the alleged practice.
After reviewing the opinions of Dr. Taylor, Mr. Kesteven, and Mr.
Heisch upon the subject, and having mentioned the results and
conclusions arrived at by those who had previously interested them
selves with the subject, Mr. Roscoe stated that all the letters received
from the medical men in Styria agree in acknowledging the general
prevalence of a belief that certain persons are in the habit of conti

                 Intelligence and Miscellaneous                          Articles.                                   551
nually taking arsenic in quantities usually supposed sufficient to
produce death.     Many of the reporting medical men had no expe
rience of the practice; others describe certain cases of arsenic-eating
which have not come under their personal notice, but which they
have been told of by trustworthy people whose names are given;
whilst others, again, report upon cases which they themselves have
observed.   Professor Roscoe proceeded to bring forward, in the first
place, evidence bearing upon the question, “Is or is not arsenious
acid, or arsenic in any other form, well known to, and distributed
amongst the people of Styria P” He said that he had received 6 grims.
of a white substance forwarded by Professor Gottlieb, of Grätz,
accompanied by a certificate from the district judge of Knittelfeld
in Styria, stating that this substance was brought to him by a
peasant woman, who told him that she had seen her farm-labourer
eating   it,and that she gave                justice
                                              it    up   toput stop       to   evil    a                  to     so
a practice.    An accurate chemical analysis showed that the substance
was pure arsenious acid.         Extracts from many            the reports       of
                                                                               the                               of
medical men were then          read,  all stating  that arsenious acid, called
“Hidrach”             by
                   the Styrian peasants,         well known and widely dis
                                                               is

     ON  THE DENSITY OF MIXTURES OF ALCOHOL AND WATER.
                          BY M. WON BAUMHAUER.
    The author has made a series of determinations of the density of
 mixtures of alcohol and water. The alcohol was obtained from two
 different sources, and was rectified first over dried carbonate of potash,
 and then five times from burnt lime.             Thus prepared, one of the
 specimens had the specific gravity 0-7946 at 15°C., and the other
 0-7947 at the same temperature.           This number agrees with that
 found by Pouillet for absolute alcohol prepared by Fremy, and was
 not changed by further rectification.        The mixtures were made in
 carefully graduated tubes at 15°, and the distilled water was freed
 from air by continued boiling and cooling in vacuo.                   The alcohol
 and the water were weighed as a control.            The results were reduced
 to water at its greatest density.    They are collated with those ob
 tained by Pouillet, from which they are seen to differ materially.

     Further experiments are being made at high temperatures, which
 show, in the gases in which a cooling effect is found, a decrease of
 this effect, and an increase of the heating effect in hydrogen. The
 results at present arrived at indicate invariably that a mixture of gases
 gives a smaller cooling effect than that deduced from the average of
 the effects of the pure gases.—From the Proceedings of the Royal

    ON  THE TEMPERATURE             OF WATER      IN THE SPHEROIDAL STATE.
                                  BY    C. MARIGNAC.
     M. Boutigny’s experiments have led to the conclusion that the
  temperature of bodies in the spheroidal state is constant, and is
  somewhat below the boiling-point of the body. That of water is
  96°5. Other experimenters, however, have not found so high a
  temperature.
      M. de Luca” considers that the direct determination of the tem
  perature of water in the spheroidal state, by means of a thermometer
  immersed in the spheroid, is liable to serious errors.                    He has esti
   mated it   by means of a coloured        solution,     which becomes decolorized
   at a certain temperature. He used for this purpose iodized starch, the

blue colour of which disappears at 80°, and the decolorization com
mences even at 50°. When a portion of this liquid is made to pass
into the spheroidal state in a platinum crucible strongly heated, it
does not become decolorized, and the spheroid retains its colour to
the end. According to M. de Luca, this experiment proves that
the temperature of water in the spheroidal state does not exceed 80°,
and is even below 50°.
   M. de Luca also states that a spheroid of albumen containing
twice its volume of water becomes opalescent on its surface only,
while the centre remains limpid and transparent, so that it can be
dissolved in water, coagulated by heat, and the albumen precipitated
by alcohol.
   The author (says M. Marignac) would probably have obtained
more desisive results by placing in suspension in water substances
fusible at fixed temperatures.     The reactions to which he appeals
do not take    place  at perfectly  distinct points; they are possible
within considerable  ranges  of the thermometric scale, but are acce
lerated by  a higher temperature.    Those who have had occasion to
exhibit the decolorization of iodized starch, must have seen that the
temperature reaches boiling before the colour disappears, and it is
only decolorized, even after some time, although, as M. de Luca
says, when exposed for some time to 80° it is also decolorized. The
direct measurement of the temperature of the spheroidal state is un
doubtedly liable to error from the influence of the radiant heat of
the sides of the incandescent crucible.      But this affects the stem,
and not the bulb of the thermometer, and is therefore inconsiderable.
   The following simple experiment gives a method of determining
the real temperature of the spheroidal state, not in an absolutely exact
manner, but at any rate with a certain approximation, and with com
plete security.
   For this purpose as large a quantity of water as possible is brought
into the spheroidal state, and without removing the lamp, the cru
cible is inclined so that the water falls into a small thin platinum
