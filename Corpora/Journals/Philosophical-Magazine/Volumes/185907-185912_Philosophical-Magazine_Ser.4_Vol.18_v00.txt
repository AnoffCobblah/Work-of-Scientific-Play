On     the   Action    of   the Magnet upon the Electric Current, from a
                                 new point of view.
76.
       Tº     rotary motion of a magnetic pole around the con
           ducting wire, and of the conducting wire around a
magnetic pole, are phaenomena which, on their discovery by
Faraday, arrested the attention the more, because they were not
connected by analogy with any previously observed phaenomena.
Laplace and Biot, by considering the action between the pole
and a single element of the linear conductor of the current,
obtained an elementary force whose magnitude is inversely pro
portional to the distance between the pole and the current
element, and whose direction is perpendicular both to the direc
tion of the stream-element and to that of the straight line con
necting this element with the pole. This force, which is reversed
in direction both by an inversion of the magnetic polarity and
by an inversion of the direction of the current, would move the
stream-element, if it were free to move, parallel to itself, in a
circle around the line which passes through the pole and is
parallel to the stream-element.

   77. The above gives, in the form of an integral, the expres
sion for the total action of a magnet upon a current whose con
ductor is a linear one of arbitrary form.  It has, however, been
assumed here that this form remains continually unchanged.
We obtain a new point of view if we regard the conductor as
perfectly flewible, and then inquire what would be the form of
such a conductor as current-bearer under the influence of the
magnet. From the simplest mechanical principles the following
laws are derived.
   78. I.          If
             any magnetic forces act upon a perfectly flewible con
ductor through which an electric current passes, equilibrium can
only exist when each element of the conductor is so disposed that
the magnetic action upon it disappears, that  when the conductor                    is,
assumes the form             of
                      magnetic curve.

                 Prof. Plücker on            the   Action of        the       Magnet
employed, just as the spectra of Davy’s arc show the character
of the electrodes.
    Under the influence of a magnet, Davy’s arc of light assumes
the form of a magnetic curve, if the end-points of the two electrodes
are so situated with respect to the magnet as to constitute two
points of the magnetic curve.                     If
                                          the end-points of the two elec
trodes are brought into another position where the above con
dition is no longer fulfilled, the arc can no longer exist; it must
be broken, and, according to the density of the surrounding
gas, gives rise to the appearance of a springing, hissing, or
undulatory light.
    The previous experiments in this direction of so many eminent
physicists, are amply sufficient for consideration from this point
of view.        I
                shall therefore at present only refer to my own
observations, which will be found in the next succeeding paper.
With the exception of some older ones, they have been performed
with the direct purpose of verifying Law I.
    81. (2) One of the two extreme points of the electric discharge
is fixed, and the second is subjected only to the condition of lying
on a given surface of arbitrary form. These conditions obtain
in the remarkable behaviour of that light which have called                          I

                                             in   a
curve   is the same for               all
                                elementary       currents, and       perfectly           is
defined      by
              passing through the given fixed point.               The whole

the curve becomes             consequence brightly luminous.

negative electrode, corresponds                   to   a    continuous luminous surface
formed from magnetic curves.
   Inasmuch            as
               the magnetic                        curves         remain the same              if       the

magnetic polarity be inverted, it follows that after such an                                         in
version, exactly the same appearance is shown.
    The beautiful phaenomena first observed by me (see Phil. Mag.
for August and December 1858), as well as similar ones, after
wards to be described, formed at the positive electrode, are
therefore fully explained.
     82. (3) The discharge occurs between two given surfaces, or
between different portions of the same given surface; so that the
elementary discharge-currents may, within certain limits, seek
their terminal points upon these surfaces.                 In this case also
experiment had preceded theory. The first observation of this
 kind was made upon an evacuated ellipsoid, which formed the
 central portion of a Geissler tube (63).             If it was placed equa
 torially upon the approximated armatures, a vaulted arch con
 sisting of luminous magnetic curves was formed in                    interior,       its
 far removed from the two electrodes.              After the eye had once
 had    its attention directed             to
                                        these   phaenomena,        recognized    it
 them also under other and         very   different circumstances.
     83. It  now only remains           make some preliminary remarks
                                               to
 concerning the application           Law II., which determines the only
                                         of
 possible path which the electric discharge, under the influence
 of   the magnet, may follow                   on

                      which determines the epipolar-magnetic curve.
 Let us, for example, suppose that the internal surface has the
 form   of    triaxial ellipsoid, and that this lies with
              a                                                         middle            its

is only   whether no electric discharge passes through the nearest
possible approximation to an absolute vacuum which we can
procure.     A Torricellian vacuum, especially such a one as exists
in the tubes prepared by M. Cassella for Mr. Gassiot, which
show the broad clouds of light, is evidently more perfect than
the gas-vacua in the different Geissler tubes which were produced
by means of a mercury air-pump, and in which a lower tension
than 1 millim. is probably unattainable. At my request M.
Geissler has also lately made Torricellian vacua in longer and
wider tubes with great care. The best of these tubes allow the
passage of the direct discharge of Ruhmkorff’s apparatus.          This
discharge, which is accompanied by a white light, soon, however,
becomes intermittent, and after one or two minutes it completely
ceases.

 be able    pass induced currents through them. (See subsequent
                to

from the positive                 to
                           the negative electrode.  M. von Breda, however,

touching the dark part of the tube near the negative electrode
with a weak horseshoe magnet, the system of white clouds were
drawn further into the dark space: a beautiful appearance was
thus presented, which                     I had already seen
                                           produced by Mr. Gas
siot, but which           I had up to that

in Geissler's tubes. On touching with two fingers that part
of the tube where the first light-cloud bordered on the dark
space, the whole of the clouds were driven back towards the
positive pole; that                 is,
                        there was repulsion where     the former                    in

 vacuum, and accordingly no light is then produced.                We are led
 therefore to the conclusion that the          light  of the  discharge-cur
 rent, and the consequent corresponding spectrum of such gas
 vacua, entirely depend upon the residual traces of gas, and are
 consequently characteristic of the gas employed on each occasion.
 For the determination of the special spectra, I chose, to begin
 with, hydrogen, oxygen, and carbonic acid; and I obtained for
 these three gases perfectly definite, constant, and distinct spectra.
 It is true that it is impossible in a graphic representation to re
 produce even approximately the original colours of such spectra.
 Such representation is also rendered the more difficult by certain
 parts of the spectra being characterized by an unusual intensity
 of light. But such a representation furnishes a true picture of
 the phaenomenon for those who have once seen                 and      suffices it,      it
 completely for subsequent comparison.

   102. In the spectrum of hydrogen, almost the whole of the
light is concentrated into three bands,-namely, a dazzling red
at the extremity of the spectrum, a beautiful greenish blue, and
finally a violet of inferior brightness, whose distance from the
greenish blue is about two-thirds of the distance of the latter
from the dazzling red.                  In the narrow             tube the electric           light
stream appears red.

situated on the extreme boundary of the red, the second is reddish
orange, the third greenish yellow, the fourth green, the fifth blue,
and the last violet. Both of the two first spaces are divided into
three equally broad subdivisions by narrow black-grey bands,
of which two always border upon the bright band. The first
space is brown-red, the second dirty-orange and yellow.         The
third and fourth spaces are of a rather faded green, and much
subdivided by different degrees of shading. The fifth space,
which is very faded, is divided into two equal spaces, which are
shaded off from the red side towards the violet.     After the last
mentioned violet     band, another dark    portion of the spectrum
occurs about as wide as the red-yellow portion.        In this dark
portion three spaces are separated by three prominent and well
marked violet bands, whose breadth is of the same value as that
of the before-mentioned six bands. The last of these violet
bands forms the visible boundary of the spectrum.       The first of
these three  spaces, which is contiguous  with the above six bright
bands, is somewhat broader than the third.        Both are perfectly
black. The second and middle space is about as broad as the
first and third together, and is of a very dark violet colour.
   The first band, which at the moment of commencing was of
an especially brilliant red, lost almost the whole of    brightness         its

increasing effect upon the spectrum of the oxygen in proportion
as the latter gas is removed : for this reason two tubes had to
be rejected for accurate determinations.     In the first one, to
which the above   remarks have reference, the previously described
spectrum of carbonic acid became continually more and more
prominent.     For this fact, which at first seemed very surprising,
a sufficient explanation  was soon found.     The same exhaustion
apparatus, namely (constructed with mercury), had been employed
just before to exhaust carbonic oxide, which here has the same
action as   carbonic acid (115). In the second tube, traces of ni
trogen were recognizable; this tube had also to be rejected, be
cause it evidently contained air mixed with the oxygen gas.
   110. In the extinction of the electric current in oxygen gas,                                     I
have already (73) recognized a proof that no current can exist in an
absolute vacuo, to which we can only approximate practically to
a greater or less extent.       I may here add that the electric cur
rent in an empty space                (if
                                one can exist there) certainly cannot
be  luminous; for         this were the case, the spectrum for empty

extreme ones     alone,  which the bright band partly covered, had
disappeared,        that only six such lines remained between the
                   so
new   bright  band and the boundary           the orange.  ofThe brilliant
red band was      gradually    extinguished;    and the result was the
formation     ofthe pure spectrum          nitrogen gas

that the red band due to the oxygen was at first of still greater

   113. A further experiment showed that nitrous oride (NO)
also immediately splits up into                      its
                                               simple constituents. The
band due      to the oxygen was less bright.
    114. The next gas examined was aqueous vapour. M. Geissler
prepared      an excellent tube for this purpose with his accustomed
skill, in   the following manner.           Two large bulbs were blown
upon  a    tube, one         of
                           them   being    provided  with    cock towards  a
the end     of the tube; the tube, having been filled with water, was
heated until the last trace           air was driven out and nothing but
                                       of
aqueous vapour remained.           The cock was then closed.      The tube         .
was then heated over          spirit-lamp,
                                  a          while the bulb with the cock
was immersed            infreezing mixture.
                             a                   This bulb,      which the      to
cock was attached, was then fused off. The same operation was
repeated      by  plunging the second bulb           the freezing mixture,
                                                                in
and then      fusing      off while the tube itself was heated. The
                         in it
electric current         the narrow tube showed the most beautiful
                                                                                          of its
deep red.       The spectrum was that             pure hydrogen with
                                                           of
three    prominent     bands,        comparison
                                      in           with the brightness
which, the rest         of
                        the luminous divisions were           insignificant,so
that here the      shading   off       of
                                      colour and luminous    intensity   was
scarcely      to   be
                    recognized.      The aqueous vapour had separated
 into   its  simple constituents; but unfortunately M. Geissler
 had   already    passed the current through.         The one constituent,
 namely oxygen, had already been removed                              by
                                                           combining with
 the negative platinum electrode.
   115. After the above-described experiments,               necessarily        it
seemed   very  doubtful whether the      spectrum         carbonic acid       of
previously described really belonged        this acid      to  undecom     in      its
posed state.      was not possible for the acid
                    It                                   have been de      to
composed into            its
                    simple constituents; for       that case we must in
have obtained the spectrum for oxygen gas, while the small
quantity      of
             solid carbon must have been deposited (perhaps                               in
inappreciable quantity)               on
                            the interior                    of
                                              the glass tube.      Hence
the only  possible  remaining   alternative was either that the acid
                                      had split                       up
had continued undecomposed,                       a orinto oxygen and
carbonic oxide.     The fact          depositof    oxide        platinum
                                                                     of            of
having been formed, was hostile          the first supposition
                                                     to            (107).
All doubt was removed                 on
                             determining the spectrum            carbonic            of
owide. This spectrum was identical with that into which the
carbonic acid spectrum was soon transformed             the diminution    by
 ofthe brightness            of
                      the extreme red. The spectrum

of platinum is deposited, the less refrangible light disappears from
the spectrum (104); as the oxygen is gradually removed, the                                                        in
terior of the tube approaches to a vacuum.
   116. The remarkable analogy in the chemical relations of
iodine, bromine, and chlorine, reappears also in their spectra*.
I shall not at present describe these spectra, because the manner
in which the tubes have hitherto been made did not admit of
complete exclusion of the air, and the spectra consequently were
not pure, but a superposition of two spectra.     Moreover, during
the passage of the   current, the above bodies combine with the
platinum of the negative electrode. The iodine spectrum remained
sufficiently long to admit of being copied.     It was necessary to
employ four bromine tubes in succession, each of which sufficed
    for
     the determination       one portion      of
                                              the spectrum.    The         of
entire spectrum was formed                         by
                                putting the four portions together.

Sºº        the publication in the Philosophical Transactions of
      my paper on the Lavas of Mount Etnaf, a Report by Prof.
Smyth, Her Majesty's Astronomer for Scotland, has been printed
by the Admiralty of Great Britain, “On the Teneriffe Astrono

“volcanic theories” is introduced.
   This chapter, which did not form part of the original Report
as published by the Royal Society in the Philosophical Transac
tions for 1858, contains a discussion of Won Buch's theory of
craters of elevation, together with critical remarks on passages
in my writings, and those of Mr. Poulett Scrope.      do not feel         I
myself called upon to reply to any of these comments, as they

right to point out the mistakes into which the author has fallen,
and the insufficiency of the evidence on which he relies.
   At p. 553 of the new edition of the Report above alluded to
(dated February 1859), the following passage occurs:—
   “The question of the submarine origin of Teneriffe no longer
depends only on the general structure of            lava-beds,     on              its                      or

Grand Canary and Palma, but has now the additional and most
unanswerable argument          fossil shells having lately been dis
covered about the slopes      the crater.”   of of
   And again     the same page:–
                          in
   “The proof      fossil shells,

We were told that the same remark holds good in reference to
certain other deposits containing shells, which we did not ex
amine, in the north-eastern extremity of the island, still further
from the Peak.
   In the first of the passages above cited, Prof. Smyth has alluded
to fossiliferous strata in the islands of Grand Canary and Palma.
In regard to Palma, I may mention that Mr. Hartung and I,
when we were there in 1854, searched in vain for fossils; no
travellers had then found any ; and our correspondents in the
Canaries have still no knowledge of any having been obtained in
that member of the Archipelago.
   Lastly, as to the Grand Canary, Won Buch was,               believe,               I
the first to call attention to the existence of marine shells in
that island, where Mr. Hartung and I collected them in abun
dance in 1854, and ascertained that they are imbedded in nearly
horizontal strata continuous over a large area, where they form an
elevated platform about 400 feet high, near the town of Las
Palmas, a platform terminating abruptly in a range of cliffs near
the sea, facing the north-east.        These upraised sedimentary
strata, with some intercalated basaltic beds, are far removed
from the slopes of the great dome-shaped volcanic mass, which
forms the central nucleus of the Grand Canary; and if they
have any bearing on the question of “Craters of Elevation,”
they certainly do not corroborate that hypothesis, but, on the
contrary, are directly opposed to                  it;
                                          for though they have been
upheaved         in district where intermittent volcanic action has

      W. On Frictional Electricity.      By Prof. VolpiceLLI*.
               a year ago Prof. Volpicelli drew attention to certain
         striking anomalies observed by him on attempting to
 develope electricity by the friction of certain resinous substances.
After repeating his experiments with a great many different
bodies, and thus familiarizing himself more perfectly with the
 anomalies in question, he is at length enabled to state more pre
 cisely the conditions of their existence.
    If a stick of ordinary sealing-wax be held by one extremity
 and pulled briskly between the finger and thumb of the other
 hand, no matter whether the latter be naked or covered with a
 woollen or other glove, negative electricity will in general be de
 veloped, as may be seen on presenting the stick thus rubbed to
 the knob of a dry-pile electroscope.      On varying the energy of
 the stroke, however, it will be found that the indications of the
 electroscope are by no means constant.        For example, negative
 electricity having been developed in the manner described, let
the stick be exposed a second time to friction and in the same
manner, the energy of the stroke alone being diminished; the
negative character of the developed electricity will be also dimi
nished; in fact, on repeating the stroke last described, and after
each stroke testing the nature of the electricity, the stick may
be reduced to the neutral state, and subsequently converted into
a positively electrified body.
    A little practice is alone necessary in order to obtain these
effects with certainty, and to have the stick of sealing-wax per
fectly under control, so that by a single stroke of greater or
less energy, a positive, negative, or neutral electric condition
may be imparted to the sealing-wax, whatever may have been
the previous state of the same.         Continuing the friction with

properly adjusted energy, either electric state may be rendered
permanent, or seizing the stick by the middle and stroking one
extremity more vigorously than the other, the first may be made
negative, the second positive; and thus different electric polarities
may be developed simultaneously in one and the same body by
rubbing its extremities with the same substance, but with differ
ent degrees      of energy.
   To the phaenomenon above described, Prof. Volpicelli has
given the name of alternate polarity, in order to distinguish it
from another, successive polarity, where, by changing the energy
of friction, the developed electricity may be changed in one or
the other way, but not back again. The three resinous bodies
with which the phaenomenon of alternate polarity may be obtained
with certainty, are common sealing-wax (cera di Spagna), gum
lac, and jalap resin (resina scialappa).           With ten other resins
which were     examined,    as well as with    amber,   negative electricity
alone could be     obtained,   no matter to what extent the energy of
the friction was varied.         A cold dry atmosphere is of course
favourable to the success of the experiments with the three
resins; but at        all
                       times the effects described may            obtained,    be

    The condensing electrometer             Volta was occasionally used

that in the refraction. Till, however, H is actually measured,
the data for an exact determination of this point are wanting.

    The sensitiveness evidently increases as the temperature rises;
 and it is far greater than that exhibited by any other substance
 examined by us, with the single exception of bisulphide of car
 bon, which is about equally sensitive.             The effect of changes of
 temperature on the dispersion could not be accurately determined.
    Phosphorus, as is well known, dissolves with extreme readi
 mess in bisulphide of carbon.            A saturated solution is almost
 as refractive and dispersive as melted phosphorus itself: indeed
 from one which was not perfectly saturated, the following ob

    These numbers are not worthy of much confidence, especially
 at the more refracted end of the spectrum.                  From a somewhat
 weaker, and therefore more manageable solution of phosphorus
 in bisulphide of carbon, the following indices were obtained:—

     From these indices may be calculated—

             Dispersive power .      .   .   .    .   =0,1613
    The angular measurements from          which these various indices
 were calculated were made only to         minutes, as the fluctuations
 due to temperature rendered any           greater nicety of no value.
 Another and more serious obstacle          arose from a certain indi
 stinctness of the    spectrum   as seen   through    phosphorus, which
 caused the    recognition   of the fixed lines to be very difficult.
 It is not easy to assign a reason for this: it is not due to
 the great refraction or dispersion; and though the extreme
 degree of sensitiveness may be a partial cause, it certainly will
 not account for the whole phaenomenon.             It is independent of
 the more or less crystalline condition of solid phosphorus, and
 of the presence of unmelted matter in the same substance when
 liquified; for it is equally observable in a solution of the element
 in bisulphide of carbon, which of course may be obtained per
 fectly clear.   It is curious to observe how, on the addition of
 successive   portions  of phosphorus to bisulphide of carbon, the
 lines of the  spectrum,  which were originally sharp, become more
and more cloudy. We are rather disposed to attribute this              in
distinctness to a slight opalescence, caused by the beam of light
converting a little of the phosphorus into that allotropic condi
tion which does not melt at so low a temperature, and which is
insoluble in bisulphide of carbon, and therefore assumes the
solid form even while the observer is looking at the rays.
    The phosphorus experimented on was colourless, having been
heated under water with bichromate             of potash and sulphuric
acid. The ordinary yellowish phosphorus, unlike most yellow
substances, absorbs the extreme red rays, and transmits the
blue, no doubt much weakened in intensity.             This appears the
more worthy of notice when we remember that another form of
the same element reflects the red and absorbs the other rays.
    Phosphorus flame.—A strong solution of phosphorus in bisul
phide of carbon was burnt in a lamp. The intense white flame
which resulted was found to exhibit a spectrum extending from
about the fixed line a of the solar spectrum to the extreme violet,
but perfectly free from any indication of dark lines or bands.

            y&=   x3  =$2, ay=88 =S/3, 82=yS=Sy.
   Observe that S is a symbol         of operation such that S*= 1, and
that §  is convertible with each of the other symbols 2, 3, y.             It
will be not so much a restrictive assumption in regard to S, as
a definition of   –1     considered as a symbol of operation if we
write S=   –1   ; the group thus becomes
               1, ot,  Á,  'y,   — 1, —o.,      –8,       —'y,

              2=&y= —y8, 8=y2 = xy, y= x8=32.
 Hence 2, 8, y combine according to the laws of the quaternion
symbols i, j, k ; and it is only the point of view from which the
question is here considered which obliges us to consider the
symbols as belonging to a group of 8, instead of (as in the theory
of quaternions) a group of 4.
   Suppose in general that the symbols 2, 8 are such that

and   therefore    if   v  =   n, a”  = 2*" or            a”-')  = 1, whence
u(s"—1)=0(mod.m.); or since u is arbitrary, s”–1=0 (mod.m),
an equation which, if m, n are given, determines the admissible

the points when their symbols are given, depending upon the
equality of the amharmonic ratios of points and great circles on
the sphere, with those of the points and straight lines into which
they are projected gnomonically, which I now proceed to inves
tigate.
   Arts. (2), (13), though to be found in every treatise on modern
geometry, and art. (3), which occurs in Mulcahy’s ‘Principles of
Modern Geometry,” are given in order to save the trouble of
reference.   The results of (6), (7), (9), (10) have also appeared
before; the methods, however, of deducing them by spherical
trigonometry, now given, are very much more simple and direct
than those which I had previously employed.

   58       Prof. Challis on the “Loss of half an undulation”
   that position a decrement of density from within to without, due
   partly to the original waves, and partly to the lateral spreading.
   So far as the decrement is due to the original waves, the propa
   gation from within to without tends continually to increase the
   density at the mouth of the tube.        But this tendency is imme
   diately counteracted by the lateral spreading, the effect of which,
  consequently, in producing decrement of density from within to
  without near the tube's mouth, has at each instant a given ratio
  to the decrement due to the original waves.          Analogous consi
  derations apply to the case in which the particle is urged by an
  accelerative force from without to within.       In this case the den
  sity increases from within to without, and, so far as the increment
  is due to the original waves, the tendency of propagation is to
  diminish the density at the mouth. This diminution is imme
  diately counteracted by the external lateral spreading, and the
  increment of density from within to without, due at any instant
 to the original waves, is thus augmented, and in the same con
  stant ratio as in the former case.     Hence, if the accelerative force
 impressed on the particle by the original waves be f, the actual
 accelerative force is qf, q being a certain constant.          In order
 that the    density at the mouth of the tube      may  be always   equal
 to that of the external     air, or that the position of what is called
 a loop in this class of vibrations be at the mouth, it is necessary
 that the factor q be equal to 2. When this is the case, the
 motion within the tube, as the mathematical theory proves, con
 sists of two equal series of undulations propagated in opposite
 directions. Consequently, as the motion is excited at one end
 of the tube, the effect that takes place at the opposite open end
 is a reflexion of the undulations in a phase contrary to that of
 incidence. A reflexion of the same kind would be produced by
 placing a diaphragm transverse to the axis of a tube along which
 a series of waves is propagated, and giving to it just double the
 velocity which the fluid in contact with it would receive from
the undisturbed effect of the propagated waves. The diaphragm
will thus impress on the fluid an accelerative force equal to that
 due to the waves, and give rise to two additional series of waves,
equal in magnitude to the original series; one of opposite phase
and propagated in the opposite direction, and the other of the
same phase and propagated in the same direction.              By giving
to the    diaphragm   any  other motion   having a given ratio, q, to the
undisturbed motion, these effects may be altered at pleasure.
If    q = 1, no effect is produced, and if q be less than unity, the
return waves are of the same phase as the incident.
     In order to apply these considerations to the reflexion of
light at the surfaces of transparent media,        I shall suppose, for
the sake of simplicity, that the light is incident perpendicularly

                                       in Physical Optics.                                                     59
on the surfaces.     As we have here to consider the action of
transparent media on waves of light, it is necessary to make
suppositions respecting the constitution of such media, and the
dynamic relations subsisting between them and the luminiferous
aether.                                  I
          On these points have already advanced, with reference
to a   theory of physical forces, very definite hypotheses, from
which, in the present theory, I shall not have occasion to depart.
The following explanation, consequently, so far as it is success
ful, may be regarded as a corroboration of the truth of the
hypotheses.     I have supposed that visible media generally con
sist of a collection of hard and inert spherical atoms, which act
upon each other dynamically only through the intervention of
undulations of the aether. Accordingly the aether is of the same
density within the media as without, and any effect which the
media produce on the undulations propagated within them is
due solely to the obstacles they present to the free motion of
the aether, and the reflexions which take place at the surfaces
 of their atoms. In my communication to the ‘ Philosophical
 Magazine,’ for last March,                   I
                                 have given reasons for concluding
 that the part of the reflexions which is unaccompanied by con
 densation produces a mutual repulsion between neighbouring
 atoms.    But, if this be the case, it is evident that the same re
 flexions must also act on the fluid itself. The effect of such action
on waves propagated in transparent media, appears to admit of
the following investigation. In the first place, it is to be re
marked, that the breadth A of a luminous undulation has a very
large ratio to the mean interval between the atoms.          This fact,
as is   known,   has been established in the instance of glass, by
microscopic observation of finely-drawn parallel lines on           sur                                 its
face, which are still seen distinctly separate, when the mean
interval between them          less thanis     By considering,

tions are incident in the same phase on a glass-reflector at the
angle of complete polarization, no reflexion takes place if the
plane of reflexion be perpendicular to that of the polarization of the
original ray. As the reflexion is considered to bring the two rays to
the same plane of polarization, it is imagined that the non-reflexion
is caused by interference, and, as the lengths of the respective
paths do not accord with this supposition, it is further supposed
that one of the rays has suffered the loss of half an undulation.
The necessity for these gratuitous suppositions arises out of the
inadequacy of the vibratory theory of light to explain the phae
nomena.      According to the hydrodynamical theory of polariza
tion, which I have given in vol. viii. part 3 of the ‘Cambridge
Philosophical Transactions,’ the two parts of a plane-polarized
ray, bifurcated in the manner above stated, constitute, on meeting
in the  same phase, a plane-polarized ray equivalent to the origi
nal  one, and having the same plane of polarization.        It is for
this reason, solely, that the compound ray is not reflected when               in
cident on the glass-reflector in a plane perpendicular to that of
original polarization. This simple explanation essentially de
pends on an investigation of the properties of polarized rays by
means of partial differential equations, as will be seen -

 sulting the paper above cited.
   These are the only instances of the supposed loss of half an
undulation in physical optics which require to be brought under
discussion.

 Etudes sur la Métamorphisme des Roches. Par M. DELEsse, Ingénieur

     this work M. Delesse has brought
             into the interesting subject        of the metamorphism of
rocks, the publication of which had hitherto been scattered through
the Annales des Mines.
   He first of     all
                   considers metamorphism under two heads, namely,
normal     general
          or        metamorphism, which proceeds from causes which
         obvious,          produced             on
                                             large scale, and abnormal

are not            and       is                      a
special metamorphism,         or
                             what   called contact metamorphism.
                                        is                                It

    Secondary actions, moreover, are often set in motion in conse
 quence of the infiltration of heated water, or of vapours; and these
 actions may extend to some distance from the actual intrusive mass.
    He divides the intrusive* rocks into lavas, trappean rocks and
 granitic rocks; and he examines the action of each upon the various
 rocks which include or surround them, as the ores, the combustible
 rocks, the felspathic rocks, and calcareous, siliceous, and argil
laceous rocks.
    The first conclusion which M. Delesse states as the result of his
investigations, is that the metamorphic effect of mere heat has been
greatly exaggerated; and he then gives an account of the action of
heat on some substances, as observed in the laboratory and in sub
terranean fires in mines.
    We must say that the conclusions to be drawn from these experi
ments, as well as those derivable from the observation of the action
of lava-streams on rocks, do not appear to us to be necessarily
applicable to the action of deeply-seated rocks, without much
caution and reserve.       The conditions of pressure, and            action                      its                 on

at Woodburn, which cuts through greensand and chalk, both
becoming crystalline near the dyke, and says that the existence of
the Glauconite (a hydrosilicate of iron and potash) in a limestone
which has become crystalline from the contact of trap, “entirely
excludes the hypothesis of that crystallization being the result of an
action exclusively igneous.”
  His remarks on the metamorphic action which the trap or whin
stone of the neighbourhood of Edinburgh have produced on the grits
of the Carboniferous formation there, are very interesting.  The
specimen of whinstone examined by M. Delesse contained—

   It made a considerable effervescence when plunged into acid, con
taining carbonates of lime, of iron, and of magnesia.       The great
quantity of carbonic acid in the trap, he thinks, might have been
the result of infiltrations of carbonate of lime, proceeding from the
calcareous grit into which the trap was injected.     This calcareous
grit was, indeed, rather a sandy limestone than a grit, as M.
Delesse observes; for it contained 66:19 per cent. of carbonate of
lime. He particularly points to the apparent presence of a mixture
of zeolite in the grit when near to the trap; and finishes his remarks
 on the metamorphism of the siliceous rocks, by calling attention to
 the fact of the frequent development of hydrated minerals, proving,
 as he believes, that in this metamorphism the “premier rôle” does
 not belong to igneous but to aqueous action.
  . . His account of the action of the trap at Portrush in the North of
  Ireland, is given in the following abstract:—
      “At Portrush, in the north-east of Ireland, we find a rock which
 at first sight appears to be trappeam, and which nevertheless con
 tains well-preserved fossils.
      “The partisans of Werner, Kirwan, Dr. Richardson, and Du
  bourdieu liken this rock to a basalt; they conclude, therefore, from
  the presence of fossils, that, basalt has an aqueous origin, and was
  formed at the bottom of the sea.
      “The partisans of Hutton, Sir James Hall, Playfair, Dolomieu,
   contend, on the contrary, that the rock of Portrush was deposited
   in the bosom of the waters, and has since been modified by an
   igneous action.
      “At a more recent epoch, the deposit of Portrush has been studied
   with much care by Messrs. Conybeare, Buckland, Bryce, Oldham,
   but above  all   by
                     Mr. (now Sir Richard) Griffith and Colonel (now
   General) Portlock.       visited

                                                                   in                        I

    He then states that the   base     the promontory
                                                  of       formed                                of

basalt, pseudo-basalt, porcellanite, thermantide, lydianstone, horn
stone, petrosilex, and jasper.”              He prefers to call it jasper.
   This jasper, he says, belongs to the Lias, as is proved by the many
fossils it contains, and is covered conformably by the chalk.                            The
thickness of the Lias here is only from 1 metre to 27 metres (say
from 3 feet 4 inches to 8 feet), but it has under it a still more
altered portion, which has been examined by Sir R. Kane, and
found to contain augite and bronzite.
   It is traversed by veins, which become more numerous as we
approach the greenstone, and are themselves filled either with green
stone or zeolites, while the stratification becomes more confused as
we approach the greenstone, till the two rocks seem almost blended
together.
   The greenstone is a dolerite very different in appearance from the
basalt which covers the country around.                        It is formed of greenish
Labradorite in macled       crystals      of several centimetres (1 centimetre–
0.39, or nearly ºths of an inch), and of blackish-green augite in
fine crystals.    We can also distinguish protoxide of iron, and some
times bronzed mica in plates of 1 centimetre.
   It is traversed by many zeolites, such as chabasite, natrolite,
mesotype, mesole, Harringtonite,                  Heulandite, stilbite, apophyllite,
Laumonite, aluminite, Scoulerite (Thomsonite), &c.                                It has also
veins of carbonate of lime, white, yellowish, and spathose, of iron
pyrites, of stellite, and even of felspar, as also of augite, in very large
crystals.
   The specimen examined by M. Delesse was taken from the large
quarry, and contained 4:22 of water, leaving in hydrochloric acid a
residue of 75 per cent.             It contained no carbonate, as most trap
rocks do.
   The normal lias near Portrush is blue, argillaceous, calcareous,

   The lias metamorphosed into jasper splits into angular fragments,
and contains veins of zeolite like those before mentioned in the
dolerite.   It may be divided into five varieties, varying in density
from 2.836 to 2-610, and in quantity of water contained, from 1:33
to 3-88. It melts easily but unequally at a red heat. It leaves a
residue of 76.75 in hydrochloric acid.                     A specimen of a blackish
grey variety gave the following analysis:–

equally well rewarded.
     We add M. Delesse's final theoretical conclusions.
     “When we study the phaenomena of metamorphism produced by
the different eruptive rocks, we find that there exists a great analogy
between them.
      “Thus the metamorphism of limestone is nearly the same at its
 contact with lava, with trap, and with granite.
     “We must nevertheless recognize the fact that lava alone bears,
in itself and in               its
                           metamorphism, the stamp             clearly evident         of    a

face in the manner apparently taken for granted by M. Delesse, and
that rocks so erupted are always lava (whether doleritic or trachytic)

of decided igneous action. We think it most likely, then, that the
difference in the effects of the lavas and the granitic rocks is due, not
to the former having been more purely igneous than the latter, but
to the different conditions under which they have acted.

   Within the last eighteen years the old and well-trodden field of
Algebra has been invaded by a host of new and strange intruders,
with the odd-sounding names of ‘Determinants,” “Hyperdetermi
nants,’ ‘Discriminants, “Emanants,’     ‘Invariants,’ ‘Evectants,’
“Bezoutiants,’ ‘Hessians’ (having no connexion, however, with
either “Boots’ or “Crucibles”), “Canonizants’ (of no religion),
“Dialytics,’ and “Quantics.” Many a reader of the Cambridge
Mathematical Journal, the Philosophical Magazine, Philosophical
Transactions, &c., has wondered what it all meant—wondered
sometimes, indeed, whether there was any meaning at all in these
new expressions and their symbols. Very few even of the best
mathematicians of the day have paid much attention to the subject
as yet; but they are beginning to do so, finding that there is really
something like a new branch growing out of their oki tree—nay,
more, that this young off-shoot is already bearing fruit. This ‘Alge
bra of Linear Transformations’ “may be said to date from a paper
published by Prof. Boole in the Cambridge Mathematical Journal for
Nov. 1841, which was mainly occupied with applications of the fol
lowing theorem:—Let an ordinary algebraic equation be made homo
geneous by writing a y for a ; let these variables then be linearly
transformed by writing Aw--py, A'r-Hpy for w and y; and let                                  V-0
be the condition that the transformed equation shall have equal
roots; then the function V will be equal to the similar function for

original equation;   that it was thus possible to form two functions
connected by a certain relation between their coefficients, and such
that, when both functions were linearly transformed, the same rela
tion should continue to exist between their coefficients.     Functions
so related have been called co-variants. The    geometrical  importance
of this theory is now manifest. When we are given the equation
of any curve or surface, the theory of linear transformations at once
presents us with equations representing other curves and surfaces,
and possessing permanent relations to the given one, which will be
unaffected by any change of the axes of coordinates:         and in like
manner the same theory presents us with certain functions of the
 coefficients of the given equation, the vanishing of which must
 express a property of the given curve or surface wholly independent
 of the choice of axes. Besides these geometrical applications, the
 theory has other important uses, which I shall not stop to enume
 rate.    That so valuable a theory is not yet as well known in this
 country as it deserves to be, must arise from the difficulty of becom

               Dr. Hofmann on                a    New Class        of Organic        Bases.              69
hydrogen on dinitronaphtaline, and gives a fuller account of the pro
ducts obtained in this process. The basic substance arising from
dinitronaphtaline crystallizes in colourless needles of great brilliancy,
which contain
                      Clo H. N, Or       Hi,             C.        -N.
It   is a well-defined basic body, which Zinin describes under the
name of seminaphlalidam.           From this later communication it would
appear that the copper-red coloration originally observed was due
to the presence of a foreign colouring matter, which can be separated
by crystallizing the base alternately from alcohol and water.
    Subsequently the copper-red body appears to have been observed
by Laurent”, who states that the action of sulphuretted hydrogen
upon dinitronaphtaline gives rise to the formation of a carmine-red
alkali.     He did not, however, analyse this substance, and the dis
covery of nitranilinet having established the existence of basic nitro
substitutes, the compound in question was hitherto believed to be
nitro-naphtylamine.
    The red crystals have of late been minutely investigated in my
laboratory by Mr. Charles Wood, whose experiments have led to an
unexpected result, which                 I
                                 beg to lay before the Society.
    A current of    sulphuretted    hydrogen transmitted through a boiling
solution of dimitronaphtaline in weak alcoholic ammonia slowly reduces
 the  nitro-compound. The process            continued for two        three hours,   or
during which time the greater part                   of is
                                              the spirit distils off; the residue
is  acidified with dilute sulphuric acid, and the liquid heated                ebul               to

rated      washed with cold water, and finally purified

the same composition as minaphthylamine.         But a superficial com
 arison of the    properties of the two bodies excludes any idea of their
       identical.    The formulae of nitrosophenyline and nitrosonaph
tyline have not as yet been finally established by the analysis of their
compounds, these substances, like colouring matters in general,
being of an indifferent character. It is probable that they are formed
by the association of several molecules, a supposition which receives
 considerable support from the discovery of minaphthylamine.
   The formation of minaphthylamine promises to add considerably
to the number of nitro-derivatives of the aromatic monamines. To
each of these substances probably corresponds a nitrous and a mitric
substitution-base, but as yet we are unacquainted with a single one
in which both derivatives are known, as shown by a glance at the
groups best examined.

               in                          changed my abode. During the

 and 3 inch thick, of which about 2000 are in daily use on the South
 Eastern Railway, and the greater portion of these are now platinized.
 The plates are delivered to me in their crude state, that is to say,
 they are merely cut into form.              Immediately on arrival they are
 placed in a stone pan, and covered with a mixture of 1 sulphuric
 acid + 4 water, in which they are allowed to remain for three or
 four days or more. They are taken out as required, and are washed
 under a tap of running water; this operation dissolves out any foreign
 matter that might be pernicious in a voltaic combination wherein
 sulphuric acid was employed; they are then partially dried. A hole
 for a rivet is next drilled in the middle, near the top of each plate—

 size of the nuggets sometimes found in the gravels, compared with
 that of the nuggets met with in the gold-bearing           quartz-veins
 (usually from about # dwt. to # oz., though occasionally as much as
 12 ozs. or even 13 lbs.), the upper portions of the veins, now ground
 down into gravel, were probably richer in gold (as formerly sug
 gested) than the lower parts, now remaining.         As far as actual
 mining experience shows, some of the “quartz-reefs” in Victoria
 prove as rich in gold at a depth of 200, 230, and 400 feet as at the
 surface; the yield, however, fluctuates at any depth yet reached.
 According to the author's latest observations, the gold-drifts, and
 their accompanying basaltic lavas, are of Pliocene and Post-pliocene
 age.    Miocene beds occur at Corio Bay, Cape Otway coast, Murray
 basin, and Brighton; and Eocene beds on the east shore of Port
 Phillip, Muddy Creek, and Hamilton. Two silicified fossils (Echi
 noderm and Coral), thought by Prof. M'Coy to be of Cretaceous
 origin, have been found in the gravel near Melbourne.

   Coins and cameos are reproduced very distinctly, even at the di
stance   of a millimetre, and notwithstanding the interposition of a
thin continuous sheet of mica, silver, or copper, provided only the
relief be strong and the temperature sufficiently elevated.
   If a paper on which a drawing had been traced in lamp-black, or
even wood-charcoal, be raised to a temperature sufficient to scorch
the paper, the portions of the reverse corresponding to the lines of
the drawing will be observed to have become more highly carbonized
than the rest.   A similar effect may be observed with respect to the
lights and shades of variegated feathers or coloured woollen fabrics;
that is to say, the action of the heat is greater on the shades than
on the lights.

       NOTICE OF TRACES OF ERUPTIVE ACTION IN THE MOON.

     The inquiry          as   to the continuance of volcanic or explosive action
on the surface of the moon must be admitted to be a very interesting
one. Astronomers are generally agreed as to             entire cessation on          its
any conspicuous scale; but this would not necessarily infer the im
possibility,         or

 be adverse      to
                the idea     any physical change.

 still he  was faithful and careful, nor does there seem any appearance,
 but the reverse, that his designs were copied from one another                  save                             to

  XV. On           Expansion of Water and Saline Solutions at High
                 the
                Temperatures.  By H. C. Sorby, F.R.S. &c.”
           studying the fluid-cavities in various minerals, I found it
 IN requisite  to ascertain the relation between the temperature
and the volume   of water and of saline solutions, up to as high a
temperature as   could be employed with advantage.       My chief
object was to make out whether there is any such simple rela
tion between the volume and the temperature,        that the tem
perature could be readily calculated from the observed volume;
which is a most important point in the study of the fluid-cavities
in many minerals.
   In his memoir on the dilatation of liquidst, M. Isidore Pierre
showed that the expansion of many may be represented very
accurately by expressions of the form
                      W = 1 + At + Bt” + Ctº,
where W  is the volume, t the temperature in degrees Centigrade,
and  A, B,  and C are constants; the volume at 0°C. being taken
    unity.   He, however, says that the expansion
 be for

the third difference is sometimes positive and sometimes nega

third difference were almost or altogether due to errors of obser

     It will thus be perceived that from 30° to 100° the agreement
is on the whole sufficiently close; for the differences obey no de
finite law, as if due to errors of observation.              Below 30°, how
ever, there is a most decided gradual increase in the difference,
evidently owing to a relative expansion taking place as the tem
perature decreases.
    Since, then, for temperatures between 30° and 100° the volume
can be expressed with very considerable accuracy by means of
one simple formula,                      I
                             was very anxious to ascertain whether the
law would hold good up to a much higher temperature; for, in
that case, it would not only be much more simple than any
formula involving higher powers of t, but could be applied to
the object            I
                 had especially in view, since it would enable us to
deduce the temperature from the observed volume by solving the
formula as a quadratic equation, which of course could not be
done if it were essentially requisite to take higher powers into con
 sideration.              I
                  was not able to carry on the experiments at a higher
 temperature than 200°C., because the water then begins to act
 very powerfully on the glass tubes, and entirely decomposes
 them in the course of time. At that heat the elastic force of the
vapour of water is very considerable, according to the experi
 ments of Dulong and Arago* being equal to 16 or 17 atmo
 spheres, or to about 240 lbs. to the square inch.                It was there
 fore necessary to make use of glass tubes strong enough to
 remove         all
               fear     fracture and explosion; and since
                                   of                                  was also                        it

bubble at various temperatures, I fixed a lens, having a focal
length of 5 inches, as an object-glass to a microscope, and pulled
out the tube of the microscope until the distance of the eye-piece
was such that each division of the micrometer in the eye-piece
corresponded to goth of an inch.        In this manner the length
of the bubble in the tube could be easily measured to within
Tºoth of an inch. Of course when the liquid in the tube ex
panded the length of the bubble diminished to the same extent,
and thus a knowledge of the length of the bubble at various
temperatures was sufficient to enable me to ascertain the amount
of the expansion of the liquid to within about gºoth of                                                         its

Not taking into consideration                            the volume at 0°, these calculated
numbers agree with the experiments as well as could be expected,
except at 200°, which is a determination far more open to doubt
than any           of the others; and                   I therefore

mine with approximate accuracy the volume of water at still
higher temperatures, whilst at the same time we must always
consider it probable that this calculated volume would be less
than the truth.    Thus, for instance, it indicates that at 300° C.

it will be perceived    that the volume differs so little up to 100°,

The direction of motion appears to me to be simply dependent
upon the direction of the first impulse. Another mode of ex
planation is thus:—Let A signify a point or locality upon the
advancing side of the moving ball, which will, by the motion
of the latter, be brought into contact with one of the heated
rails." The sources of A's gaining heat are by radiation from
the heated copper, and by conduction from the hotter parts of
the ball; and           means    its               of

       Mr.      J.   Drummond on the Molecular Structure                                     of Ice.               108

following conclusions may,     think,     drawn —  I                  inbe
    1st. That the molecular structure    both cases was the same.
   2nd. That the molecular state      each was entirely different.
                                                                 in

   3rd. That the structure in both cases was closely related to,
if not identical with that of ordinary sheet glass.   And
   4th. That the ice formed in the fracture possessed a disrup
tive structure, analogous in some respects to that of glass when
cooled rapidly.
   It is only, of course, from the direction of the cracks that we
can trace by the eye the nature of the structure.      But conclu
sions drawn from these would be of little value, could we not at
the same time trace them to the action of molecular forces.
Thus considered, however, the value of the cracks as evidence of
structure will be at once apparent. In the ice with which the
great fracture was filled, the principal crack passed through the
centre, others proceeding from it laterally.  Now the line of this
crack is exactly that of the molecular axis of sheet glass, the
principal characteristic of     structure       its
                                            which   have drawn    to             I
attention.   Again,     the case     the great Lake sheet, Prof.
                                     in               of
Erman states that       depth            third   the entire thick
                                                of                          of
                                 at
                                about

ness, the cracks proceeding from the upper and lower surfaces
met, and that this depth was the same for all.        Now     this                           if
point      be
         taken     that    the position
                            as            ofthe central molecularof
axis, we have here also the same structural characteristic. True,
 we have not here any direct evidence          existence; but the

considerations             to

therefore,    trace the causes which produced this opposite mole

reduced, the great fracture was formed.        Further, when this rent
was newly made, the water must have rushed up, filled              and                        it,

 ture far below the freezing-point of water; and then quickly                                                                     :
 placing it in a saturated solution of common salt previously re
 duced to a very low temperature,          was much surprised to find   I
 that the liquid    in the fluid-cavities had not been frozen, but the
enclosed bubbles still moved about like those in spirit-levels,
when the fragment was turned round, just as they did at first.                                                              I
 again repeated this experiment along with Dr. Tyndall; and we
 both came to the conclusion that the fluid would not freeze at a
temperature nearly 20°C. below the freezing-point of water, or
even lower than that of strong saline solutions, and therefore
there was some doubt as to whether it really could be water or
some saline solution.         I, however, had such confidence in the
value of other independent proofs, that              still adhered to the                 I
idea of        its
             being    water,  and that the phaenomenon      must     owing                                           be

whole field appears dark, and no white line is to be seem down
the centre of the tube; whereas, if the water be frozen, the double
refraction of the ice depolarizes the light, and the tube appears
as if it contained a white substance, which vanishes as the ice
thaws.     In order to delay the thawing, the small tube should be
examined when inside a larger vessel containing a strong solu
tion of common salt.
   The capillary tubes used in my experiments were prepared by
drawing out, when melted, the tubes used for alcohol thermo
meters; and their internal diameters were ascertained by mea
suring them at the broken ends by means of the microscope
micrometer, because the bore appeared about ; of the actual
diameter when seen at the side through the curved glass,                                                    I
made experiments with those whose diameters varied down to
nearly rºupth of an inch; but when so small as that, the depo
larizing action of the ice is so weak, that it is impossible to be
quite sure whether they contain water or ice. Those, however,
from a $nth to sinth of an inch in internal diameter are in every
respect most satisfactory; for there is no difficulty whatever in
deciding this point with polarized light in the manner just de
scribed. When water is contained in such tubes, we can readily
reduce the temperature to below –15°C, without using any
care to keep them quiet; and even when we shake them very
violently, it will not freeze. The temperature may even be re
duced to -16°C. (3°F.) without taking any precaution to keep
it still; but at — 17°C. the water freezes at once, even when
kept perfectly quiet.     It will thus be perceived that there is a
difference of about 11°C. (20°F.) between the temperature at
which water freezes in tubes of about 4th of an inch in diameter
and in those less than gºinth, which is so great a difference that
there is no chance of       being         its

     It
      therefore appears to be completely proved that water will
not freeze in tubes of very small internal diameter, even when
they are shaken, at a temperature very considerably lower than
 that at which it freezes at once in larger tubes, even when kept
 perfectly still, as though the actual size exerted a most decided
influence in preventing the crystallization of water, which freezing
essentially            this respect water does not stand alone; for
                      is.      In

110                  Prof. Davy on            the presence       of Arsenic
    Having collected the stalks, leaves, and pods of the peas, care                            I
 fully kept them for examination, to ascertain if those plants under
 the treatment they had been subjected to had taken up any arsenic.
 Professional business, however, of one kind or another prevented
 at the time my pursuing the subject any further; and did not                              I
 resume the inquiry till recently, when, being engaged in the de
 tection of arsenic in a case of suspected poisoning, my attention
 was again called to this subject.
    In the case I allude to, the quantity of arsenic present in the
 stomach and         its
                     contents was very minute, and           had recourse
                                                                       I                             to
 several methods for the detection of that metal before                   could         I
 affirm positively         as   to
                             the existence     arsenic; and found that
                                                         of                      I
 by  employing conjointly Reinsch's and Marsh's methods,                                        by   far
 the most satisfactory results were obtained.
    These methods are well known. The first consists                    boiling        in
the   suspected    substance     along   with diluted    hydrochloric      acid,
 together with some pieces                of
                                     metallic  copper,   when,       arsenic       if                is
 present,  it will        be
                        deposited             in
                                        the metallic state         the surface   on
of  the copper, giving           peculiar steel-grey appearance; and
                                    it
                                     a                                                               on
heating the copper after being washed and dried, the arsenic can
be   volatilized     as
                     arsenious acid, and identified                         by
                                                                  appropriate    its
tests.    The second method consists               bringing the suspected

                     be
had been applied. To determine this,              transplanted, last April,
a  small  cabbage-plant     into   flower-pot
                                          a        which in I had previously

mixture for three weeks,          cut off the top
                                     I                     the plant, which
                                                                       of

looked perfectly green and healthy. On examining it for arsenic,
I  obtained the most distinct indications of the presence of that
substance, though only a very small amount of cabbage, viz. 113
grains, were used in the experiment. This result was therefore
perfectly conclusive as to the power possessed by some plants, at
least, of taking up arsenic from manures containing that sub
stance. As in this experiment         I                      I
                                       was aware that had placed
the   plant in a most favourable condition for absorbing the poison,
and that a larger proportion of superphosphate had been em
ployed than was used in practice, my last experiments were to
ascertain if the presence of arsenic could be detected in our crops
grown with superphosphate in the ordinary way.
     Iprocured for this purpose some Swedish turnips which had
been grown with superphosphate,          and having most carefully
washed each turnip to remove every particle of adhering clay, I
cut up in small pieces 2 lbs. weight of one of the turnips, and
boiled them in a large glass flask for about three hours with 36
                                               I
fluid ounces of distilled water, to which had added 3 ounces of
hydrochloric acid (spec. grav. 1:14), placing in the mixture a
hundred grains of perfectly clean and bright turnings of metallic
copper.     After removing the copper turnings and washing them
well with water to separate the vegetable matter, and then boil
ing them for a few moments in a mixture of spirit and ether to
remove any fatty matter which might have been deposited on the

 metallic copper, and finally, after the spirit and ether had been
poured off, washing well with
found to have     acquired
                                               water, the copper was
                            the characteristic steel-grey appearance
 produced by the presence of arsenic under such circumstances,
    The copper turnings were them carefully dried, and afterwards
 heated strongly in a glass tube closed at one end, when a very
 perceptible white sublimate was produced, which, on being dis
 solved in hot distilled water, and this solution added to a Marsh's
 apparatus in operation (the hydrogen flame, which before the
 addition of the solution did not give the slightest indication of
 a metallic stain on a cool piece of white porcelain being placed
 over it), produced immediately the characteristic stains of me
 tallic arsenic in a most striking manner, proving beyond                     all
doubt that the matter deposited           on
                                        the copper was metallic
arsenic, and the sublimate arsenious acid, formed during the
heating  of the metal.
   This experiment was repeated with the same results, using
    2%
    lbs. weight of turnip taken from another       the turnips,

     To the Editors          of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,                              Edinburgh, July 16, 1859.
        ITH some surprise I see, on page 21 of the Philosophical
W          Magazine for this month, that Sir Charles Lyell has
dragged into print a portion of a private letter.                       -
   While   glad  in any  way to learn the scientific   opinions   of so
highly and deservedly esteemed an authority as the celebrated
author of the ‘Principles of Geology,'        regret that   Icannot in              I
this case agree   with him,  or allow that he has materially invali
dated any essential part of my “Teneriffe Report for 1856.’         He
allows, for instance, that the important information there given,
of fossil shells having actually been discovered in Teneriffe, is
perfectly true; but objects, first, to the discovery being spoken
of as “late,” rather than “old;” and secondly, to the locality
being alluded to as “on the slopes of the great crater.”            Yet
with regard to the first objection, he does not give any earlier
printed authority than my own pages; and with reference to the
second, absolutely refuses               all
                                  discussion     what           of

February, 1859; and as the part of the Phil. Trans, cited was
not published until three months afterwards—or, more exactly, on
Monday, May 16, 1859,-it is plain that the facts of the case
have been inverted in the pages of the Philosophical Magazine.

tions, and proceeding as in the preparation of nitrophenic acid.
When about half the liquid is distilled off, the residue in the
retort is filtered while hot; on cooling, drops of the new acid
are deposited.    A resinous mass remaining on the sides of the
retort is exhausted with boiling water, the filtered aqueous solu
tion mixed with excess of caustic soda, by which a yellow cry
stalline precipitate of isonitrophenate of soda is obtained.      The
acid is obtained by dissolving the purified soda salt in warm
water and adding hydrochloric acid. On cooling, the liquid
becomes turbid, and then filled with a mass of fine needles.
   These needles are quite colourless: they are very soluble in
ether, and are obtained on evaporation from an etherial solution
in large crystals with a fatty aspect and a reddish-yellow colour.
These appear to constitute a dimorphous modification of the
colourless needles.     On evaporating the aqucous solution of the
coloured   crystals,  the colourless needles are again obtained.
The needles again become coloured by the action of light.
   Isonitrophenic acid fuses at 110°, under water it fuses at 40°
or 50°. It volatilizes partially below       fusing-point.     its

 When dinitrochlorophenylic acid is digested with sulphide of
                                                                        –
 ammonium, the solution assumes a blood-red colour, and sulphur
 is deposited.     On evaporating the filtrate and adding acetic acid,
 this acid is obtained.       It is not very soluble even in hot water,
and    crystallizes  out on   cooling  in yellow silky needles.
    By passing a current of nitrous acid through a solution of this
 acid, it is transformed into a new acid, which the author names
diazonitrochlorophenylic       acid,

             acid.                                   acid.
The author views this acid as being derived from nitrochloro
phenylic acid, C*H*Cl (NO”) O*, by the substitution of two
atoms of hydrogen by two atoms of nitrogen.
    In  an investigation     of the creosote from coal-tar oil, Fairlie
established the existence of a new alcohol, C*H*0°, hydrated
oxide of cresyle, homologous with hydrated oxide of phenyle.
Duclos” has confirmed the existence of this alcohol in coal-tar
creosote, and has further found that it is contained in wood-tar
creosote.     The crude wood-tar was rectified, and the distillate
between 150° and 220°C. collected.             By treating this with solu
tion of soda the neutral oils were       removed,   and the soda solution
was decomposed with sulphuric acid. This treatment was re
peated until the product was quite soluble in soda.            It was then
washed with water, dried over chloride of calcium, and fraction
ally distilled, by which a fraction boiling at 187° consisting of
phenylic alcohol, and one boiling at 203° consisting of cresylic
alcohol, were obtained.
    In his description of the properties of cresylic alcohol, Duclos
confirms the statements of Fairliet, but observes, contrary to
what had been stated by Gerhardt, that cresylic alcohol is about
as soluble in ammonia as phenylic alcohol.
    Potassium liberates hydrogen from cresylic alcohol, and forms
a  deliquescent    crystalline mass consisting of fine needles.       Cre
sylic alcohol dissolves in sulphuric acid with a reddish-brown
colour and formation of sulphocresylic acid, the lead and baryta
salts of which do not crystallize.
    Mononitrocresylic Acid, C*H7 (NO”) 0°, is obtained by the
cautious addition of very dilute nitric acid to an aqueous            solu
tion of cresylic alcohol.         It is a yellowish-brown liquid      of a

salts of silver, lead, mercury, and baryta, but not those of lime,
strontia, zinc, and copper.
   The composition of the potash 'salt is C*H* KN*O'”; and
from two nitrogen determinations made by means of soda-lime,
it appeared that 2 equivs. of nitrogen were contained in a form
other than that of NO". Cyanogen could not be detected.
   The soda salt is obtained by treating picric acid with cyanide
of sodium. It is more soluble than the potash salt, and is of a
dark green colour with metallic lustre.
    The ammonia salt, C* H* (NH4) Nº Olº, forms beautiful
wedge-shaped crystals of a brownish-red colour and green lustre.
The baryta salt, formed by adding the potash salt to a solution
of chloride of barium, is a vermilion-red precipitate, which when
dried possesses a splendid light-green metallic lustre, and when
rubbed becomes red again. The lime salt, Cº H*Ca N°0°-H3HO,
formed by adding solution of chloride of calcium to a solution of
the ammonia salt, forms very beautiful green needles, often half an
inch long, and with a metallic lustre. The lead salt, when cry
stallized from hot water, in which it is somewhat soluble, appears
under the microscope in the form of very fine reddish-brown
needles, possessing a green lustre.
   It was not possible to obtain the free acid. When the potash
salt was decomposed by means of a stronger acid, further decom
position was set up.     For this reason it is not possible to dye
with solutions of the salts, beautiful as they are; for without
mordants, the colours on cloth are neither beautiful nor perma
ment, and on mordanted cloths decomposition is soon induced.
   The salts of this acid are isomeric with those of purpuric acid
(which is also unknown in the free state) obtained from uric
acid; on this account it has been named isopurpuric acid. Like
purpuric acid, isopurpuric acid appears to be bibasic.          The
salts of the two acids  present  great  similarity, both as respects
colour of the solutions, solubility, and deportment when heated.
   The optical relations of the isopurpurates were examined by
Grailich.    Isopurpurate of ammonia and murexide (which are
isomeric) are perfectly similar in their optical and crystallogra
phical deportment. They appear to belong to the rhombic system.
    The formation of isopurpuric acid may be expressed by the
following equation:—

   A  new mode of the formation of chloride of benzoyle has been
observed by Beketoffº, who, however, does not state whether                it
is advantageous in a practical point of view.
   When a mixture of chloride of sodium and anhydrous acid
sulphate of soda acts upon benzoate of soda at about 200° C.,
        º
             acid and chloride of benzoyle are set free. The
latter remains diffused in the mass, but may be extracted by
means of ether.    The action is as follows:—
   C7
                0+SO3 + Na2Cl2=C7H59, Cl- Na2SO44-HC1.
   The sulphate of soda combined with the anhydrous acid serves
to prevent the action of sulphuric acid on the benzoic acid, and
formation of benzoesulphuric acid.
  In  the preparation of creatine by Liebig’s process, there is
obtained a syrupy mother-liquor which contains several sub
stances, among which are creatinine, inosinic acid, and lactic
acid.   Streckert has further discovered in it a substance pos
sessing feeble basic properties, which he names sarcine.       is     It
obtained by adding to this mother-liquor a solution of acetate of
copper, with which it forms a compound; this is then decom
posed by means of sulphuretted hydrogen.      Sarcine is a crystal
line powder which can be heated to 150° without decomposition.
It is somewhat soluble in boiling water, but dissolves with diffi
culty in cold water and in boiling alcohol.
   Its composition is C19H4N4O2; it has feeble basic properties;
it forms a crystalline compound with hydrochloric acid, which has
the formula C19H4N4O2, HCl·H2aq.          This compound forms a
double salt with bichloride of platinum. The nitrate and sul
phate of sarcine are crystalline bodies, but are decomposed by
being crystallized from water.
   Sarcine also combines with bases and with salts.      A compound
with   baryta  has the formula C19H4N4O2+2BaO +2 aq.               It
also forms a  compound  with nitrate of silver, C19H4N4O4, AgNO3,
and with oxide of silver, C19Hº Ag” N*O2+ aq.
   In     chemical relations sarcine has great similarity with gua

gave on analysis the composition                         C19H4N40°, which is that of
xanthic oxide.
   Neglecting the intermediate nitrogenous products, the trans
formation of guanine into xanthine may be thus represented:—
                  C10H5N5 O2+O3=C10 H4N4O4 + HO + N.
                     Guanine.                         Xanthine.
Xanthine does not lose weight when heated even to 100° or 150°.
Its solution gives precipitates with corrosive sublimate, with
acetate of copper, and with nitrate of silver.  Its ammoniacal
solution gives precipitates with an ammoniacal solution of chlo
ride of zinc or of chloride of cadmium.
     Its       properties are even less strongly pronounced than
            basic
those of    guanine  or of sarcine.    Strecker further found that
xanthine is contained in small quantities as a normal constituent
of urine. It may be separated by taking advantage of           pro                                its

                    1.    Action
  The dilute solution  the nitrate    amylaniline was acted of                                          on   by
mitrous acid    100°C. for
                     at        hours.            12
                                       Amylamiline and ammonia
were obtained,            but       in   quantities      too     small      to        be   quantitatively
determined.
                     2.   Action         of   Nitric Acid        on   Amylaniline.
     Amylaniline was boiled with dilute nitric acid                             (1    part acid    to   2    of

water)   until the reaction began, which was immediately stopped by
adding     cold water to the solution.             This was filtered when cold
from the      mitrophenasic acid, and after potash had been added, it
was again     filtered to separate any undecomposed amylaniline.              The
filtrate was distilled,        the distillate redistilled per ascensum into
hydrochloric acid, and the acid solution evaporated to dryness.
The residue was then extracted with absolute alcohol, and the fil
trate evaporated to dryness.            This operation was repeated four or
five times.       A   platinum-salt.*    made with the chloride, which was
soluble in absolute         alcohol,  gave   33:55 per cent. platinum.        The
chloroplatimate of amylamine requires 33.66 per cent. The plati
num-salt of that chloride which was insoluble in absolute alcohol
gave 439 per cent. platinum.                The chloroplatinate of ammonia
requires 44.2      per  cent.
    The above reaction may be explained as follows:—

    The free nitric acid present converts the phenylic alcohol into
 nitrophenasic acid, and the amylic alcohol into nitrite of amyle.
                  3. Action of Nitric Acid on Ethylaniline.
    Ethylamiline was treated in the same manner as amylaniline. The
 platinum-salt of the chloride which was soluble in absolute alcohol
 gave in two experiments 39.6 and 39.5 per cent. platinum.                    The
 percentage of platinum in chloroplatinate of ethylamine is 39-3.
     The platinum-salt of the chloride which was insoluble in abso
 lute alcohol gave 44 per cent. platinum,               which agrees with the
 number required for the chloroplatinate of ammonia.
                 4. Action    of Nitric Acid    on Diethylaniline.
     Diethylamiline was treated with dilute nitric acid (1 part of acid to
 4  of water), and heated till the temperature reached 54°C., when,
 on being left to itself, it soon became turbid, and the temperature
 rose about 10°C.           After a while the solution cleared itself again,
 but remained very dark. When quite cold, it was filtered from the
 nitrophenasic acid, and the filtrate was treated in the same manner
 as described in Experiment 2.            The solution of the chlorides (5–6
 grms. were obtained from about 50 of diethylaniline), which were
 Soluble in absolute alcohol, was partially precipitated with bichloride
  of platinum (precipitate No. 1); then another portion was precipi
  tated, which was not used ; after this, more bichloride was added
  (precipitate No. 2); and lastly, an excess of bichloride was added
         * All   the platinum-salts determined  were recrystallized in water.

          39.2 per cent.         35.5 per cent.         35.4 per cent.
    The chloroplatinate of ethylamine contains 39.3 per cent., and of
diethylamine 35.3 per cent. platinum.            A platinum-salt made with
chloride insoluble in absolute alcohol, gave 44.2 per cent. platinum,
which is exactly the amount contained in the chloroplatinate of
animonia.

    As in the case of amylaniline, the phenylic alcohol and the alcohol
are converted into nitrophenasic acid and nitrite of ethyle; the am
monia being in both cases partially oxidized.
5. Action of Binowide of Manganese and Sulphuric Acid on Aniline.
    Aniline was dissolved in an excess of dilute sulphuric acid (1 part
of acid to 6 of water) and heated to boiling, when a small quantity
of binoxide of manganese was added. The reaction was allowed to
continue for 3 or 4 minutes, and it was stopped by cooling the flask
in water. Potash was then added, and the solution filtered. The
filtrate was distilled as described in experiment 2, and the distillate
evaporated to dryness with hydrochloric acid, and extracted with ab
solute alcohol, to dissolve any chloride of aniline present. A plati
num-salt made from the chloride, insoluble in absolute alcohol, gave
44.0 per cent. platinum, which corresponds to the platinum in the
chloroplatinate of ammonia.
      6. Action of Binowide of Manganese and Sulphuric Acid on
                                Diethylaniline.
    Diethylaniline    was treated  in the same manner as aniline, but only
for about one minute.         Potash was added, &c., as in the foregoing
experiment.       The platinum-salt partially precipitated, as in Ex
periment 4, from the chloride soluble in absolute alcohol, gave :—
          Precipitate No. 1.                    Precipitate No. 2.
          37.6 per cent.                   35'4 per cent. platinum.
    No. 1   appears     to be  only  a mixture of the chloroplatinates of
ethylamine and diethylamine; the quantity of salt first precipitated
being too small to be properly recrystallized (on account of former
experiments showing that the quantity of ethylamine present was
very small).      No. 2 corresponds with diethylamine, and of this salt

there was a large quantity, so that it was recrystallized twice.          A
platinum-salt made from the chloride insoluble in absolute alcohol
(of which there was only a very small quantity), gave 44.3 per
cent. platinum, which is almost the same as the amount in chloro
platinate of ammonia.       No phenylic alcohol was found nor any of
 its compounds; and according               experiment      Long (not yet
                                                              to    an                             of

    The author found that pure starch scarcely increased the amount
 of carbonic acid evolved, but the combination of starch with gluten
 and sugar in the cereals caused an increase of about 2 grains per
minute.     Wheat flour, oatmeal, and rice had similar effects, but
 potato had a less enduring influence.
   Fats lessened the amount of carbonic acid evolved, and when taken
with starch, the cereals, or sugar, somewhat lessened their power to
produce carbonic acid.       Fats increased pulsation.
   Sugars increased the carbonic acid evolved to the maximum extent
of from 1% to 2% grains per minute in about half an hour. Came
sugar was more powerful than milk-sugar, and still more so than
grape-sugar.     Acids increased the maximum influence of sugar.
    Milk increased both the pulsation and the carbonic acid, and the
latter to a maximum of nearly 2 grains per minute.           All the com
ponent elements except lactic acid had a similar influence, but new
milk was much more powerful than any of                              its

                                                elements. The effect                                 of
milk differed        in
                    degree, and         of

   Gluten, caseine, gelatine, albumen, and fibrine increased the amount
of carbonic acid exhaled, the two former to about 1 grain per minute,
and the last to about # grain per minute.         Almond-emulsion did
not increase it.
   From these facts the author infers that there is a class of foods
which might be called “excito-respiratory;” a class which embraces
nearly    allnitrogenous foods, and      almost entirely composed
                                                   is                    these                     of
substances.
   The non-excitants are starch, fat, some alcohols, and coffee-leaves.
   The respiratory excitants are sugar, milk, the cereals, potato, tea,
coffee, chichory, cocoa, alcohol, rum, ales, some wines, gluten, caseine,
   latin, fibrin, and albumen.
   Of the hydrocarbons, sugar acted very differently from starch and
fat.
   All the “respiratory excitants” increased the depth, but not the
rate  of  respiration.
    Some      ofthem acted with great rapidity; as, for example, sugar
and   tea,  which sometimes caused           increase   an grain     carbonic of
                                                                               1              of

and    caseine,  acted with less   rapidity.       many,         In

produced much greater effect when               small dose was

duration      ofthe increase was very different with different foods, but
that with sugar was the least, and then that with tea, while that
with the cereals and rum and milk was the greatest. The amount

12, 1859.
   Since the death of our late excellent and lamented friend Mr.
Robert Brown, several appeals have been made            his executors              to                      to
publish certain evidence presumed         have been       to

or Watt     the discovery    the composition
                                         of       water. As the execu    of
tor  to whom Mr. Brown entrusted his papers, and having been for
many years honoured with his entire confidence,         feel called upon       I
to respond         to
               these  appeals, and     therefore  request
                                                    I       that you will
kindly lay before Meeting a      the Royal    of
                                             Society the  following   brief
statement       on
              the subject.
   The date and nature               of
                             Cavendish's communication           Priestley                to

142                                             Royal Society:-
have always been considered as essential elements in the determina
tion of the question; and it was the evidence which Mr. Brown
possessed in regard to these particulars, which, in his estimation,
 “placed Cavendish's claims as the discoverer of the composition of
water beyond dispute.”           That evidence, however, was not derived
from   any  unpublished       document,     but formed part of a section of
Deluc's “Idées sur la Météorologie,” which although especially
entitled,—“Anecdotes relatives à la découverte de l'Eau sous la
forme d’Air,”—appears entirely to have escaped the notice of those
who have advocated Cavendish's claims.              It is the more conclusive
as coming from Deluc, the “ami zélé,” as he justly terms himself,
of Watt, and who, in relation to this question, believed himself “a
                                                        as les

 claiming priority for himself.   The following extract from a Report

 28th   August   1790,  and signed Lavoisier, Brisson, Meusnier, and
 Laplace, the last named being the reporter, will prove that Lavoisier
 was not unmindful of the appeal which had been addressed to him
 by Blagden some years previously, and that he distinctly resigned
 the priority of discovery to Cavendish :—

 observation, qu'il se contenta de présenter, sans entirer aucune con
 séquence. M. Cavendish paroit avoir remarqué le premier que l'eau

    “On   the Influence of White Light, of the different Coloured Rays
 and   of Darkness, on the Development, Growth, and Nutrition of
 Animals.”     By Horace Dobell, M.D.
    In this communication the author laid before the Society the par
ticulars of a series of experiments, having for their object to discover
what influence is exerted by ordinary light, by the different coloured
rays, and by darkness on the development, growth, and nutrition of
animals.
    After referring to the experiments of Edwards, Higginbottom,
E. Forbes, Morren, Wöhler, Hannon, Moleschott, and Béclard, the
results of which were shown to be somewhat contradictory, the
author described the precautions taken by himself to avoid sources
of fallacy.
   The original experiments detailed in this Paper were conducted in
the years 1855, 1856, 1857, 1858. The subjects selected were the
Ova and Larvae of the Silkworm (Bombya mori) and of the Frog (Rana
temporaria).     A comparative experiment in the vegetable kingdom
was also made on the Sweet Pea (Lathyrus odoratus).           An appa
ratus contrived for the experiments on Tadpoles was described and
figured; it secured the following desiderata:-
    1. That each of six compartments or cells should be supplied with
water from the same source, at the same time, subject to the same
changes, and capable of being refreshed without interfering with the
cells.
   2. That each of the cells should be placed in the same condition
with respect to the supply of air and of food.
   3. That during exposure for examination of the animals, the
whole series should be opened the same length of time and to the
Same extent.

144                                          Royal Society:—
     4. That  each cell should receive no light but that transmitted by
 itsproper cover.
   One       these six cells was open
                   of                      the air and    light; one was
                                                                 to                          to
covered with ordinary white glass; one was made completely dark
 by    covering
       a            blackened opaque glass; one was covered with blue,
                         of
one with greenish yellow, and one with red glass. The transmit
ting and absorbing powers          these glasses were detailed from expe
                                                  byof
riments made upon them             Mr. Cornelius Hanbury, jun., and by
the author.
   The apparatus used for the Silkworms was,                 essential par                in   all
ticulars, the same                as
                        that for the  Tadpoles,  only without water.
  A   tabulated analysis       the daily journal kept during the experi
                                        its of
ments was given, and          separate items compared and discussed                                                         ;
after which the author concluded his Paper with the following résumé.

    3. Those      processes          of   vegetable   life and of inorganic change
  upon which      the proper              condition     of the respiratory medium
    depends.
    Speaking generally then, it must be admitted that light is essential
 to the development, growth, and nutrition of animals, but only                     in
directly. In the foregoing experiments, the usual coincidents of
light, a proper supply of food, a due aération of the respiratory
 medium, a properly regulated external temperature, &c. having
been provided in each cell, the direct influence of light only being
changed, no corresponding change occurred in the animal life.
    In the vegetable kingdom the case is quite different, and the ex
periments on Lathyrus odoratus recorded in this paper demonstrate
again, what has been shown by numerous other experimenters, that
light as a direct agent is essential to the nutritive processes of
plants.    An interesting exception occurs, however, in the vegetable
kingdom, which serves to strengthen the probability that the con
clusions arrived at concerning animals are correct, viz. that fungi—
which derive their nutriment, like animals, from organic compounds
already prepared for them—perform their vital functions without
dependence on the influence of light.
    Under the head of colour, it would seem that the familiar phe
nomenon of etiolation witnessed in plants which have been deprived
of light, has led to erroneous anticipations as to the effect which
alterations of light would produce upon the development of the
colouring materials in animals.
   In the experiments here recorded, it is seen that meither white
light, nor the different coloured rays, nor darkness altered the de
velopment of those materials necessary to the exhibition of colour,
when the animal was seen in ordinary light. The experiments of
Dr. Gladstone, on plants, also show that the development of colouring
matter in the petals of flowers is independent of the influence of
light; that flowers raised under the different coloured rays and in
darkness have the same colour in their petals as when raised in or
dinary light.    Thus, even in vegetables, etiolation is confined to
those parts of the plant which depend for their colour upon the
condition of the chlorophyl, to the green appearance of which some
portion of the solar beam is evidently essential.
   Although, therefore, at first sight, the results of my experiments
under the head of colour may appear questionable,                   I
                                                           think we must
rather throw the question upon the correctness of our preconceived
notions on the subject; and the facts elicited by Prof. Edward
                                                                 of all

is no evidence to show that these colourless shells have developed
any materials capable of manifesting colour after exposure to the
 influence of light; whereas my own and other experiments show
 that the etiolated stalks and leaves of plants speedily manifest the
 characteristic colour of the chlorophyl if placed in the sun's rays.
     So far, therefore, as our present knowledge on the subject justi
 fies any conclusion, the varieties of colour and the absence of colour
 in the mollusks are physiologically separated from the phenomena of
 etiolation in plants, and may be placed in the same category as the
 varieties of colour and the absence of colour in the corollas of
flowers, which depend upon the development of materials having
certain optical properties.
    The beautiful facts observed by Prof. Forbes, instead of being
regarded as the consequence of imperfect exposure to light, must,                                   I
 think, take rank with the phenomena of coloration observed through
out the animal kingdom, such as the peculiar markings of reptiles,
birds, and wild animals, according to their different habitats and
modes of life; the colours of the upper and lower surfaces of fish,
and the like; which cannot be shown to depend upon the exposure
or non-exposure to light with which they frequently, but not always,
coincide.     These facts appear only to form a part of the vast and
perfect plan of creation, in which everything that exists is suited in
every particular to the conditions of                      its
                                            existence; thus, those mol
lusks which are designed          inhabit depths scarcely permeable
                                                                                                  to to

     eyen a   small amount of solid material be interposed between the
     water  employed  and the mouth of the hearing-tube.        A piece of
     wood, not much thicker than a paper-cutter, materially interferes
:    with the augmenting power of water.
        The augmentation of sound thus obtained by water seems to be
     due to the complete fitting of the liquid on the solid body and also
    round the mouth of the hearing-tube, whereby the column of                                                            air

limited solubility was deposited. This substance readily dissolved in
boiling water, from which it crystallized on cooling in long white
needles.     It was less soluble in alcohol, insoluble in ether.
   The analysis of this compound, carefully purified by repeated
crystallizations, led to the following atomic expression:—
                                               C.H.PI.
This formula       received ample confirmation by the examination of
a platinum- and gold-compound.          Converted into chloride and pre
cipitated by dichloride of platinum, the new body furnished a crystal
line, difficultly-soluble platinum-salt, differing from the platinum-salts
of     all

boiling concentrated hydrochloric acid without decomposition, and
crystallizes       on

   1. “Notes on Spitzbergen.”      By J. Lamont, Esq.
  Mr. Lamont cruised about Spitzbergen in his yacht in the summer
of 1858, and went up the Stour Fiord, which, he remarks, is a Sound
dividing the Island, not a gulf. The first thirty miles of coast along
which he sailed on this Fiord consisted almost entirely of the faces
of two or three enormous glaciers: the water is shallow, seldom as
much as sixteen fathoms, and such appears to be the case          around                             all
Spitzbergen; and hence icebergs         very large size are not formed.

The shores are mostly formed        muddy flat, from half mile
                                                 of   a             three                     a          to

                                    which the reindeer fattens.      Pro
truding trap-rocks appear        many spots     at these flats.     steep     on                         A
slope     mud, snow, and debris succeeds the flats, and reaches
             of                                                                                                 up   to
perpendicular crags      schistose rock, above which extend the great
                                     of
glaciers. Above these, peaks, probably        granite, appear when free  of
of  mist.
   The upper part      the Sound has much drift-wood, chiefly small
                                 of
pine-trees, weather-worn and water-logged, and some wreck-wood.
Bones and skeletons of whales are numerous.             Drift-wood and
bones      whales were observed several miles inland and high above
             of
high-water mark—at least 30 feet. Whales’ skeletons were also
 seen high
                   up    on
                  the Thousand Islands.      These circumstances, con
nected with the fact that seal-fishers and whalers state their belief
in the shallowing               of
                    these seas, lead the author  think that                         to                     Spitz

even more rapid than that                       at   which some parts              of   Norway       have been
shown    be rising.

        In
      the first place, the author referred     his views, already given   to
 inthe Society's Journal,      the great outpouring
                                            of           basalt   India                      of            in

 flatness of the tops of trap-hills being the effect of well known laws,
 to which lava, like every other liquid body, is subject. While the
 deposit now covered up by trap was being formed in a lake or lakes
 in Western and Central India, there was, he remarked, a contem
 poraneous formation, similarly overlain, going on in an estuary or
 sea towards the south-east, about the mouths of the Godavery. The
 amygdaloid, which is generally found underlying the sedimentary
 rock, he believes to have been liquid at a period subsequent not only
 to the deposition of that rock, but also to the consolidation of the
 upper trap, both of these having apparently been broken up by it:
 still he thinks it probable that the lava in both positions belonged
 to the same eruption, the upper portion of it having cooled first.
    The author formerly held that the arenaceous strata which have
 been described by some as the “ diamond-sandstone” were of nearly
 the same age as the fern-beds of Silewádá, &c., the carbonaceous
shales of Umret and Damuda, and the argillaceous sandstone, with
Brachyops, of Mángali; but he now considers that they must be
 classed with the intertrappean deposit mentioned above, which they
underlie.     They contain abundance of wood, chiefly silicified, and a
few Paludinae.     This tertiary sandstone is metamorphosed into gneiss
by the intrusion, apparently, of some deep-seated plutonic rock, evi
denced by veins of pegmatite.
    Some minerals from the trap, gneiss, &c. were then enumerated,
especially the “Hunterite” and “Hislopite” lately discovered by
Prof. Haughton.
    The Fossils were next alluded to : namely, Fish-remains—some
like the Sphyraenodus of the London Clay; also Reptilian remains,
and bones of Pachyderms.         The Shells, both freshwater (from the
neighbourhood of Nagpur) and marine (from Rájámandri, near the
mouth of the Godavery), were described by the author in detail.
 Cyprides are numerous; two species have been named by Mr. Sower
by, and some new forms will be described by Mr. Jones.            Plant
remains are abundant, but have not been yet described. Many remains
of Insects occur; and, as far as Mr. Andrew Murray can form an
opinion on them, they differ from recent species.
    The author, after comparing the fossil shells of Nagpur with those
of the Nummulitic fauna described by Wiscount D’Archiac, and with
the recent fauna of India, offered the conclusion that they are pro
bably of Lower Eocene date. The nearest European analogue is
found in the Physa-bed (Physa gigantea) at Rilly, in France,
    These Tertiary deposits, with their pachydermatous remains, are
decidedly (in the author's opinion) older than those of the Sewalik
Hills, so well known from Cautley and Falconer's researches. There
are yet newer deposits with huge fossil bones (probably of Upper
Pliocene age) on the banks of the Nerbudda and elsewhere.
    Lastly, the author inferred that the upper or diamond-sandstone
must be of Lower Eocene age, like the intertrappean deposit with
which it is associated, and consequently that plutonic and meta      -
morphic action must have taken place since that era.

                                                  BY H. HAHN.
   T      is    long since discovered by Mitscherlich, that crystalline
               a law
   bodies  expand   equally in the direction of their similar axes, but un
equally in the direction of their dissimilar axes. According to this
law, only those bodies that belong to the regular system expand
equally in            all
                 directions, while those that belong          the quadratic                   to
and  hexagonal    systems   present two  axes,  and those  belonging      the                                 to
other systems three axes        unequal expansion.

   Calc-spar (hexagonal system).-According                Mitscherlich, the              to
terminal dihedral angle         the primary rhomboid becomes
                                                of                      34"-5                                8'

of calc-spar for 1°, from 0 to 100° (between which limits it expands
uniformly), to be 0.000018.                 From 17°5 to 100° it expands there
fore 82°5 x 0.000018-0-001485, whence we have
               a ×  3-00479-0-001485 and ac-0-0004942.
                     Axis       a expands     by      0-0004942,

   We arrive at these last values also              if we  indicate the expansion of
axis a for 1% by a ; we then have
                       a   x 3-0121792=0.000018,              &c.
   Bitter-spar (muricalcite) (hexagonal system).-The terminal di
hedral angle of the principal rhomboid at the temperature 17°5 is
 106° 15'; at 100° it becomes 4' 6" more acute, and measures there
fore 106° 10' 54".          In the first case the ratio of the axes is as
follows:–
                         a:     c-1     2016 :   1 = 1 : 0-8322;

                         a   :  C-1’    1993 :   1 =  1 : 0°8338.
Axis   c therefore expands 1-00192 as much as a ; or for 19, 0-012144
times as much.        If the cubical expansion of bitter-spar be known,
the absolute expansions of a and c can be calculated as in the former
CaSe.
   Arragonite (rhombic system).-At                    17°5 the acute angle of the
prism   oo P(axis   b)=63°48'14";              the polar  dihedral angle of the prism
Poo-     108°27'. At 100° the first of these angles becomes 63°44'32";
the  second,    108° 21' 31". Axes b and c have therefore expanded
more in    proportion     than axis a. The two temperatures in question
give the following proportions between the axes:—
                 179.5.                                          100°.

          =0°62249 : 1         :  0-72056                  =0.62175    : 1 :  0-72177
          = 0-86389      :   1-38780 : 1                   =0-86142    : 1-38547:    1
   Axis b therefore expands 1-001201 as much as a ; axis c 1: 19027
as much ; and the latter 1:00167 as much as b. For 19, b 0-0121357
times, and c 0:01.44275 times as much as a, c expanding 0-0121414.
times as much as b.              Kopp found the cubical expansion of Arra
gonite for 1° to be 0:000065.                The expansion in the direction of a
for 1° being called z, we have
                         a ×     3.0265632=0.000065,

produce        an increase of intensity in others; and from the contrast of
these different degrees of brilliancy, and on account of an effect of
clair-obscur, an enormously exaggerated manifestation of the inequal
ities which really exist on the surface submitted to this sort of test
will result.
    As the observation can only be made by means of a single eye, it
happens that, under a mental influence independent of the will of the
observer, the valleys and hills seem to overlie each other; but with a
little attention, what is a mere illusion will soon be distinguished
from reality by considering that the true rising parts are neces
sarily contained between two opposite declivities, one of which being
turned towards the screen, which hides the image, appears dark,
whilst the other presents an increase of brilliancy.       In other words,
the true figure of the mirror is analogous to that which would corre
spond to the apparent relievo interpreted on that hypothesis, in which
an oblique light would come from the side opposite to the screen.
    This process offers particularly the advantage of being at the same
time expeditious and direct; that is to say, a surface can be judged
of in a few seconds, and when it is defective, the faults of it are
known immediately with great precision.                        -

ON   THE ORGANIC SUBSTANCE IN THE METEORIC STONE                                                OF    KABA.

   The following note on the organic matter contained in the
meteoric stone of Kaba was communicated by Haidinger to the
Academy of Sciences at Vienna.
    Experiments made with about 10 grims. of powder and small frag
ments of the meteoric stone of Kaba, have shown that this meteorite,
            to its

described,   plates could be introduced into the middle of the
bottom of this vessel, containing orifices of various diameters.
The streams issuing from these holes fell into a vessel placed
upon a soft support and quite separate from the above-mentioned
stand, in order that the motions in the receiving vessel might be
as little as possible communicated to the floor and thence to the
first vessel. Again, in order to reduce these motions to a mini
mum, and to avoid the noise occasioned by the falling water, a
board was so placed in the receiving vessel as to make a small
angle with the vertical, as is described in § 42. The                                                   jet   of

   120. Even with a perfectly regular flow, it is difficult to esta
blish a quite steady stream; for if the water flows out under a
pressure of about 20 centimetres, it is impossible to ensure the
perfect constancy of the jet, even when the “tranquillizer” is
used. With a smaller pressure, the jet, it is true, appears
perfectly smooth; but the smallest motion—that, for instance,
occasioned by the passage of a carriage in a distant street—is
sufficient to displace the image of an object seen by the reflexion
from the jet.
                   The formation of the swellings.
   121. No swellings, however, are occasioned by such shakings.
In order that these may be formed, the vessel from which the
water flows must receive regularly and quickly recurring motions.
The fittest means for this purpose is furnished by the sounding
of a note, Indeed for the production of regular swellings,
scarcely any other means is applicable. For, as already remarked,
for this effect to be produced, regular and quickly succeeding
motions are necessary; and such always produce the impression
of a tone. The effect of such regular vibrations is to cause
swellings of about the form shown in fig. 3. The first swelling
always lies much nearer to the orifice than does the point where
the jet without swellings commences to become turbid.
   122. As is well known, the jet itself occasions a tone,
partly because             its
                     single separate masses      water set the air,of
through which they fall,      motion, but especially
                                          in                the impact        by
 ofthese masses upon some solid          liquid.    Hence swellings
                                                         or

Very high notes alone seemed incapable of causing swellings;
at least by very high notes I was unable to form them in a jet of

great that swellings were not produced by any but the original

the  jet,  and   which,  being  held     the  hand,  cannot commu
nicate their motion otherwise than through the air, does not
prove that the changes are effected directly through the air. For
 we  must not forget that when the peculiar note            the jet                    of                is
heard, the vessel from which the water flows invariably gives
forth  a  note    well. Hence the peculiar note
                       as                               the jet    de             of               is

 the vibrations can only be communicated to the plate through
the water, and then no swellings are produced. At first I em
ployed a tube of vulcanized caoutchouc.       But in this case swell
ings were formed even when no solid body existed between the
plate and the bottom; and these swellings were not much                                 in
creased in strength when a piece of wood was introduced.           The
commercial vulcanized tubes of 3 centimetres in diameter are,
however, rather stoutly made, and hence it happened that the
vibrations of the bottom were communicated through the caout
chouc to the plate cd.      On employing a tube of very thin non
vulcanized caoutchouc, no such communication took place.
    135. Hence there appears to exist no doubt that the swellings
are produced by vibrations in the bottom plate.            Inasmuch,
however, as this plate cannot vibrate without setting the mass
of water in the vessel in similar vibrations, and as, inversely,
the vibrations of the water set the bottom plate or the edge of
the egress-orifice in vibration, it follows that both exercise their
influence upon the formation of swellings.       But it follows from
the  experiments   described in the   preceding  paragraph,   that the
vibrations of the bottom plate, or of the edge of the egress-orifice,
are the immediate cause of the swellings.

        If
      only one spoked wheel be employed, in conjunction with a
disc placed behind it and provided with circular holes, when the
disc and the wheel revolve in opposite directions, the holes no
longer appear round, but oblong; and by using different discs, it
is easy to convince oneself that the outlines always appear of a
different form to what they are in reality.
   150. The anorthoscope described by M. Plateau, as well as
the other very ingenious contrivances which this physicist has
given for similar metamorphoses, depend, as is well known, upon
this alteration in the outline.
   151. In order to make such alterations in outline visible, I
have had an apparatus constructed by means of which two discs
of the most different kind may easily be made to revolve in the
same or opposite directions with the most variable velocities.
The discs are made of thin pasteboard; so that any number of
them, very various in respect to the shape and number of their
orifices, may be easily procured.         If such discs be covered with
a solution of shell-lac, they do not absorb moisture from the air,
                                                                                          its

and are very durable.        Each disc has          own axis; but both
in  the same horizontal line.         Each axis receives         motion                                              its
means            cordof passing
                          a      over       roller.    The two rollers are

thin rods.     From these thin masses of water, as they separate,
small drops appear with great regularity between each two of
the greater ones.     These small drops are not to be confounded
with the much smaller ones which move laterally, and which
have been mentioned in the previous paragraph and in § 118.
Such laterally-moving drops, it is true, are sometimes produced
when the stream has swellings, but only when the note which
causes them is impure, or when two inharmonious notes are
sounded at the same time. These small drops, which regularly
occur between two of the larger drops, and which fall vertically,
give the appearance of a hollow cylinder placed in the middle of
the swelling, as Savart has already mentioned.               They are so
small that a change in their form cannot be recognized even by
means of the rotating slit.       On the other hand, as Savart has
also  mentioned,   the  larger  drops   appear in some places broader
than they are long, in others longer than they are broad.         At the
middle, where a swelling occurs, a spheroid is formed whose ver
tical axis is smaller than                         its
                                  horizontal one. On the contrary,
    the point midway between two swellings they appear elongated,
so at

flow from above downwards. All others, whether moving verti
cally from below upwards, or at any inclination to the horizon,
behave quite similarly.       All jets which issue from a perfectly
circular opening are smooth and continuous close to the open

greater diameter, separating at the same time into distinct drops.
On examining the turbid portion by means of the rotating slit,
the formation of the drops is seen to take place in a manner
quite similar to that described in § 156, of streams flowing from
above downwards, which are represented in fig. 11.        The dimen
sions alone are somewhat different; that         the distances    the       is,                              of

 weak, are sufficient to give different directions to the drops at
 the moment of their separation; so that they do not             follow                                        all

which flows out of an angular opening from above downwards
during the existence of a note, we see that the higher portion,
which shows with great regularity the singular forms described in
the previous part of these investigations (§§ 44, 45, 61,64), con
sists of a continuous mass of water, and that where the regularity
is less, rounded masses are formed in the stream. At the com
mencement of their formation these masses appear to be com
posed of several spheres or drops, formed at the edges ir, i, r, of
the surfaces described in § 45, where these surfaces, even to the
naked eye, no longer appear smooth and continuous. These
spheres gradually unite to a single drop, which still at first
shows traces of           its
                     derivation, but continually assumes more and
more the spherical form.           fig. 24 the attempt

 exception to what has just been stated, as it has been found in
 the horns of the Irish elk, and even in human bones.
     Stalagmitic-like concretions and nodular masses of phosphates
 appear to be immediately derived from organic bodies, and may
 have been formed by the double decomposition of phosphate of
 lime, held in solution in water, by carbonic acid and salts of
 metallic oxides, or by the reverse action of soluble salts of me
 tallic oxides upon earthy phosphates.
     One of the most interesting mineral phosphates is the blue
 protophosphate of iron, which, when crystallized, is called Vivian
 ite,_the earthy varieties being known as blue iron earth, Angla
 rite, &c. This phosphate is found either crystallized or amor
  phous in all formations, from the oldest to the most recent; and
  there is no doubt that it can be formed in a very brief space of
  time, as the observations of Schlossberger show that the blue
  matter sometimes found in the pus of ulcers has the composition
  of Vivianite, the iron being derived from the disorganized blood
  corpuscles.
     Considerable doubt exists as to the true constitution of Wi
  vianite.    Rammelsberg assigned to a specimen analysed by him
  the formula
      4(3Fe0, PO)4-2(3Fe0, PO)4-3Fe2O3, 2PO3 + 16HO,
  Or
           6(3Fe0, PO3 +8HO)+3Fe2O3, 2PO*48HO.
     The observations   of Barreswil upon Abich's salt,
                 3(FeO, SO3)2(Fe2O3, 3SO") +4HO,
 which he obtained of an indigo-blue colour, appears to lend sup
 port to the view that Vivianite contains sesquioxide of iron. On
 treating the blue sulphate with phosphate of soda, he obtained
 a blue salt which was not decomposed by water.        Rammelsberg
 assigned to this artificial phosphate the formula
                2(3Fe0, PO)+3 Fe2O3, 2PO3 + 16HO.
    The ordinary basic phosphate of protoxide of iron, obtained
by adding a solution of basic phosphate of soda, 3NaO, PO",
drop by drop, to a solution of a protoxide salt, and which has the
composition 3 FeO, PO", is white when first thrown down, but
gradually becomes blue on the filter.         If the blue colour be
owing to oxidation, it must take place very rapidly, and only a
very small portion of sesquioxide must be necessary to produce
the blue colour; for this is found to have penetrated the whole
mass on the filter, even before   it is wholly washed.
    This is further shown by dissolving       a portion of the blue
earthy phosphate     in weak hydrochloric acid, and adding sesqui

 result seemed        to favour the conclusion that the                                  aether vibrated
in the plane of polarization.  But though it is true that the ex
periments of Holtzmann thus indicated a twisting of the plane
of polarization in the opposite direction to that which Stokes,
according to his hypothesis, had anticipated, yet on the other
hand it must be observed that this twisting was, on the average,
actually twice as great as it ought to have been according to the
observer’s own calculations; so that it was at    events very bold               all

Stokes that the aether vibrations are perpendicular    the plane                            to

variable conditions exert upon the relative proportion of the dif
ferent fats composing butter. The milk just drawn from the
cow was introduced into clean well-stoppered glass bottles, and
stoppered in such a way as to leave no        between the stoppers    air

observed to form upon the sides      of the bottle, consisted of the
solid acids of the series C"H"O" in a crystallized state. This
fact is interesting in connexion with the chemical changes which
the substance known as bog butter must have undergone in time,
as   Ishall show in a future paper.
   A portion of the filtered acid solution was distilled in a retort;
a faintly acid liquor came over, smelling strongly of butter. When
neutralized with baryta, and the solution evaporated and set
aside over sulphuric acid, crystals were obtained which had the
characters of baryta salts formed with the volatile acids of butter.
   When a portion of the filtered acid liquor was treated with
moist freshly prepared oxide of zinc, so as to neutralize a consi
derable portion of the free lactic acid, and then heated, it coagu
lated exactly like a solution of albumen.        A portion of the acid
liquor, without the addition of oxide of zinc, on being evaporated,
did not appear to produce in a very distinct manner the pellicle
so characteristic of a solution of caseine.      Bichromate of potash,
iodate of potash, and ferrocyanide of potassium gave the usual
precipitates in the acid solution, which may be obtained either
with albumen or caseine.
   A portion of the acid solution, on being mixed with a solution
of chloride of ammonium, coagulated on being heated. A similar
result was obtained with common salt, chloride of potassium,
sulphate of soda, sulphate of potash, and nitrate of potash.         The
larger the quantity and the stronger the solution of the alkaline
salt, the lower was the temperature at which the coagulation
took place. The precipitates formed at very low temperatures
were soluble in pure water; but the solutions were not coagu
lated by heat, though precipitable by ferrocyanide of potassium.
When recently thrown down and rapidly filtered, they dissolved
in acetic acid. Strong alcohol also gave a precipitate in the ori
ginal solution.
 . The distinctive tests for albumen are coagulation by heat, and
when a free acid is present, coagulation on the addition of a salt
with an alkaline base, the temperature of coagulation being
less as the proportion of salt increases.          So far, therefore, as
these tests can be relied   upon,   it would  appear   that the caseine
of the milk was converted into albumen in the presence of the
lactic acid formed from milk sugar, in the absence of air.               If
this was a simple metamorphosis, it would support the view that
caseine was merely an albuminate of soda,             so strongly held,
among others, by M. Gerhardt.          It    is,
                                               however, very probable
that the change   is not so  simple as  this would make it: for how,
in  this case, was the lactic acid formed    :    portion

                                                             the caseine
 must have first been modified into      a lactic ferment, and the re
 mainder converted into albumen, according           the lactic acid was
                                                       as

Mr.   W. K. Sullivan on the nature of Lactic Fermentation.                                                 205
formed.        A
               very small portion of the caseine would be sufficient
to perform the function of ferment, so that the great mass might
have been changed into albumen.
   With a view to ascertain whether the relative quantity of albu
men was in accordance with this view of the case, and also
whether there remained any dissolved caseine not converted into
albumen,         I
               added, as Lehmann recommends, a strong solution of
chloride of ammonium to the acid solution, and boiled it for some
minutes, so as to wholly coagulate the albumen; the boiled liquor
was filtered, and a solution of sulphate of magnesia added, and
again boiled: no precipitate was formed.          It is usually considered
that  if,   in
             such     case, caseine
                               a          present,      be

attributed           to

                    exposure       the air, the liquor becoming

that   caseine,           as
                          extracted from

two different bodies.           Schlossbergert digested well-washed
caseine with dilute hydrochloric acid, and obtained                 solution                      a
which,         on
               neutralization with carbonate            ammonia, gave       of                               a
 white slimy body, which filtered with difficulty, while another
 body remained dissolved and was precipitated                  hydrochloric             by
 acid  in  excess.    Schlossberger found that the first body con
 tained sulphur, and the second not.           But, even after the sepa
 ration     of
             the second    body,   another substance appeared           have                          to
 been left behind.        Gerhardt did not think the experiments                                             of
 Schlossberger and others conclusive: undoubtedly                 may with                   it

could only be thrown down by boiling the hydrochloric acid
solution.                        -
   At present there is no satisfactory mode of accounting for the
formation of caseine in the mammary glands. According to the
observations of Lassaigne, made a considerable time ago*, the
milk is alkaline, and highly charged with albumen forty days
before calving, and only ten days before that period does the
sugar of milk appear.       Some writers also state that albumen
sometimes exists in milk during inflammation of the mammary
glands. Among others, Moleschott found it in cow's milk. It
may, however, be observed that Scherer prepared from normal
milk a caseine coagulable by heat, and that where coagulation
alone is depended upon, erroneous results may be obtained.
Lehmann has drawn attention to this source of doubt; but, on
the other hand, may it not be equally well asserted that the
coagulable caseine of Scherer was no longer true caseine, but
albumen? A phaenomenon the reverse of this has, indeed, been
observed in the case of the albumen of serum by Hofmann.
When serum is digested at the temperature of 31° to 44° with
a piece of rennet, the liquor becomes troubled in the course of
about twenty-four hours, and little by little it becomes filled with
a flocculent precipitate.    The filtered liquor is perfectly neutral,
and does not coagulate by boiling, but forms a pellicle on evapo
ration exactly like caseine.
    An explanation of the phaenomena of the change of albumen
into caseine in the animal body, and the reabsorption of the
caseine into the blood, would be of great interest; much light
 may be thrown upon these questions by a complete series of ob
 servations carried out from the same point of view as those of
Lassaigne, above alluded               to.
   In   describing the changes which the caseine           the milk un    of
 derwent  as   aconversion into albumen,       have naturally assumed

Mr.       W. K.       Sullivan on the nature                 of Lactic      Fermentation.                207
which the milk underwent in the course of three or four years is
not the less interesting in several points of view, and especially
as throwing considerable light upon the function of digestion.
   The production of lactic acid from lactine, during this pecu
liar metamorphosis of caseine in the absence of air, is perhaps a
still more important phaenomenon than that metamorphosis itself,
inasmuch as it derives peculiar interest from the recent revival of
the   much-debated question of the nature of fermentation.
    Of the many hypotheses which have been proposed since the
time of Stahl, two have especially divided the suffrages of che
mists.    According to one, first proposed by Berzelius, vinous
fermentation is produced by the kind of action which he de
scribed as catalytic, and which he supposed to be the result of a
peculiar force exerted by simple as well as compound bodies,
whether in the solid or liquid condition, upon other substances
with which they come in contact.           The consequence of this
 action        is,

208          Mr. W. K. Sullivan          on the nature                of Lactic Fermentation.
   According to the second view, fermentation is a vegetative
process, consisting in the growth of a plant at the expense of
the fermenting bodies. This view, which appears to have been
first suggested by Erxleben, was adopted by Cagniard de la Tour,
 Schwann, Kützing, Quevenne, Dumas, Mitscherlich, and Mulder.
     There is this much in favour of the vegetative theory, that
yeast is undoubtedly the mycelium of a fungus or mould (a Peni
cillium) in an abnormal condition.        It consists of globules or
free  floating  cells, without a trace of rootlets, which are capable
of almost endless propagation, and which, from their submerged
position, are forced into a peculiar habit of development without
ever producing perfect fruit.
    Several observers, among others Hofmann and Berkeley, have
followed up the development of individual yeast-globules in fluid
surrounded in a closed cell with a ring of air, and have obtained
the true fruit proper to a Penicillium, and to one too which has
been more than once observed to grow on fermenting matter.
    It is also known that other species of mucor promote vinous
fermentation as well as the true yeast plant: a case is recorded of
the kind where a peculiar myceloid state of Mucor clavatus was
developed in raisin wine, the latter being, nevertheless, of pecu
liar excellence+.
   But while there can now be no doubt that yeast is the myce
lium of a fungus, there is still much room for difference of opi
nion as to whether the plant be the primum movens of the
decomposition of the sugar, or only ancillary to                                   it.
   Pasteur has recently instituted    series   ingenious experi

the whole of their nitrogen from ammonia.                 There is nothing

in oxidizing the caseine? Then, again, no trace of yeast-globules
could be found in the milk when the bottle was opened; but
after a few days mould and abundance of infusoria were developed
in the liquid, partially neutralized by zinc.
   The growth of moulds, as for example the beautiful Penicillium
glaucum,    from milk-globules has been long noticed. Indeed
Dutrochet states that he observed milk-globules changed into
the spores of mould, or at any rate developed into moulds.                   But

Mr. W. K. Sullivan                   on the nature             of Lactic Fermentation.                    211
instance of this may be mentioned the fact that the yeast plant
is continually taken into the stomach, and yet fermentation does
not ensue, except where the stomach is diseased, and then the
yeast plant grows rapidly, as has been discovered by an examina
tion of the matter rejected from the stomach.     The yeast plant
has even been      found under those circumstances where the patient
has not      partaken    of fermented drinks. The fungus found in
urine during acid fermentation, and which so closely resembles
the yeast plant, has always been observed after the urine has
been some time voided.           There is no proof whatever that it ever
germinated within the bladder during life.          On the other hand,
parasitic fungi are often found on putrid ulcers, but only on
the uninjured skin or mucous membrane when it has become
 previously covered with a layer of exudated matter which has
begun to pass into a state of decomposition.             The growth of
fungi, once established, may no doubt spread to healthy parts, as
in certain skin diseases, and in bread mould, but it could never
 commence upon a perfectly healthy clean spot.                         -
  I     have lately had occasion to observe how completely the
 germination of the spores of fungi depend upon the existence of
 certain conditions.                 I
                               laid aside some small beaker glasses
 covered    tightly  with  filtering paper, and containing very strong
 solutions of     salts,  consisting   of sulphates of potash and of
 chrome.       The solution in one of the glasses had been treated
 with excess of ammonia, and boiled for some time, and then
  filtered to separate the small portion of the sesquioxide of
  chrome which had been precipitated.           After a few weeks, the
  solution to which the ammonia had been added became filled
   with an extremely beautiful rose-pink-coloured mycelium of a
   Penicillium.    Nothing grew in the others; but on adding some
   ammonia, the same mycelium was developed after some time.
      The supposition that the primum movens of fermentation is
  the        growth   of
                     specific ferments, appears         me              far   to          to   be   so
 premature,    that while there may                        be    no
                                               doubt that the vegetable
 form developed during alcoholic fermentation could not produce
   thelactic, and vice versa,        has not yet been established that

212        Mr. W. K. Sullivan                  on the nature      of Lactic Fermentation.
   The mycelia of most fungi are so exceedingly alike in the
early stages of their development, that the free cells, beaded
threads, and ramuli composing ferments, crusts in skin diseases
(Porrigo, Favus, &c.), putrid matter, &c. may            specifically        all      be

       October, 1838, at 9 A.M., in the Bokkeveld, about seventy
miles from Capetown, accompanied by the most fearful and
widely-heard thunder-clap, present in their peculiar external
condition the greatest resemblance to the stone that fell at
Kaba in Hungary, on April 15th, 1857, the analysis of which
the author has lately communicated.      They are, like the latter,
almost black, and consist of a soft incoherent mass in which only
a few bright points can be discerned, and none of the little no
dules which the Kaba stone contained in such abundance.        The
Cape stone was analysed by Faraday as early as 1839; but no
explanation was then given of      peculiar colour. its
                                                                                                       in of be to

in oxygen it burnt at once to a light brown, with evolution
of carbonic acid gas, the quantity of which was measured, and
by that means the per-centage of carbon determined. The pre
caution was taken of separating the sulphurous acid, which was
formed at the same time, from the carbonic acid by passing the
gaseous product through a long tube filled with peroxide of lead,
and thence through baryta water and solid moist hydrate of pot
ash, both weighed. As soon as the oxygen, which was absolutely
pure, came into contact with the pulverized stone at a low red
heat, the formation of carbonic acid evinced itself by causing a
dense precipitate in the baryta water.    In this manner it ap
peared that the stone contained 1.67 per cent. of carbon, without
reckoning that in the above-mentioned hydrocarbon which had
been previously dissolved out by means of alcohol.

we get  l'3 per cent. nickel, 3:14 sulphur, and 2.50 iron, for 694
 of the compound, the small difference between the amount of
 sulphur thus calculated and that actually found being explicable
on the ground of the presence of a small quantity of a sulphate
of some kind.     Hot water, indeed, actually extracts some sul
phate of magnesia; and the solution obtained by means of mu
riatic acid gave indications of the presence of sulphuric acid.
   Mr. Harris made three analyses of the stone—the first with
carbonate of soda and potash, the second with hydrofluoric, and
third with nitromuriatic acid—from which it appeared that the
stone contained 5:46 of silicate insoluble in the latter acid.
These analyses gave the following bodies as component parts
of the stone.   (The composition of the Kaba stone is subjoined,
in order to show the great similarity between the two.)

     The amount of metallic iron present could not be directly
ascertained, but was calculated on the foregoing hypothesis.
The total  quantity  of oxide of iron which analysis detected
answered to 33-15   per cent. protoxide, from which 3:21 per cent.
was deducted, and in                      its
                            place metallic iron calculated     the                                                 to

                                               of                                                    a

also, the mineral decomposed by the acid was a silicate                                   of mag
nesia and oxide of iron of the composition of olivine,
                           3(Fe0. MgO)SiO3.
    Of the silicate not decomposed by the nitromuriatic acid,
which only amounted to 5:46 per cent., an analysis was indeed
made; but the quantity available for the purpose was too small
to give a reliable result. It is very probable, moreover, that the
silicate itself had been partly decomposed by the action of the
acid. It can only, therefore, be stated that this silicate contains
as bases, alumina, magnesia, lime, protoxide of manganese, prot
oxide of iron, potash, and soda.      Its silicic acid amounted to
about 44   per  cent.

it took place in our atmosphere ! such an origin is scarcely con
ceivable.” (Phil. Mag. S. 3. vol. xiv. p. 231.) According to Mr.
Thompson, the noise of the fall was fearful, louder and more pow
erful than the heaviest artillery; the air was shaken for more than
eighty miles in every direction. Several persons at Worcester felt
a sensation at the knees as though of an electric shock; and even
there, at the distance of forty miles, the noise was compared to
the rolling of rocks down a mountain. From the place of obser
vation on the borders of the Great Karroo, where Mr. Thompson
happened to be in company with Mr. Justice Menzies, something
similar to a Congreve rocket was seen to approach from the west,
and, when almost over the heads of the observers, to burst into
drops of fire,       or,   as
                            it seemed,      transparent glass.

  Three entire stones (among the rest, that sent                Mr. Thompsonby
 toMr.Charlesworth)and several fragments were sent    the British                      to
 Museum.    Sir John Herschel received stone       the weight    a             of                      of
 7lbs. from M. Truter  Capetown. The late M. Partsch,

 in addition to the former piece, could only procure from Von
  Struve about #3 oz. weight, consisting of a large fragment and
 three small chips; and it was only in 1845 that he succeeded
 in purchasing, of Dr. Ferdinand Krauss of Stuttgart, a larger,
 nearly complete stone, with external crust and weighing about
 1247; oz., which the latter gentleman         had brought from the
 Cape; and it was Sir J. Herschel himself who in the year 1847
 made the Royal Mineralogical Cabinet the valuable present of
 a fragment of the stone with fresh surfaces and external crust,
 weighing 6 oz., as well as two smaller pieces which together
 weighed # of an ounce.      One of the first pieces received from
 Von Struve, Director Hörnes gave M. Wöhler for analysis.
    So few pieces of the Cape meteorite have, in truth, come within
 reach of a chemical examination         like the latest of Wöhler’s
 (prompted by the fact of the discovery in meteorites of a bitumi
 mous substance formed according to the laws of organic matter),
that, after the facts here communicated, we need not despair of
obtaining somewhat larger quantities of the material in question,
so as to make the new substance itself the subject of further     in
vestigation.

Dr. Thomson remarking at the bottom of the page that the spe
cimen analysed by himself consisted of fine crystals carefully
selected, while that examined by Mr. Connell was a mixture of
amorphous and crystallized mineral.
   The method for the separation of baryta, strontia, and lime,
employed by Connell—probably by both analysts—namely, the
solution of nitrate of lime, and afterwards of chloride of stron
tium, in alcohol—has given place to more reliable processes; and
on this account a repetition of the analysis might be desirable;
but it becomes still more so when the close analogy of Brew
sterite to Heulandite is considered.       The two species should in
all probability have the same general formula, and this has                                    in
fact been assigned         to
                           them      Dana’s “Mineralogy;' but with
                                           in
the formula for Heulandite these older analyses            Brewsterite              of
do  not very well agree.
I     have recently analysed some fine specimens from the original
locality (Strontian         Argyleshire, Scotland); and the results
                           in
appear fully      to
                  establish the chemical      well    crystallographic
                                                               as             as
relationship with Heulandite.
   The mineral formed crusts         minute crystals upon the surface
                                           of

      of by
rock      careful blows, but       general they adhered very firmly.

The specific gravity was found =2:453.
   For analysis, the crystals were carefuly broken off and picked
clean from any dust      the accompanying rock.

fect decomposition, and consequent purity of the silicic acid
weighed; the other specimens were treated directly with hydro
chloric acid, which seems of itself to be capable of effecting com
plete decomposition.               The baryta was precipitated by hydro
fluosilicic     acid*;      and the relative amounts of lime and strontia
were determined indirectly, by weighing the mixed earths first as
sulphates and then as carbonates.

    Analysis IV. was spoiled by an accident; and in III. the de
termination of the earths was abandoned on ascertaining the ne
cessity for the removal of ammoniacal salts before precipitating
baryta (vide note), a precaution which had not been taken in this
CaSC.
    The silicic acid, alumina, protoxides, and water are clearly
present in the ratio 4: 1: 1 : 5, giving the formula
              (BaO,   Sr0, CaO), SiO2+A1*0°, 3SiO3+5 HO.
The atomic relation between the lime, baryta, and strontia is near
1:2:4,
    * In examining the precautions incident to this mode of determining
baryta in the presence of strontia or lime, I have found no notice taken in
any work on chemical analysis of the solvent effect of ammoniacal salts
upon silico-fluoride of barium.              -
    Fresenius states that the latter dissolves in 3400 to 3800 parts of water,
and in 640 to 733 parts of water acidified by hydrochloric acid, but does
not mention salts of ammonia.
    I digested pure silico-fluoride of barium in the cold, with frequent stir
 ring, for forty-eight hours (a) with a saturated solution of chloride of am
monium, (b) with the same solution diluted with twice its volume of water.
 The fluid was in each case filtered off perfectly clear, 100 cubic centimetres
were measured, and the baryta was determined as sulphate.
    (a) gave 1942 grim. of BaO, SO’=2338 grim. of BaF, SiF". Hence 1
part .#the latter salt dissolves in 428 parts of a saturated solution of sal
alm IIMOIllac.
    (b) gave 1409 grm. of BaO, SO’="1697 grm. of BaF, SiF*, or 1 part in
589 of the diluted solution.
    The necessity of removing ammoniacal salts from a fluid in which baryta
is to be determined as silico-fluoride is sufficiently obvious.

   “Remarks on Organo-Metallic Bodies; 4th Memoir.” By Edward
Frankland, Ph.D., F.R.S., Lecturer on Chemistry at St. Bartholo
mew's Hospital.
   In a former Memoir” the author described the production of a
mew series of organic compounds containing the metal tin in com
bination with the radicals methyle, ethyle, and amyle. His attention
was at that time especially directed to the compound formed by the
 union of tin with ethyle, and to which the name stamethyle was given.
 The iodide of stamethyle was prepared by exposing iodide of ethyle to
light or heat in the presence of tinfoil; and, by acting with zinc upon
the aqueous solution of this iodide of stamethyle or of the chloride of
the same body, stanethyle itself (C, H, Sn) was obtained.
   In accordance with a theory of the constitution of           organo                                    all
metallic bodies which the author then      suggested,  the above com

bearably pungent odour of one of the products of the action of tin
upon iodide of ethyle at 160°C., and described by MM. Cahours
and Riche as iodide of distannous ethyle, Sn, (C, H.), I. The iodine
salt appears, in fact, to be either identical with this body or to consist
of stannic iodotriethide (Sn, (C, H,), I)*.
   Stannic ethide does not decompose water, and is not acted upon
by strong aqueous hydrochloric acid in the cold. When, however,
heat is applied to the mixture of the two liquids, bubbles of gas are
slowly evolved; but it requires from twelve to eighteen hours to
complete the reaction. The gas was found to be pure hydride of
ethyle, and the quantity evolved was such as to show that exactly
one equivalent of ethyle was expelled in the form of hydride from two
equivalents of stannic ethide, indicating the following reaction: —

           II.   Action of Zincmethyle upon Iodide of Stanethyle.
   About three ounces of crystallized iodide of stanethyle were gra
dually added to a solution of zincmethyle in ether. Considerable heat
was evolved, and the vessel in which the reaction was performed
required to be plunged into cold water.      On treating the product
as before described, a  liquid was obtained  boiling between 143° and
148°C., and yielding, on analysis, numbers closely corresponding
with the formula
                                                     C, H.

  The action of zincmethyle upon iodide                       of stamethyle may therefore
be thus expressed:—

     The   new body thus formed,    and for which        propose the nameI
stannie   ethylomethide,  is a colourless   limpid   liquid,  undistinguish
able in  appearance  from stannic ethide. It     possesses,   like the latter,
a very  faint ethereal odour and a    slightly  metallic taste. Its specific

 the  above formula, unless the exceedingly improbable assumption be
 adopted, that it contains two volumes of zincmethyle vapour, united
with one volume of ether vapour, without condensation. On the
other hand, it accords closely with the specific gravity of the vapour
of a mixture of zincmethyle and ether in the above proportions.
   Without at present offering any decided opinion as to the nature
of this body, the author states that in repeated operations with large
quantities of materials he has entirely failed in obtaining pure zinc
methyle by this method of proceeding.
   Similar repeated attempts to produce pure zincethyle frcm zinc
and iodide of methyle, without the intervention of ether, were also
unsuccessful, although this method generally succeeds in small glass
tubes.     This anomaly in the results obtained from the same mate
rials heated in a copper digester and in glass tubes, is doubtless due
to the difference of the conditions in the two cases.         In a glass tube
half immersed in a heated oil         bath,   a constant distillation of the
internal liquid is going on, the liquid condensed in the upper por
tion of the tube flowing over an extensive surface of zinc in                                                        its

   May 10.-Professor Miller made communications—(1) “On an

   Mr. Godfray read a paper “On a Chart and Diagram for facilita
ting Great-Circle Sailing.”
   It has long been known that in many cases a very great saving of
distance would be effected by guiding the ship along the arc of a
great circle instead of following the rhumb; but the tedious calcula
tions which great-circle sailing requires, and the difficulty of tracing
the track on the chart, have hitherto stood in the way of its adop
tion. The great advantage which Mercator's sailing offers in these
respects sufficiently explains the preference given to                 even by those   it,
who are   fully  aware        of

several vertebrate classes, directing attention to the tripartite divi
sion of their distal segments, and to the uniformity of plan upon
which they are constructed.     He argued that this uniformity has
relation to the mode in which their development proceeds, and to
the similarity of their functions rather than any adhesion to an
“ideal archtypal pattern;” and expressed his belief that the exist
ence of such an ideal in the minds of anatomists proves in some
measure a hindrance to the full study of the laws which regulate the
formation of animal bodies.
   The differences between the fore and hind limbs were shown to
depend,—first, upon the fact that the hind limbs are required to pro
pel as well as to support the trunk, and less variety of movement is
needed in them; hence they are larger and firmer, and the same
bone of the leg forms a main constituent both of the ankle and of the
knee-joint; secondly, in walking and running the fore limb is ex
tended in front of the trunk, and draws the latter after it during its
flexion, whereas the hind limb is bent up beneath the trunk and
                                                             an its

   The following communications were read:—
   1. “Further Observations on the Ossiferous Caves near Palermo.”
 By Dr. Falconer, F.R.S., V.P.G.S.
   Dr. Falconer, in the first place, adverted to his previous com
 munication, read on the 4th of May last, before his collections
 had arrived in England. In the present paper he submitted, with
 more detailed explanations, the materials on which his first state
 ments were founded.        Dr. Falconer then described the physical
 geography of that portion of the northern coast of Sicily in which
 the ossiferous caves abound, namely between Termini on the east
 and Trapani on the west. Along the Bay of Palermo, and again
 at Carini, the hippurite-limestone presents inland vertical cliffs, from
 the base of which stretch slightly inclined plains of pliocene depo
 sits, usually about 1% mile broad, towards the sea. The majority of
 fossil shells in these tertiary beds belong to recent species. At the
 base of those inland cliffs, but sometimes 50 feet above the level of
 the plain, and upwards of 200 feet above the sea, the ossiferous
 caves occur.     One of the best known of these is the Grotto di
  San Ciro, in the Monte Griffone, about two miles from Palermo.
  This cave has been often described. Like many others, it contains
  a thick mass of bone-breccia on         its
                                        floor, extending also beyond                 its
  mouth and overlying the pliocene beds outside, where great blocks
  of limestone are mixed with the superficial soil. The bones from
  this cave had long been known, and were formerly thought                      to   be
  those  of giants..  Some years since, bones were here excavated for
  exportation; and M. Christol          Marseilles was surprised
                                         at                           re        to

  Besides the Hippopotamus, remains           Elephas also occur.

of 8 feet from the floor had been thickly bored by Pholades; for
the space of 10 feet higher the side was smooth; and still higher up
it was cancellar or eroded.   Above the breccia were blocks of lime
stone, covered by earthy soil, in which bones of Hippopotami, with
a few of those of Bos and Cervus, light and fragile, not fossilized as
in the breccia, occurred plentifully.
   In his late visit to the San Ciro Cave, Dr. Falconer collected
(besides the Hippopotamus) remains of Elephas antiquus, Bos, Cervus,
Sus, Ursus, Canis, and a large Felis, some of which indicated a
pliocene age.

miles to the west of Palermo, was lately the especial subject of the
author's research, whose attention was directed to it by            Mor                               J.

roof, mingled with some bits of carbon, but without shells or bone
splinters. On the back part of the cavern, where the roof shelves
towards the floor, thick masses of reddish calcareous matrix were
found attached to the roof, and completely covered over by a crust
of ochreous stalagmite. It contained numerous fragments of the
siliceous objects, mixed with bone-splinters and bits of carbon. In
fact, all round the cavern, wherever the stalagmitic crust on the
roof was broken through, more or less of the same appearances
were presented.        In some parts the matrix closely resembled the
characters of the “ceneri impastate,” with a larger admixture of
calcareous paste.                  -
    With   regard   to the   fragments     of the siliceous objects, the great
majority of them present definite forms, namely long, narrow, and
thin, having invariably a smooth conchoidal surface below, and
above, a longitudinal ridge beveled off right and left, or a con
cave facet replacing the ridge—in the latter case presenting three
facets on the upper side. The author is of opinion that they closely
resemble, in every detail of form, obsidian knives from Mexico, and
flint knives from Stonehenge, Arabia, and elsewhere, and that they
appear to have been formed by the dislamination, as films, of the
long angles of prismatic blocks of stone. These fragments occur
intimately intermixed with the bone-splinters, shells, &c. in the
roof-breccia, in very considerable abundance; amorphous fragments
of flint are comparatively rare, and no pebbles or blocks occur
either within or without the cave.            But similar reddish flint or chert
is found in the hippurite limestone near Termini.
    In regard to the theory of the various conditions observed in the
Maccagnone Cave, the author considers that it has undergone
several changes of level, and that the accumulation of bone-breccia
 below and outside is referable to a period when the cave was scarcely
above the level of the sea. Dr. Falconer points out the significance of
 the fact that although coprolites of Hyaenae were so abundant against
 the roof and outside, none, or but very few, of the bones of Hyaenas
 were observed in the interior. He remarked also on the absence
 of the remains of small mammalia, such as Rodents.                   He inferred
 that the cave, in    its  present form, and with                      its
                                                              present floor, had
 not been tenanted          bythese animals.      The vast number           Hippo   of

 have been very different         at   novery distant geological period from
 what obtains now. He considered that all deposits above the bone
 breccia had been accumulated           up    the roof by materials washed
                                                 to                                            in

EXPERIMENTS TO                SHOW    THE EXISTENCE OF A NEW SPECIES OF
  RESISTANCE TO                   THE TRANSMISSION  OF ELECTRICITY.  BY
  M.    J.     M. GAUGAIN.
     HE theory of Ohm rests, as is known, on the fundamental idea
      that the electric movement transmitted by a conducting body
is subject to the same laws as the movement of heat in a solid body;
and all the consequences which have been drawn from this hypo
thesis have hitherto been verified by experience.                 The observations
which form the subject of the present notice, seem to establish a
new analogy between heat and electricity: just, in fact, as in the
case of heat there are two species of conductibility—the one inter
mal, the other eaternal—so it seems necessary to admit two species
of electric conductibility, in order to account for the facts I am about
 to mention.
   I    formerly stated that the flow of electricity, of uniform intensity,
 down a cotton thread in a constant state of tension, varies inversely as
 the length of the thread.          This law is true, not only of cotton thread,
 but of the    greater   number of bad conductors,             of gum-lac, for in
  stance, and    porcelain,  and the     glass   which is used for the isolating
  supports of electric machines.            Hitherto I have found but a single
  body to which the law in       question    does not apply,–the glass, namely,
  which is used in the construction of disengaging tubes.
      I have proved that the resistance of a glass tube of this kind is
   absolutely independent of                its

described is precisely equal to the sum of the separate resistances of
the portions of the tube of which it is made up; in other words,
the external resistances, of which I am here speaking, may be added
to each other like the internal resistances, and consequently they
have a constant value, which is independent of the intensity of the
electric current.       This observation is of some importance, because
it  proves   that the resistance caused by the contact of a glass tube
with a metallic ring is not of the same nature as the resistance
which is offered by an electrolysed liquid. The latter, as I have
shown elsewhere (Comptes Rendus, 24th December, 1855), varies
with the intensity of the current, and even with the duration of the
electrolysation.       I may add that the resistance to the passage of
the current which results from electrolysation, never occurs without
the electrodes themselves becoming polarized, whereas, in the case
of the passage of electricity down a glass tube, I am convinced no
polarization takes place.
    It may be said that the resistance which the electric fluid encoun
ters at the contact of the tube with the metallic ring, results
from the stratum of air which is interposed between the glass and
the metal; but it must be observed that this stratum of air exists
 as much in the case of white glass as in that of tube-glass, and that
nevertheless the resistance, which with the one of these kinds of
glass is very observable, is absolutely imperceptible with the other.
 It appears to me to be impossible to explain the concurrence of these
facts except by means of the new property which I have designated
 eaternal conductibility.
    When the resistance of a conductor is altogether external, as in
 the case of tube-glass, it would be expected, a priori, to vary with
 the superficial extent of the metallic rings which connect the tube
 with the rest of the apparatus; and this is verified by experience.
If,  for example, the communications are made                 meansby    broad      of
 bands, the resistance         much less than
                                is                  wires of small diameter
                                                     if
 are employed.        When,          on
                                   the other hand, the resistance      altoge   is

of   the tube has not been perceptibly modified by the friction            has           it
 undergone; but      if    the electroscope         be

resinous electricity, while no vitreous electricity is to be detected in
the tube.   These facts are easily explained.       The tube does not
retain the vitreous electricity, because         internal conductibilityits
being very great, this electricity can escape into the earth; but the
electroscope remains charged with resinous electricity, because the
small external conductibility       the tube only suffers

                                                      letter addressed       a                                       by
him     M. Clement
       to               1815, which concludes thus:—“If we suppose
                                    in
now that the products furnished        the ferment may      by disregarded                   be
in relation      the alcohol and carbonic acid which are the only

                             of                               100 parts                    of                        of
sugar, 51.34 are converted into alcohol, and 48°66 into carbonic
acid during fermentation.”        This deduction         Gay-Lussac co                of
incided with the views promulgated twenty-five years before                                                          by
Lavoisier upon alcoholic fermentation, and       removed        the doubts  it                  all

                  later must have been raised       the inaccurate expe          by
riments of that illustrious chemist.
  It  was admitted, however, that experiment could not            all points                      in
confirm Gay-Lussac's theories, for Lavoisier had rightly indicated
that   asmall portion     sugar was transformed into
                                     of                      organic acid,                 an

which he supposed to be acetic acid, but which has long since been
identified with lactic acid.                                                                 &
   The results of the author's experiments are at variance with the
general opinions upon the products of fermentation
   1. The acid of alcoholic fermentation is never either acetic or
                                                                              :-
lactic acid.
   2. Alcohol and carbonic acid are not the only products of the
splitting-up of sugar. They are always accompanied by succinic
acid and glycerine.       The proportion of succinic acid varies between
5 and 7 thousandths, and that of glycerine between 25 and 36 thou
sandths of the weight of sugar set in fermentation.
   3. The alcohol and carbonic acid do not equate with a definite
weight of sugar, that is to say, the alcohol and carbonic acid are
not in the proportions indicated by the theoretical equation; more
carbonic acid is evolved than is required by the weight of alcohol
produced.
   4. More than 1 per cent. (1-2 to 1-5) of the weight of sugar is
fixed upon the yeast in the form of various matters, amongst which
are cellulose and fatty substances.
   Thus of 100 grms. of sugar which are fermented, 5 to 6 grims. do
not follow the equation of Lavoisier and Gay-Lussac ; and this por
tion of sugar is transformed by assimilating water in such a way as
to furnish in ordinary cases—

   The remainder of the sugar appears to correspond with the whole
of the alcohol and the rest of the carbonic acid, in accordance with
the equations of Lavoisier and Gay-Lussac.
   The question here arises whether the succinic acid and glycerine
with the carbonic acid which accompanies them, may not be the
results of a secondary and accidental action.                        This the author can
not admit, as in more than a hundred analyses of fermentations
effected under the most different conditions, these products were
always obtained.
   In wine also he found that succinic acid and glycerine are present
in considerable quantity; 1 litre of wine contains 6 to 8 grms. of
glycerine, and 1 to 1-5 grim. of succinic acid.                       The solid residue of
the evaporation of a litre of wine being from 15 to 25 grims., it will
be seen that more than a third, and often more than half of the solid
materials of wine have been unknown to the present day.—Comptes

again have the same action on M as if this body were at rest,
and consequently will impart to the same a new velocity equal
to the first, and so on.
   5. Let us next suppose the body M to be placed upon a fixed
support, applied at a point F whose distance from the centre of
gravity G is h. If the body were struck with any force Q at the
point F and at right angles to the support, it is evident that the
direct percussion upon the obstacle would be measured by the
force Q itself.
   But if the body were struck with the same force, and in a
parallel direction, at another point C taken on the line GF at
the distance a from G, the percussion on the obstacle would no
longer be the same as before, but would be dependent upon the
distance a in a manner which requires to be determined.

 infinite, the moment of inertia around an axis passing through
 the centre g has a finite value which, as will be seen, is exactly
 the same as the moment of inertia, with respect to the same axis,
 of the simple body M. Hence, although the centre of gravity g,
 in consequence of the infinite mass M+A with which it is
 charged, remains immoveable under the direct action of              the                                to all

percussion, whose distance is expressed by

coincides here also (since K=0) with the centre of gravity g.
But this would be a theoretical error similar to the preceding;
for at the point g, where was 0, the percussion Q is precisely
equal to the force P, whereas at the point T, which corresponds
to the preceding value of a, the percussion is infinite+.

IN     your Number for June last, Professor Haughton has replied
          my remarks
           to              your May Number
                                      in                 his investigations       on

feel obliged               by
                  your publishing the following rejoinder.
       Professor Haughton states,
      1.                                                      (p.

crust and for the nucleus.”
   These words        once show me that Professor Haughton has
                                at
misapprehended      my meaning. The fallacy                referred      was      I                      to
this—that             in

                                                        of                        he

viz. (1) that the same law         ellipticity  of
                                                and  density   holds for the
solid and fluid parts          the earth; and (2) that the same law

260                     Archdeacon Pratt on the Thickness                                of
physical property or condition into the problem by which the
solid and fluid parts may be distinguished.   Mr. Hopkins intro
duces the condition that the fluid part presses according to the
laws of fluidity against the solid parts and produces a preces
sional motion in them, which is an object for measurement.
Mr. Hennessy, in his investigation, introduces physical conditions
which serve the same purpose according to his method of treat
ing the problem. But this Professor Haughton does not do.
His investigation, therefore, is not one which affects the problem
of the thickness of the earth’s crust one way or the other.
   3. It is against the assumptions which are made in attempting
to solve this problem that Professor Haughton protests; and not
least against “Laplace's arbitrary law of density.”        He will
find others who agree with him in this, at any rate to a consi
derable extent.   Had this been his only apparent objection,                                                   I
should not have written my former paper.          But as he had taken
up the subject as a physico-mathematical one, and had brought
to bear upon it the only machinery which is of any value and
power in such problems—the analysis of Laplace—his investiga
tion seemed to call for special attention.
   4. And now one word with regard to “Laplace's arbitrary
law of density.”     If we are to make no hypotheses, there is an
end to       all
             philosophizing, and       attaining results such
                                                           to       have                            as

words from me, the italics being his own:-"          has been sug                     It
gested that the crust may project downwards into the lava                                                so   as

desired effect; for the crust being formed from the liquid, will

And then he adds an expression of surprise that should base a                                      I
                                                                                      of all

According to the concordant measurements of Miller and Kok
scharow, the angles of the terminal edge of the fundamental form
are 123° 8, and hence only differ by 11 minutes from those of
the angles of zircon. It is true that hitherto the characteristic
twin crystals of tinstone have not been met with in zircon; and
in this respect a difference between these forms might be found.
But it must be remarked that the twin crystals of tinstone only
occur in certain places, as in the Erzgebirge, while they have
not been found in the tinstone of other districts, as for example
Cornwall.    The same may also be the case with zircon; and the
places in which it occurs in twin crystals may hitherto have
rethained undiscovered.
  If there is such an agreement in crystalline form and strutture
in tinstone and zircon, it is very probable that the chemical com
position in both is analogous.     Both have, it is true, hitherto
been regarded as compounds of entirely different nature—tin
stone as stannic acid, zircon as silicate of zirconia; and zirconia
has even been considered as a sesquioxide.         Notwithstanding
this, Deville+ has found it necessary to assume two double atoms
of chlorine in chloride of zirconium, since it is only by this
assumption that the condensation of    vapour agrees with that    its
of  similarly constituted vapours, and with that                                  of

according to Breithaupt*, varies from 45 to 4-8. It is therefore
less in proportion as the quantity of silica is greater than in ordi
nary zircon.     But since the crystalline form of Auerbachite is
the same as that of zircon, small differences being neglected,
this circumstance is also an argument for considering zircon as
an isomorphous compound of zirconic acid and silicic acid, which
are, however, not always combined in the same proportion.
    The differences which have been observed in the specific gra
vities of zircon, may perhaps arise from the fact that silicic acid
and zirconic acid are not always present in the same proportion;
but it may also happen that in some, titanic acid, or, as Svan
berg't has found, moria is contained. Malakon and Oerstedtite,
which have the same crystalline form as zircon, have still more
divergent and lower specific gravities than that mineral; yet,
according to the investigations of Oersted and Scheerer, these
contain water (5.5 to 3:03 per cent.), and are hence no longer in
a fresh, but in a decomposed condition<U+017F>.        Oersted states that
Oerstedtite contains titanic acid, along with zirconic acid and
silicic acid.

lower than the given contour line; in which case the tract
bounded by the contour line is a depression.     But there may be
  within the contour line bounding an elevation, spaces lower than
  the bounding line, and within the contour line bounding a de
 pression, spaces higher than the bounding line. A depression
 usually contains water, and indeed is filled so as to overflow, in
 which case there is a lake with an outlet; if the depression is
 not filled to overflowing, the lake will have no outlet. The
 contour line bounding an elevation may become indefinitely
 small and ultimately reduce itself to a point, which is a summit;
 the contour line bounding a depression may in like manner
 become indefinitely small, and ultimately reduce itself to a point,
 which is what I call an immit.        A summit is a point of maximum
 elevation (though of course there may be summits, or even
 immits, which are higher); an immit is a point of minimum
 elevation.    But there are besides, as at the heads of passes,
 points where the surface is horizontal, but where the elevation is
 neither a maximum nor a minimum ; you descend backwards
 and forwards, but ascend right and left:                      I
                                                      will for the present
 purpose call this kind of point a knot.           And this leads to the
 consideration of a contour line which cuts itself: the point where
 this happens is in fact a knot, or geometrically the knot is a
 node or double point on the contour line.            It may be assumed
 that the contour line through a knot does not pass through any
 other knot; for although there may be neighbouring passes of
 precisely the same altitude, yet the general configuration of the
 country will not be altered by giving a slight difference of eleva
tion to such passes: the effect of this alteration is to distribute
among contour lines of slightly different elevations (one to each
line) the different knots which would otherwise occur upon one
and the same contour line.         The contour line through a knot
cuts itself therefore at this  point   only ; such contour line is either

is the case of two mountain summits connected by a ridge or
eol, the lowest point whereof, or head of the pass, is the knot on
the outloop contour line through this point.    And in like man
ner, that for an inloop curve the lune is an elevation, the inner
loop a depression; and that the outer loop, considered as a por
tion of the contour line, is higher than the consecutive exterior
contour line. This is the case of a lake having an outlet; if the
lake were dry, the passage up stream into the bed of it would be
over a ridge, col, or barrier, the lowest point whereof, or point of
outlet for the water of the lake, is the knot on the inloop con
tour line passing through this point, the shore of the lake being
of course the inner loop of this contour line, and the waters
being retained by means of the raised ground within the lune
between the two loops of the contour line.
   The slope lines cut at right angles the contour lines; and this
property applies also to the projections of the two systems of
lines; so that the two systems of lines delineated in plano inter
sect at right angles.     Consider the eontour lines which are closed
curves surrounding a given summit or immit; the exterior con
tour line is intersected at each of         points         slope line; and
                                                                  its                by  a

in general a course line passes from immit to immit through a
single intervening knot which is a point of maximum elevation
on the course line; it need not be considered as an exception
when, as is frequently the case, the course line arrives at the
sea-level contour line without previously reaching an immit.            It
is to be noticed that a ridge line or a course line may commence
and terminate at one and the same summit or immit, and thus
form a closed curve.
   The ridge lines, as above defined, determine the watershed.
In the case of an isolated conical or dome-shaped mountain, and
in general when the contour lines are                                all

my laboratory.            In
                     these experiments the amount of water was
determined which a given quantity of pure and most carefully
prepared mangano-manganous oxide furnished when reduced
in a stream of dry hydrogen, free from air, to manganous oxide.
If a denotes the quantity of mangano-mangamous oxide, b the
quantity of water obtained, the equivalent of manganese is calcu
lated from the equation                1 (32(a—4 x 0.8889                     b)

        It
      must be admitted that this method does not wholly satisfy
the strict conditions which may be demanded for the determina
tion of an equivalent. It is clear that a small error in the esti
mation of the water appears as a comparatively great one in the
equivalent number.      Nevertheless we may expect an approxi
mately correct value from a long series of experiments performed
with accuracy.
   The apparatus in which the reduction was effected, received
such an arrangement that the narrow finely drawn-out end of
the reduction tube passed in an oblique direction deep into the
chloride of calcium tube destined to receive the water.       This
limb of the reduction tube, in order to prevent  any  loss of man
ganese, was filled for 3–4 inches with a loose plug of previously
ignited asbestos. The ignition of the oxide in the current of
hydrogen was continued until the formation of water had entirely
ceased, and the contents of the tube of reduction had assumed a
pure green colour. No weighing was made of the residual sub
oxide, as the degree of compactness acquired by the substance
at the temperature to which it can be subjected in a glass tube,
is not sufficient to prevent an immediate partial oxidation when
it is exposed to the air%.
   Of nine experiments in which the above process was employed,
and in which the quantities of mangano-manganous oxide varied
between 1:6 and T1:6 grms,   here adduce     I                       the      six   which gave

272                        M. R. Schneider               on Equivalents,               and
the relation between the carbon and manganese in pure neutral
manganous    oxalate.   Inasmuch, however, as the oxides of
manganese cannot be reduced to the metallic state on being
heated in a stream of hydrogen, the amount of manganese in
the salt could only be determined indirectly by estimating the
water formed at the same time.   From the difference of the sub
stance employed and the water, the amount of the anhydrous
salt was determined; from the difference between this and the
carbonic acid, the weight of the manganese was determined.                                                           I

considered as important preliminaries for the establishment of a
natural system.   It seems to me, however, that in trying to
establish such a law,  we should proceed more cautiously than
has been in some instances the case hitherto.   Laws must have
established facts to rest upon; as long as the latter are wanting,
laws are out of the question.   In this point agree entirely with                  I
Schafarikº, and consider it very fortunate that chemistry at pre
sent is not a mere aggregate of facts.   Such an aggregate, how
ever, were better than one of unproved hypotheses.
  According to M. Dumas, there is a certain law according to
which several elements have the same equivalent.     In the first
instancet, this law was sought to be established with regard to
manganese and chromium, which were said both to have the equi
valent 26.     As has been remarked      271), Dumas has been           (p.
already obliged    retract the number 26 for manganese
                         to                              being                                          as
inaccurate, although advanced with such positiveness. Granted,
however,   that manganese were actually 26, still the equality                                                of

               manganese     not 26,   Dumas gives     but 26:24; as                           it,
and until   experimental  proofs are furnished,   seems unjustifi                      it
able   toconvert this into the round number     26;      least this                                at

                                  chromium are therefore decidedly
not equal.
     Lately M. Dumas      has endeavoured
                                   Š             prove the equality         to                                of

prise at the hasty conclusions which M. Dumas has drawn from
 incomplete investigations.
    On continuing his attempts to deduce the equivalent of mag
 nesium from the composition of chloride of magnesium, Dumas
 has obtained numbers extending from 12:0 to 12.6; that                      dif                      is,

 12:25 was obtained. Finally, Dumas admits that for the pre

the results    given,      can      we   at
                                    once draw the conclusion that none

280                Dr. Wallace on the Equivalent of Bromine.
series of experiments performed with bromide of potassium pur
chased as pure, and submitted to four recrystallizations,  ob                 I
tained the equivalent 784.     Marignac prepared, in the first
place, bromate of potash, and after repeated crystallizations,
converted it into bromide of potassium by the action of heat.
His experiments, which are entitled to the utmost confidence,
gave the number 79.94 to 79.99, or in round numbers 80; and
this equivalent is now universally accepted.   Notwithstanding,
however, the very high reputation of Marignac, the wide differ
ence between his results and those of other authorities render it
expedient that his number should be confirmed by another series
of experiments.
        I have recently hadoccasion to employ bromide of arsenic in
an  investigation,    in the course of which I observed that this
compound offers peculiar facilities for thorough purification.       It
distils  readily, but at a much    higher temperature   than the chlo
ride, and, on slow cooling, forms beautiful large rhombic prisms,
from which the still liquid portion may be poured off. The ob
servation of these properties determined me to employ the bro
mide of arsenic for the estimation of the equivalent of bromine.
        I
      prepared, by the simple union of the two elements, about
three-quarters of a pound of the bromide, and in the first place
distilled off a large proportion in order to get rid of the traces of
chlorine by which bromine is always accompanied.          The bromide
was then collected, rejecting the last portions, however; and the
distillate was slowly cooled until a part crystallized out, after
which the remainder was poured off and rejected.          The distilla
tion, excluding the first and last portions, was repeated, and like
wise the crystallization, several times.      The first quantity em
ployed for experiment was distilled three times and crystallized
as often; the second portion was distilled three times and cry
stallized four times; and the third was distilled four times and
crystallized five times.
   The method of procedure resembled that of Pelouze for arsenic,
                                                                           of all
and of Marignac for bromine; and to ensure accuracy,               the
reagents—silver, nitric acid, and water—were obtained              the
greatest possible purity.      Three experiments only were made.
        In
       the first experiment 8-58 grms.        silver required 8.3246
                                                       of

   It will be observed that this number depends upon that of
arsenic; and       I
                  am satisfied that the number 75, as found by
Berzelius and   Pelouze,  is entitled to the utmost reliance; the
respective numbers of these distinguished authorities, found b
entirely different processes, being respectively 74.918 and 75-068.
My experiments serve, to some extent, to confirm Marignac's num
ber, and to show that those previously obtained are much below
the    truth.

theorem plays a principal part) of the irreducibility of the equa

of equations as for the system derived from it by interchanging
p    with q.
     This, in fact, isgeneralization of Euler's theorem, with which
                                a
it becomes identical on making one of the quantities p or q (say
q) infinite; for the theorem of Bellavitis then assumes the fol
lowing form: “The number of ways of making up m with the
numbers 1, 2,           ...
                    p, is the same as the number - of ways of break
ing up m into p or fewer parts.”
   It is capable of an intuitive proof in precisely the same way as
Euler's particular case by means of Mr. Ferrer's method of dis
integration given in this Magazine.       For it can be shown that
every group of integers a'i, a 2,                       ...

SOME
   several     interesting facts relative to this acid.
   By some chemists lactic acid is considered to contain 6, and
by some 12 atoms of carbon. The discovery by Strecker of             for                             its

     Inrepeating Wurtz’s experiments, Ulricht observed certain
reactions which led him     the conclusion that Wurtz’s chlorolac

Ulrich observed that chloropropionic acid, when treated with
nascent hydrogen, was converted into propionic acid; and                                                     he
found that this reaction furnished the best method                                         of   preparing
propionic acid.
     In    a    communication                  on   the constitution          of   lactic acid,      Kolbef
expresses the opinion that lactic acid, and the acids homologous

Even if these compounds did not exist, it would still be allowable
to consider lactic acid as biatomic, if not bibasic; for by simple
dehydration it forms an anhydride, and it also forms a
chloride, which, by appropriate treatment, regenerates the acid.

 not the researches of Wurtz rendered it probable that the ethers
 of the glycols contain the same number of equivalents of carbon
as the glycols themselves.
    When iodide of methylene is treated with chlorine, iodine is
separated, and chloride of methylene, C*H*Cl”, formed.                    It is
an oily liquid, which distils at 40° to 41° C., with an odour
resembling chloroform. The corresponding bromide, C*H*Br”,
is similarly formed.          Butlerow’s attempts to isolate the gas me
thylene were unsuccessful.
    Wurtz and Frapolli’k succeeded in transforming aldehyde into
acetal by acting on sodium-alcohol with the compound C*H*O°Cl,
which is formed by the action of hydrochloric acid on aldehyde.
    Beilsteint has performed the reverse of this operation by trans
forming acetal into aldehyde.
    When acetal and glacial acetic acid are heated in a sealed tube
for two or three days to a temperature of 150° to 200°C., a
liquid is obtained which begins to boil below 50°.                      If the
vapours disengaged are received in ether saturated with ammo
niacal gas, the characteristic crystals of aldehyde-ammonia                  are
obtained.      The residual liquid contains acetic ether.           The reac
tion is expressed by the equation

    Anhydrous       acetic acid exerts a similar action.          A liquid is
obtained from which         aldehyde     and acetic ether  may  be extracted,

    From these experiments, acetal might be regarded as a combi
nation of aldehyde with ordinary ether,

    The same chemist<U+017F> tried the action of pentachloride of phos
phorus on acetal.         He found that the action was different accord
ing to the proportions taken. By the action of 2 equivs. of
pentachloride he hoped to obtain chloride of ethylidene, accord

                                noticing how comparatively rare are

tent to which these deposits are worked; and of these few cases so
many have been disproved, that man's non-existence on the earth
until after the latest geological changes, and the extinction of the
Mammoth, Tichorhine Rhinoceros, and other great mammals, had
come to be considered almost in the light of an established fact.
Instances, however, have from time to time occurred to throw some
doubt on this view, as the well-known cases of the human bones
 found by Dr. Schmerling in a cavern near Liege,                the remains of
 man, instanced by M. Marcel de Serres and others in several caverns
in France,—the flint-implements in Kent's Cave, and many more.
 Some uncertainty, however, has always attached to cave-evidence,
from the circumstance that man has often inhabited such places at
a comparatively late period, and may have disturbed the original
cave-deposit; or, after the period of his residence, the stalagmitic
floor may have been broken up by natural causes, and the remains
above and below it may have thus become mixed together, and
afterwards sealed up by a second floor of stalagmite. Such instances
of an imbedded broken stalagmitic floor are in fact known to occur;
at the same time the author does not pretend to say that this will
explain         all
             cases         of
                       intermixture       caves, but thatin   lessens the value        it
of the evidence from such sources.
    The subject has, however, been latterly revived, and the evidence
 more carefully sifted                  by
                              Dr. Falconer; and his preliminary reports

   At Abbeville the author was much struck with the extent and
beauty of M. Boucher de Perthes' collection.                There were many
forms of    flints,  in which    he,  however,  failed to see traces of design
or work,    and which he should         only consider as accidental; but with
regard to those flint-instruments termed “axes” (“haches”) by
M. de Perthes, he entertains not the slightest doubt of their artificial
make. They are of two forms, generally from 4 to 10 inches long:
the outlines of two specimens are represented in the following dia
gram.     They are very rudely made, without any ground surface,
and were the work of a people probably unacquainted with the use
of metals. These implements are much rarer at Abbeville than at
Amiens, fig. 1 being the common form at the former, and fig. 2 at

gentleman's opinion, that they there also occur in beds of undisturbed
sand and gravel.
    At Moulin Quignon, and at St. Gilles, to the S.E. of Abbeville,
the deposit occurs, as at St. Acheul, on the top of a low hill, and
consists of a subangular, ochreous and ferruginous flint-gravel, with
a few irregular seams of sand, 12 to 15 feet thick, reposing upon an
uneven surface of chalk.      It contains no shells, and very few bones.
M. de Perthes states that he has found fragments of the teeth of the
elephant here. The worked flints and the bones occur generally in
the lower part of the gravel.
    In the bed of gravel also on which Abbeville stands, a number of
flint-implements have been found, together with several teeth of the
Elephas primigenius, and, at places, fragments of freshwater shells.
    The section, however, of greatest interest is that at Menchecourt,

(“haches”) in M.      de Perthes' collection from Menchecourt; one
noticed   by  the author was from a depth of 5, and another of 7
metres.    This would take them out from bed No. 1, but would
leave it uncertain whether they came from No. 2 or No. 3.        From
their general appearance, and traces of the matrix, the author would
be disposed to place them in bed No. 2, but M. de Perthes believes
them to be from No. 3; if so, it must have been in some of the sub
ordinate clay seams occasionally intercalated in the white sand.

   The specimens of the weapons figured by Mr. Frere, and those
now in the British Museum and elsewhere, present a singular simi
larity in work and shape to the more pointed forms from St. Acheul.
   One very important fact connected with this section, is that it
shows the relative age of the bone and implement-bearing beds.
They form a thin lacustrine deposit, which seems to be superimposed
on the Boulder Clay, and to pass under a bed of the ochreous sand and
flint-gravel belonging to the great and latest drift-beds of the district.

In   fact, from the evidence here exhibited, and from all that he

  Statements have recently been made relative    the discovery                          to                                 of

animals, hitherto supposed to have been extinct long anterior to the
existence of our race. These observations are supposed by some to
prove the great antiquity of the human race; whilst others, equally
competent to form an opinion, admit that the intermixture of such
remains presents a most perplexing mystery.
   Whatever may be the result of yet unpublished or of future and
more extensive observations, it is certainly premature to assign this
great antiquity to our race, as long as the occurrence of such mix
tures can be explained by known causes admitted to be still in action.
   Two places have recently been pointed out in which such mixtures
are stated to occur :-1st, certain localities in France; 2nd, certain
caves in Sicily.   The latter have been visited by Dr. Falconer, and
as the information respecting them which we at present possess,
though small, is yet much more definite than what is known of the
French locality, my explanations will chiefly relate to the latter.
   It is stated that one of the Sicilian caves has    sides perforated      its
 by     marine animals.

  During the rising, or at a later period, fragments of rock may
have accumulated at the open mouth of the lower cavern, and thus
have stopped up        its
                       entrance, leaving the roof, sides, and floors
bearing evident traces   having been

may have been depositing        other portions

first rude state  ofexistence, entering this deserted den through the

              former occupants had used, might have been glad

   During this period traces of man's skill would probably be left
within his miserable abode; pottery, if he possessed the art; char
coal or charred wood, if he were acquainted with fire; rude cutting
instruments of flint or other hard stone, perhaps spear or arrow-heads.
   Fig. 4 represents the caverns at the end of the fourth period.
                                 Fig. 4.
   5th Period.—Torrents entering by the aperture at C, might now
have swept through the upper cavern, perhaps at successive intervals
of time. The effect of such torrents would be to wash from the
sloping floor of the upper cavern, the mixed remains of animal and
human life, together with the earliest traces of human art.
   In some of these catastrophes, the workman, as well as his work,
may have been entombed together in the lower cavern.
                                Fig. 5.
   Thus in the course of time the whole of the lower cavern may
have been filled up even to the roof.
   This state is represented in fig. 5.

  The effect of infiltration through the roof would now cement into
a breccia the mingled remnants from the upper chamber, and enclose
them, as it were, in a marble monument, in their new, though not
their latest resting-place.
   But the infiltration proceeding from the roof would act first, and
most powerfully, in cementing the upper part of the intruded mass.
   The lower portion would be less consolidated, and therefore less
capable of resisting any pressure from above.
   6th Period.—In the progress of time, some torrent of extra
ordinary magnitude may have penetrated through the upper cavern,
and, filling the channel or pipe P, have acted by                      its
                                                                  hydrostatic
pressure    onthe semi-consolidated matter               in
                                                  the lower one.       As the
water accumulated        the pipe, the pressure would become immense,
                           in
and ultimately the materials included         the lower cavern would give
                                                    in
way    at their point        of
                            least resistance.    This would probably                       be
towards the middle          or
                           bottom        the original entrance. The first
                                             of
sudden rush would probably clear out the greater part                the con of
tents  of the lower cavern, leaving, however,
    1st. Those portions attached        the roof
                                             to               by

than the middle which gave way; and also other portions                   the         of

                                        course.
   After this reopening          of
                               the lower cavern, the access              of
                                                                    air would
accelerate evaporation from            its
                                     roof, and that portion            of
                                                                  the breccia
still adhering   to   would gradually acquire the external coating
                      it                                                                   of
stalactite which   usually occurs           in
                                       caves.
  In    the meantime the dropping from the roof, falling upon the
floor, might also contribute        consolidate the remaining fragments,
                                       to
and, although more slowly, cover the whole                     of

perforated by marine animals, and no traces of animal life or of human
art would present itself; but on excavating the floor, both would be
found below the stalagmite ; whilst if the curious inquirer should
drive his pick into the roof,                  its
                                 fragments would bear testimony                                                   to
the same fact.

    These caverns had             recently   (1833) become accessible, and were
 then   very  imperfectly       explored.       I expressed       the guides my wish

 floor of   which     sloped     rather   steeply    towards one side. The whole
 floor was covered with              coat
                                      a          soft red mud, about three inches

    On my return from the cavern examined the black sooty matter,

    On the following day, having made inquiries                        the drainage

the   neighbouring       country,       was informed that about twenty years
before    my   visit,  a stream       of I
                                       water had been diverted from the valley
in  which   it  originally     flowed,   into another adjacent valley.
 I     then visited several        quarries,         in
                                                   one      which, about

                                  a                     water terminating

sucked     in very small particles floating                   on
                                                         the surface        the water.       of
 I    now visited the valley from which the original stream had been
diverted, and found             some elevation peat bog
                                 at                       a         which        had pro

     The large caverns                     I
                           had visited were considerably below the level
of the  peat  moss,  and the stream which flowed through            portion                                it.   A

       waters was    conveyed                            by
                                   sinks and crevices into the caves, and
kept them continually full. There must, however, have been some
very small leakage through which, when the stream which supplied
the water was cut off, those caverns were, after many years, laid dry.
    A  small mass       unconsolidated peat, sufficiently light
                                   of                                 float,                                         to

roof     the cavern.     Remaining there undisturbed for years,        may                                            it

 Discovery      of Remains of Human Art with                                        Bones      of Animals.                  305
    In such circumstances few or none of the larger fossils would
 occur, but possibly the remains of infusorial animals might enable us
 to identify the material of the ancient and of the new but inverted
 deposit of gault.
    The      of remains of human art found imbedded with bones of

 extinct races of animals in deposits of ancient gravel, seems to
 require a different explanation.
    Admitting, however, the existence of those animals to have been
 contemporaneous with the original distribution of the gravel, it by no
 means certainly follows that the race of man was coeval with them.
    For the remains of man and his rude arts might occur on the
 surface of that gravel long ages after the extinction of those races of
 animals.    Several causes might produce their mixture:–

306                                          Royal Society:—
 opinion is founded upon the previous examination many years ago of
 the mode then used for making gun-flints.
   Amongst the many valuable observations of Dr. Falconer, one
fact to which he testifies deserves the most marked attention,
 and may possibly assist in directing us to the true solution of the
problem.
   Dr. Falconer has noticed the fact that the greater portion of these
bones belong to the Hippopotamus, and also that they occur in their
several deposits in enormous numbers.        In each cave there must
have been several thousands, if not tens of thousands, of individuals.
The question immediately suggests itself, what causes produced this
vast collection of individuals of the same race entombed in one
common sepulchre?
   It is scarcely possible to suppose that any instinct could have led
the Hippopotamus, when death approached, to have chosen particular
spots where the bones of his race were exposed to his view. . If this
were      so,
          then most probably the existing race would possess the same
instinct.
   Another question arises: Were these remains originally deposited                                           in
different localities, and afterwards transported         some common cause     by
to  these various caverns and beaches? Water seems the only probable
mode       conveyance:
          of                this were                              so,

the case. Moreover,           difficultis                         to
                                            conceive how water could have
collected the bones             of
                             multitude

distributed over        wide extent
                          a                 country,   into       of
                                                               few favoured               a

the same action, and should have been deposited               the same tomb.         in
If these animals          all
                        perished     the same time   at  each locality, some   in
common cause must have produced the catastrophe.
   Although the existing evidence may                                     be                  to         us

     In such circumstances the gradual subsidence of this land would
check the outflow of its rivers, and occasion extensive marshes and
lakes, a state of things favourable to the increase of the Hippo
potami.        As the subsidence proceeded, those animals which dwelt
on the banks of the lakes and rivers would be driven inland.                      The
waters of the Atlantic, entering through the channel of the former
river, would convert the low ground and the marshes into sea, and
thus gradually isolate the sinking land from the African coast.

multiply rapidly, an increased rapidity in the sinking of                       lands                           its

males?

greater abundance near the top of the bone-beds, and those of the

  May 16, 1859.-Mr.                             Hopkins gave               a     lecture        “On Glacial
Theories.”
   De Saussure attributed the motion       glaciers   their sliding over
                                                                 of                  to

was made        our knowledge
                     in             glaciers for many years after De
                                                      of
Saussure's death, till certain Swiss observers, Charpentier and others,
rather more than twenty years ago, added much           our knowledge                  to
of the subject.   Among these glacial observers, M. Agassiz, with
characteristic zeal and activity, soon afterwards took       prominent                          a

position.     He and those who were associated with him, or had pre
ceded   him,   brought forward incontestible evidence of the former ex
tension of   glaciers    in the Alps, and of their efficiency in the trans
port of enormous angular fragments of rock from their original sites
to other localities, not only in the same Alpine valley, but even on
the flanks of the Jura on the opposite side of the great central valley
of Switzerland.        These were the great facts which bore upon specu
lative  geology.      Glaciers were still engaged in the work of trans
port, and they had been so on a much larger scale at some former
epoch; the masses of ice of which they were composed had been
then of much larger dimensions, and consequently the mean climate
of Western Europe must have been at that period considerably lower
than at present. No one was so active as M. Agassiz in pressing
these facts on the notice of geologists, or insisted more strongly on
their geological importance; and by the energy of his own character,
his great reputation, and extensive personal acquaintance with men
of science, he had undoubtedly made the first great steps in giving
currency to the glacial theories of geology—theories which, though
viewed at that time with much distrust, had since, with such modi
fications as enlarged knowledge and sober judgment had imposed
on them, been universally recognized by geologists.
   For his unflinching advocacy of the glacial theory in                 broad out                  its
lines, geologists had been unquestionably much indebted                           M.                           to
Agassiz; but        inhis  physical   theories  respecting    glacial phaenomena,
he  had not shown that caution              acquaintance with physical science

  A    few years later Professor Forbes commenced his researches
among the Alpine glaciers.                His “Travels through the Alps'
was published        in 1843, and contained           greater amount  a        well                           of
arranged information respecting glacial phaenomena than perhaps all
other works together                on

viscous mass would move along a trough inclined at a small angle
to the horizon; and, moreover, it was obvious that the general mass
of a glacier did so change its form as to accommodate itself to the
changing dimensions of the valley down which it moved.
    On the other hand, it was contended that a substance so hard and
brittle as glacial ice could not be said to have the property of visco
sity, and that the different velocities of the central and lateral por
tions of a glacier, and the changes of form which the general mass
might undergo, were more attributable to the formation of crevasses
and to discontinuous ruptures of the mass, than to any continuous
change of form in each infinitesimal portion of                       like that which     it,
takes place            in

this view was       partly   true was     obvious,   since   ruptures    and crevasses
were actually formed by the unequal motions                      different portions

the mass.        Those who maintained this latter view held that the

Since this was written, several observations had been made by dif

over its bed.      Dr. Tyndall has recently observed proof of this latter
motion in various parts of glaciers as well as near their lower extre
mities; and all the phaenomena of polished and striated rocks indi
cate most clearly that such motion must have existed in the ancient
glaciers to which such phaenomena are referred.                But how was it
conceivable that a      glacier  should thus slide over a surface on which
there must be many and considerable inequalities, and at inclinations
sometimes not exceeding 2° or 3° 2 And if it did thus slide, how
was it that it did not move, as bodies ordinarily move down inclined
planes, with an accelerated motion ? These questions were frequently
dwelt upon formerly.         They were completely answered by the expe
riments made      by  Mr.  Hopkins,    and described by him in the ‘Trans
actions’ of this Society in 1844 (vol. viii. part 1), and in his first
letter “On the Motion of Glaciers,” dated November 19 of that
year, and inserted in the Philosophical Magazine.                The motion in
question was not at                 all

There was           conclusive evidence that glacial ice would bear any
considerable extension without breaking, for numberless crevasses
were formed wherever the ice appeared                  subjected       any great

                 a

mass. These facts were not sufficiently explained        the assertion                         by
that glacial ice was viscous.   The true explanation appeared                                                            to

 manifestly some corresponding term was required to designate the

terms as viscous and plastic failed to express adequately the property

glacial motion depended on the facility with which the glacial mass
might change                 its
                    form, the manner      which that change was effected in

supposed to take place by pressure and differential motion, indepen
dently, as far as Mr. Hopkins understood, either of infiltration or
melting of any portions of the ice.
   Both Professor Forbes and Dr. Tyndall had endeavoured to eluci
date the phaenomena of glacial motion by means of a semifluid sub
stance descending down a trough inclined to the horizon.      For the
purpose of ascertaining the direction of greatest extension and com
pression of the substance when thus put in motion, the latter gen
tleman described circles on its surface while still at rest, and ob
served the compressions and extensions of the radii when the mass
was in motion.     He thus found that the lines of greatest extension
were inclined at angles of 45° to the axis of the trough ; each such
line pointing centrally and downwards, or laterally and upwards,
while the lines of greatest compression were perpendicular to them.
In the case of a glacier descending a canal-shaped valley, the former
of these directions would manifestly be that of greatest tension;
and this is precisely the result which Mr. Hopkins had obtained both
by exact mechanical reasoning and by experiment fifteen years ago;
and it   was thus that he was able to explain (and he was the first to
do so)   the formation of crevasses making angles of 45° with the axis
of the    glacier, and directed centrally and upwards, i. e. at right
angles    to the lines of greatest tension.     There was also another
result to which Mr. Hopkins was led by an exact consideration of
the problem, but which he had also elucidated by experiments, as
described in the letters above alluded to in the Philosophical Maga
zine.    There were not only directions of maximum and minimum
pressures and tensions at each point of the mass, there were also
two other directions inclined at 45° to the former, not recognized by
either of the above-mentioned experimenters, in which there is a
maximum tendency to produce the differential motion, to which Prof.
Forbes ascribed an actual rupturing of the ice and consequent forma
tion of the veined structure.       In the directions of maximum and
minimum pressures or tensions, this tendency to produce a differ
 ential motion altogether vanished.      The truth of these results was
just as certain as that of the parallelogram of forces. In more com
 plicated cases than that above supposed of a glacier descending
 down a canal-shaped valley, the absolute directions of these differ
 ent lines would vary with the conditions of the glacial mass, and the
 external pressures to which it was subjected; but the important fact
 was, that there must in all cases exist at each point of the mass a
 direction of marimum tension or of minimum pressure, and a direction,
                   it,
 perpendicular to  of     minimum tension      marimum pressure, and two
                                                 or
 other directions inclined   to  each   ofthe former     45°, along which
                                                           at
 there   is   amaximum    tendency      produce
                                       to         the kind      of
                                                                differential
 motion above described.          Itwas moreover manifest that where
 crevasses were formed there must           be
                                           tension; and equally manifest
 that the directions  of   such crevasses must       least approximate
                                                      at                  to
 perpendicularity with the directions       of
                                           marimum tension, and therefore
 to  coincidence with those  of maximum pressure. Also,        discontinui
                                                                if

 814               Cambridge Philosophical Society           —
   ties and differential motions resulted from these internal pressures
   and tensions, they must be produced in those directions in which
   there is the maximum tendency to produce them, i. e. in directions
   inclined at 45° to those of the crevasses.        All these directions might
   be  supposed   to be (as   they  would    generally  be in a glacier) nearly
   horizontal. These       conclusions,   Mr.  Hopkins   repeated, were as cer
   tain as that of the   parallelogram    of forces, and no theory which con
   tradicted them could     possibly  be true.
      Professor Forbes was the first to recognize the law which esta
   blishes a certain relation between the veined structure and the cre
  vasses.     He asserts that, as a matter of observation, the crevasses
  intersect the structure at right angles; consequently the blue veins
   must be perpendicular to the directions of maximum pressure, and
  could not coincide (such being the law) with the directions in which
  differential motion must necessarily take place, if it should take place
  at all. The law above enunciated exactly accorded with the conclu
  sions above stated, and also with Dr. Tyndall's views, who asserts,
  from his own observations, that the laminae of blue and white ice
  (and especially in those places in which the structure originates)
  conform to the law of perpendicularity to the direction of greatest
 pressure.     So far from there being any tendency to produce ruptures
  and fissures lying in the planes of the laminae in these positions,
  they were the only positions entirely free from such tendency. And
  hence it became so difficult to conceive how the laminated structure
  could possibly originate in actual discontinuities such as those to
  which Professor Forbes had ascribed them, whether we suppose the
  blue laminae to be produced by subsequent infiltration or any other
 process.
      According to Dr. Tyndall's views, the law stated in the preceding
 paragraph was an essential consequence of physical causes, to which
 the production of the laminae was referred.           He had shown, experi
 mentally, that if a piece of ordinary ice be subjected to direct pres
 sure, it will melt along fine lenticular laminae perpendicular to the
 direction of the pressure.        A similar process is supposed to take
 place in the névé, or in any part of the glacier where the structural
 laminae originate.       Professor W. Thomson had offered an explana
 tion of this phaenomenon on thermal principles.             It had been shown
 by himself and his brother that the melting temperature of ice is
                                       if,
 lowered by compression.          Now in       Dr. Tyndall's experiment, the
 ice were   a  perfectly   homogeneous      substance,    every portion would
 be    equally compressed; and   if      the  uncompressed     mass were only
just above the melting temperature, the whole would melt under the
compressing force.          But no substance  is     perfectly homogeneous;
and     consequently    the internal    pressures in   the experiment would
not    be perfectly  equable;    and those    portions  of  the ice which were
subjected    to  the greatest pressure would melt the soonest, and pro
duce the aqueous laminae above mentioned           in   the experiment,or   the
laminae     of blue icein     the glacier.   In    the latter case the laminar
portions must first    be    supposed to     melt, the air-bubblesto    escape,

and the water subsequently to be refrozen to form the blue transpa
rent laminae.
  Mr. Hopkins did not profess to maintain the entire adequacy of
the above explanation of the formation of the laminated structure,
though he could not but feel persuaded that it was founded in truth.
It seemed to explain very satisfactorily the conversion of névé, or opake
white ice, into transparent blue ice; but he did not well understand
how transparent consolidated ice could be converted by pressure
into white opake ice. But still, at the bottom of an ice-fall, as that
of the glacier of the Rhone, the broken fragments were again united
into a continuous mass, and the laminated structure was reproduced
on a type entirely new, and conformable to the altered conditions of
the mass; and, assuming a large portion of the ice descending the
fall to be in a sufficiently consolidated state, the process of recon
struction must consist as much in the conversion of blue ice into
white, as of white ice into blue.                 Mr. Hopkins was not aware
whether this       difficulty  had been       previously  started, or, if so, what
answer had been made to              it.     His  object  was more especially                        to
point out the essential distinctions between Professor Forbes's and
Dr. Tyndall's theories respecting the laminar structure.                    disposi       A

 soning essentially involved         in    the one was totally inapplicable                          to
 the other.      The differences were such                     as
                                                          could not        ignored,       be

 with  a  sincere desire       ofeliciting the truth, and not      the mere spirit

       To the Editors     of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
          GENTLEMEN,
THE first to deduce, from the principles          of thermodynamics, a law
       of relation between the temperature, pressure, density, and latent
heat of vapours, was Professor Clausius, in Poggendorff's Annalen
for 1850.
   By combining an equation substantially identical with that of
Professor Clausius, with a formula expressing the relation between
the pressure and boiling-point of a vapour, a formula is obtained
for computing the density of a vapour from its latent heat, and the
rate of increase of its pressure with elevation of the boiling-point;
as to which see the Philosophical Transactions for 1854, part 1, and
the Number of this Magazine for December 1854.
   In the absence of direct experimental data as to the density of
steam, I used that formula to compute tables of that density for
practical use, which were first published to the extent of a few
copies in 1855, and have since been revised and reprinted.
   On the 20th of September, 1859, the results of the first series of
experiments by Mr. Fairbairn and Mr. Tate, on the density of steam,
were laid before the British Association. So far as I am aware, this
is the first series of experiments on the absolute density of steam at
high pressures that has ever appeared; the experiment of M. Adolphe
Hirn having been a detached one, and those of M. Siemens having
reference to the rate of expansion of steam rather than to its abso
lute density.
   The following Table shows a comparison between the results of
the formula already mentioned, and those of Messrs. Fairbairn and
Tate's experiments. The differences range from              i.  to
                                                                   #

quantities compared, and are all in one direction, the theoretical vo
lumes being the greater.          But this may probably be accounted for by
a difference in the value assumed for the density of water; for in the
theoretical calculation, the unit of volume is the volume assumed by

an interesting subject of investigation at the present time, and

         ON    THE OCCURRENCE                           OF GOLD.            BY DR. F. A. GENTH.

at   aloss    explain the latter satisfactorily, and
               to                                            seems      me that        it                 to

   The gold obtained from the disintegrated diorite                   generally                      is
smooth and rounded,                as

if we observe any cavities in such gold, we find the sharp edges of
crystals, &c. in the same rounded in a similar manner, just as if
the whole piece had been subjected to the action of acids, which in
reality seems to have been the case.        I believe that this is the most
natural explanation, because it tells us at the same time to what
source we must trace the gold which we find in the veins passing
through these formations.
   The greatest difficulty presents itself on inquiring into the nature
of the solvent.             I
                      do not believe it is very probable that the gold
has been carried off as a silicate of gold, or by the action of hydro
chloric acid upon the sulphide.       What seems to me most reasonable,
is that it was dissolved as terchloride of gold.      If we remember that
the decomposition of pyrites, one of the most common accessory
constituents of diorite, produces sulphuric acid, which, in the
presence of the never-wanting chloride of sodium and a higher
oxide of manganese, may liberate small quantities of chlorine, the
most powerful solvent of gold, we have at least a very plausible
                                 -
explanation.
   After penetrating the decomposed diorite, the solution of gold,
passing down the veins, comes in contact with reducing agents and
is reprecipitated again, frequently in crystals or crystalline forms,
I shall, below, make a few remarks about the substances which
precipitate the gold, in veins as well as in beds.
   An almost positive proof that the gold in the veins of the diorite
formation originates from the adjoining rocks, is the fact that the
 deeper the diorite is decomposed, the deeper the gold is found in
the veins, Many of these veins do not contain any gold at 50
feet depth; and I have known veins which were rich near the surface

 have seen other specimens from the same locality, but of inferior
 value and beauty.
    b. The tetradymite from the Tellurium Mine, Fluvanna Co. Va.,
 and the native bismuth from the Peak of the Sorato in Bolivia, S.A.,
 are frequently interlaminated with gold.
     Ihave made some experiments with a solution of terchloride of
 gold and tetradymite, and found that the latter precipitates the
 gold from a dilute solution easily with a smooth and brilliant
surface.
    c. In the upper portion of the ore-bed in the metamorphic slates
 at Springfield, Carroll County, Md., which, near the surface, consists
 of magnetite and at a greater depth of chalcopyrite and other ores,
films of native gold have sometimes been observed coating the
cleavage-planes of magnetite.            On close examination, it can be
perceived that below the film of gold the magnetite is oxidized into
hydrated sesquioxide of iron.
    d. A very striking occurrence of native gold is that where it is
associated with pyrites.        Most of the pyritous gold ores are too poor
for us to form a    positive   opinion   about the form in which they con
tain the   gold,  from    observation;    and many authors are of opinion
that the   gold  may   exist in the form of a sulphide, either by itself or
as a  sulphosalt.     If we take it for granted that the pyrites itself is
the result of the reduction of iron-salts, and bear in mind that pro
tosalts of iron reduce gold instantaneously, we cannot adopt this
opinion.      But even if terchloride of gold should have been precipi
tated by hydrosulphuric acid whilst passing through the vein, it
could not remain in that state for a long time, because moist ter
sulphide of gold in the presence of the smallest trace of an acid is
easily decomposed into metallic gold and sulphuric acid.                 Some
specimens of auriferous albite from Winter's vein, Calaveras County,
California, show beautifully that wherever there is a crystal of
pyrites, small crystals of gold are attached to             it,demonstrating
that the sulphate   of   iron precipitated the gold previous           to   its
                                                                           own
reduction into pyrites.
   All these facts prove that the gold           carried into the veins from
                                                  is
the adjoining rocks, and that the opinion which considers veins the
source   of  the gold of   alluvial and diluvial deposits and the soil            is
erroneous.
  If   another proof were wanted        to show the fallacy       this idea,
                                                                  of              it
would    be the fact that the    gold  from the soil   oralluvial and diluvial
deposits has rarely the same fineness         asthat from the veins wrought
in  the immediate neighbourhood               the same—the latter being
                                             of
generally less fine.     It   isimpossible therefore that the destruction
of   a portion of   these veins could have furnished the gold               of
                                                                          such

in this case the same    as that given by the solution of Problem III.,
 at least to the first order of small quantities.    But in the circum
 stances of Problem IV., different parts of the fluid move with
 different velocities, the motion being accompanied by condensa
tion or rarefaction. As the excursions of the vibrating particles
of the fluid are supposed to be very large compared with the
diameter of the sphere, this difference of circumstance is taken
into account with sufficient approximation by the factor pi, as is
shown by the foregoing investigation, so far at least as relates to
the hemispherical surface on which the waves are incident. With
respect to the other part of the surface, other considerations have
to be taken into account, as will appear from the following
argument:—
    The value of a”(s—a) found above, determines completely the
pressure on the surface immediately acted upon by the waves,
because the velocity W sin 6 along that surface is impressed at
each instant by the waves themselves.          But the disturbance of
the fluid in contact with the other hemisphere results, not from
the direct action of the waves, but from the momentum of the
fluid in the plane through the centre of the sphere perpendicular
to the direction of their incidence.      Now it may be asserted ge
nerally, that the sum of the pressures produced on the surface of
the sphere in a given time is proportional to the sum of the mo
menta of the fluid which passes the above-mentioned            plane in
the same time. But if during the transit of the condensed por
tion of a wave across the plane the sum of the momenta be
X. MWC1 +a), during the transit of the rarefied portion the sum
of the momenta will be 2. MWCl—a), taking effect in the con
trary direction. The former of these quantities exceeds the other
by 2X. MWo), which varies as W*, because a varies as W. Hence
there will be a residual pressure, varying as the square of the
velocity of the fluid, and acting in the direction contrary to that
of the propagation of the waves. This important inference ad
mits of the following more particular investigation.
    In  the solution   of Problem II., reasons were given for con
cluding that, in the case of a uniform stream, the velocity of the
fluid in contact with the sphere is W sin 6 for both hemispheres.
In the case of incident waves, the velocity has this same value
for the first hemisphere, and, from what has been argued above,
approximately this value for the surface now under consideration.
To obtain the complete value for the latter, it must be considered
that the disturbance is propagated from the plane perpendicular
to AA' through the centre of the sphere, and that the velocity at
A! is zero.     Hence, in consequence of the confluence of the lines
of motion    along  the surface, there will be at this point a partial
reflexion of velocity, so much the greater as the curvature of the

                                          of Attractive            Forces.                                        329
surface is less.To the approximate value of the velocity a term
must therefore be added, which vanishes if W be constant, and
also at the points where                       6–0 and             6= #.               These conditions are
all   satisfied        by   the following expression for the velocity,
                                 W sin                             in           cos    6,

These values   of W' and U' make V'rd6+ U'dr an exact differential.
The value of V', applied to the motion of fluid in contact with a
sphere, is of the same form with respect to 6, as the term added, in
the previous part of the reasoning, to W sin 6, to express com
pletely, to the first order of small quantities, the velocity of the
fluid along the hemispherical surface opposite to that on which

IF liquid,

             be inverted, the liquid will remain suspended by the
pressure of the atmosphere, provided the cohesion of the particles
of the liquid at the lower extremity remains unbroken; but if
the cohesion of these particles be broken, the liquid will be dis
charged from the tube with a velocity depending upon the dia
meter of the tube and its inclination to the horizon.            From an
extensive series of experiments with tubes varying from 3 inch
diameter to 12 inch diameter,          have found that for      I     tubes                                all

   When the tube          held        horizontal position, the liquid,

       Dr. Schunck            on the Phaenomena                 of   Fermentation.               341
ments which         I had made          of the ferment of madder
                                        on the action
on sugar. These experiments were undertaken in order to ascer
tain whether this ferment, which I call erythrozym, and which in
several respects differs very widely from other ferments, would
have the same effect on sugar as ordinary ferments, such as yeast.
Now   I discovered among the products of this process of fermen
tation, besides alcohol and carbonic acid, a small quantity of an
acid having the properties and composition        of succinic acid; and
as the formation of this acid from      sugar   had until then not been
observed,  I  was led to believe that it was characteristic of the
particular process of fermentation induced by erythrozym. To
M. Pasteur belongs the merit of having discovered that succinic
acid uniformly makes              its
                              appearance along with alcohol and car
bonic acid     inordinary fermentation. That this discovery was,
however, not entirely unanticipated, will          evident from the fol

the crust, the under surface of which is supposed to be uniform.
This segment of the crust is not only treated as a nearly flat
plate band, but great inequalities of thickness are assumed; and
the problem is thus invested with circumstances from which it
readily follows that a very thick crust becomes necessary in
order to compensate such remarkably weakening conditions. As
we know that the first of these conditions is decidedly incorrect,
and that the other at least is wholly unsupported by facts, we
cannot be expected to admit the conclusion to which they would
lead.” (P. 25.)             -

to rise, there being only the low Sewalik Range to the south.
The diagram represents a meridional section of the mountain
mass through Dehra. A B is about 140 miles, or 2 degrees; BC
is about 230 miles, or 34 degrees: take CD equal to A B. The
southern mountain slope A B rises from A gradually to a height
of 15,000 feet at b, the intervening space abounding in peaks of
20,000 feet and more.     From b to c is the vast plateau, which
Colonel  Strachey   places at an average height of 15,000 feet
above the sea.   The northern slope from c onwards is not so

the crust to open at u and S, and to turn about O.
   The weight of each portion of the ocean tends downwards
towards the centre of the earth; and the buoyancy arising from
the deficiency of that weight equals the difference between the
weights of the same bulk of rock and sea-water, and tends up
wards towards the zenith of the place.          As sea-water is about
half the density of rock (in fact it is less), this difference will
equal the weight of a mass of rock, of which the volume is half
that of the ocean under consideration. The moment of this
force about O is the force multiplied by the perpendicular from
O upon           its

of pressure         on
              the lava under the mountains     communicated                          is                         to
the lava under the ocean-bed, and increases the upward pressure
there, and vice versd.

maintaining their elevation and the ocean-bed continuing unal

otherwise this state of things could not exist. If the advocates
of the theory that the crust has expanded in becoming solid say
that I have considered the weight of m r in my first diagram too
great, what will they say of the density of us in my second dia
gram     In order to nullify the buoyancy, the density ought to
be greater than that of the crust under the continent.     But by
what process could it become denser, if it became at first lighter
in becoming solid 7
   13. Another means of determining the inferior limit of the
thickness of the crust, seems to be suggested by a consideration
of the varying pressure the attraction of the moon and sun must
cause the fluid in the interior of the earth to exert against the
crust. If the crust were very thin, this varying pressure might
cause it to crack.   In the following calculation I show that, to
resist the force caused by the moon alone, the crust should be at
least 100 miles thick.    The force of the sun is to that of the
moon as 2 : 5.     Hence to counteract their combined effect at
new moon, the thickness should be at least 140 miles.

of friction to be overcome before such a plug could be forced out,
that we cannot draw any inference from the formula. There
would indeed be friction in every case where 8 is less than 2, and

which the calculation leads.                                J. H. PRATT.

         cially with impure or commercial metals, the results ob
tained have been such that it has been impossible to solve the
important question, Are alloys and amalgams chemical mixtures
or compounds          It is with the hope of throwing some light on
this  subject    that we have for the last two years been engaged in
examining comparatively some of the physical properties, such as
the conductibility of heat, tenacity, hardness, and expansion of
alloys and amalgams made with pure metals, and in multiple and
equivalent quantities, as follows:—

    By this method      we have succeeded in ascertaining, first, the
influence which each additional equivalent quantity of a metal
 exerts on another; secondly, the alloys which are compounds and
 those which are simple mixtures; for compounds have special
 and characteristic properties, whilst mixtures participate in the
 properties of the bodies composing them. This method of                in
 vestigating alloys and amalgams has enabled us to ascertain
 which metals combine together to form definite compounds, and
 those which, when melted together, only form mixtures.              Thus,
 for example,     bronze  alloys   are definite  compounds,  for each alloy

   The same fact is also observed in the expansion or contraction
of these alloys. Whilst, on the contrary, the alloys of tin and
zinc, being mixtures, conduct heat, have a specific gravity, and
expand according to theory, or the proportion of tin and zinc which

   We shall divide our      researches on the specific gravity of alloys
and   amalgams    under two heads: first, those which have a higher
specific gravity than indicated by theory; and secondly, those
which have a less specific gravity, or expand.
   I. Alloys   which have     a    higher specific gravity than indicated
by theory.     Results:—
   * The principle upon which the theoretical conductibility, specific gra
vity, and expansion are calculated, is similar to that followed with respect
to hardness, for which see page 4 of our paper “On Hardness.”

  These researches reveal two important facts: first, that there
is one metal the alloys                              of
                            which always contract, viz. those                                                                 of

                    the amalgams expand        have    less specific                     or
gravity; secondly, that the maximum expansion           contraction                                    or a

                                                     of
   tin and zinc. But this arises no doubt from the fact that
all of

A  at *   the Meeting             of     the British Association    Aberdeen, Sept. 20, 1859.
                                                                                  at

360                      Mr. R. Campbell               on the     Uniformity
uniformity usually exhibited by classes of phaenomena—such as
not only births, deaths, marriages, but such things as those ap
parently depending upon mere caprice—such as the number of
letters annually sent without directions through the Post-office,
or those which appear likely to depend on the most capricious
and irregular causes, such as murders and suicides; and he pro
ceeds to draw certain moral conclusions from the fact of this
uniformity, namely, the existence of certain moral laws by which
a section of the community, definite in number, is always im
pelled to such acts.    But before entering upon a discussion of
the legitimacy of such results, there appears to me always a
previous question to be solved, namely, whether the observed
degree of uniformity is remarkable or not.     For supposing the
observed uniformity to be not more than that which might be
expected from events, the occurrence of which to individuals was
conceived of as perfectly fortuitous, the whole argument would
resolve itself into a pure metaphysical question, from which it
would be hopeless to expect any practical issue.
    Ipropose, therefore, the following problem:—To find some
test by which we may ascertain whether a certain observed degree
of uniformity, or the reverse, in tables which give the numbers
yearly occurring of a certain class of phaenomena is to be looked
                                                        I
upon as remarkable or not; and propose the following method
for finding such a test.  Starting from the supposition that we
know nothing except the total number of such phaenomena which
have occurred during a certain number of years,       try                            let   us        to
find the degree   uniformity with which we should expect the
                             be of
phaenomena          distributed through the different years.
                       to                                            the                        If
uniformity observed                  in
                           the real tables    much greater than this,
                                                                 is
we may fairly conclude that there        some cause    this uniformity
                                                        is                  of
which we might hope          discover; and further, that
                                       to                      there                  if             is
any known cause which might tend            produce such uniformity,
                                                             to
we may fairly ascribe such uniformity,          part    least,     in

cause; and             if,
                    the other hand, we found the figures
                             on                                      the                        in
real tables    vary much more widely than we should expect from
                   to
the knowledge      the mere fact from which we started, we might
                             of

remarkable deviation      most likely assignable

   When we come              work out results numerically, we shall

     which it would give us to see such a number in the tables. Why
    is this? Simply because we started with the hypothesis that we
    knew nothing about laws regulating the phaenomena and causing
    either uniformity or variety.     Now this hypothesis was morally
    incorrect in this   respect.   For we knew this at starting, that
    such laws may exist; and if the degree of uniformity or the
    reverse in the real tables present a striking contrast to that which
    we should expect from the result of our hypothesis, we may
    fairly be led to the conclusion that such laws do exist, and that
    our tables justify us in looking for causes to explain their re
    markable features.
       For example, take a=5, b=242, and suppose n large in com
    parison. (These are the figures referred to in Mr. Buckle’s                                                           in

   The numbers for the figures above 242 may easily be similarly
worked out, and will present an appearance somewhat symme
trical with the above.    It will be thus seen that there are about
a dozen numbers, 236 to 248 say,           nearly equally likely   all                                               to
occur with the average one; about thirty which are        least half                          at
as  likely    to
             occur     that one. And the above Table shows with
                                  as
what enormous rapidity the numbers increase when             get far                               we
away from the limit.
    The above figures are      course obtained of   the use    loga                by                   of
rithms;        therefore easy from the logarithms

carbonate of sodium, an intermediate           silicate of sodium,;
Naº Síº 07 or (Na+ SiO4. Naº SiO4). And it will be found that
all non-aluminous silicates which do not contain an excess of
silicic anhydride, may be referred to one or other of the three
types,         M4 SiO4 Orthosilicate = 2M? O. SiO2.

   If we   consider alumina as always basic, then there are silicates
in which the basicity exceeds that of the tetrabasic group; but
the basic or acidulous function of alumina in many minerals is
yet subjudice; and if we exclude aluminous minerals, we shall
find that the tetrabasic are the most highly basic of              known        all
silicates, natural      or
                       artificial.    As illustrating   the existence                 of

     In addition to these comparatively simple orthosilicates, which
 can be readily formulated, there are a great number of complex
 silicates, containing mixtures of several bases, proto-equivalent
 and sesqui-equivalent,     which evidently pertain to the formula
 M*SiO4 or 2M* O. SiO2, because, despite great variations in
 composition, the ratio of the oxygen in the base to the oxygen
 in the anhydride invariably equals 3.           Such, for instance, are

    From the foregoing lists, we perceive that phosphates and sili
cates are strictly comparable with one another.           But a compa
rison of the      phosphoric   acids with their     corresponding  silicic
acids is impossible, from our ignorance of the constitution and
properties of the latter acids, if indeed they have any existence.
But we should not, I think, expect to observe any decided differ
ences in the three modifications, seeing that even in the phos
phoric acids, despite the facilities afforded by their soluble con
dition, the distinctions are not of a highly characteristic kind.
We might even speculate upon what our knowledge of the
varieties of phosphoric acid would now have been, if the ortho

phosphate of silver had chanced to be of a white, instead of                               a
yellow colour.
    The relations of nitrates and phosphates to carbonates and
silicates respectively are very interesting. Ordinary nitrates and
carbonates correspond to metaphosphates and metasilicates; but,
as we shall presently see, representatives of orthophosphates and
orthosilicates are not entirely wanting.
    The analogy of composition between nitrates and metaphos
phates is obvious, the analogy of properties is doubtless slight;
but, admitting them to be comparable salts, we should scarcely
expect to find any striking resemblance between them, seeing
that nitrogen is so widely separated from the other members of
 its family, precisely     are fluorine, oxygen, and carbon from
                               as
the other members          of
                        their respective families:—
       Fluorine         Chlorine, bromine, iodine.
       Oxygen           Sulphur, selenium, tellurium.
       Nitrogen         Phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, bismuth.
       Carbon           Silicon, titanium, &c.
   Now,     accordance with the general law, that binary hydrides
            in
yield ternary    ox-acids containing the same number
                   or                                    hydrogen             of
atoms,      we
            should   expect that  ammonia,      the ter-hydride
                                                              or                           of

PH", would, like that body, yield terhydric acids and terbasic

                                    is                    the case;      to

 we may term orthonitrates, M*NO", that     quadroxidized com is,

             metallicized ammonias.      We are acquainted with
great variety     basic nitrates, and among them some may

mula (M* O. MNO”)           M*NO". But we know that basic salts
                                or
comprise salts formed under very various circumstances, modelled
upon different types, and having little                       in
                                                  common with one

special properties, distinguishing them from the ordinary run

                                               in

    Moreover, precisely as there are intermediate quadribasic
 phosphates, or pyrophosphates, with seven atoms of oxygen, so
 ought there to be intermediate quadribasic nitrates with seven
 atoms of oxygen; and we have, at any rate, one marked example
 of this class of salts, in the ethyl-nitrate of mercury, Hg"Et N°07,
 analogous to sodio-pyrophosphate of copper, Cuº Na P" O7, and
 to double pyrophosphates in general.          To this class may also be
 referred two soluble crystalline mercurous and mercuric salts
 having the respective formulae (Hg2)” HN° 07 (Gerhardt) and
 Hg" Nº O7.2H2O (Mitscherlich).
    The most highly basic class of carbon salts that we usually
 admit are the carbonates, M*C0°, bibasic salts analogous to the
 sulphites, M*SO°, precisely as the most highly basic nitrogen
 salts that we usually admit are the nitrates, MNO”, monobasic
salts analogous to the chlorates, MC10°.            But precisely as we
obtain an orthonitrate, M*NO", analogous to a normal phos
phate, by adding an atom of protoxide to a nitrate, so do we
 obtain an orthocarbonate, M*CO", analogous to a normal sili
 cate, by adding an atom of protoxide to a carbonate.           We are
acquainted with a considerable number of well-defined ortho
 carbonates, constituting, in fact, the class of salts usually known
 as dicarbonates, of which the following are examples:—
    Caº CO4               Dicarbonate of calcium. Half-burnt lime.
    Caº CO". Hº O Hydrated dicarbonate of calcium. Disinte
                             grated lime.

    Pb°CO". HºO Hydrated dicarbonate of lead. Crystalline.
                             (Yorke, Bonsdorff.)
    Cu% CO4.              Dicarbonate of copper.     Mysorine.
    Cu"CO". H” O Malachite. Crystalline?
    Possibly also certain hydrated salts may belong to this class.
Thus the carbonate of sodium that results from the exposure of
the crystallized salt to the air, may be either a hydro-dicar
bonate, Hº Naº CO", or a hydrated carbonate, Naº CO2. H2O,
&c.
   We are acquainted likewise with a few carbonates, known as
sesquibasic carbonates, containing seven atoms of oxygen, and

                  intermediate in composition between ordinary carbonates and
                  ortho- or dicarbonates, precisely as the pyrophosphates are                                             in
                  termediate between metaphosphates and normal phosphates.
                  Thus Fritzsche has described a carbonate of magnesium having
                  the formula Mg." C* 07.3H2O.           According to Mulder and

mately combine the two combinations; hence a part of pm is

THE“New   Wolatile Organic Acids, from the Berry                   of the Moun
tain Ash.”       By A. W. Hofmann, LL.D., F.R.S.
    Whoever has been engaged in the preparation of malic acid from
the juice of the unripe berries of the Mountain Ash (Sorbus Aucu
paria), cannot have failed to perceive the peculiar powerful odour
evolved during the evaporation of the liquid partially saturated with
lime.     The body to which this odour belongs was hitherto un
 known, and only lately, my friend and former pupil, Dr. George
 Merck of Darmstadt, when preparing malic acid on a large scale,
 conceived the happy idea of evaporating the liquid in a distilling
 apparatus.       He thus obtained an acid distillate, from which he suc
 ceeded in separating an oily body possessed of acid properties.                 To
 the kindness of Dr. Merck I am indebted for an appreciable quan
 tity of this remarkable body, which has enabled me to examine                                           its
 properties and establish             its

   “Further Remarks on the Organo-metallic Radicals Mercuric,
Stannic, and Plumbic Ethyle.”—No. III.    By George Bowdler
Buckton, Esq., F.R.S., F.L.S., F.C.S.
     On resuming my inquiries into the nature of these organo-metals,
I have   met with some interesting reactions, which I here wish briefly
to notice.
   The preparation of mercuric, stannic, and plumbic ethyles, through
the action of zincethyle on various organic and inorganic salts, has
been already detailed in my sketch published in the ‘Proceedings of
the Royal Society”;'     but at that time,  was not able to fix, with I
certainty, the constitution of the compounds which were produced
by acids on the different radicals.    An appeal to analysis now en
ables me to state the following:
                            Mercuric ethyle.
   The reactions of this liquid are well-marked.     Towards sulphuric
and hydrochloric acids it follows the deportment of         homologue                         its
mercuric methyle.    When assisted                           by
                                         gentle heat, one equivalent                                                  of
ethyle   disengaged, which unites with the hydrogen
          is                                              the acid, and                      of
forms hydride      ethyle, whilst the acid takes
                       of                            place, and gives rise        its
to  the corresponding   salt   mercurous    of
                                           ethyle.
   The radical bursts into flame when poured into chlorine gas, and
is almost entirely destroyed; but when         slowly mixed under water
                                                              it      is
with iodine       or
                 bromine,  the disengagement       ethyle gas    scarcely   of                       is
perceived, and iodide        bromide   or  ethyle  may      of
                                                            recovered                    be                          by

  Analysis furnished numbers which pointed to the formula
                           Pb,   C, H, SO,              or Pb, (C, H,), SO,.
All  the salts of this sesqui-ethylated base are volatile, and their
vapours attack the eyes and mucous membrane of the throat.          In
this respect they imitate their homologues in the stannic series.
   In concluding this short abstract, will only express my belief  I
that a wide field of research is still open for inquiry, and that some
promising experiments are at present in hand, from the right under
standing of which we may hope to throw additional light on these
interesting substances.

this, and         he

       In the experiment in which Prof. Matteucci finds what he con
    siders to be the proof of the reversal of the muscular current during
    contraction, he takes a prepared frog's thigh with a long portion of
    nerve attached, and watches the changes of the muscular current
    which is derived from two points of the uncut surface. On laying
    the thigh upon the cushions which form the electrodes of the galva
    mometer, the needle diverges under the current of the relaxed muscle;
    on producing contraction by irritating the nerve with a feeble inter
    rupted current, the needle immediately travels back and passes to
    the other side of zero. The fact is undeniable, but, according to the
    author, the backward movement of the needle does not indicate, as
    Prof. Matteucci supposes, a reversal of the muscular current during
    contraction. There                is,

The interpretation is that the reactions during muscular contraction
are, not between the primary nerve-current and the muscular cur
tent, but between the muscular current and the secondary or induced
currents which may be supposed to spring into existence when the
primary or inducing nerve-current is suspended or renewed.      The
 fact that the nerve-current sinks during contraction, is appealed to
as an argument that the primary nerve-current is actually suspended
and renewed during muscular contraction, and that in this manner
the occasions for the appearance of the secondary or induced cur
rents are thus properly provided for.        It is pointed out that the
reactions between the    uninterrupted  nerve-current and the muscular
 current, and between the muscular current and the induced or se
condary currents which come into play when the primary or inducing
nerve-current is interrupted or renewed, must be altogether different.
With respect to the reactions which take place between the uninter
rupted nerve-current and the muscular current, there is reason to
believe that these must result in mutual intensification, for the nerve
current and the muscular current pass in the same direction. At any
rate this is the case in the hind-limbs of the frog, or the fore-limbs
of the same animal, and in the hind-limbs of the rabbit, dog, cat, and
mouse. With respect to the reactions which take place between the
muscular current and the secondary currents which come into play
when the primary or inducing nerve-current is suspended or renewed,
there is every reason to believe that the result is altogether different.
In this case, it appears as if the secondary or induced current must
involve, not the intensification, but the discharge of the muscular
current in all the muscle which enters into the circuit of the second
ary current.      For what is the peculiarity of the secondary current 7
It is a current of momentary duration, disappearing almost in the
very instant of                its
                       appearing, and carrying along with             dis                          it   in   its
charge any electricity      may meet with it       circuit. Hence there  in   its
is      no
       difficulty    understanding why the galvanometer should afford
                        in
evidence of abatement of the muscular current          the moment when              at

                                            muscular contraction.    Nor

very elaborate investigations, holds that the chemical actions of
muscular respiration are transformed into electricity, and the elec
trical into contractile force; but there is just as good reason for
supposing that the increased chemical action may be required to
keep up the muscular current, which current is being continually
annihilated by the actions which bring about contraction.             And
thus, after all, the increased respiration of muscles which are made
to contract, may refer, not to the contraction, but to the renewal of
the state of relaxation.     At any rate, it is scarcely possible to refer
to this fact as an objection to the view which is set forth in this
paper.

 before the blowpipe.          Carbonic oxide, after slow passage through
 potash solution, and then through sulphuric acid, was next made to
 fill the flask by displacement. Finally, the contracted neck of the
 flask was closed by fusion, and thus the bulb containing sodium
 alcohol was inclosed in an atmosphere of pure oxide of carbon.                 By
 agitation the inclosed bulb was broken, and                contents came  in its

     Comparison of the analysis with these numbers will show that the
 gas was pure oxide of carbon.               Furthermore, if we assume that the
 trifling departure from the theoretical quantities for pure oxide of
 carbon was due to the presence of olefiant gas, and if we calculate
 how much olefiant gas would be required, we obtain a negative value
 for the quantity of olefiant gas from one equation, and a positive one
 from the other equation, viz.:-
     By employing for data the original volume and the carbonic acid
 generated, the value of C, H, is negative.
      Wol.  of C, H,-vol. of CO,-original vol. = –0.82 per cent.
By employing for data the original volume and the contraction, the
value of C, H, becomes positive.
     Wol. of C, H, =# contraction—# original vol. = 1.19 per cent.
This want of conformity shows that C, H, will not satisfy the condi
 tions of the case, and may be regarded as excluding the supposition
 that a trace even of C, H, was present in the gas examined.
    When it is considered that on Dr. Geuther's hypothesis every
volume of carbonic acid absorbed should be replaced by an equal
volume of olefiant gas, and when it is borne in mind that sodium
alcohol and carbonic oxide must have been less perfectly exposed to
mutual action in Dr. Geuther's experiment than in the one just
described,    I think the conclusion cannot be avoided, that that expe
rimenter's formic acid came not from sodium-alcohol, but from
hydrate of soda.
    In a previous experiment            I   failed to obtain propionic acid on
exposing, at 100°C., carbonic oxide along with sodium-alcohol; and
in so far my result agrees with that of Dr. Geuther.
    To resume : at 100° C. sodium-alcohol is without action on car
bonic oxide.

first sight for azurite.  It is separated from the remainder of the
material  by  washing   with cold water, which does not alter it at
all. Its  composition  is represented by the following formula:—
                        CuO, CO2 + NaO, CO2.
   This is the first example of a double carbonate of copper, anhy
drous and undecomposable by water.
   Bicarbonate of potash also furnishes a crystallized blue product,
but this is decomposed by water with great facility.
   In these experiments the tribasic nitrate of copper may be replaced
by any other salt, such as the carbonate; only the alkaline bicarbon
ate must be in excess.
   Experiments to produce azurite by the action of carbonic acid at
high pressures (10 to 14 atmospheres) upon ordinary carbonate of
copper or upon malachite, mixed or not with carbonate of lime, gave
no result.  The carbonates were neither dissolved nor altered.
  Becquerel produced azurite two years ago, but his process differs
essentially from the author's.-Comptes Rendus, Aug. 1, 1859, p. 218.

   In delivering my recent course of lectures, I was led to try some
new experiments upon two points of great interest in electro-physio
logy. I long since showed that an electric current which is trans
mitted across or perpendicularly to the axis of a nervous filament,
does not possess, like a current which traverses the nerve longitudi
nally, the property of exciting it and producing contractions in the
muscles in which the nervous filament ramifies. The importance of
this result, with regard to the still unknown theory of the physiolo
gical action of the current upon the nerves, is easily understood. Un
fortunately the experiment, which may be easily enunciated, is ex
ceedingly difficult to perform in such a way as to lead to a reliable
result. Whenever I have paid attention to this subject, I have always
tried to render the experiment more perfect.           In my electro-physio
logical course I operate as follows.
    Upon a small slip of wood I                         fix
                                          two square plates,            millims.            of        50

placed crosswise touches the paper for a length of 40 or 50 mil
lims. I need not say that when the galvanoscopic frog is a little
weakened, the contraction only takes place at the moment of clos
ing the circuit with the direct current, and that with the inverse
current the contraction occurs at the moment when the circuit is
broken.
   I must remark here, that in reflecting upon the relation, now well
established, between the electro-physiological effects of the current
and its direction in the nerve, the difference in the effects found,
according as the current traverses a nerve in a direction parallel or
transverse to               its
                     axis, becomes almost         theoretical consequence  a                                                        of

for twenty times this length.        This mode          operation answers the

parison well, I employed a process which has always been useful to
me in my old experiments in electro-physiology, and which consists
in the opposition of two muscular elements which it is desired to
compare.     I have killed a great number of frogs poisoned by urari,
at the moment when the first effects of the poison were manifested,
and at the same time I killed a great many similar frogs which had
not been poisoned.      Piles of gastrocnemians taken from healthy and
poisoned frogs, or a healthy and a poisoned gastrocnemian being op
posed, the galvanometer has always indicated a notable differential
current, denoting that the electromotive power of the poisoned muscles
had become much more feeble than that of the healthy muscles.
   If this result be compared with that which obtained long since,    I
with muscles belonging to frogs killed with narcotic poisons, and
which do not exhibit the difference of healthy muscles, we shall be
led to consider that, as I believe is the result of the experiments of
M. Bernard, the action of urari is exerted upon the blood and upon
the nutrition, and consequently upon the function which         accord                   is,

of a year ago, will be found in the second Jahresbericht des
Königl. meteorologischen Institutes which will appear in the

   It was clearly proved by Duprez in his essay, Sur l'électricité
de l’air, to which the Academy of Brussels awarded a prize in
1844, that, in consequence of imperfect insulation, no fixed appa
ratus, such as that lately proposed by Dr. Romershausen, can
ever indicate in a trustworthy manner the true electric condition
of the atmosphere.     The truth of this assertion has been placed
                                    by

immediately surrounding air, but are vitiated by the action of
the conductor leading to the measuring instrument.
   It is well known that it is only since 1844 in Brussels and
 Kew, and for the last few years in Munich, that observations on
atmospheric electricity worthy of the present state of science
have been instituted.    The Brussels observations are imperfect
from being made only once a day, and those at Kew from being
made with imperfect instruments. At Brussels the Munich obser
vations are considered, not unjustly, to be deteriorated by faulty
graduation of the measuring instrument; but this objection ap
plies more or less to the Brussels observations themselves.      In
undertaking similar observations for the Prussian government,
my endeavour was to avoid the errors of the existing observa
tions, and to appropriate as much as possible their good qualities.

the  sphere  and  charging    the measuring instrument; under ordi
nary circumstances, however,          little more than half this time

measuring instrument”; sphere and transferrer were then put
on one side, the angle of deflection a measured, and, with the
exact time t of charging, noted. After some minutes a precisely
similar observation was made, and the angle of deflection b, with
the corresponding time t, noted.     My Table II. (of which more
hereafter), where the quantities and angles stand side by side,
gave the quantities a and 8 which correspond to the deflections a
and b.    The required loss is given by the expression
              (2–3)2 x 5 x 100      (a–8)1000

where  ti-t   represents minutes. Where it appeared advisable, an
observation   with the psychrometer was combined with the elec
tric measurements.
   The first series of measurements, where the intervals amounted
to 24 minutes, gave at once the following numbers correspond
ing to the losses per cent. per 25 seconds :
  2.02, 2:38, 2.84, 1.85, 1.60, 1:19, 1:04, 1:01, 1:00, O-97.
Here, therefore, a pretty regular diminution in the loss of elec
tricity is unmistakeable; some of the following series showed
less regularity. In the loss here under consideration four pieces of
shell-lac are concerned,—two on the carrier of the sphere, one on
the transferrer, and one on the measuring instrument; of these,
however, the ring around the carrier of the sphere being most
important was principally kept in view; the effect of the shell
 lac on the electrometer was known and very small.           In the fol
 lowing measurements, however, the influence of the two remain
 ing pieces of shell-lac was not entirely neglected; that of the
 shell-lac on the transferrer was specially tested several times,
 by charging the instrument from the transferrer alone before
 charging it from the sphere. The ring on the carrier was mo
                                                                    it,

 its  mass, and by  changing        its

the same charge from the sphere, so that the deflections differed
greatly from each other and always diminished.         In the last
series, which extended over 2 hrs. 25 mins., the first deflection
amounted to 76%, and the last to 134°. The Table II., accord
ing to which the calculations were made, is not the Table II. of
Kohlrausch, but one calculated by me, of which more hereafter.
   The last series already shows pretty clearly the proportionality
between the electric loss and the density.       On the following
morning, however, the effect of the drying had again disappeared;
for a series of measurements then gave the following numbers:
  1:03 (5),        1:27 (5),    1:38 (5),   0.97 (5),     1:32 (5)
   1-04 (5), 0.98 (5), 1-11 (5),            0.74 (23),
                                                0.79 (20).
Although the smallness of the last two numbers is partly due to
the greater intervals to which they correspond, yet on the whole
the cause of the irregularity must be sought elsewhere.
   After fruitless endeavours to produee regularity by careful
attention to the shell-lac ring, it was at last withdrawn and re
placed by thin leaves of dried caoutchouc.      The measurements
now gave the following numbers:–
  0.87 (10),       0.77 (14),     0.80 (21),   0.82 (29),     0.98 (24).
Here is tolerable regularity, so that caoutchouc insulates almost
as well as dried shell-lac.  Thick patches of moulded vulcanized
caoutchouc, to whose surface several fibres still adhered, insu
lated much worse.
   Thin and previously dried leaves of gutta percha were next
tried, and found not to be so serviceable as thin dried leaves of
caoutchouc; they insulate worse, and ensure less regularity.      In
fact throughout the whole investigation it was manifest that
regularity in the loss of electricity always accompanies good
insulation.
    Caoutchouc and gutta percha, used in thin plates, have the dis
advantage, however, of becoming partial conductors in a shorter
time after being dried than shell-lac does, and this clearly because
the former expose a greater surface to atmospheric vapours;
nevertheless a string of gutta percha appeared to be a worse
conductor than good shell-lac.
   In order to reduce the influence of the shell-lac to a minimum,
the sphere was suspended by a thin wire insulated by means of
the shell-lac taken from the destroyed ring; the effect, however,
was not satisfactory.   No corresponding regularity was produced
even when the transferrer, in        its
                                    old form, was also taken away,

former ring of brown shell-lac was replaced by one of white.
A remark against Coulomb, made by Riess in his memoir “On
the determination of the Density of Electricity in the Torsion
Balance *,” was here corroborated in a surprising manner. The
first series of measurements on employing the new ring gave the
following numbers.-
0.59 (28), 0:56 (28), 0:54 (29), 0:50 (32), 0:58 (32), 0:56 (51),
the angle of deflection at the same time diminishing from 71}*
to 9°. To give an example of the capriciousness of even this
             I
shell-lac, may mention that after the above measurements were
made the sphere was again charged, without being otherwise at
all touched, when      the first succeeding 34 minutes
                                 in                        loss                                  a             of

0.78 per cent. per       seconds took place, and    the following                       in
 30  minutes   loss    a equal amount.     Why, without the least
apparent cause, should the loss         hour   minutes  in now 1             4                be               so
much greater than that which before took place               hours                           in   3
 20 minutes?
      In   all
           probability some electricity still adhered         the new                        to

                                     it       immediately after beingof
constructed.     On this account the sphere was placed         metallic                       in
connexion with the earth for      eight  hours before  being  used for
measuring the atmospheric electricity; when          used,   few drops           so          a
of rain fell, and the                  air
                          was strongly negatively electric. The last
positive charge which the sphere brought down was allowed                                                      to

             order              to
                       measure the loss.     Three times successively,

                           of

                  F. Dellmann on Atmospheric                   Electricity.                    409
manifested itself; it was only after 4 hours, however, that this
loss increased threefold.   Electricity, then, clearly disperses
drops of water.
   The influence of change of air on the electric loss was next
examined, and it was always found that the loss was unaltered
by carrying the sphere about, provided that it remained in air of
the same constitution.   When carried about in a room wherein
the air was mixed with the moister air of the kitchen, the loss
was a little increased, but it would certainly have also been in
creased had the sphere remained stationary.
    Positive electricity, too, appears to suffer less loss than nega
tive electricity,+a fact easily explained, since the electricity of the
air is generally positive.
    So far the new shell-lac ring has approved itself by giving the
following series of losses after having been moistened and rubbed
dry with clean linen —
    0.53, 0:51, 0:50, 0:51, 0:52, 0:53, 0:55, 0:56, 0.56.
The whole series extended over 3 hours, and the intervals were
almost equal. It will only be necessary to test the ring occa
sionally, and to replace it by a new one whenever it can no
longer be restored by treating it with alcohol or heating it before
 a lamp; the latter expedient generally succeeds perfectly.
    Apart from the intrinsic interest of many of the results, this
 communication on the electric loss will be sufficiently justified
 by   itsprincipal object, -to prove that the insulating power                                      of

                  b. The Measuring Instrument.
   The   measuring   instrument is the one before described, the
construction of which was proved to be excellent in these as in
 allother measurements+.         Nevertheless   slight modification          a
was deemed    advisable;   the small   strip  now quite rectilinear,    is
and      longer
          no    possesses     slit. The arma     the balance    also         of                  is
rectilinear, and therefore hangs over the strip.
    The calculation        new Tables appeared necessary for the fol
                                 of
lowing reasons: first, there          some doubt attending the bending
of  the strip, for the amount          curvature of isnot exactly ascertain
                                                                        is
 able, and the same calculating Tables cannot              applied      differ    be         to
ent   curvatures;   secondly,   the observations         the  battery,  calcuon
lated according        Kohlrausch's Table II., did not agree well with
                            to
each other, and the discrepancy before alluded tof must arise
from the fact that my strip has not the same curvature                    that                   as
of  Kohlrausch’s       lastly,
                           ;   the results           communicated  to   be the                     to

     Inorder      calculate the new Tables, three methods presented
                    to
themselves,      that            of

of  Quetelet         by
                   division        the same quantity
                                            of               electricity over      of
well-constructed spheres, and that, not hitherto employed,                                              of

superintendence; two                   of
                                them had equal radii double that                                        of

employ them.       The third method was           hopefully   employed,    but
did not lead       satisfactory results.

filled. The sensitiveness lost in the new arrangement was quite
unimportant, as it could easily be replaced by a glass thread of
smaller thickness.    During last summer I used a glass thread
27 centimetres long, which received from a battery of 64 zinc

mensions were unimportant,      the distances, on the contrary,
much more so; and further, that of these distances, the one
between the strip and the lower graduated circle was most im
portant, that between the strip and the balance-arm coming
next; the last distance, however, is less important the smaller
the distance between the strip and circle; for the distance
between the strip and arm being great, the following series of
reduced torsions were obtained:—

General Tables, then, can only be constructed for definite                              di
stances; and since no one is likely to be willing to prepare Tables
for a number of such possible distances, each experimenter who
wishes to use the instrument must reconcile himself to the prepa
ration of his own Tables. One might prescribe certain definite                          di
stances and furnish Tables for these, but I am convinced thatevery
one will prefer to construct his own Tables, since the necessary
preliminary experiments are no longer onerous, and the calcula

When the tension remains       pretty constant for some hours, the

                                  the 13th    April  of the fore   of
going year, the following successive values for the tension                        of   an
element were obtained, wherein the bracketed numbers denote
the number of elements:—

   From    these one might imagine that somewhat too high a
value had been given in the Tables to the larger angles; but the
day before the following numbers had been obtained:—
   2.92 (64),   2.91 (80),    2.98 (96),     2.96 (112), 3:00 (128),
   2.97 (144),  3:01 (160),   2.95 (176),    2.95 (192), 3:01 (208),
   2.99 (224),  3:03 (240),   3:09 (256),    3.06 (240), 3-04 (224),
   3.01 (208),  3:00 (192),   3:01 (176),    3-06 (160), 3-04 (144),
   3.05 (128), 3:01 (112), 3:06 (96),        2.91 (80),     2.99 (64),
   3.12 (48), 312 (32), 3:00 (16).
The angle of deflection for 256 elements was 55°, that for 16
elements 3°.
   The Tables by means of which our observations here, on atmo
spheric electricity, are calculated range with tolerable certainty
from 2° to 88°.     In fact the torsions from 5° to 85° could be
measured with a good agreement amongst the results; still for
these extremes it appeared advisable to adopt a particular ex
pedient. Two electrometers which stood close to one another
were charged with the same quantity of electricity, one immedi
ately after the other, that is to say, with the same pole-wire of
the battery. The ratio of sensitiveness of the two instruments
was thus ascertained with tolerable exactitude by a series of
measurements whose angles fell within the limits of the Tables
already calculated, the mean of many calculated values for a
single element being taken. Greater and less numbers of ele
ments were now taken, which with the more sensitive instrument
gave deflections up to 88°, and with the other under 10°.           The
tabular value of the one was then multiplied or divided by the
quotient of sensitiveness, when the product or quotient ought to
give the tabular value for the measured angle of the other.
Lastly, the mean of many measurements was adopted.                  This
method would not have been practicable had the instrument
under the vessel not had almost free space.
   For the instruction of those who may wish to form Tables for
their own instruments, it may be well to notice that the former
assertion*, that the arm of the balance must be straight through
out, is no longer applicable when the angle read off is always on
the same side of the arm as that which was taken when mea
suring the torsions on which the Tables were based. The great
est difficulty attending the construction of the apparatus thus
disappears.    Care must of course also be taken that the direc
tion of the arm does not change very much; for which purpose
it is better to have a brass arm, since the brass wire does not
enter the lamp, and therefore     remains harder.         All the  above

   My friend, Prof. Roeber of Berlin, has had the kindness to
examine     mathematically the theory of the instrument.    His
memoir will also be found in the second Year's    Report of the
Royal Meteorological Institution *.    From his double formula
two new methods of interpolation can be deduced, whose results
differ little from each other and from those obtained by Kohl
rausch's method.    Nearly three years ago Roeber furnished me
with a formula which almost entirely coincides with that since
published for the Munich instrument.

With    the electrometer here employed the last precaution is ne
cessary, even in order to compare later with former numbers in
the case of the glass thread being destroyed.                Coulomb's for
mula, it is true, might serve this purpose; yet Kohlrausch's
proposition to use the tension of the pile for this purpose is pre
ferable, since the method is more practical.              In the following
numbers, therefore, the unit is the tension of an element of a
zinc-copper battery.       With respect to the reduction, the follow

electric under such circumstances.    When rain commences, the
drops are generally negatively electric like the air. In still air
the tension of atmospheric electricity is much less variable than
in strong winds: it varies most quickly when the electricity
passes from the negative to the positive state, or vice versä. At
4:20 P.M. on thc 14th of December, the tension during a very
slight shower of rain was —918.7.      Seven minutes afterwards it
was 0, and the rain had quite ceased. Two minutes afterwards,
when a little rain again fell, it amounted to +41.5; two minutes
after this, however, it rose to 281'4, when rain had ceased.
Three minutes later the tension was 547-5; and after another
 interval of four minutes it rose as high as 831. At 2 P.M. on
 the 15th of December, the tension changed in a few minutes
 from 66.5 to —447-1.            Such examples occur in             months, and     all

It is a fact, however, that when my collecting sphere is con
nected by means of an insulated wire with the electrometer, the
latter always indicates the presence of electricity opposite in kind
to that which the sphere brings down when charged in the ordi
nary manner.        It follows from this, as Peltier, sen. has always
asserted, that the sphere is actually charged by induction and
not by conduction, so that the                     electric.     air

charge      ofbad logic brought against me        Archdeacon Pratt.                                          I
now gladly dismiss the personal question, and turn            the consi                   to
deration of the thickness of the earth’s crust.
I     shall consider the subject under the three points          view                          of            in
which Mr. Hopkins, Prof. Hennessy, and                 myself have ex         I
amined it.
    First. Mr. Hopkins has made two suppositions:—
     A.    That Laplace's law                   of   density     is   the law     of   nature
                                                                                                (**)
this law holding good for both the crust and nucleus.
     B.Having assumed this law, and calculated from                   the                           it
amount         of   lunisolar precession, Mr. Hopkins assumes the small
difference          between the result of calculation and observation                                        to
be   areal difference.
#  The logical inference from these two hypotheses would appear
to    bethat one       other  or  them     erroneous: Mr. Hopkins
                                                of            is
thinks   differently, and reconciles   Laplace's  theory with observa
tion      by
          introducing     fluid nucleus without friction, and
                                   a                                 cal                             so
culates     athickness for the crust         the earth.          of
                                                               am most                   I
anxious        toevery justice
                    do             the ingenuity and skill with which
                                                 to
Mr.   Hopkins    has worked out his problem, but must            allowed          I            be
to doubt whether              any geological value.
                                           of            the first place,          In
                              in it
                                      is
I    do
      not believe      Laplace's law      density; and       of

place, even admitting this law, the omission              friction, and            of
assumption        perfect fluidity
                      of                the molten nucleus, must
                                                        in                                                   be
regarded         as      so    far
                        from the truth                             as
                                                 render the thickness   to

of crust deduced of comparatively little value.                                                     If   the consi
deration of friction be introduced, and Laplace's law of density
be abandoned, the thickness of the earth’s crust might be sup
posed 10 miles as easily as 800 miles.
   Secondly. Mr. Hennessy has found a thickness for the crust
of the earth on the following hypotheses:—
   A. Laplace’s law of density for the fluid parts of the earth.
   B. The specific gravity of the solidified fluid not the same
as that of the fluid, and an assumption of their ratio from some
experiments.
   C. That the outer surface of the earth is not perpendicular to
gravity, and that the small difference between          surface and                              its
that perpendicular     gravity
                                           of to
                                    real difference.          is

   By combinations      the foregoing hypotheses, Mr. Hennessy
obtains various values for the thickness       the earth’s crust, all               of
                                                       no
                                                                                                                   do on
of which              of
             course have     higher  value than the hypotheses
which they rest. The first and third               these hypotheses             of                            I
not admit; but think that much important information might
                                 I
 be obtained                  by
                   well-directed experiments made with reference                                                   to
the second   hypothesis.
   Thirdly. My own investigations            the thickness              on
                                                               the earth’s                          of
crust are essentially sceptical, and were published with the view
of showing that the entire subject requires            many hypotheses,                  so
that  it      little,
             is
             of          any  value      aid

                                     admit that this defect would                                                  be

                                                                would fall                      as  it

to show that Mr.   Hopkins  and Mr.  Hennessy   have each made

 experimental circumstances.   Whether the circumstances of his
 experiments or of mine made the nearer approach to the sim
 plicity assumed in theory, or whether in both there did not exist
 experimental conditions sensibly influencing the result, but of
 such a nature that it would be impracticable to take account of
 them in theory, is a question which at present       think it would I
 be  premature to discuss.     I
                              still adhere to the opinion  I formerly
 expressed”, that the whole question must be subjected to a
 thoroughly searching experimental investigation before physical
 conclusions can safely be drawn from the phaenomena.

    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
 Tur       question as to the proper angle at which dock gates
         should be placed so that the timber employed should yield
 the most favourable result, has often been discussed by mathe
 maticians, and determined as a problem of maa'ima and minima.
 The angle has been found to be 109°28' 16".
    A patient consideration of the properties of the cube and                          its
 partition, has led me    tothe fact that the geometrical solid formed
  by the union    of two cubes, being       dodecahedron with twelve
                                              a
 rhomboidal   faces,  produces angles  affording  the greatest amount
 of resistance.
   The obtuse angle      on
                        the face     this dodecahedron produced
                                         of

                   two cubes       as

 angle which affords the greatest resistance    water pressure

   428        On the Angle    of  Dock Gates and the Bee's Cell.
      The partition of another regular solid body, the tetrahedron,
   effected by cutting off four smaller tetrahedrons, of half the
  length of the base, will leave the platonic or regular octahedron,
  whose eight faces are equilateral triangles—and these faces we
  find incline to each other at an angle of 109°28'16", thus arri
  ving at the same angle, although we make use of two very differ
  ent simple solids—the cube, and tetrahedron. There are other
  curious interchanges, as in the partition of the dodecahedron,
  the trihedral summit forms one-fourth part of a tetrahedron.
      The laws of nature are always simple; we might therefore be
  led to expect that the same angle which is best for the dock
  gates, should be precisely the same as that of the trihedral roof
  of the bee’s cell. The mode of arriving at the angle of the bee’s
        I
  cell have shown in a letter which is inserted in ‘The Literary
  Gazette’ of the 9th of July, and which          I  beg to annex at foot%,

                    (To the Editor of the Literary Gazette.)
     “SIR,-Many years ago you inserted in your journal a paper of mine on
 the subject of an approximate geometrical quadrature of the circle.      That
 approximation    I afterwards succeeded in obtaining to within the     ºrth
 part of the side of the square sought; and the Royal Society, on the 10th
 of May, 1855, so far relaxed the rule adopted with reference to questions
 of this description as to admit the paper to be read; and a short account
 was inserted in their ‘ Proceedings.”
     “I  am now anxious to announce that I have succeeded in dividing the
 cube into several geometrical solids, with which many definite and regular
 geometrical bodies may be constructed.
     “Perhaps one of the most curious is that of the bee's cell, which is in
 fact an elongated dodecahedron; and consequently the angles of the        tri
 hedral roof and base, respecting which so many learned investigations have
 been made, can be no other than those of the true geometrical solid.

 clear to the mind in a popular way.                -         -  -

gonally to the three opposite angles, dividing the cube into three equal and
uniform solids.     Each of these solids being halved, forms a left- and a
right-handed solid. These six solids, though equal in solidity, differ so far
in shape, as three are left-handed and three right-handed, in the same way
as the hands of the human body.
    “Each of the six bodies obtained by the second mode of partition may
be divided into two of equal solidity and of similar shape.     Two of these
bodies, each being one-twelfth of the cube, may be so united as to produce
the pyramid obtained by the first mode of partition. Six of these bodies,
each being one-twelfth part of a cube, may be so arranged as to form the
oblique rhomboid.

solid thus obtained, being the one-twelfth part of the cube.    By this body,

 rial for reflection in connexion with this difficult subject.                                         These
 have an interest alike to the chemist and the physiologist; and
 as so little is really known as to the precise mode in which
 foods perform their function of nourishing the body, any
 additional facts may also have an interest to the practising
 physician.
      I
      purpose to consider the subject in the three following points
 of view. The carbon evolved at any particular moment is derived—
    1st. From the immediate transformation of food containing
 carbon.
   2nd. From the blood, in which it is held free or loosely asso
ciated with a base.

                                      have shown that there is a
uniform and   progressive variation in the quantity of carbonic
acid evolved after each meal.    There is an increase commen
 cing within half an hour after the meal, and attaining          maxi                            its
mum        from two

                                    to      and from this    point the
 decline commences, and proceeds until the next meal. This
occurs after every meal; and with           suitable interval between
                                                            a

certain  period, and   being   connected with the appetite       desire                          or

                               carbonic acid evolved, but     uniform                        a

constant quantity cannot        due         be

   The same objection lies      reference  in     that large quantity
                                                                  to   all

the same           continued through the day
                  as     is                           the absence             in                            of is

   2nd.    I      have proved            that when starch              or    fat   is   taken alone,

                            the Carbon exhaled by the Lungs.                                                431
it does not increase the                         quantity of carbon evolved, or rather
that with starch there is                        a very small increase, and with fat a
corresponding decrease.                          Hence on this theory these substances
have no action; and yet     they must be the chief source of the
supply of carbon to the system.      It is true that by this test,
viz. the absence of effect in increasing the evolution of carbon,
we cannot prove that these substances thus taken are ultimately
resolved into their elements; but we know well that they do
become transformed and take a share in maintaining the evolution
of carbon, for example, to the minimum line above mentioned.
   3rd. There are numerous substances contained in food, which,
when taken alone, cause the evolution of more carbon than they
themselves contain.   Such are tea, gluten, and casein,  the first
causing a maximum increase of from 14 to 24 grains, and the two
latter of 1 grain of carbonic acid per minute, the duration of the
increase existing from one to two hours.
   4th. Other substances, and those which are the richest in car
bon, contain much more carbon than is evolved by the increase
                                                                of all
which they occasion.         Such are           cereals and sugars, both                                       of
which cause        maximum increase

                                                                          hours
                                                                                                  of
                                                                                                  3

     1. Vierordt has shown that increased depth                     inspiration              of

   Also that voluntary increase in the quantity of air inspired,
 whilst the conditions in which the body is placed remain the
 same, causes increase in the quantity of carbonic acid evolved.
   My own experiments support these statements, and have also
 shown that whenever food caused an increased elimination of
 carbonic acid, the respirations were deeper, but not more                                                                fre

       All
       these have reference to a variation in the proportion of
 carbonic acid on the two sides of the capillary membrane.
   2. The action of tea, gluten, and casein, in causing the
 evolution of more carbon than they supply, and of the cereals
and sugar in causing the elimination of only a small part of their
carbon during this period of increase, agrees with this theory;
for this indirector intermediate action is independent of the car
bon contained in the aliment, and may therefore bear no definite
proportion to        Indeed,
                           it.  has been shown above, starch and
                                                       as

       rich    carbon, are almost inert
                      in                  reference   this increase          in                       to
in the evolution of carbon.
        The fact that this effect does not increase pari passu with
       3.
                the dose, supports the theory
                                                                                  in of
 increase         in                                     this indirect action.

434               Dr. E. Smith                on the immediate Source              of
there is a larger increase in the quantity of carbonic acid evolved
in cold than in hot weather, but not in a definite relation to the
degrees of heat.    Thus at a medium temperature of 55° to 60°
F. there is no relation between the temperature and the carbonic
acid; with higher and lower temperatures the relations of the
carbonic acid are inverse, but so that sudden and violent changes
have the greatest effect soon after the long continuance of the
opposite condition, and after prolonged heat the carbonic acid
still declines for a time after the temperature has begun to decline.
   The influence of temperature is next to that of exertion in point
of duration and power, but the precise mode in which it acts is
not yet made known.
   3. The relation between the quantity of carbonic acid and
nitrogen evolved at the same period and under the same influences
point to this theory. It is known that with exertion there is
this relation in reference to the carbon and nitrogen.                  Barral
has shown that it exists in reference to season; and I have proved
that it occurs in the action of tea. It is highly probable that
its existence       universal, but not
                      is                       constant proportion.

like manner an algebraic cone cannot be an indefinite spiral sur

suppose that OP, starting from the position Op, and before it
again comes to coincide therewith, comes to coincide with Op',
then at the same time OP' (without having first come again to
coincide with Op") will come to coincide with Op; the generation
is here complete, and we have a single sheet, which, if the motion
were continued until OP came to coincide with Op, would only
be generated over again.  The conical angle of a single sheet is
necessarily greater than 360°; for OP in coming to coincide
with Op' must describe an angle greater than 180°, and OP' de
 scribing an equal angle, the entire angle is therefore greater than
 360°; in the limiting case, where the entire angle is precisely
 360°, the conical surface is a plane.                It is easy to cut out in
 paper and join together two sectors of a circle so as to form
 therewith a sector the angle whereof exceeds 360°; such a sector
 can then, by joining together the two radial edges, be converted
 into a cone of a single sheet; the generating lines being all finite
 lines equal in length, the curve formed by the circular edge                                          is,

                               have added to the Newtonian hypo
theses two others; viz. that the ultimate atoms of bodies are
spherical, and that they are acted upon by the pressure of a
highly elastic medium pervading space. The existence of such
a medium is almost demonstrated by the undulatory theory of
light. It is supposed that this medium is always and everywhere
equally in action, but that          action becomes perceptible only

further half of the sphere is not directly caused by the waves,
but results from the momentum of the fluid which passes that
plane. But the sum of the momenta of the condensed portion
of a wave is greater than that of the rarefied portion. Hence the
expression for the pressure (a’s) on any point of the further he
mispherical surface must contain a term involving q, not wholly
periodic, and as the condensation prevails the non-periodic part
must be positive. In fact it was shown that the above value of
W conducted         to an expression           for   a*(s-a), which contains the

   Again, from the reasoning of the former article, it appears
that q is independent of the radius of the atom.        For it was
found that whether or not the effect of the   spherical surface in

that q in the above expression for W is independent of c.
   We are now prepared to draw some general conclusions re
specting the permanent motion of translation of a spherical
atom submitted to the action of the assumed series of waves.
The expression for the part of the pressure which causes such

   1. According to an hypothesis already stated, the ultimate
atoms of bodies differ in size, but not in intrinsic inertia. Nor
can one atom be said to be denser than another, because density
                                           *
is a quantitative quality of bodies, depending wholly on their
being aggregations of atoms. Hence the quantity of inert matter
in   the atom       of   radius   c   is        Consequently, dividing the above
value     of   the pressure       by   this quantity,        it    will follow that atoms
of   different magnitudes are equally accelerated.
      From hydrodynamical principles

             the waves, does not vary
                                                                                   of to
breadth                                with the distance      which
they are propagated from the origin. The phaenomena            light
exhibit, according     the undulatory
                            to         hypothesis, actual instances
of this law.    Hence the acceleration                   of
                                           the atom varies       mº;                  as

 448              Prof. Challis  on the Force of Gravity.
 but by the same principles m varies inversely as the distance
from the origin of the waves.           Hence the acceleration varies
 inversely as the square of the distance.
    Also if there be several series of waves propagated from the
same centre, having different values of m and A, the condensa
tion and velocity resulting from them at a given point are
expressed to the first order of small quantities by a function of
the form
            m sin
                    (***) + m'sin (#42) +&c.
But, from what has been shown, the pressure which gives to an
atom a permanent motion of translation, depends on the non
periodic part of the square of this expression, and therefore
varies as Am”--Bm”--&c.           Hence, as each of the quantities m,
m', &c. varies inversely as the distance from the centre, it follows
that the acceleration of an atom produced by a compound series of
waves emanating from a centre, varies inversely as the square of
the distance   from the centre.
    3. By the mathematical theory it is shown that there is no sen
sible dynamical action between the medium and the atom if
the latter move uniformly, the pressures on opposite hemi
spheres just counteracting each other.         Also if the motion be
variable, and the variation be extremely slow compared to that
of the vibratory motion of the particles of the medium, no
sensible action of the medium on the atom results from this
motion, because such action could only be expressed by means
of a periodic function in which X is immensely large compared
to the A of the waves.          Consequently the acceleration of the
atom is independent of the acquired velocity.
    4. In waves for which A is very small, the dynamical action
depending on the first power of m may be very great, because the
principal term of the first order in the value of       a” (s—a), viz.
3.
    -
      gy cos    0, contains A  in the denominator. On this account,
since action and reaction must be equal, the vibratory motion of
the waves of light in transparent substances may be greatly       im
peded by the mean counteraction of the inertia of the atoms, and
the rate of their propagation be consequently diminished. . But
as the above expression for waves 1 foot in breadth, m being
given, has only motºrinth part of the value it has for waves
of light, it is quite possible that that expression may be extremely
small for waves having much larger values of m and A than those
of light-undulations.      In that case they would be transmitted
through solid bodies without sensible alteration of character, or
retardation of the rate of propagation. Thus each individual of

 that the hypotheses on which the reasoning rests cannot be con
 sidered as established, unless the laws of the other physical
 forces are deducible from them in a similar manner.
    It may be urged against this theory, that if such be the
modus operandi of gravity, some distinct indication of it might
 be expected to be given by phaenomena.      With reference to this
point I remark that, if the rate of propagation of large waves
through the interior of the earth be in a very small degree less
than in free space, the form of the large inequalities of the
 earth's surface will have an influence on the direction of gravity.
 The normals to the fronts of the waves will be made to incline
 towards high ground; and, in particular, the normals about a
 small island in the midst of a large ocean will incline towards its
 centre, and there produce an abnormal excess of gravity.      And
even if there be no difference between the exterior and interior
rates of propagation, the waves must undergo a sudden diminu
tion of eondensation and rarefaction on emergence from the
surface of the earth, in consequence of the space in the interior
being partly occupied by the matter of the atoms; the effect of
which change on the directions of the normals, as affected by
the form of the surface, will be the same as that just described.
It is certainly remarkable that the local irregularities of gravity
which have chiefly attracted notice are precisely of this kind.
The excess of gravity in insular oceanic positions was long since
a matter of observation; and recently Archdeacon Pratt has shown
that the plumb-line in India inclines from the zenith towards
the Himalaya range, after the effect of the attraction of the
elevated regions has been allowed for.
    Again, the mathematical theory seems to indicate that, if the
approximation were carried further, the law of gravity would be
found to be expressed by such a function as                                 +         A being
                                                                      #          #.

and Jupiter, would, so far as it is a law, indicate that there is
no planet nearer to the Sun than Mercury, because, the di
stances according to that law being a, a +b, a + rb, a + r*b, &c.,
the quantities a and b are determined by the distances of Mer
cury and Venus.
   It may also be remarked that, if the law of gravity be absolute,
there is no security for the stability of a system of stars, whether
the system be the Milky Way or a nebulous cluster; for, how
ever small the mutual attraction between the constituent bodies
may be, in the courseof ages it must produce a general move
ment towards the central or densest region. But the forms of
the Milky Way, and of certain nebulae (as that of Orion) seem
to present an utter contradiction to any such tendency.        Ac
cording to the theory of gravity    have      I
                                           proposed, although  the
ordinary law may be exact through the solar system and far
beyond, there must be distances at which the condition that the
excursions of the vibrating particles of the aether are large com
pared to the dimensions of the atoms, ceases to be fulfilled.  In
that case the attraction changes to repulsion. Thus neighbour
ing stars may be repulsive to each other, while the action of the
accumulated waves of the whole system upon outlying stars is
attractive. The stability of the system would thus be secured
 in a manner analogous to that in which, according to the view                          I
have taken of molecular forces, the constituent atoms of bodies
are held                            This theory would receive

confirmation if the proper motions of stars should be found
to be periodic.
   It    will be perceived that the theory assumes that   bodies                all
are centres        of large and constant magnitude, which may

time, it solidifies to a white crystalline mass, which is bitartrate
of potash, without any admixture of saccharate of potash.
   In a paper by Kellerº on the constitution of scammony, which
he had already recognized as a glucoside, this chemist obtained
the following results, which are partially corrective of those he
had formerly obtained.
   A solution of purified scammony is digested for some days
with sulphuric acid, or saturated with hydrochloric acid.       On
mixing this solution with water, fatty crystalline laminae sepa
rate, and the solution, on continued standing, deposits well
formed crystals. On being purified and fused, they present the
appearance of a radiating mass.     This substance is insoluble in
water, but dissolves in alcohol, and is neutral to test-paper.    It
fuses at 37° to 38°C.     It gave, on analysis, numbers which
correspond to the formula C*H*O".

   This neutral body is decomposed by treatment with alcoholic
potash.    On the addition of sulphuric acid to the potash solu
tion, a substance separates in white flakes, which melt under
water to oily drops, and           to a radiant crystalline mass.
Its fusing-point is 60° to 61°  C.;  it is soluble in alcohol, with
an acid reaction.   Its formula, deduced from that of its silver
salt, is C30 Hº O6.
   The other product of the action of alcoholic potash is a neu
tral body which appears to be an alcohol. It is a fatty substance,
fusing at 40°, and has the composition C*H*O”.
   The above neutral substance hence appears to be a compound
ether, and      its
               formula would      C*H*O°, according

458   Prof. Scheerer on the Separation of Lime and Magnesia.
it ought to increase in weight 3-5 per cent, on being heated in
the air and converted into sesquioxide; but in fact it lost weight.
Wöhler thinks, therefore, that it contains an admixture of some
binoxide of chromium, CrO3.
   The method of separating lime from magnesia by means of
oxalate of ammonia, is not available where only small quantities
of lime are present.  In a solution of magnesia containing 1 per
cent. of lime, oxalate of ammonia produces no precipitate.
The following method, which was originally given by Rose, is
recommended by Scheerer* as being accurate for the detection
and separation of small quantities of lime. Both the earths
converted into sulphates are dissolved in water, and alcohol
added with continued agitation      until a faint but permanent tur
bidity results. After standing some hours,           the lime     preci
                                                                  all                 is
pitated     gypsum, which
            as                  filtered, and washed with
                                          is                    mixture           a
of alcohol and water. When too much alcohol                added, some     is
sulphate     of
             magnesia      precipitated.
                                is             this case the sulphates
                                                           In
may   be redissolved and    reprecipitated  with alcohol,      the lime          or
precipitated with oxalate        ammonia; the magnesia not being
                                          of
present     excess does not prevent
            in                                       its
                                           precipitation.
   By this method Scheerer detected small quantities            lime              of         in
some magnesian       minerals with which                     he

                            magnesium.      The results obtained gave

                                       the following experiment.
                                      as   is
A  small Hessian crucible containing some crystallized silicon
was placed         larger crucible, the interstices packed with
                  in   a

tufts of a white, finely crystallized substance.   All the various
parts disengaged ammonia when fused with potash.
    The mass still contained unchanged silicon: this was removed
by treating it with chlorine, which converted it into chloride of
silicon without altering the nitride of silicon.
    When this nitride of silicon was heated in a stream of aqueous
vapour and carbonic acid, it was slowly decomposed with forma
tion of carbonate of ammonia and amorphous silica. Nitride
of silicon, prepared from the chloride, is decomposed by water at
                                                    -
the ordinary temperature.
   When crystals of silicon are heated in an atmosphere of moist
chlorine, they are changed into pseudomorphs of silica.
    Next to oxygen, silicon occurs to the greatest extent in nature;
and it is surprising that it does not occur in the free state, inas
much as it is not oxidized by oxygen even at a white heat.        As
the above experiment shows, it unites directly with nitrogen.
If  we may adopt a geological fancy, we might suppose that at
the period of the formation of our planet, when the elements
combined to form the compounds which now constitute            crust,                         its
the silicon combined with the nitrogen, and the ignited nitride
of  silicon coming       contact with water, was decomposed into
                                in
silica and ammonia.           this manner ammonia was formed,

rifield, Esq.
  If   in   common trigonometry                    we     take one arc equal                 to   the sum        of

two others, the cosine of the first   are is equal to the product of the
cosines, diminished by the product of the sines of the other two.
  If  we pass from the circle to the ellipse, the addition of the arcs
becomes more complicated, the product of the sines being multiplied
by a radical.    This relation was first obtained by Euler as the inte
gral of a differential equation.                      I
                                      have called it elsewhere, for con
venience, the elliptic equation between three amplitudes.     Moreover,
we are no longer able to take the simple sum of the arcs, but we have
to add in an algebraic quantity, which is a multiple of the products
of the sines of the three amplitudes.
   The comparison of hyperbolic arcs hitherto has been matter of
still greater complexity, as it has been usually handled simply by
reducing each hyperbolic arc to two elliptic arcs. The complexity,
of course, is thus doubled.
   It seemed to me, however, that the ellipse is so completely the
analogue of the hyperbola, and that it is so easy to pass from one to
the other by an imaginary transformation, that a similar analogy
ought to pervade the comparison of their arcs.          Hence that there
must exist some formula for the comparison of hyperbolic arcs, as
simple as that for elliptic arcs.
   A slight modification of Jacobi's second theorem has enabled me to
find the analogue which       required.         I
     If
      we take Euler's elliptic equation, and substitute the following
changes,<
           cosine of amplitude into secant of amplitude,
           sine of amplitude into tangent amplitude x V-1,
           sine of modulus into cosine of modulus,
we leave the equation entirely unaltered, except in form.                  Even this
form may be obtained directly by a simple transformation, of purely
algebraic character.         Hence it follows that            the consequences   all                     of
this  imaginary     transformation are allowable.

   By the help of my formula,                    I
                                    have succeeded in reducing the case
where the parameter   is negative  and greater than unity. The steps
are the mere  counterpart   of  Legendre's  work in the second  supple

ment of the treatise on  Elliptic  Functions.
   Both Legendre's case and mine are of the logarithmic form, and
can therefore be reduced to one another by algebraic transformation.
The cases where the parameter is positive, or negative and interme
diate between unity and the square of the modulus, are still unre
duced.   The difficulty is exactly analogous to that between the two
cases of cubic equations, and this analogy is even carried into the
very form of the solution.
   Dr. Booth's application of the trigonometry of the parabola to the
reducible case of the cubic equation, affords some hope that a corre
lative calculus may exist, particular cases of which may solve the
cases now irreducible, just as the calculus of elliptic functions in
cludes the trigonometry both of the parabola and the circle.       My
own investigations on this subject are still without any useful result.

  from glycol, an aldehyde of the composition of acetic acid or of the
  formula C, H, O, may be produced.       Glyoxal, obtained by the oxida
  tion of ethylic alcohol, has indeed the composition corresponding to
  the above formula and the characteristic properties of an aldehyde.
  Nitric acid converts it rapidly into oxalic acid. Consequently glycol,
  glyoxal, and oxalic acid bear a similar relation to each other as ethylic
  alcohol, aldehyde, and acetic do.

 Another connexion      between glycol and glyoxal is that they both pro
 duce  glycolic  acid, the former by oxidation, and the latter by combi
 nation with one atom of water.        I treated glycol, which was diluted
 with  water,  with  fuming  nitric acid at about 30° C., and evaporated
 the acid  liquid,  as soon as the action was completed, on the water
 bath until it assumed the consistency of syrup”. This residue was
 found to contain, as previously shown by Wurtz, oxalic and glycolic
              I
 acids; but also found therein glyoxylic acid and a body which com
 ported itself with some reagents like glyoxal.         Want of material,
 however, prevented              to its
                           being identified with the latter.

Since both acids are easily oxidized, the one to carbonic, and the
other to oxalic acid, we may say that, with regard to composition,
formic acid stands to carbonic acid in a similar relation as glyoxylic
acid does to oxalic acid.

                                plus water.
     But with regard to other properties, these acids do not correspond
to      other: thus formic acid is monobasic and carbonic
     each                                                                         acid    biba
sic, whilst both glyoxylic and oxalic acids are biatomic.                           Further,
the latter two are derived from the same alcohol, which is not the
case with carbonic and formic acids.     Amongst the products of the
oxidation of glycol occurs also glycolic acid, which is produced from
glyoxal by the assimilation of water.

Some regard glycolic acid (C, H, O,) as a bibasic acid.     According
to this view, it would stand to glycol as acetic acid does to common
alcohol.             C, H, O,             C, H, O

                               Glycolic acid.             Acetic acid.
 But with this view the capacity of saturation of glycolic acid does
 not agree. For according to our present experience, if we adopt the
 formula C, H, O, it evidently combines only with one atom of base.
 Before we have discovered compounds represented by the general
 expression C, H, M.O.,              I
                            think we are not justified in placing glycolic
 acid in the same relation to glycol as we do acetic acid to common
 alcohol.  According to our present knowledge, this position must be
 assigned to oxalic acid.
    We can represent to our minds the derivation of glycolic acid
 from acetic acid in the following manner.     If in acetic acid one atom
 of hydrogen be replaced by peroxide of hydrogen, we obtain a body
  which has the composition of glycolic acid.
                     C, H, O,       =acetic acid.
                               C, H, (HO) O,-glycolic acid.
 But, according to the following observations, this view appears not
 to be correct; for glycolic acid can be formed from glycolide and
 water, and probably also again can be resolved into these two sub
 stances in the same way as lactide and water by their union produce
 lactic acid, and the decomposition of the latter by heat yields lactide
 again.         If,
              therefore, peroxide   hydrogen     ofcontained    glycolic

  and to illustrate this by a new Table representing the vitality of the
  healthiest part of the population of England.
     The Life-Table is an instrument of investigation; it may be called
  a biometer,    for it gives the exact measure of the duration of life under
  given circumstances.        Such a Table has to be constructed for each
  district and for each profession, to determine their degrees of salu
 brity. To multiply these constructions, then, it is necessary to lay
  down rules, which, while they involve a minimum amount of arith
  metical labour, will yield results as correct as can be obtained in the
  present state of our observations.
     A Life-Table represents a generation of men passing through time;
 and time under this aspect, dating from birth, is called age.         In the
 first column of a Life-Table age is expressed in years, commencing
  at 0 (birth), and proceeding to 100 or to 110 years, the extreme
 limit of observed lifetime. Annexed is an outline of the two primary
 series of the Life-Table, representing the surviving at each year of
 age (l), and the first differences representing the dying (d.), in annual
 intervals  of age.

             30          598     69,792
    The Table may be read thus: of 100,000 children born, 10,295
 die in the first year, 89,705 survive.
    It will be observed that, upon the hypothesis that the annual
 births equal the annual deaths in number, and that the law of mortal
ity remains invariable, the series of the living (l.) can be constructed
from the series of numbers (d.) representing the dying, or from the
 numbers dying at different ages, as returned in the parish registers.
That course was adopted by Halley, and afterwards by Dr. Price, in
constructing the Northampton Table.               But the hypothesis of an
invariable annual number of births equalling the deaths has never
been verified by observation, and consequently tables on the plan of
Halley's are often exceedingly erroneous. In the healthiest districts
of England the births were 29,715, the deaths 17,469 annually: a
Table constructed upon that plan, like Dr. Price's, makes the mean
lifetime—or as it is sometimes called, the expectation of life—for
Northampton,         25 years, while the mean lifetime by a correct
Northampton Table is 38 years.
    It is shown by a diagram that if age (w) is represented by the
abscissas, the numbers living (b.) will be represented by the ordinates
of a curve. . De Moivre constructed this curve by assuming that
the series l, is from the age 12 to 86, in arithmetical progression

                   Dr. Farr              on the Construction                 of Life-Tables.                      469
decreasing thus, 74, 73, 72        3, 2, 1, 0.     ...
                                                By another hypothesis,
the rate of  mortality is assumed to decrease or to increase in geome
trical progression at different rates in different periods of life; and
it is found that this hypothesis represents the results deduced from
the observed facts approximatively.
   As v, the velocity, expresses a ratio, so m, the rate of mortality,
is the ratio of the number dying to the number living in a unit of
time.    Now if y represent the living at a definite age, and r the rate
at which the mortality increases at that point of age, then mr will
be the rate of mortality after the lapse of 2 units of time. The
decrement of y in an infinitely short time will be dy=ymrºdz.
This was pointed out by Mr. Gompertz, and Mr. Edmonds subse
quently extended the theory.       This expression can be integrated,
                                                                                                           *(1-, *)
and the final equation of the corrected integral is y=10”              ;
where A is put for the common logarithm, and k for          modulus.                            its
   Either         of
               the hypotheses gives    close approximation   athe exact                               to

   Halley first pointed out some of the financial applications of the
Life-Table, and the new Table shows that the mean duration of life
among large classes of the population exceeds considerably the ex
  ectations of life deduced from the ordinary Tables.     The science of
public health has been developed since Halley's day; and here a
new application of the Life-Table is found.      If we ascertain at what
rate a generation of men die away under the least unfavourable
existing circumstances, we obtain a standard by which the loss of
life under other circumstances is measured; and this I have endea
voured to accomplish in the New Life-Table. And recollecting that
the science of public health was almost inaugurated in England by a
former President of this Society, who crowned the sanitary dis
 coveries of Captain Cook,                    I
                               feel assured that the Society will receive
with favour this imperfect attempt to supply sanitary inquirers with
 a scientific instrument.

   The following  communications were read:—
   “On the Means by which the Actiniae kill their Prey.” By
Augustus Waller, M.D., F.R.S.
  “On the Double Tangent of a Plane Curve.” By Arthur Cayley,
Esq., F.R.S.
  The author notices that the problem of finding the number of
double tangents was first solved by Plücker in 1834 from geometrical
considerations, and he gives a sketch of the subsequent history of
the problem.    The complete analytical determination of the double
tangents was only obtained very recently by Mr. Salmon, and is given
in a note by him in the Philosophical Magazine, October 1858: it is
there shown that the (n–2) points in which the tangent at any point
of a curve of the order n again meets the curve, are given as the
points of intersection of the tangent with a certain curve of the order
 (n–2); if this curve be touched by the tangent, then the point of
contact will be also a point of contact of the tangent and the curve
of the order n, or the tangent will be a double tangent. The pre
sent memoir relates chiefly to the establishment of an identical
equation, which puts in evidence the property of the curve of the
 order (n–2), and which the author considers to be also import
 ant in reference to the general theory of binary quantities: viz. if

cherty limestones and red porphyry occur.
   To the north, at Nanaimo, rocks with cretaceous fossils appear,
also at Comoux Island, 21 miles N.W. of Nanaimo. The fossils oc
cur in nodules, and consist of Fish-scales, Nautilus, Ammonites,
Baculites, Inoceramus, Astarte (?), Terebratula.
   Lignitiferous deposits (sandstones, grits, conglomerates, and mica
ceous flagstones) succeed the cretaceous rocks, and are extensively de
veloped over a great extent of country, forming the mass of the islands
in the Gulf of Georgia, as far south as Saturna Island. Northward,
they occur at Fort Rupert. Two seams of coal, averaging 6 to 8 feet
each in thickness, occur in these beds, and are extensively worked for
the supply of the steamers navigating between Victoria and the
Frazer River. The coal is a soft black lignite, interspersed with
small lenticular bands of bright crystalline coal. Retinite is common
in the more earthy portions. Shales with plant-remains are inter
stratified with the lignite.  At Bellingham Bay, on the mainland,
similar coal-bearing sandstones have been observed by the American
geologists.
   A pleistocene boulder-clay is widely distributed over the southern
part of Vancouver's Island and the opposite coasts of the mainland.
In the neighbourhood of Esquimalt and Victoria the rocks are deeply
scratched and grooved along the shore; and so also is the rock-sur
face beneath the drift, which at Esquimalt Harbour is about 20 feet
thick, whilst it is much more at the Barracks, and more than 190
feet thick between Albert Head and Esquimalt.
  November 16.—Professor      J.   Phillips, President, in the Chair.
  The following communication was read:—
   “Supplementary Researches among the Crystalline Rocks of the
North-west Highlands.” By Sir R. I. Murchison, V.P.R.S., F.G.S.
   This communication was offered in corroboration of those views
of the Author, already printed in the ‘Quarterly Journal of the Geo
logical Society' (No.59), which he first brought systematically before
geologists at the Glasgow Meeting of the British Association in 1855.
   The former suggestion of Prof. Nicol, that the fossiliferous rock of
Durness and Assynt might prove to be of carboniferous age (Quart.
Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. xiii. p. 17), having been set aside by the proofs
that these quartz-rocks and limestones contained true Lower Silurian
fossils; and the order of succession from a fundamental gneiss up
wards through unconformable sandstones and conglomerates (Cam
brian) to the Lower Silurian limestone inclusive, being admitted, it
was still objected that such limestones were not surmounted by any
great mass of quartz-rock, and that they terminated the ascending
series.   Professor Nicol, also believed that there did not exist an
ascending order from the rocks now proved to be Lower Silurian into
a series of micaceous, quartzose, and chloritic flagstones, which have
to the present day been represented by the same colour as the Old
Gneiss in   all the published geological maps     ofScotland.   Lastly,

 he intended to point out the existence of much igneous rock causing
 a great separation between the fossiliferous Lower Silurian and what
 he termed the “Upper or Eastern Gneiss”, it became necessary that
 the Director-General of the Geological Survey should revise his own
 conclusions, which had affirmed the existence of an unbroken ascend
 ing succession. With this view, he induced Professor Ramsay to
 accompany him to the north-west of Sutherland, where they spent a
 month.    There they not only saw no reason to depart from any of
 the views already published by Sir R. I. Murchison, but were enabled
 to strengthen them by laying down on a map a more correct outline
 of the formations than had hitherto been traced, by marking the
 principal faults, and by indicating clearly the transition upwards
 from the known Lower Silurian rocks into a superior micaceo-quart
 zose series (or the so-called “younger gneiss”), which is entirely
 dissevered from the Old or Fundamental Gneiss.    They further as
 certained that, whenever eruptive rocks occurred, they did not                                                  in
 terfere with or derange this ascending conformable Lower Silurian
 Success10n.
    Professor Harkness, who has visited the west of Sutherland since
 the Meeting of Aberdeen, and who has gone over the principal or
 typical sections in question, has confirmed these views, and has trans
 mitted to the author additional details, which were cited in the pre
 sent communication.
    The characters of the “Fundamental Gneiss” which occupies the
 Western Coast were again dwelt upon to show that                    strike from            its

    The author particularly cited the observations of Professors Ram
 say and Harkness, in illustration of this essential feature of the
 passage upwards from this quartzose and calcareous series into the
 “Eastern or Upper Gneiss”, as seen on the banks of the River Oykel
in Ross-shire, and thence ranging to Kinloch-Ailsh in Sutherland.
   To show how in the limited space of a few miles there was an en
tire discrepancy between the Fundamental Gneiss and the strata
overlying the quartz-rocks and limestones, two transverse sections
were exhibited, the one along the banks of Loch Stack and Loch
More, the other across Loch Eriboll to Ben Hope.              Both of these
exhibit a conformable overlying succession from the quartzose and
calcareous strata into overlying micaceous flagstones, which though
occasionally so metamorphosed as to resemble a sort of gneiss, are for
the most part very unlike that rock, and when viewed en masse
can everywhere be distinguished from the Lower Gneiss; to say no
thing of their greatly overlying position and their having a strike
and dip entirely discordant to that ancient rock.
   Attention was peculiarly directed to the details of the section
across Loch Eriboll, where a large Orthoceratite had been discovered
by Mr. Clark, in a strong band of quartz-rock between the Lower
and Upper Limestone, and where, in the escarpment above the house
of that gentleman, the clearest proofs are seen of an unbroken and
conformable succession from the quartzo-calcareous members of the
series up into the quartzo-micaceous and chloritic rocks (“Upper
Gneiss”) which range across Loch Hope and rise to the summit of
Ben Hope, 3040 feet above the sea.
   In  its advance      onthe dip       the east, this overlying micaceous
                                         to
and flag-like series occasionally becomes gneissose, particularly                            in
those tracts south and east        Tongue, and along the eastern frontier
                                   of
of Sutherland, where intrusive granitic, syenitic, and felspathic rocks
prevail infinitely more than        in
                                     the western tracts.
   Particular attention was given                 by
                                             the author and Prof. Ramsay,

separation between the Silurian Rocks with fossils and the “Eastern
Gneiss.”      In the escarpment above Eriboll House, the only igneous
rock observable    is
                   a     very thin course              of

on it would be represented the most sweeping change in the Geo
logical Map of Scotland which had ever been proposed; inasmuch
as a vast region, which has up to this day been considered to be
of a primary age, and anterior to palaeozoic life, will be referred to
the Lower Silurian epoch.
   Passing from the North Highlands, which he had more especially
examined of late years, the author expressed his opinion that the
mica-slates, clay-slates, and quartz-rock of the Southern Highlands
would probably            all
                     fall into the same Lower Silurian category         the                                as

   ON  THE PRESENCE OF WANADIUM IN THE CLAY OF GENTILLY.
                            BY P. BEAUVALLET.
    M. H. Sainte-Claire Deville terminates a recent note on the
occurrence of vanadium in an iron ore of the South of France, by
 stating that, from what he has heard, vanadium will be found to be
more common than might be expected. This refers to the discovery
 of this metal by the author in the clay of Gentilly, towards the close
of the year 1858. By fusing this clay with carbonate of soda, the
author obtained a mass of a bluish-green colour.          At first he sup
posed this coloration to be due to manganese, but analysis proved it
to be produced by vanadium.
    To extract the vanadium from the clay, he proceeds as follows:—
Fragments of baked clay * are boiled with 3 per cent. of carbonate
of soda and a sufficient quantity of water. After they have been
boiled for a few hours, the liquid is separated by filtration; it con
 tains silica, alumina, and nearly the whole of the vanadic acid. It is
 supersaturated with sulphuric acid and then with ammonia; and
hydrosulphate of ammonia is afterwards added. After two hours of
 digestion the liquid is filtered, to separate the precipitate of alumina
 and silica.    The filtered liquid, which contains the vanadium in the
 form of sulphovanadiate of ammonia, is treated with an excess of
 acetic acid, which throws down the sulphuret of vanadium, espe
 cially when the liquid is heated to boiling. This sulphuret, calcined
 at a red heat, gives vanadic acid.
     The following process may also be adopted for the separation of
 the vanadium from the solution of soda. The solution is boiled with
 an excess of muriate of ammonia until no more ammonia is evolved;
 the silica and alumina are separated by filtration; and a solution of
 tannin is poured into the filtrate, which causes the formation of a
 voluminous precipitate of tannate of vanadium of a fine blue-black
 colour; this, calcined in contact with the air, leaves a residue of
 wanadic acid.
     M. Terreil, who has treated different clays of the environs of Paris
 by the above method, did not find any vanadium in them, but obtained
 from them titanic and tantalic acids.
     M. Elie de Beaumont mentions that both the iron ore and the
  Gentilly clay above referred to belong to the tertiary strata. This
  occurrence of vanadium in recent strata at two points so wide apart
  as Gentilly and les Beaux, is a new fact in geology, and merits
  attention.—Comptes Rendus, August 22, 1859, p. 301.
     * The  author uses the flower-pots furnished to the Museum by M. Lé
 cuyer.    The red pots contain more vanadic acid than the yellow ones.
  After they have been exposed for some time to the action of the water,
  they furnish scarcely any more.

LXXIV.       Critical and Eaperimental Contribution to the Theory of
     Dyeing.    By Dr. P. A. Bolley, Professor of Technical Che
     mistry at the Zürich Polytechnic.
                            [With a Plate.]
EVE:on since the first attempts were made by chemists to base
       scientific principles the art which is carried to such
perfection in this district, two questions have presented them
selves as necessarily requiring solution.
   1. In what part of the coloured fibre is the colouring matter
situated? Does it merely adhere to the surface, or does it pene
trate the entire substance of the cell-walls of such fibres as
cotton and flax? or lastly, in the case of such fibres, is it stored
up in the interior of the cells?
   2. What is the nature of the union between the dye and the
fibre 7 Is it a chemical combination, or is it due to mere surface
attraction ?
   It is obvious that the correct decision of the former of these
questions must throw much light on the latter; and this consi
deration suggests the course which it was necessary to take in
order to arrive at the required conclusion. Both chemical expe
riments and microscopic observations have been employed on
this subject, though neither to any very great extent; indeed
it is only in recent times that researches have been engaged
in for the express purpose of ascertaining the true nature of
the phaenomena in question: formerly the subject was treated
altogether inductively.      In this way several theories concerning
the process of  dyeing  have arisen which absolutely contradict each
other in      all
              their parts, none      them paying the least regard

    Persoz” has made an excellent summary of at least the more
 ancient learning on this subject; and it will be quite sufficient for
 our purpose to take from this source the most essential outlines
 of some of these various doctrines.
    At first the view found                        its
                                          supporters, that         the group          in                   of
 phaenomena under consideration we had                                     to
                                                         deal with mechanical
 adhesion.       Hellot was           opinion that the colour

in   the first case the fibre was covered over with “an astrin
 gent substance,”              that the ordinary agents—light, water,
                                   so
 &c.—could not         get      the colouring matter, whereas
                                    at                                  the case               in

                        such protection existed.             another place      In                         he
 says that the pores must                         be
                                        cleansed, opened, filled, and again
 closed,      that they may retain the particles

     All   the phaenomena                   of attraction            may be divided into three
groups.
   The first comprises those whose results we call chemical com
binations, consisting of the approximation of atoms or atom
groups, where the physical properties of the product are entirely
                                             of its
different from those of                          components.
     The second consists        those immediate approximations                                                   of
atoms      or
            atom  groups  which can only occur when the form and
size  of the atoms render       possible;      includes what are ordi

marily called the phaenomena         cohesion.    Persozl explains how

these two classes             of
                       phaenomena,    generally  described     altogether                         as
distinct, are really very similar.
   The third class      phaenomena, which has been less accurately

investigated, stands further removed from either              the former                      of

      It
      is obvious that thus, together with the second of the ques
tions mentioned at the commencement of this essay, on which
the whole subject turns, the first also is most unequivocally
answered.
   The practical illustrations which Persoz adduced in support
of his own views, he also employed against a theory of Walter
Crum’s on the subject of cotton-dyeing. We shall therefore give
a short sketch of Crum's theory before we notice the arguments
of Persoz.
      According            to   W. Crum#, the cell of the cotton fibre, in                                          its
fully developed state,        flattened throughout
                                      is                       entire length,             its
except
             to at
             the edges, which remain raised and tubular.                    He
appeals      the microscopic observations          Thomson          Clitheroe,

 of the relations that result from the application to the fibre of
 both mordant and dye.       In the last two divisions, also, cer
tain well-known phaenomena of the art of dyeing are noticed,
 which contribute nothing to the proof that we have to do with
chemical combinations.
    To Chevreul's views and labours we shall have to return pre
 sently. We must now notice the chief results of three several
works which possess the common merit of pursuing the method
of actual observation, the more so because they have nowhere
been influenced by the desire to uphold a common theory of
dyeing.
    A. Oschatzº, in the year 1848, published a treatise well worthy
of attention, “On the Structure of the most important Fibrous
 Substances used in the Arts,” at the conclusion of which there is
a short chapter entitled “Microscopic Contribution to the Theory
of Dyeing.”      The conclusion which he draws from his observa
tions are   expressed  in his own words as follows:—
     “If thin sections of coloured fibres be taken and submitted to
microscopic examination, it will be seen that the entire sub
stance of the fibre is equally coloured. The thickness of the
cell-walls, even in cotton fibre, leaves no doubt on this point;
and the fact that in some cases, especially in cotton dyed Turkey
red, the external layer of the cell-wall is more deeply coloured
than the rest, is not to be set against the universal observation
that in wool and silk the whole section displays the most entire
uniformity of tint.
    “By the establishment of this universal fact, of the reality of
which any one may convince himself in the way above indi
cated, a starting-point at least is secured for future theories.
The separation of the particles of colouring matter which have
been disseminated throughout the organic substance is as little
to be detected, even with the highest magnifying powers, as that
of the particles of lime-salts in the organism of bones, or of silicic

   1. Wool, silk, and cottom are coloured by the penetration of
the dye.   Under the microscope they appear evenly impregnated
with  colour, and transparent.    Stuffs dyed with chromate of lead
and oxide of chromium form an exception, being coloured partly
by adhesion of the dye to the surface, partly by        penetration                    its
throughout the substance       the fibre.   ofsome exceptional cases   In

                                       of
and shows the fibre coloured uniformly        penetration.   With           by
these exceptions, fibres are universally coloured      penetration                     by

are collected.       The only portion of Hartig's labours which it is
important for us to notice, concerns the explanation of the phae
momenon of the attraction of colouring matter by the cell-nu
cleus. Maschke expresses Hartig's views as follows (we also give
Maschke’s explanation of these observations in his own words):—
    “1. Carmine is by no means the only dye taken up by the
chlorogen (or chlorophyll) of the cell-nucleus; the same thing
happens with the juice of Phytolacca decandra, litmus, gamboge,
sulphate of copper, cinnabar, and ink.
     “2. The chlorogen is composed of vegetable gelatine and
albumen; and the gluten of wheat consists of the same sub
stances, each of which possesses the property of taking up
colouring matter.         Animal albumen (white of egg), the fibrous
bundles of isinglass before and after solution, the nitrogenous
gluten meal of other seeds, and the non-nitrogenous mucilaginous
layers of gum tragacanth cells and other mucilaginous cell-walls
 (Entwickelungsgeschichte       des Pflanzenkeims,       by Hartig, p. 6),
behave     similarly  with  regard  to  dyes.
     “3. Chemical action is out of the question, as is also mere
 adhesion or penetration, since the smallest scarcely perceptible
 mixture of dyeing matter with the cell-sap colours the chlorogen
 and that alone, the cell-walls and juices by which it is surrounded
 remaining colourless. The colouring commences in a few seconds,
 and in a few minutes attains                  its
                                        maximum intensity.
     “4. The whole phaenomenon can hardly                             be
                                                             explained other

 liquid through the chlorogen, which acts               filter, arresting and

     “5. Among the different colouring matters that have been
 employed, carmine           is   topreferred, because bodies coloured

  stance    ofwool and silk;          also known that certain colouring
                                      it      is

490              Dr. Bolley on the Theory of Dyeing.
matters, indigo for example (called for this reason a substantive
dye), possess this affinity so strongly that even the employment
of a mordant may be dispensed with ; nothing then can be more
natural than to expect something similar in the process of colour
ing microscopic objects, and to explain the colouring effect of any
pigment on the cell-nueleus simply on the ground of the chemical
affinity between the substance of the nucleus and the dye employed.
    “That chemical affinities do here, in fact, come into play, may
be gathered a priori from the fact that other granular or vesicular
contents of the cells, morphologically similar, but of a different
chemical constitution, do not unite with pigments; and the jus
tice of this view will appear more clearly with regard to each
separate kind of material in the course of the present work.
    “The physical state of the material to be coloured does not,
however, appear to me to be altogether without effect.        Besides
chemical affinity, surface attraction, as it is exhibited in charcoal
and platina, certainly contributes in some cases to the result, by
rendering the effect of the former more considerable.
  “I    have addressed the following experiments in the first place
to discover those physiologically important substances in which
the power of attracting colour is innate; but as it is well known
that nitrogenous substances, such as wool and silk, are especially
                         I
fitted for dyeing, so have begun the series of my experiments
with this group, or rather with the group of proteine substances.”
    Maschke then describes a series of observations of his own,
from which we shall select such as seem to relate to our subject.
    Of horny tissue, for example, he says, “The power which
horny matter possesses of attracting colour is well known to
dyers.    I was therefore the more surprised at finding, on repeated
and most carefully conducted experiments, hardly a trace of colour
in hair and wool which had been treated with ether, even after
they had laid for hours in the dye-bath.       Only where the fibres
had been cut or   broken,  or where,  through   pressure or friction,
the external surface of the hair had been abraded so as to expose
the corticular substance to the operation of the dye, did the
colour after long exposure begin to become visible.
  “This       paradox   disappeared   when   the   temperature   of the
coloured solution containing the object under microscopic exami
nation was greatly elevated; then the process of colouring was
seen to proceed from the sections of the hairs, to enter their ex
tremities, and thence to spread over their entire lengths. It
seems, therefore, that the phaenomenon first noticed results from
the external covering of the hair opposing itself obstinately to the
entrance of the coloured liquid; and that in aqueous solutions
at ordinary temperatures, both this external covering and            the
corticular substance become soaked but very slowly.”

   Lastly, the group of substances consisting                                          of cellulose is con
sidered, and the following observations made                                           thereon:-
   “These substances, consisting altogether                                            of cellulose             (and
also that substance consisting entirely of vascular or vesicular
membrane, which                 I
                     am inclined to regard as corticular sub
                  is,                                          of                                     of

the different authors whose names we have mentioned.
   We shall first take general view  a       those observations which   of
relate    the deposition
             to                the colouring matter

   While Persoz contends for external adhesion as the most
general, W. Crum (who, however, only concerns himself with
cotton fibre) considers the storing               the colouring matter
                                                                        up    of
in the interior of the cells as the true state of the case. Oschatz
and Verdeil declare for the uniform penetration                 the dye                               of

                                  fibres, but allow some exceptions.
Finally, Maschke denies that cellulose possesses the property                                                     of
penetrability     by

   With regard       wool and silk, we find
                        to                        certain agreement           a                                   of

    the dye into the mass of the fibre—is considerably the most
    common; the second, however—the external adhesion of the

    colouring matter—is by no means unexampled.                   On careful
    investigation of the principal series of specimens of coloured wool,
    a considerable accumulation of colouring matter may be found in
    the little pits which occur in the external membrane of the fibre.
    This may be best shown by treating with dilute caustic soda
    when the colour is not destroyed by an alkali.            have dyed wool        I

    uniformly throughout; both, however, admit exceptions. Maschke,

    ing matter from solution,-meaning,

    I      shall mention two methods         conducting the investigation*.

    In the first place, sections were made bundles cotton-thread   of                   of

sian blue); only with the difference that the section, as com
pared with the external surface, was even less deeply tinged.
    No discoloration of the substance of the cell-walls could, how
ever, be observed in the case of indigo-blue, Turkey-red, madder,
pink and violet, chrome-yellow, chrome-black, catechu-brown,
nankeen (hydrated peroxide of iron), iron-black, and other dyes.
    With these dyes, colouring in the hollow of the fibre was ob
served very seldom, and, we may say, only locally. This appear
ance, on the contrary, presented itself unmistakeably in the case
of those specimens of cotton which had been dyed with murea'ide.
The cell-walls themselves were not coloured; the dye and mor
dant adhered for the most part to the outside surface, but a con
siderable quantity had penetrated into the hollow of the fibre.
Fig. 5 will give an idea of the appearance of this section.        Of
course, therefore, W. Crum's view is not to be approved.       Of the
two parallel canals lying along the sides of the flattened fibre
there is not a trace.
    The method of conducting the investigation by means of sec
tions leavesroom for some uncertainty, since in certain cases, where
the section is not quite perpendicular, the inclined portion of the
outside surface shines through the sharpened edge of the section.
    The following plan may, in my opinion, be regarded as safer.
 Solution of oxide of copper in ammonia, according to the obser
vation of E. Schweitzer, dissolves cotton, the cellulose precipitated
 from the solution being disorganized and gelatinous. Under the
 microscope this reagent seems to act just like iodine and sul
 phuric acid. The appearances which accompany this reaction,
 which Dr. Cramerº describes very accurately, are altogether
 similar to those which are presented when sulphuric acid of
 proper strength is suffered to act in the presence of iodine. The
 cuprate of ammoniat, however, has the advantage of acting
 much less powerfully in decomposing or dissolving most of the
 pigments used in dyeing and the metallic oxides of the mordants.
 Some of them, however (safflower, for example), are unable to
 resist its action.

 of dyed cotton cloth to   an ash, and the determination of the base
 of the mordant   therein,  serves as an indication of the nature of
the dyeing process through which the stuff has passed.
    After what has been said, we think we may very properly
 excuse ourselves the trouble of further examining into researches
 which contain so little that is conclusive.
    The researches of Chevreul, and the prior ones of Roard and
 Thénard, which he appeals to in his treatise on the theory of
 dyeing, are not numerous and varied enough to lead to a clear
characterization of the group of phaenomena which result from
the application of salt solutions to fibres.      This circumstance,
and the conjecture that a reconsideration of the question would
in many cases lead to different results, were the inducement
to undertake a long series of experiments from which infor
mation might be expected.          Some of Chevreul's experiments
related to the withdrawal of sulphuric and muriatic acids from
their dilute solutions by fibrous substances.         He determined
the strength of the diluted acid before the immersion of the
fibre, and after              its
                      digestion                    in
                                     the solution. This method                                             is
the  only exact one.

 solution in sulphuric acid, charcoal next, and wool next to

 attraction for indigo under such circumstances.                That, more

 small portion of sulphuric acid, which is not the case with cotton.

light on the behaviour of these bodies to solutions of colouring
matter.
   1. Wool and silk are unable to deprive a solution of all its
colour, as charcoal can; their effect only extends to a certain
degree of dilution, beyond which the particles of colouring mat
ter resist their attraction.
   2. What we have already asserted concerning wool, and espe
cially concerning silk, namely, that dyes which they have taken
without a mordant maybe removed again by long washing inwater,
is not true in the case of charcoal, or only to a very slight degree.
   Both these observations show that the attraction of colouring
matter for water is more completely overcome by charcoal than
by animal fibre.
   Cotton, as we gather from the experiments above tabulated,
has less effect than wool and silk on salts and colouring matters
in solution; this, however, will not surprise us when we com
pare the structure of cotton fibre with that of wool and silk, and
reflect that the latter substances, in consequence of their physical
constitution, belong (as has been long known) to the class of
strongly absorbent or hygroscopic bodies; that               bodies which,   of is,

                    Dr. Bolley       on the Theory                 of Dyeing.                        505
Esprit”, Schönbeint, Guthef, Stenhouse $, notwithstanding
many differences on isolated points, certain concordant results:—
   1. That the same charcoal produces a greater effect on one
solution than on another.
   2. That charcoals of different origin and preparation may pro
duce very different effects.
   3. That charcoal takes up some salts from their solutions un
changed, but that it decomposes others, either attracting the base
more strongly and leaving an acid or an acid salt, or reducing
the base to a lower degree of oxidation.
   The reduction of bases by fibres immersed in solutions of me
tallic salts has not,   far as we know, been observed; but the
                                as
decomposition   of a neutral into an acid and a basic compound
occurs several times in the above Table of experiments.    In this
respect also the behaviour of the fibres is therefore very similar
to that of charcoal.
   Putting together the conclusions which may be deduced,
partly from the observations cited, partly from general consi
derations, we may regard it as proved:—
  A. With regard to              the part       of the fibre in which the colouring
matter is deposited.
   1. The penetration of the fibres by the colouring matter is
not so general as Verdeil and Oschatz suppose; and the external
adhesion of the dye cannot be regarded as an exception.
   2. The view of Persoz, that the colour of dyed fibre is due
solely to superficial adhesion, is as little to be maintained.
   3. Silk and wool, in              all
                               cases where they have not been dyed
with colours       in
                    mere state
                      a                     of
                                      suspension, seem          impreg                    to   be
nated with the   dye  throughout     their entire mass.
     4.Both these kinds       fibre, but especially the first (silk), are
                                     of
in  many cases coloured, not only internally, but also          external                       by
adhesion.
          In           cotton, the penetration
                           of                                                                            by
                                                                             it of

slight.   By far the larger portion       colouring matter adheres
                                                       of                                                to

                                           in
canals which contain the greater part          the colouring matter,

proved. (Chevreul, Thénard, and Roard state that silk and wool
weaken dilute sulphuric acid, while cotton,               abstracting the by
water, concentrates the acid.)

certain bodies from their solutions, nor even the observations
that have since been made, that certain fibres are coloured                                        by

there are important facts directly opposed.

have nothing          to
                    do.   The so-called substantive dyes are those
which become insoluble from some cause other than the addition
of mordant.

a  communication          Prof. by
                                 Erdmann,    “On the    Operation                                  of
Mordants, especially Alum,         Cotton Dyeing.”in      am obliged,          I

                                              of                  con                         in

                            of                                make the              to
following observations thereon.
     1.When,     the treatise,
                     in             said “the phaenomena
                                              it   is           dyeing                   of
have hardly ever been the subject                            of
                                          accurate scientific examina
tion,” the industry      preceding writers seems very much under
                                of

                          Dr. Bolley on the Theory of Dyeing.                                                   507
estimated, as sufficiently appears from the foregoing short                                                    histo
rical summary.
   2. It must be attributed to an oversight that, in Erdmann's
essay, no mention is made of the experiment the particulars of
which      I
         communicated on a former occasion, “On the Dyeing
of Amorphous Cotton”.” Mittenzwey has, it is said, investi
gated the behaviour of disorganized cellulose towards mordants
especially alum, in order to decide the question “whether the
structure of cotton fibres is essential to the process of dyeing,
as is assumed in W. Crum's theory among others.”       This ques
tion is rightly answered                       in the negative,
                                                   however,      had                 as,                   it
already been      myself   by         the spring
                                               as   early
                                                      1858+.   as
                                                                The                        of
passage which touches      this subject   on  follows:—“I can,            is   as                                    in
the present  communication,  only  shortly mention that from this
behaviourthe conclusion maybe drawn, that the structure       cotton                                      of
fibres has           no
               connexion with their power      taking    dye.   This           of                a
view,       well known,
           as   is         opposed                              to
                                       several theories which have
                                          is
been advanced concerning the dyeing process          W. Crum’s for                         (to
example).”
      The result, that cotton (amorphous
     3.                                          organized) neither                 or
unites with alum nor separates alumina nor    basic salt from                        a                               it,
is confirmed       my      by
                      experiments       the behaviour       fibres   on                                   of
towards that salt.               -
     4.    In
          Erdmann’s treatise       said, “An alum solution
                                                     it   is                                                         is
chosen, not only because      one    the commonest mordants,    of
                                          to is it
but especially because               it         not decomposed      heat.” The last  by
reason may stand; but                           is
                                                the first we must say that alum                                 is   by
 no   means one           of  the commonest mordants employed                               in   cotton-dyeing,
On the contrary, the mordants employed, almost without excep
tion,   the operations
          in              the cotton-dyer, are either the so-called
                                         of
neutral alum (that                  is,
                        alum partly decomposed with soda),                                                           or

of Erdmann's treatise; but then         added, “This explanation

       support    this view, have since, just
                          of              I      Professors Erdmann and        as
Mittenzwey have done, mordanted and dyed with different decoctions
of dye-woods, sulphate              of
                           baryta and other pulverulent mineral bodies, and
exhibited the preparations     the sittingat the Zurich Society  of Natural                           of
Philosophy.

508                Mr.       J.   Cockle on the Theory of Equations
tice that cotton is mordanted with common alum, nothing is
gained, as far at least as concerns the theory of cotton-dyeing, by
a statement of the behaviour of alum to solutions of colouring
matter. In the foregoing treatise                             I
                                            have therefore adverted to
this   subject  in connexion with wool- and silk-dyeing, in which
relation it has not yet been considered, having, however, made
the express reservation, that, in considering this subject, a colla
teral effect (the partial decomposition of alum by the fibre) must
not be overlooked.
    5. The principal conclusion, that the colouring matter adheres
only mechanically to cotton fibres, and that the fibre itself in
dyeing is without any chemical effect, is correct. We have seen
that Persoz, as well as previous investigators, were of the same
opinion; and observe thatI                     I
                                     myself, induced by observations
of an entirely different nature, expressed it as my own in the
little communication which I published in May 1858. Whoever
 is acquainted with the numerous and contradictory researches
 and theories that have been made on this subject by a long
 series of chemists, and regards the diversity          and the difficulty     of,
     becoming acquainted with the phaenomena which
to of
                                                                 have had                  I

substances, brought singly into the melting-space, exhibited the
following changes:–
    1. Chemically pure chloride of calcium produces a yellow flame,
which, even with very thin layers of the indigo solution, passed
through a tinge of violet into the original lamp flame.
   2. Chemically pure chloride of sodium, the same.
   3. Chemically pure carbonate or chloride of potassium appears
of a caerulean blue, then violet, and at last of an intense crimson
red, even when seen through the thickest layers of solution.
Admixtures of soda or lime do not hinder the reaction.
  4. Chemically pure carbonate or chloride of lithium gives a
carmine-red flame, which, with increasing thickness of the
medium, becomes gradually feebler, and disappears before the
thickest layers pass before the eye.                        Lime and soda are also
without influence on the reaction.

reverse is the case.  By ascertaining in this manner between
what two of the silicates the reaction falls, the proportion of
soda can be approximatively determined to a few per cents.
    Certain precautions must not be neglected: the test specimen
and the standard silicate must be as nearly as possible equal ;
the lengths of wire in the flame must also be equal; but above
all, the eye must be accustomed to distinguish the different
brightnesses of the same tint, from the changes in colour, which
are very different.       Inasmuch as the eye is not susceptible
enough for the more intense bleaching of the iodide of mercury
paper, in cases where the bleaching is intense the paper must be
illuminated so strongly by the flame of an ordinary candle, that a
colour nearer to the red, but at the same time white, is produced.

    The reason that lasurstein, which only contains 9 per cent. of
soda, gives a stronger soda reaction than nepheline, which con
tains 15 per cent., is that it already contains sulphuric acid,
and can therefore only be compared with silicates containing no
sulphuric acid when these are fused with gypsum, when, as is
seen from the Table, the anomaly disappears.                    As sulphuric
acid, by giving rise to the formation of volatile sulphate, renders
the reaction more delicate, it is first necessary to ascertain
whether it is present.        This is effected by fusing a sample with
soda in the    reducing    flame,  letting it cool in the dark part of the
flame, and then testing it on polished silver.
    In testing a sample a splitter is brought into the flame, and
by the intensity of the bleaching of the iodide paper the place is
approximatively determined.            To come nearer to the number, a
lighted candle is approached to the iodide paper, and the
distance observed at which the bleaching passes into red.               The
nearer the candie can be placed, the lower in the series is the
silicate.   With lasurstein, the candle can be brought within 2
or 3 inches without producing red. After this preliminary test,
two, or at most three, comparative observations will show the
place of the silicate.
    Lithia silicates must be tested for separately. The above soda
scale cannot be used, as the lithia flame gives rays which
redden the iodide paper: this is not the case with potash.
    Lithia silicates can only be compared amongst themselves;
and lepidolite, petalite, and triphane are best used as reagents.
Their deportment is as follows:—
    1 a. Lepidolite.—Easily fusible.            In the oxidizing flame yel
lowish red to the naked           eye;   in the reducing flame and the
melting-space yellow ; with the indigo prism a strong, and with
 gypsum a still stronger lithia reaction; tolerably strong potash
 reaction, still stronger with gypsum and the prism.                 Feebler
 soda reaction than 2 a and 3 a.          The varieties richer in fluorine

 LXXVIII.             Further Remarks on Parabenzole, and on the Isomers
              of   Turpentine.  By ARTHUR H. CHURCH, F.C.S.*
     ULPHOBENZOLATE of                  ammonium, Cl* Hº, NH4, 2SO3,
        when submitted to     dry  distillation,  yields (among other pro
 ducts which I have not examined)             sulphate   of ammonium, sul
 phobenzole, sulphophenylamide, and benzole.                The proportion
 of benzole thus obtained is very considerable : one experiment,
 in which 200 grammes of sulphobenzolate of ammonium were
 distilled, yielded nearly 60 grammes of benzole.               The hydro
 carbon thus regenerated contains sulphurous acid and other im
 purities, from which it may be freed by agitation with a strong
 solution of hydrate of potassium. The benzole thus purified has
the exact boiling-point t (80°-8) of the original hydrocarbon used
in the preparation of the sulphobenzolic acid; in every respect          -
also it is precisely identical with pure benzole.
    Sulphoparabenzolic acid, which is produced when parabenzole,
a  hydrocarbon    occurring in coal-naphtha, is treated with fuming
sulphuric acid, yields a series of salts which, although isomeric
with those of sulphobenzolic acid, differ from them considerably
in physical properties.        I have already described f the hydro
carbon itself       boils (it 97°5),    the sulphoparabenzolic acid, and

   The boiling-point of 103°7 assigned to toluole has been lately
confirmed; and if on further examination the hydrocarbon boil

discrepancies in the boiling-points assigned to this body will be
explained; for the analysis of fractions of coal-naphtha boiling
between 104° and 121° has been found by several experimenters
to give numbers exactly according with the formula C*H*.

          produced by the action   of Light   upon Bodies.     525
sulphurets of the alkaline earths, such as the sulphurets of barium,
strontium, and calcium; the two first present a greater activity
in the emission of light, and the third distinguishes itself by a
greater variety in the tints. Afterwards come several kinds of
diamonds, most of the varieties of fluoride of calcium, in parti
cular the variety known as chlorophane, and subsequently a
great number of minerals and salts; for the most part, however,
these only retain the property of emitting light for a few seconds
—rarely a few minutes—after exposure to luminous rays,
Amongst the list of these bodies, too, are the compounds of lime;
a great number of the compounds of strontia and barytes; mag
nesia, soda, and potash, together with many of their compounds;
sal-ammoniac, succinic acid, oxalic acid, borax, &c. Amongst
the organic bodies possessing the property in question, are dried
paper, silk, sugar, sugar of milk, teeth, &c. Although most of
these substances were already known to possess the property of
 phosphorescence under the action of light, there still remained to
be investigated a great many circumstances accessory to the action
 of luminous radiation, as well as the causes which are introduced
 in the preparation of artificially phosphorescent bodies in order
 to bestow upon them the property of presenting rays of different
 refrangibility.   Such are some of the principal points which the
 author proposed to study, and of the importance of which there
  can be no difference of opinion; for, as he himself remarks, “the
 phaenomenon of phosphorescence       by the action of radiation, is
  one of the most curious in molecular physics; it tends to elucidate
 the manner in which luminous vibrations become modified when
  they strike different substances, thus giving rise, perhaps, to
  some of the effects upon which the colour of bodies depends.”
     After having passed in review the principal substances which
  become phosphorescent by insolation, the author resumes the
  examination of the sulphurets of calcium and barium, to which
  the name of artificial phosphors has been preeminently given.
  It had been already shown that, according to the mode of
  preparing these substances, the property of emitting different
  coloured lights could be imparted to artificial phosphors; but
the causes of these differences had never been specified.      M.
Becquerel having already been led to suppose that in certain
cases the same substance might be endued with different lumi
mous properties according to    itsphysical   molecular condition,
                                              or
has re-examined with great care the different modes     preparing

these  exceedingly  sensitive substances.   He experimented  prin
cipally upon the different reactions    bymeans    which the sul

phurets   ofcalcium and barium are obtained; and the result        at
which    hearrived was, that the tint   ofthe phosphorescent light
emitted   by these different substances varies not only with their

 chemical    composition, but also according to certain molecular
 modifications which may be produced in substances having the
 same chemical constitution.        For instance, when phosphorescent
 sulphuret of calcium is prepared by means of carbonate of lime,
 the luminous effects which are obtained are more or less brilliant,
 and the tints are different shades of violet.                   the other       If,   on

that the more refrangible rays, and particularly the violet, were
most efficacious       giving rise

Becquerel has shown that the solar rays which most excite phos
phorescence are still more refrangible than the violet rays, that
   fact they are situated partly without the spectrum.         By giving

accompanies the action           radiation, the author has observed

that each  substance,   indeed each preparation,       sensitive within     is
different limits    refrangibility. The author here enters into very
                         of
interesting details               on
                         the manner       which the several phospho
                                                       in
rescent bodies above described behave under the action            rays                       of
of different refrangibilities; and       shows not only that

less refrangible rays tends,       the contrary, on diminish and even  to
to      destroy phosphorescence.

                           next treats           of these phospho           of

during which phosphorescent substances can emit light             the                        in

                               upon their temperature.                                  In   no

minerals, such        Arragonite, Iceland spar, and glass, which
                           as
emit very vivid light whose duration scarcely exceeds fifteen
          a                                                                                       or

much less luminous than Arragonite, continue           emit light for         to
upwards        of   an
                 hour after insolation.  The same takes place with

                 produced by the action                  of Light upon Bodies.                       527

author gives the results of his numerous experiments on this
subject in the form of a Table, wherein the principal phospho
rescent substances are arranged according to the duration, as
well as according to the intensity, of the light which they emit
after insolation.  To facilitate his researches, M. Becquerel                                            in
vented an apparatus, the phosphoroscope, wherein bodies may be
regarded by the experimenter immediately (a small fraction of a
second) after the action of the light, so that the interval which
separates the moment of observation from that of luminous action
may be shortened to any extent, as well as measured.       In this
apparatus a great many bodies become luminous which do not
appear to be so by the ordinary mode of experiment.     By means
of a modification introduced into such an apparatus, which per

528                   M.        Becquerel on the Luminous                      Effects
    In a fourth chapter, M. Becquerel treats of the intensity and
composition of the light emitted by phosphorescent bodies at
different temperatures.      On this subject he remarks that, when
diffuse or solar light is used to excite the substances, the light
emitted by phosphorescence is much less brilliant than the                                                   in
cident light; but if different parts of the spectrum are operated
with, this is not always the case; for, as already observed, the
invisible rays beyond the violet give rise to a brilliant phospho
rescence.    The phosphoroscope, by enabling the author to follow
continuously the luminous emission of a body, furnished him
with the means of studying the changes which take place in the
intensity of the phosphorescent light when the intensity of the
active rays varies within certain determinate limits.       He found,
in general, that the intensity of the light emitted by a body in
             of its
               proper action, whilst remaining independent
virtue of                                                          the                               of of
duration       insolation,        function
                                         is   a the intensity      theof
exciting rays.     With respect        the composition
                                                    to       the light                    of
emitted     by    phosphorescent
                  a                  body,   M. Becquerel  found that
in   general     had
                 it      refrangibility less than that
                                a                            the exci                     of
ting rays; but       this case,
                           in           that   as   in

 by  any luminous source whatever, the colour             the emitted                of
light is   intimately connected with the refrangibility            the                               of
exciting rays.        further appears that the intensity and the

pend   as much upon their temperature         upon their physical         as
constitution.    In fact the author has shown that an elevated                           at

tain tint whose duration and intensity are both determinate; and
that, on cooling                 its
                        ordinary temperature, the body
                           to                             question                            in

which  in   this respect presents the most remarkable modifications
is sulphuret        strontium, obtained
                      of                       the reaction     by

case the emitted light, which                  is   of
                                          violet colour     the ordinary             at
temperature, becomes clear blue           40°, greenish  at a70°, green                  at

                                          at            about 200°, thus       at
becoming more and more        refrangible                       as

The author has collected           Table series of observations made

retained    atdifferent temperatures, but they         unequally for           do   so

all phosphorescent substances receive       greater totality   action

            produced by the action    of Light  upon Bodies.      529
from the exciting light, and gleam for a longer time, at lower than
at higher temperatures.
   The following is a literal translation of the conclusions which
M. Becquered deduces from the researches              recorded in his
memoir:-                                 º
    1. Certain bodies after being acted upon by light, and parti
cularly by the more refrangible rays of the same, emit luminous
rays whose wave-length is in general greater than that of the
exciting rays.    For the first few seconds this emitted light dimi
nishes rapidly in intensity, and afterwards more slowly, for a time
which varies with different bodies from a small fraction of a
second up to several hours.       Ultimately the bodies become com
pletely inactive, and require to be exposed anew to the light in
order that the effect may be reproduced.
   This fact may be otherwise expressed thus: bodies manifest
for  a certain time a persistence in the impression exerted upon
them by light, which depends upon the nature and physical
constitution of the body. This emission of light corresponds to
a certain totality of action received by each body, and takes place
in obscurity, whether the body be      enclosed or not.    Heat merely
accelerates   the emission   of light, which at a higher tempera
ture takes place in a shorter time, and consequently with a
greater intensity.
   2. It has been possible to construct an apparatus, to which       I
have given the name phosphoroscope, in which the bodies can be
seen by an observer, and the time which intervenes between the
moment of insolation and that of observation can be rendered as
short as required, and also measured.         In this apparatus a cer
tain number of bodies become luminous which are not percep
tibly so by the ordinary method of experiment.
   3. The refrangibility of the light emitted by phosphorescent
substances depends upon their molecular condition, and not
merely upon their chemical constitution; by employing the sul
phurets of the alkaline earths, it is possible with one and the
same body to obtain an emission of light of different tints, and
that according to the temperature to which the bodies have
been previously submitted, and also according to the conditions
of the combinations which, by their reaction, give rise to the
substance    whose phosphorescence is under consideration.
   4. In   general, in the preparation of the sulphurets of the
alkaline earths, called artificial phosphors, the elevation of
temperature and the duration of the thermal action cause little
variation in the refrangibility of the light emitted by phos
phorescence; for the most part they only affect the luminous       in
tensity of these phosphors. Amongst the few bodies which
constitute an exception to this rule, may be mentioned the pro
   Phil. Mag. S. 4. No. 123. Suppl. Vol. 18.                 2M

580                       M.     Becquerel                on the Luminous Effects
ducts of the reaction of sulphur upon caustic strontia, and upon
lime.
   By following the indications contained in this research, phos
phorescent substances may be obtained which, after solar action,
emit much more vivid light than any before observed.
   5. The cause which produces the phaenomenon of phosphor
escence by the insolation of a substance, is probably different from
that whereon               its
                   crystalline state depends, and perhaps        con                                           is
nected with      density,its  with some peculiar physical property
                                                  or

such   a      substance possesses                         of   giving       an

platinum, diamond &c.; sometimes,                the contrary, those cor   on

of the alkaline earths.

   14. The properties manifested by glass in general, and espe
cially by flint-glass, show that in optical instruments this sub
stance may act as a luminous source; the rays emitted in virtue
of this action, although of small intensity, must mix themselves
with those transmitted through this substance.
   15. On passing electric discharges through tubes containing
phosphorescent substances in rarefied air, very remarkable lumi
nous effects are produced, and that not only during, but after
the passage of the electricity; in this manner we are enabled to
exhibit with great intensity the various phosphorescent phaeno
mena usually observed with solar light.         Hence with this dis
position we have effects analogous to those observed in the phos
phoroscope, except that here the electric discharges replace the
intermittent flashes produced by the solar light on penetrating
the latter instrument.
   This mode of experimenting, too, is well suited to the exhi
bition of the luminous properties of bodies which retain the                              im
pression of light only for a short time; for the observer here
sees the effects produced upon bodies immediately after the
passage of each discharge, and even when the luminous impression
of these discharges is retained for a time too short to be measured.
   These conclusions, which support the theory of undulation as
at present admitted, prove that luminous vibrations, when trans
mitted to any body, or at least to a great many bodies, compel                                its
molecules       to

  “On the Electric Properties of Insulating or Non-conducting    -
Bodies.” By Professor Carlo Matteucci of Pisa.
  The object of the author in the first part of this memoir is to
ascertain by experiment what condition is assumed by insulating or
non-conducting bodies in the presence of an electrified body, and in
what degree such condition is developed in insulating bodies of
different kinds.     In a memoir published nearly ten years ago (Ann.
de Chim. et de     Phys.,  xxvii. p. 134), he had shown that a cylinder of
gum-lac, sulphur, stearic acid, or the like, suspended by a filament
of silk, and brought near to a body charged with electricity, begins
to oscillate in the same way as a cylinder of metal. The non-con
ducting cylinder, whilst under the influence of induction, behaves
like any body charged with opposite electricities, and returns to                                      its
matural state when the induction ceases.
    These experiments have now been very carefully repeated with
cylinders formed              of
                        various insulating substances, made           nearly             as            as
possible        of
             the same    length  and  perfectly  diselectrized. The         was                 air
rendered perfectly dry, and the inducing ball was charged with
electricity      toconstant degree, measured

which leaves no doubt as to the presence of acetic acid.
  Still further proof of the same was obtained by converting a little
of the acid into a soda-salt, and heating it with arsenious acid.
Abundance of kakodyle was evolved.
   In order to remove any doubt which might exist as to the
source of this acetic acid, and to show that it did not arise from
oxidation of the ether which accompanied the sodium-methyle,                                                       I
operated upon some of the original sample which had never been
exposed to carbonic acid, and which, as previously mentioned, had
been laid aside for comparison.
  I   mixed it with a little mercury, distilled with excess of dilute
sulphuric acid, and digested the redistilled distillate with oxide of
silver, using the same samples of acid and of oxide of silver as in
the former experiment.
   The distillate neither smelt like acetic acid, nor yielded acetate of
                                                                                                   on its

with oxide     of
                silver.  Neither could   kakodyle     obtained   heating    be
its soda-residue with arsenious acid.
    From all which,          evident that the acetic acid obtained must

    The formula which expresses the relation of the bursting pressure
to the thickness and diameter of the globe, is—
                                           P=     *A ,>
where a = the longitudinal sectional area of the material in square
inches, that is in the line of rupture or line of minimum strength ;
A = the longitudinal sectional area of the globe in square inches;
and T = the tenacity of the glass in pounds per square inch.
Hence from the above experiments we deduce—
                                   Pounds.
                             T=4200 for flint-glass,

                                    5000-mean tenacity of glass.
Here the mean tenacity is nearly twice that obtained in the experi
ments upon thick bars; a result, which perhaps corresponds with the
 difference between the crushing strength of cylinders and cubes, and
 is largely attributable to the condition of ammealing.
     On the Resistance of Glass Globes and Cylinders to an external
pressure.—The manner of conducting these experiments did not
 differ in any essential detail from that pursued in the experiments
 upon wrought iron. The globes and cylinders, after having been
 hermetically sealed in the blowpipe flame, were fixed in a wrought
 iron boiler communicating with a hydraulic pump.                   In this position
 an increasing pressure was applied until the globes broke, the
 amount of pressure at the time being noted by means of a Schäffer
 pressure-gauge.         During the collapse the globes were reduced to
 the smallest fragments, so that no indication of the direction of the
 primary lines of fracture could be discovered.

   After the detail of certain experiments by which the author was
led to believe in the existence of a distinct system of compounds of
graphite, an account is given of a peculiar crystalline substance
formed by the prolonged oxidation of graphite.            This substance
consists of transparent plates of a pale yellow colour, which exhibit
under the microscope an appearance distinctly crystalline.        The ama

   Before commencing         research into the electric conductivity
                                                                                                               to of

determine their specific gravities; and the methods employed and
results obtained     this inquiry are given
                           in                  the present paper.     in
   The metals used were antimony, tin, cadmium, bismuth, silver,
lead, mercury, and gold.       The silver and gold were obtained                                              in
          purity from the refiners, the other metals were purified
          of                                                                                                   bya

was twenty grammes.         The fused alloys were cast in a form and
very thin, to avoid internal cavities from crystallization.         Three
separate determinations were made of their specific gravity, which, to
gether with the mean result, are given in Tables. In every case the
alloy was recast at least three times before the first determination, and
once again before each succeeding one. The distilled water used
in the weighing was first boiled and allowed to cool in vacuo, and
the alloys were suspended in it by a fine platinum wire, except the
soft amalgams, which were weighed in a tube similarly suspended.
In calculating the specific gravities, the weight of water displaced
was corrected for the temperature, the unit in        cases being distilled       all
water      0°C. All the
            at              weighings   were reduced         vacuum, and                to   a
a  correction was made for the     platinum   wire which    dipped       the                                  in
water.
   The numerical results are stated       three Tables,    which the first
                                                           in                            of

                                    the pure metals employed, and the
temperature      Centigrade degrees; the second gives the same
                      in                                                                                           of
the alloys; and the third exhibits the mean specific gravities found,
and the specific gravities      calculated,—1, from the volume
                                            as                           the                                  of

ing power for electricity; that the other metal, contained in small
quantity in the amalgam, acted by rendering the amalgam viscous,
and thereby interfering with the transference of heat by convection,
and that the low conducting power of mercury would show itself on
merely inclining the vessel used in the experiment, so that the box
containing the warm water should be higher than the other.               Ex
periment confirmed this view. As the apparent conducting power
of mercury was found continually to decrease with an increase in the
inclination of the vessel, it was found necessary, in order to obtain
correct results, to arrange so that the bar-shaped box containing the
mercury or fluid amalgam was actually vertical in the experiment.
In this way the authors obtained for mercury the figure 54, on the
same scale as before.      It is worthy of remark, that mercury comes.

away with in my apparatus at the rate of five per cent. per half
second, or even faster.      Hence a very moderate degree of insulation
is sensibly  as good   as  perfect,  so far as observing the atmospheric
effect is concerned.     It is easy, by my plan of drying the atmosphere
round the    insulating   stems   by   means of pumice-stone moistened
with  sulphuric  acid, to ensure a    degree of insulation in all weathers,
by which not more than five per cent. per minute will be lost by it
from the atmospheric apparatus at any time”. A little attention, to
keep the outer part of the conductor clear of spider lines, is necessary.
The apparatus I employed at Invercloy stood on a table beside a
window on the second floor, which was kept open about an inch to
let the discharging tube project out without coming in contact with
the frame. The nozzle was only about                                24 feet from the wall, and
nearly on a level with the window-sill.                              The divided ring electro
meter stood on the table beside               and acted  it,     very satisfactory

no oxidation due to the action of the atmosphere, for the same things

   Recent experiments made by M. Kühne in M. du Bois-Reymond's
laboratory, show that the opinion put forward by Brücke as to
the cause of the rigor mortis is perfectly well founded.       It appears
that this rigidity is the result of a spontaneous coagulation of a pro
teine substance which is contained in the muscles, but of which it is
impossible to say whether it is identical with the muscular fibrine of
Liebig, or with the syntonine of Lehmann.       The question may there
fore be raised, whether there is any causal relation between the
phaenomenon of the coagulation of this substance and the formation
of acid in the muscles. It does not appear, however, that there is
any necessary relation between these two phaenomena.        In fact M. du
Bois-Reymond      shows that heat may cause the coagulation of the
muscular substance, that is to say rigidity, without producing acidity.
   The investigations of which the preceding is an analysis, were
directed to the striated muscles.     M. du Bois-Reymond has extended
his studies to the non-striated    muscles,  and has arrived at the sur
prising result that these fibres pass from life to death, and lastly
become decomposed, without passing through any acid phase; their
reaction is always alkaline.
   M. du Bois-Reymond lastly set himself to prove that the effect of
the prolonged activity of a muscle is to set acid at liberty in its
interior.   With this view he irritated in succession by galvanism all
the parts of the nervous system of a frog, from the spinal cord to the
muscles of the leg, and continued the irritation until the effects ceased.
It may certainly be objected that the acid which is produced during
this tetanization may result from electrolytic actions induced by the
voltaic current in the muscular substance; but the author has found
a mode of operation which places his results out of the reach of
this objection.    He has also varied his experiments so as to keep
the animal alive during the operation.       In operating upon rabbits,
he has even succeeded in    demonstrating   the correctness of his theory
without    having  recourse to  galvanism.    For this purpose he cuts
the sciatic nerve on one side   only,  and then poisons the animal with
strychnine.    The rabbit dies in a state of general tetanus, in which
the muscles of the leg operated upon alone take no part.            If the
muscles of the two hind legs be then cut transversely, an acid
reaction is detected in the tetanized leg, whilst those of the leg
operated upon present no reaction.
   The heart, notwithstanding its constant activity, presents the same
reactions as the other muscles, except that it becomes acid rather
more rapidly after death.
   The fact that tetanus is attended by a production of acid in the
muscles, proves, moreover, that the acidity of the muscles is not
necessarily accompanied by rigor mortis.
   M. du Bois-Reymond is inclined to regard the acid of the muscles
as a lactic acid.-Bibl. de Genève, 1859, Bull. Scient. p. 70.
