   M. Biot attempts to illustrate the correctness of his list of
stars, though so irregularly distributed and in many instances so
inferior in importance, by stating that there is evidently a law in
their selection, and that a narrow mansion in one part of the
heavens corresponds to a narrow mansion in the opposite part;
so also with the wider mansions; so that the stars, at the epoch,
were situated in pairs on the same meridian.
   5. It is by the application of this test, which is to some extent
                                        I             I
approximately true, that think can detect a flaw which destroys
the necessity of passing so far back into past time as the twenty
fourth century B.c.    In the first of the three columns in Table
V., I have given the differences of AR for 2357 b.c. gathered
from M. Biot's results in Table I. It will there be seen that the
pairs of stars deviate from being on the same meridian by an
average =about 3°, if we earcept the third pair in which the
deviation is as much as 18° 15'. There must be some reason

 2357 B.c. being selected.           I can see no special reason. (1)
 Even if A. Orion is not      rejected,  it will be seen that the width of
 the third mansion is 2° 23' and 1958 at those two later dates,
 and these are not so inferior to 2° 43', the width in 2357 B.C.,
 as to induce any great preference for that epoch.              (2) By com
 paring the columns of declinations in Tables I. and III., it will
 be seen that the twenty-eight stars                 very much alike with        lie

astronomy, as being at the equinoxes and solstices in the time of
Yao. As one of the points (see Table II.) is wrong by 6° 46',
this confmits the Chou-king to an error of 487 years. Moreover,
these traditions are not to be relied upon as facts.               We have in
Indian     astronomy    an instance of an ancient        conjunction     of sun,
moon, and planets stated as if an observed phenomenon, whereas
it is clear that the idea (which is false in fact) was come at by
calculating backwards, and that upon defective data.                   (5) An
other thing which M. Biot appears to think confirmatory of his
epoch is this.      He states that the Chinese used to observe with
care the motion of the circumpolar stars in the Dragon, the
 Great Bear, and the Lesser Bear, and two in Lyra ; and conjec
 tures that the position of the declination-circles passing through
 them at that epoch influenced the astronomers in the choice of
 the stars which define the twenty-eight mansions. Eleven, how
 ever, of the mansions have none of these circles passing through
 them, and the angular distances of the others from the nearest
 stars vary through             all
                             degrees        magnitude between
                                                          of                 and

the Emperor Yao, even supposing he was a historical character,

it altogether untrustworthy. If the data were more exact, the

the Lake of Geneva entirely corroborate this view.
    Three Centigrade mercurial thermometers, capable of showing
the tenth part of a degree, were fixed at different heights round
a vertical pole about 16 feet long.       Each thermometer was
attached to the extremity of a horizontal rod fixed to the pole,
and sufficiently long to ensure the thermometers being sus
pended, not over the boat from which the experiments were to
be made, but directly over the surface of the water.   One of the
thermometers was    placed  at a  height of about 3 inches above
the surface of the water, the second at about 6 feet, and the
 third at 15 feet. Three series of observations were made du
 ring the evenings of the 26th and 28th of October, at about
 600 yards from land, under the most favourable circum
 stances—the sky being beautifully clear, and the surface of the
 lake unruffled by the slightest breeze. The observations were
 commenced a quarter of an hour before sunset, and renewed
 every half hour until three-quarters of an hour after sunset.
 The following is the average result of the observations noted
 during the evening of the 26th of October:-               O

    I conceived the rotating matter to be the substance of certain
cells, divided from each other by cell-walls composed of particles
which are very small compared with the cells, and that it is by
the motions of these particles, and their tangential action on the
substance in the cells, that the rotation is communicated from
one cell to another.                     -
    I  have not attempted to explain this tangential action, but it
is necessary to suppose, in order to account for the transmission
of rotation from the exterior to the interior parts of each cell,
that the substance in the cells possesses elasticity of figure,
 similar in kind, though different in degree, to that observed in
 solid bodies. The undulatory theory of light requires us to
 admit this kind of elasticity in the luminiferous medium, in
 order to account for transverse vibrations.         We need not then
 be surprised   if the magneto-electric medium possesses the same
 property.
     According to our theory, the particles which form the partitions
 between     the cells constitute the matter of electricity.       The
 motion of these particles constitutes an electric current; the
 tangential force with which the particles are pressed by the
 matter of the cells is electromotive force, and the pressure of
 the particles on each other corresponds to the tension or poten
 tial of the electricity.
     If we can now explain the condition of a body with respect to
 the   surrounding   medium when it is said to be “charged ” with
 electricity, and account for the forces acting between electrified
  bodies, we shall have established a connexion between all the
 principal phenomena of electrical science.
     We know by experiment that electric tension is the same
  thing, whether observed in statical or in current electricity; so
  that an electromotive force produced by magnetism may be
  made to charge a Leyden jar, as is done by the coil machine.
     When a difference of tension exists in different parts of any
  body, the electricity passes, or tends to pass, from places of
  greater to places of smaller tension. If the body is a conductor,
  an actual passage of electricity takes place; and if the difference
  of tensions is kept up, the current continues to flow with a
  velocity proportional inversely to the resistance, or directly to the
   conductivity of the body.
      The electric resistance has a very wide range of values, that
   of the metals being the smallest, and that of glass being so
   great that a charge of electricity has been preserved” in a glass
   vessel for years without penetrating the thickness of the glass.
      Bodies which do not permit a current of electricity to flow
  -through   them are called insulators.     But though electricity does

 not flow through them, electrical effects are propagated through
 them, and the amount of these effects differs according to the
 nature of the body; so that equally good insulators may act
 differently as dielectrics”.
     Here then we have two independent qualities of bodies, one
 by which they allow of the passage of electricity through them,
 and the other by which they allow of electrical action being
 transmitted through them without any electricity being allowed
 to pass. A conducting body may be compared to a porous
 membrane which opposes more or less resistance to the passage
 of a fluid, while a dielectric is like an elastic membrane which
may be impervious to the fluid, but transmits the pressure of the
 fluid on one side to that on the other.
    As long as electromotive force acts on a conductor, it produces
 a current which, as it meets with resistance, occasions a continual
transformation of electrical energy into heat, which is incapable
 of being restored again as electrical energy by any reversion of
the process.
    Electromotive force acting on a dielectric produces a state of
polarization of                 its
                        parts similar       distribution    inthe polarity            to                      of

These relations are independent of any theory about the internal
mechanism of dielectrics; but when we find electromotive force
producing electric displacement in a dielectric, and when we find
the dielectric recovering from its state of electric displacement
with an equal electromotive force, we cannot help regarding the
phenomena as those of an elastic body, yielding to a pressure,
and recovering                its
                       form when the pressure             removed.              is

IV.       On the Direction of the Joints in the Faces of Oblique Arches.
                By G. B. AIRY, Esq., Astronomer Royal+.
MY       attention was lately called to the following passage in Mr.
        Buck’s ‘Essay on Oblique Bridges,’ 2nd edition, p. 7.
“After having had several drawings of the faces of oblique arches
made on a large scale and projected with great exactitude, we ob
served that the following remarkable property exists. If the lines,
which are the chords of the small curves forming the joints in
the face of the arch, be produced, they will         meet     one point
                                                                   all      in

regards the relation between the angle which the face-plane

  The equation of the plane of the face of the arch is watan S. &.
  The combination of these two equations gives the face-joint.
The second enables us to eliminate z from the first, and we have
;=tan (H-n.cotan B. a.).                         If X be        the horizontal coordinate
measured   in the plane of the face, we can, for joints necessarily
in the plane  of the face, make wasin B. X; and then the equa-.

This is not the equation to a straight line; and therefore the
face-joint is curved.

the face-joint, either where it meets the intrados, or at the middle
of the arch-stones’ depth, in the following manner:—Let a be the
radius of the cylindrical surface which forms the intrados, or of
that which passes through the middle of the stones' depth (as
the case may be). And           +8a        let

 32      M. G. Kirchhoff               on the Relation       of the Lateral Contraction
partly by the screws y, y. In order to ascertain whether the
desired parallelism exists, I have adopted the following method:—
In two points of the 8 axis of the scale are fastened the threads
f, f, which terminate below in two loops. In these loops a rod
g, of similar dimensions to those of the rod d, is placed.     The
length of the threads is so chosen that both rods are of about
the same height, one behind the other. On the rod g is sus
pended a strip of mirror by means of hooks, which are like the
hooks of a level, fig. 4, Plate I. ; upon this mirror is directed
a telescope, in front of whose object-glass a plummet is so sus
pended that the inmage of the plummet is covered by the vertical
cross-hair of the telescope.    Thereupon the same strip of mirror
is suspended  to the rod  d, and this is so arranged that, when the
position of the telescope remains unchanged, the image is covered
as before.
    On the ends of the rod d are screwed the supports of two
silver mirrors h, h, the centres of which must be almost in the
lines of vision of the two telescopes.   To judge whether this is
the  case, there are two leads suspended  to the intersection of the
threads, which, as already mentioned, are underneath each of the
two object-glasses.    Each mirror can be moved within narrow
limits towards             its
                     support      means         by

42     M. G. Kirchhoff         on the Relation    of the Lateral Contraction
     Inowpass on to a statement          of the numerical results which the
observations and measurements             have given.
     As far as the scale is concerned, the parts of each axis were
not found exactly equal, yet the differences which they exhibited
were so small that they may be here neglected. The differences
of the mean value of one part of the É axis, and of the mean
value of a part of the m axis, were, however, more considerable.
From the measurements made the former is 1:7993 millim., the
latter 1-8086 millim.
   An approximate value for C is 2357 millims. In the experi
ments the particulars of which            I

not the same, since, as mentioned above, the divisions of the É

    It would be interesting to ascertain whether with rods of a
different section to that of those here investigated, the above rela
tion would be as great.      If that were the case, the assumption
here made would be       thereby   confirmed, that a hardened steel
rod may be considered homogeneous, and of the same elasticity
in different directions. Objections may be raised against this
assumption; in fact it may be assumed that in the hardening, in
which heat flows from the axis towards the periphery, the elas
ticity in the direction of the axis is different to what it is in direc
tions rectangular thereto, and that the molecules in the external

layers have a different arrangement to those nearer the axis.                       If
this is the case, it is probably also the case in different directions
according to the thickness of the rod, and accordingly the latter
relation will be different in thick from what it is in thin rods.

  In conclusion mention some experiments made with a hard
drawn brass rod of almost the same dimensions as those of the
          ;
three steel rods. The experiments are of exactly the same kind
as those made with each of the steel rods, excepting that weights
of 50 gr. and 100 gr. were used instead of weights of 100 gr.
and 200 gr. The following values of B and T were found for

  This number has certainly not the same importance as that
which     I
         have thought myself justified in assigning to the corre
sponding numbers in the case of steel rods, for the elasticity of
a drawn brass rod is certainly different in the direction of the
axis to what it is in others.

to be in the neighbourhood; they are under the impression that
they heard the music several times in the course of the evening ;
they remember also to have noticed clouds in the direction of
Killeter. On reaching Killeter the same evening, they were told
of the wonderful shower of stones which had spread over several
fields. I received the fragments of these stones from the Rev.
Dr. M'Ivor, Ex-Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, and Rector
of Ardstraw: he writes to me that “it is now very difficult to
get either a specimen of a stone, or any very distinct intelligence
of them : even the very rumour of them has nearly died out, and
     might ask intelligent middle-aged men about the neigh

that the people of that locality are very “uncurious,”  and that,
if there were a veritable  burning   bush thereabouts, few would
“turn                 aside to see.”                                                    -

    Omitting the alumina, the preceding analysis gives the rational
 formula of the Hornblende family,
                                4RO, 3SiO3,
 and, taken as a whole, it agrees with the analysis of many Horn
 blendes.     The variety of Hornblende with which it has the
 closest relation is Anthophyllite.
    According to Mr. Greg's ‘Catalogue of Meteoric Stones and
 Irons,’ three other falls of acroliths are recorded as having oc
 curred in Ireland:—
    1. A.D. 1779, at Pettiswood, Westmeath; 6 oz.
    2. August, 1810, Mooresfort, Co. Tipperary; 73 lbs. Spec.
            grav. = 3,670.
    3. September 10, 1813, Adare, Co. Limerick; 17 lbs. + 65
            lbs. --24 lbs.; moving E. to W. Spec. grav. = 3-64.
    4.  April  29, 1844, Killeter, Co. Tyrone; fragments of one
            stone.     Spec. grav. = 3-761.
    Of   the meteorite that fell at Mooresfort, co. Tipperary, in
1810, the only analysis on record is one published by the late
Professor Higgins, in the forty-seventh volume of the ‘Proceedings
of the Royal Dublin Society,” in whose museum the greater part
of this stone, and a cast of the entire, are carefully preserved.
My friend Mr. Robert          H. Scott   has undertaken to analyse  a
portion of it afresh.
    Professor Higgins considered 35 per cent. of the stone to con
sist of metallic particles separable by the magnet. This would
include the magnetic pyrites, iron, nickel, and chrome. In the
Tyrone meteorite examined by me, the iron, nickel, chrome
oxide, and magnetic pyrites amounted to 35-40 per cent, which
is very nearly the same proportion.
    Dr. Apjohn has published a detailed account of his analysis of
the Adare meteorite in the eighteenth volume of the ‘Transactions
of the Royal Irish Academy,’ from which it appears that the fol
lowing is the mineralogical composition of that meteorite:-

    published in the Philosophical Magazine of January 1859,
an account of two new minerals, found by the Rev. Messrs.
Hislop and Hunter near Nágpur, Central India. Being anxious
to obtain additional information respecting the geological mode
of occurrence of these minerals, I wrote to Mr. Hislop, who fur
nished me with information respecting them, from which extract                                            I

   Hislopite.—This mineral was found in a small stream which
flowed down from a trap-hill at Takli. It was discovered by a
servant of Major Wapshaw, an officer of the Madras army.      Mr.

imbedded       the volcanic rock, which has been dispersed
strings       by
           the effusion, and which, generally speaking, contains
a pretty equal proportion   calcareous and siliceous ingredients.”

probably once completely covered by a considerable thickness of
trap-rock, which still remains as an outlier in Sitábaldi Hill,
about 300 yards from the watercourse in which the pegmatite
dyke penetrates the gneiss. The trap-rocks of this hill are hori
zontally bedded, and interstratified with a freshwater stratum
containing Physa and other shells.
    It is certain, from the occurrence of such a mineral as Hun
terite in the dyke penetrating the gneiss, that this dyke must be
regarded as a fissure filled by the action of water holding mineral
matter in solution under pressure and at a high temperature;
and as the gneiss (10) itself contains Hunterite, it also must have.
been to some extent subjected to the same Neptuno-Plutonic
agency.

mexion  of the ponderable and imponderable elements of the uni
verse.  We are indeed striving to carry the domain of the induc
tive experimental     philosophy into the properties of the subtile
matters called, often, the imponderables, and searching for the
causes of the development of mechanical force in the actions,
reactions, affinities, incompatibilities, &c. of these subtile agents,
which are struggling to pass from the state of instability which
has been impressed upon them by an omnipotent power to a state
of stable equilibrium, through the properties which they possess.
The phenomena of the actions of these properties in their inde
finitely varying states constitute the phenomena of nature; and
in investigating them we are striving to attain the highest degree
of knowledge within the reasoning powers which have been con
ferred upon us. We must therefore be content with the progress
of knowledge which the inductive philosophy affords to us, and
leave wild dreams and speculations to the day-dreamers and spe
culators, and receive as probable only such theories and hypo
theses as have an experimental basis, and for the probability of
which good reasons can be advanced.
  From the time of the discoveries of Dr. Black in heat, about a
century ago, the advance of our knowledge has been great,
although apparently slow, and often deviating from a straight
course.   The properties now proposed to be discussed are amongst
those which require peculiar watchfulness of our instruments, as
changing properties are to be learnt, and evanescent results are
to be noted.
   It has long been known that, in popular language, high-pres
sure steam blows cold.   Now this means that a jet of steam from
a boiler in which it exists of high temperature and elastic force,
on being allowed to escape through an aperture into the air, soon
loses    its
          high temperature and gives feeling
                                          a             of
                                                        cold         to

 on which       strikes. The sensible heat of the steam has dimi
               it
 nished, because         its
                          capacity for caloric has increased              by
                                                                         ex    its

 the question for consideration whether the change             of
                                                              capacity for

"issues, the sensible heat increases, and the capacity               in

                           that we must conclude that the change
 the  capacity   for caloric   developed only
                                is                 insome time after the

       That the properties of gases are analogous to those of steam,
   as related above, there can be no doubt; that                      expanding                  is,   on

      We are not without popular results which we may treat                                                             as

56     Prof. Potter on the Fourth Law of the Relations of the
had other experiments in view on the same subject, and soon
after  I procured one of M. Breguet's exceedingly sensitive me
tallic helix thermometers, by means of which I hoped to ascer
tain directly the temperature of an expanding jet of air entering
the exhausted receiver of an air-pump, but was disappointed in
obtaining anything more than confirmatory results, and should
not by means of it have ascertained the law. This arose from
the unsteadiness and vibrations of the helix and index-needle
when a jet passed through them, even when an addition had
been made to the instrument to steady the index-necdle at the
expense of a small loss of sensibility.       This addition consisted of
a small brass vertical   pillar  screwed into the pedestal under the
centre of the   helix, with a small cylindrical hole down a part of
its axis, which was directly over       small polished agate cup

was considerably agitated by the jet, and the index-needle set
into vibration, so that tenths of degrees could not be read off
with quickness and certainty.
                          I
    In January 1854 used a method of experiment similar to
that with Marcet's boiler, described in the paper of 1853, namely,
the exterior thermometer having been compared with Breguet's
within the reciver, this latter fell on the pump being worked;
and when it had risen gradually to some particular degree, the
jet was allowed to pass for about one second, and the effect upon
the index-needle noted. When the barometer-gauge of the air
pump stood about half the height of the barometer, we had
 8-P-P       = 1 nearly; and if Breguet's thermometer           stood 4°,
 3°, 23°,    11%,”,   or 1° degree below the exterior thermometer,
 it rose  instantly   on the jet passing through the helix; but when
 the difference was only 4%;" it fell.         These are in accordance
 with the former       results, which   gave  3% as the temperature of
 such a jet; but the actual readings of the index, contrary to
        I
 what had hoped for, were irregular and uncertain.
     Experiments were then tried of rarefactions about five and
 three; or if the barometer stood at 30 inches, the jet was passed
 through the helix when the barometer-gauge stood at about 25
                                                   —n'
 inches and about 23 inches, for then        8=*Tº      became
                                                   p'

                       –5-–       2 and
                                         8=+++=83.
  The first motion of the needle was always in the direction due
  to cold; but the very great agitation of the helix and index-needle
  from the violence of the jet, prevented a reading being obtained
  before the temperature approached that of the external air.
  Accordingly this method of experiment only confirmed the
  results of the paper of 1853, without adding anything to them.
     The next method of experiment which I adopted was with a
  Newman’s air-pump, and the Breguet's thermometer placed
  under a glass, receiver upon the plate.           Newman's air-pump
  having a single barrel of large dimensions, a considerable ex
  haustion of a moderate-sized        receiver is obtained by the first
  stroke of the piston; and this can be easily performed, and the
  communication cut off by the stopcock in one second of time.
  The object was to find the effect of such rapid exhaustion on the
  thermometer, and then by using receivers of different sizes
  giving different degrees of exhaustion for the same single stroke
  of the pump, to find the law for the corresponding changes of
                            * ºth of a millimetre.

 58        Prof. Potter on the Fourth Law of the Relations of the
 temperature. A considerable degree of cold was produced by
 even a small amount of expansion; but the time required was
 eight or nine seconds before the thermometer reached          mini                                         its
 mum. This slowness          great measure in  doubt arises from

thermometer at 58°5, we have as follows:—By a stroke of the
piston performed in one second with a large receiver and New
man's air-pump, the mercury in the barometer-gauge rose, on the
average of seven experiments which differed only slightly, to
2.64 inches, and falling gradually during some minutes rested at
2.01 inches; then

which differs a little from the experiment, in which we have
reason to expect a loss of heat.
   In other experiments with the same receiver, the     dried         air   by
passing through     V-tube with
                       a         pumice moistened with sulphuric
acid, the results gave
                                    t”—t"=13°-5,
and Poisson’s formula 14°-8; which are closer than the former.

    In   another experiment with the smallest receiver                                                  the result

   These are nearly in arithmetic progression for condensations
in arithmetic progression, according to Poisson’s law. On the

  The experiments differed only slightly amongst themselves, and,
with the exception of those where the height of the gauge was
4 inches, they form a very certain arithmetic progression in
accordance with M. Poisson’s rule; but the absolute increase of
temperature is very little                   than one-half what his expression

taken place.
   The law of the increase of temperature being as the condensa

which the other methods did not show; whilst the time in which
it occurred may have been much less than one second, as exhi
bited by the thermometer.

THE     following extract from Professor Kirchhoff's interesting
     memoir “On the Solar Spectrum, and the Spectra of the
Chemical Elements,” just published, with magnificent maps of
the lines, in the ‘Transactions of the Berlin Academy,” and about
to appear in English, may interest your readers as helping to
explain the appearance of the blue band in the spectrum of in
tensely ignited lithium vapour, first noticed by Dr. Tyndall, and
referred to in your Number of last month by Dr. Frankland.
    “The position of the bright lines (or, to speak more precisely,
the maxima of light in the spectrum of an incandescent vapour)
is independent of the temperature, of the presence of other sub

 low temperature.      This influence on the mass of the temperature
 of the incandescent gas explains perfectly why, in the spectra of
 many metals, those lines which are the most prominent when the
 metal is placed in the colourless gas-flame, are not the most       di
 stinct when the spectrum of the induction-spark from the metal
 is examined.      This is most clearly seen in the case of the calcium
 spectrum.      I have found that if a wet string or a narrow tube
 filled with water be placed in the circuit of the Leyden jar which
 gives the spark, and if the electrodes be moistened with a solu
 tion of chloride of calcium, a spectrum is obtained which coin
 cides exactly with that seen when a chloride-of-calcium bead is
 placed in the colourless gas-flame. Those lines appear absent
 which are the most distinct when an entire metallic circuit is
 employed. If the narrow column of water be replaced by a
 column of larger sectional area and of shorter length, a spectrum
 is produced in which both those lines which are seen in the flame
 and those obtained by the intense spark are equally plainly
 visible.    In this experiment we see the mode in which the cal
 cium   spectrum,   as given in the flame, may be converted into that
 produced by the bright electric spark.”
     I may likewise add that, in lately examining the spectrum
 of lithium obtained by the induction-spark from a Ruhmkorff’s
 coil with one of Steinheil's prisms, Professor Clifton and I ob
 served the appearance of two blue lines, one of which (probably
 the line noticed by Dr. Tyndall) we found to be coincident with
the common blue strontium line 8, whilst the other coincided
 with a seeond blue strontium line, which became first apparent
in the spark-spectrum of this metal. Whether the lines thus
produced in the spectra of lithium and strontium will prove to be
coincident when examined with a larger number of prisms and
with a higher magnifying power we are unable at present finally
to decide; but by employing three of Steinheil's prisms, each
having a refracting angle of 60°, there appeared to us a slight
difference in refrangibility between the first blue lithium line and
the line Sr 8,-this difference, however, not being so large as that
between the two sodium lines. We hope to be able before long to
give a definite answer to this in portant and interesting question.
The explanation of the coincidence by possible presence of strontia
in the lithia, is disposed of by the fact that when the blue lines
are most intense no trace of the orange or red strontium lines a,

sulphate, being a portion of some pure salt sent me by Professor
Bunsen; the strontium-salts employed were the chloride and           ni
trate, and with both of these the same coincidence was observed.

IX.     On the inapplicability  of the  new term “Dyas’ to the            “Per
    mian’” Group of Rocks,        as proposed by Dr. Geinitz.             By Sir
    Roderick IMPEY MURchison, F.R.S., D.C.L., LL.D.                          &c.,
    Director-General of the Geological Survey of Britain%.
 INforthe“Permian,”
           year 1859 M. Marcou proposed to substitute the word “Dyas”
                       and summed up his views by saying that he re
 garded   “the New Red Sandstone, comprising the Dyas and Trias,
 as a  great geologic period, equal in time and space to the Palaeozoic
 epoch of the Graywacke (Silurian and Devonian), the Carboniferous
 (Mountain-limestone and Coal), the Mesozoic (Jurassic and Creta
 ceous), the Tertiary (Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene), and the recent
 deposits (Quaternary and later)”!!t.
    As that author, who had not been in Russia, criticized the labours
 and inductions of my associates de Werneuil and von Keyserling, and
myself, in having proposed the word “Permian’” for tracts in which
 he surmised that we had commingled with our Permian deposits
much red rock of the age of the Trias,       I briefly defended the views
 I  had further sustained    by   personal   examination of the rocks of
 Permian age in various other countries of Europet.
    It was, indeed, evident that M. Marcou's proposed union of the so
 called Dyas and Trias in one natural group could not for a moment
be maintained, since there is no conclusion on which geologists and
palaeontologists are more agreed, than that the series composed of
 Roth-liegende, Kupfer-Schiefer, Zechstein, &c., forms the uppermost
 Palaeozoic group, and is entirely distinct in all its fossils, animal and
vegetable, from the overlying Trias, which forms the true base of
the Mesozoic or Secondary rocks.
    Owing to such a manifest confusion respecting the true palaeonto
logical value of the proposed “Dyas,” we should probably never have
heard more of the word, had not my distinguished friend, Dr. Geinitz
of Dresden, recently issued the first volume of his valuable palae
ontological work, entitled ‘Dyas, oder die Zechstein-Formation und
das Rothliegende’ $. In borrowing the term “Dyas” from Marcou,
Dr. Geinitz shows, however, that that author had been entirely
mistaken in grouping the deposits so named with the Trias or the
Lower Secondary rocks, and necessarily agrees with me in con
sidering the group to be of Palaeozoic age.
    As there is no one of my younger cotemporaries for whom have         I
a greater respect as a man of science, or more regard as a friend,
than Dr. Geinitz, it is painful, in vindicating the propriety and use
fulness of the word “Permian,” to be under the necessity of point
ing out the misuse and inapplicability of the word “Dyas.”

 66           Sir R. I. Murchison on the inapplicabity of the new
    The term “Permian’” was proposed twenty years ago for the
 adoption of geologists, without any reference whatever to the litho
 logical or mineral divisions of the group; for        well knew that a                         I
 certain order of mineral succession of this group prevailed in one
 tract, which could not be followed out in another. After surveys,
 during the summers of 1840 and 1841, of extensive regions in
 Russia in Europe, in which fossil shells of the age of the Zechstein of
 Germany, and the Magnesian Limestone of England, were found to
 occur in several courses of limestone, interpolated in one great series
 of red sandstones, marls, pebble-beds, copper-ores, gypsum, &c., and
 seeing that these varied strata occupied an infinitely larger super
 ficial area than their equivalents in Germany and other parts of
                   I
 Europe, suggested to my associates, when we were at Moscow in
 October 1851, that we should employ the term “Permian" as de
 rived from the vast Government of that name, over which and several
 adjacent Governments we had traced these deposits.
    In a letter addressed to the late venerable Dr. Fischer von Wald
 heim, then the leading naturalist of Moscow,        therefore proposed                     I
 the term “Permian’’ ”, to represent by one unambiguous geogra
 phical term a varied mineral group, which neither in Germany nor
elsewhere had then received one collective namet adopted by geolo
gists, albeit it was characterized by one typical group only of animal
 and vegetable remains.      As the subdivisions of this group in Ger
many consisted, in ascending order, of Roth-liegende, with the sub
ordinate strata of Weiss-liegende, Kupfer-Schiefer, and Lower and
Upper Zechstein, and in England of Lower Red Sandstone and Mag
nesian Limestone, with other accompanying sands, marls, &c., so well
described by Sedgwick f, the name of “Permian”—purposely de
signed to comprehend these various strata—was readily adopted, and
has since been generally used.       Even Geinitz himself, as well as his
associate, Gutbier, published a work under the name of the ‘Per
mische System in Sachsen                   'S.

               term      “Dyas”               to the   “Permian’” Group of Rocks.                            67
America no other term in reference to this group has been used for
the last fifteen years.
  The chief reason assigned by Geinitz for the substitution of the
word “Dyas”        that    is,
                          parts   Germany the group

two essential parts only—the Roth-liegende below, and the Zechstein
above, the latter being separated abruptly from      overlying de                      all
posits.
    Now, not doubting that this arrangement suits certain localities,
I  affirm that        it entirely inapplicable
                          is                           many other tracts.

self have appealed, in the work on ‘Russia and the Ural Mountains,”
and which     I have further developed in Memoirs read before the
Geological Society and in my two editions of “Siluria,’ be shown to
be inaccurate,   I hold to the opinion that there are tracts in which
the Zechstein is simply a fossiliferous zone in a great sandstone
series, to which no division by numerals can be logically applied.
          I
Even if do not appeal to the natural evidences in England, Russia,
 and parts of Germany, but refer to those tracts where the Zechstein
or Magnesian Limestone has no natural red cover,            I may well ask,
does not the word “Permian,” in the sense in which it was origi
nally adopted, serve for every tract wherein the uppermost palaeo
zoic fossil animals and plants are found, whether the strata of which
the group is composed form, as in Russia and Silesia, one great series
of alternations of plant-bearing sandstones and marls in parts con
taining bands of fossiliferous limestone, or whether, as in other
tracts, the Zechstein stands alone (as near Saalfeld), or in others,
again, where the group is tripartite, and even quadripartite? Quite
irrespective, however, of the question of whether there are or are
not localities in Germany where the Zechstein passes upwards into a
red rock, which forms no true part of the Bunter Sandstein of the
Trias, we have only to look to the environs of Dresden, on the one
hand, and to Lower Silesia on the other, to see the inapplicability
of the word “Dyas” to this group.
    Near the capital of Saxony, Dr. Geinitz himself pointed out to
me that the Roth-liegende is there divided into two very dissimilar
parts; and these, if added to the limestone which is there inter
polated, or to the true Zechstein of other places, constitute a Trias.
Again, Beyrich, in his Map of Lower Silesia *, has divided the vast
Roth-liegende of those mountains into Lower and Upper, the two
embracing eight subdivisions according to that author.
    In repeating, then, that the word “Permian * was not originally
proposed with the view of affixing to this natural group any number
of component parts, but simply as a convenient short term to define
the Uppermost Palaeozoic group,         I  refer all geologists to the very
words   I used in the   year  1841,    when the name was first suggested.
In speaking of the structure of Russia,         I thus wrote:—“The Car
boniferous system is surmounted to the east of the Wolga by a vast
series of beds of marls, schists, limestones, sandstones, and conglo
merates, to which    I  propose to give the name of ‘Permian System,”
because, although this series represents as a whole the Lower New
Red Sandstone (Rothe-todte-liegende) and the Magnesian Limestone
or Zechstein, yet it cannot be classed exactly, whether by the suc
cession of the strata or their contents, with either of the German or

 British subdivisions of this age +.”
    After pointing to the Governments of Russia over which such
 Permian rocks ranged,      I   added:—“Of the fossils of this system,
 some undescribed species of Producti might seem to connect the
 Permian with the Carboniferous era; and other shells, together with

“Dyas” for the older name “Permian,”          take this opportunity     I                                                 of

rated the several axioms which Euclid tacitly assumes.                Instead of
showing, in a very questionable manner too, how the 11th and 12th
propositions of the third book might have been proved directly had
they been placed after the 18th proposition, would it not have been
better to have proposed a rearrangement of the whole book—to
have given a sketch, in fact, of a better treatment of the many beau
tiful properties of the circle 7
    The collection of geometrical exercises given by Mr. Potts is an
other characteristic feature of his work, and has also been improved.
In order to give to exercises their full value, however, and to prevent
them from degenerating into mere riddles, they should be made sub
ordinate to, and illustrative of geometrical methods; and this, it
must be admitted, Mr. Potts has not been able to do fully, since, for
other and good reasons, he has preferred selecting his exercises from
college and university examination-papers.          Comparing his selections
with others, however, we cannot but agree with the Reviewer whom
Mr. Potts himself quotes in his preface. With respect to the first
of the exercises “on tangencies,” we will merely caution the student
against accepting the author's analysis, either as a model for imitation
or as a specimen of Mr. Potts’ ability; it is unusually defective.
The very enunciation of the problem is objectionable, disfigured as
it is by the introduction of the perfectly irrelevant datum “of a line
given in position.”
    We do not care to dwell longer upon imperfections which, if not
trivial, are certainly far outweighed in importance by the many
excellent features of the book. We will merely repeat, then, that
although we trust the work, considered as an introduction to the
science of geometry, will some day be superseded, we are convinced
 that as a careful English reproduction of Euclid's Elements, illustrated
 by the notes of an able and judicious teacher, and enriched by a
 large collection of very useful exercises, it will long maintain its
 ground.

     The case in which the upper edge of such a plate (supposed rec
 tangular) is fixed is first discussed; and then that in which the lower
 edge is fixed. Each of these cases is considered subject to the con

   Each plate would under these circumstances descend faster than
the one beneath; and supposing the adherence of the lowest plate to
the board to be the same as that of the plates to one another, then, of
any number of blocks similarly placed and subject to the like varia
tion of temperatures, the thickest or deepest would descend, at its
surface, the fastest; and if there were a block of different depths in
different parts, the deepest parts would descend the fastest. The
differential motion thus set up would not be appreciable in a block
of ice of different thicknesses in different parts if           dimensions                                      its

proportion than that sustained by the lead upon the board, and
variations of temperature far less, without passing the limits within
which a probability is created by the experiment that the descent of
the glacier is due to the same cause as that of the lead.
   In the act of descending on the board, the slab of ice of which we
have spoken could not but be thrown into a state of extension in
some parts and of compression in another.        The conditions of the
descent being in other respects given, the amount of this extension or
compression might be at any point determined.        If at any point the
extension exceeded the  tenacity of the ice, the slab would there sepa
rate across its length;  and if at any point  the compression exceeded
the resistance to crushing, it would there crush.
   Supposing it to be thinner at the sides than in the middle, the sur
face-motion of the middle would be faster than that of the sides, and
from this differential motion would result cracks oblique to the axis of
the slab, the explanation of which, as they exist in glaciers, is one of
the most successful attempts yet made at the solution of the me
chanical problem of glacier-motion.      These conditions of the descent
of the slab, when referred to a glacier, explain the formation of trans
verse and lateral crevasses, and the fact of a glacier crushing itself
through a gorge.
    The Mer de Glace moves faster by day than by night*. Its mean
daily motion is twice as great during the six summer as during the six
winter monthst. It moves fastest in the hottest months, and in those
months varies its motion the most, because in them the variations of
temperature are the greatest.     It moves most slowly in the coldest
months, and in those varies its motion the least, because in those
months the variations of temperature are the least. These differences
 are more remarkable at lower stations on a glacier than at higher, “be
 cause the lower are exposed to more violent alternations of heat and
 cold than the higher : this (says Forbes) we shall find to be general.”
    It moves fastest on the hottest days. “This apprehend (says                        I
 Forbes) to be clearly made out from my experiments, that thaw

of the atmosphere is unaccompanied by                                      a corresponding                   change         in
the mean motion of the glacier.
   The glacier moves with different velocities at different depths, the
surface-motion being faster (probably two or three times) than that of
the deepest part. The motions at different depths cannot but be re
lated to one another: so that as the influence of variations of tempe
rature is felt on the surface, it cannot but be felt throughout the glacier.
    Ifevery change of solar heat is associated with a corresponding
change of glacier-motion, it seems to follow that the two are either
dependent upon some common cause, or that the one set of changes
is caused by the other; and the former of these conclusions being
inadmissible, we are forced on the latter.      It is not necessary to show
how it is that   changes   of external temperature   penetrate glaciers. Of
the power of the sun upon them there are, however, evidences in the
ablation of surface constantly going on and in the preservation of the
ice which is covered by the stones of a moraine, which sometimes
forms an icy ridge from 50 to 80 feet high, and some hundred feet in
width.
    “The sun's rays,” says Tyndall*, “striking upon the unpro
tected surface of the glacier, enter the ice to a considerable depth ;
and the consequence is that the ice near the surface of the glacier is
always disintegrated, being cut up into minute fissures and cavities
filled with water and air, which, for reasons already assigned, cause
the glacier when it is clean to appear white and opaque. The ice
under the moraines, on the contrary, is usually dark and transparent.
I   have sometimes seen it as black as pitch, the blackness being a
proof of          its
              great transparency, which prevents the reflexion     light                                         of
from its interior.    The ice under the moraines cannot be assailed in
its  depths             by
                 the solar heat, because this heat becomes obscure be
         reaches the ice, and           lacks the power                                          byof

      XIII.                 of Vesicular Structure in Copper.
                 On the Cause
  By W.     J.   Russell, Ph.D., and A. MATTHIEssen, F.R.S.*
      LL  specimens of commercial copper, when carefully ex
        amined, are found to be more or less vesicular in their
structure: in some cases the vesicles are so small as to require a
magnifying glass to see them, but in other specimens they are
developed on a much larger scale.      Copper and silver are, we
believe, the only metals which may readily be made to assume a
vesicular structure.   In the case of silver, it is well known that
the fused metal absorbs oxygen, which being again given out on
cooling, produces the vesicular structure.    It appeared therefore
possible that the vesicular structure in copper might also be
caused by the absorption of some gas.       Our experiments have,
however,   proved this not to be the case, but have led us to the
same conclusion with regard to the cause of this porous struc
ture as that arrived at by Mr. Dicki. As, however, our experi
ments on some points have been rather more extended than his,
and remove, we believe,                  all
                                   doubt from the subject,          short      a
account    of
           them   may   not          be
                                without interest.                             *
  The amount         of
                    gas contained                in
                                        these cavities found      copper      in
was  evidently  too small      allowto       beingof        its
                                                     collected,      were         we
therefore obliged      carry
                          to      the investigation synthetically.

seemed, however, probable, from the inside           the cavities always

appearing untarnished, that they did not contain any oxygen.
In order, then, first          to
                           ascertain whether the vesicular structure
was owing      any mere absorption

air, carbonic acid, and carbonic oxide. With            gas the expe

gas was passed through when the melted copper was without
flux     covering; 2nd, when

                              the fuel fell into the melted copper.
Having satisfactorily proved that air and oxygen were the only
gases which caused the copper          become vesicular, and to   fact                                         in

   In another experiment of the same kind we varied the condi
tions by throwing on the charcoal before the fused copper had
been removed from the furnace; a vegetation in bulk nearly
equal to half that of the copper used took place.     In order to
give a more definite idea of the great extent to which the metal
becomes porous, we have taken the specific gravity of several of
these specimens of copper in which we have developed the vesi
cular structure.     The specific gravity of the copper operated on
in the last experiment was found to be only 5'683, whereas that
of pure copper is 8-952. Mr. Dick, in the paper before alluded

Th;       connexion between the distribution of lines of magnetic
       force and that of electric currents may be completely ex
pressed by saying that the work done on a unit of imaginary
magnetic matter, when carried round any closed curve, is pro
portional to the quantity of electricity which passes through the
closed curve.   The mathematical form of this law may be ex

86              Prof. Maxwell       on the      Theory of Molecular Vortices
conceives magnetism to consist in currents of a fluid whose direc
tion corresponds with that of the lines of magnetic force; and
electric currents, on this theory, are accompanied by, if not de
pendent on, a rotatory motion of the fluid about the axes of the
current.    Professor Helmholtz+ has investigated the motion of
an incompressible fluid, and has conceived lines drawn so as to
correspond at every point with the instantaneous axis of rotation
of the fluid there. He has pointed out that the lines of fluid
motion are arranged according to the same laws with respect to
the lines of rotation, as those by which the lines of magnetic force
are arranged with respect to electric currents.        On the other
hand, in this paper       have      I
                                regarded  magnetism    as a phenome
non of rotation, and electric currents as consisting of the actual
translation of particles, thus assuming the inverse of the relation
between the two sets of phenomena.
   Now it seems natural to suppose that      the direct effectsall any                      of
cause which      itself
                     is      longitudinal
                                    of   acharacter,  must      them                   be
selves longitudinal, and that the direct effects        rotatory cause   of   a
must      themselves rotatory.

current         in
              one direction  along  the axis rather than the other.
   Electric currents are known          produce effects
                                                     to       transference     of
 in the direction        the current. They transfer the electrical
                               of
state from one body         another, and they transfer the elements
                                    to
 ofelectrolytes      opposite directions, but they

88            Prof. Maxwell on the Theory of Molecular Vortices
the vortices accounts for induced currents, is supported by the
opinion of Professor W. Thomson*.             In fact the whole theory of
molecular vortices      developed   in this paper   has been suggested to
me   by  observing     the direction in which those investigators who
study the action of media are looking for the explanation of clec
tro-magnetic phenomena.
    Professor Thomson has pointed out that the cause of the mag
netic action on light must be a real rotation going on in the
magnetic field.       A right-handed circularly polarized ray of light
is found to travel with a different velocity according as it passes
from north to south, or from south to north, along a line of mag
netic force. Now, whatever theory we adopt about the direction
of vibrations in plane-polarized light, the geometrical arrange
ment of the parts of the medium during the passage of a right
handed circularly polarized ray is exactly the same whether the
ray is moving north or south. The only difference                    that the                           is,
particles describe their circles            opposite directions.     inSince,
therefore, the configuration         the same     the two cases, the forces

       applied to the Action of Magnetism on Polarized Light.                   89
    A  and B have been fully investigated by M. Verdet*, who has
shown that the rotation is strictly proportional to the thickness
and to the magnetizing force, and that, when the ray is inclined
to the magnetizing force, the rotation is as the cosine of that                 in
clination. D has been supposed to give the true relation between
the rotation of different rays; but it is probable that C must
be taken into account in an accurate statement of the phenomena.
The rotation varies, not exactly inversely as the square of the
wave-length, but a little faster; so that for the highly refrangible
rays the rotation is greater than that given by this law, but more
nearly as the index of refraction divided by the square of the
wave-length.
     The relation (E) between the amount of rotation and the size of
the vortices shows that different substances may differ in rota
 ting power independently of any observable difference in other
 respects.    We know nothing of the absolute size of the vortices;
 and on our hypothesis the optical phenomena are probably the
 only data for determining their relative size in different sub
 stances.
     On our theory, the direction of the rotation of the plane of
 polarization depends on that of the mean moment of momenta,
 or angular momentum, of the molecular vortices; and since M.
 Werdet has discovered that magnetic substances have an effect
 on light opposite to that of diamagnetic substances, it follows
 that the molecular rotation must be opposite in the two classes
  of substances.                                             -
     We can no longer, therefore, consider diamagnetic bodies as
 being those whose coefficient of magnetic induction is less than that
  of space empty of gross matter. We must admit the diamagnetic
  state to be the opposite of the paramagnetic; and that the vor
 tices, or at least the influential majority of them, in diamagnetic
  substances, revolve in the direction in which positive electricity
  revolves in the magnetizing bobbin, while in paramagnetic sub
  stances they revolve in the opposite direction.
     This result agrees so far with that part of the theory of M.
 Webert which refers to the paramagnetic and diamagnetic condi
 tions. M. Weber supposes the electricity in paramagnetic bodies
  to revolve the same way as the surrounding helix, while in dia
  magnetic bodies it revolves the opposite way. Now if we regard
 negative or resinous electricity as a substance the absence of
  which constitutes positive or vitreous electricity, the results will
  be those actually observed.          This will be true independently of
  any other hypothesis than that of M. Weber about magnetism

   In addition to the localitics near Torbay, it has been stated
that Beekites occur near Lidcot in Somersetshire; also in the
north of Scotland; while foreign localities for them have likewise
been mentioned.      Their appearance varies so much that it is
scarcely possible to give such a description of their general form as
shall include               all

of flints, agates, petrified woods, &c., and applies it in the case
of Beekites. In these instances a slow decomposition of an
alkaline silicate by means of carbonic acid is supposed.        Mr.
Kesteven thus describes his       theory:—“Fragments      of  coral,
broken by the waves, and deposited with the beach now consti
tuting rocks of red conglomerate, would retain a certain portion
of chlorides, while their decomposition would liberate the carbonic
acid which would separate the alkaline constituent of siliceous
springs, and cause the deposition of silica upon the nucleus of
coral. That a similar siliceous deposition is not found upon the
surrounding deposits is satisfactorily explained by the non-libe
ration of carbonic acid from the pebbles, into the composition of
which   its elements did not enter.        This view     strengthened             is                        by
            of                            the nucleus itself, the silicate

 Furthermore, where chalcedony presenting the Beekite characters

98             Mr. A. H. Church     on the Composition,
 the nuclei are slightly siliceous, but in no case more so than
 ordinary limestones are.”
    A correspondent at Exeter first directed my attention to
 these singular fossils, and not only gave me a large number of
 specimens, but much valuable information and many useful hints.
 The following interesting remarks are extracted from a letter
 lately received from this gentleman: to some of his remarks         I
 shall have occasion to refer when detailing my own theory and
 experiments.
    “The chief locality for them in this county is Torbay: have I
 heard that they are found at the Ness near Shaldon, and have   I
 a few from North Tawton. Beekites proper are confined to the
 New Red Sandstone, although a structure very near akin to it is
 found in the Mountain Limestone (I have one specimen); the
 same may be said of the Lias and the Greensand, but there the
rings (concentric ridges) are not so large.      I have often thought
whether this    peculiar arrangement   is not due to the displacement
 of carbonate of lime by silex which takes place in fossilization, as
the shells must originally have been carbonate of lime. The
              I
 experiment tried with hydrofluoric acid was on mammillated
or bubble chalcedony, to see if there were any connexion between
this structure and the Beekite. I thought the latter was the
 former with the tops of the mammillations either dissolved or
rubbed off; the appearance of the chalcedony after the application
of the acid rather favoured that supposition.    I have seen Beekites
with the mammillated structure on a part of them, and the
Beekite structure on the other, passing gradually from the one to
the other. The mammillated structure I speak of is found
abundantly in the interior of the flints at Haldon, and perhaps
in the Chalk also. I shall send you the Beekite which effervesces;
you will find that as the carbonate of lime is dissolved, the rings
more and more appear.        I shall also send a few specimens of
shells from the Greensand of Haldon.           With your glass you
will see that they are entirely made up of rings, such as are
shown in the Beekites on a larger scale.”
    Both Mr. Pengelly and Mr. Kesteven speak of the fragments
of coral and of limestone, to which they refer as the basis of
Beekite, as undergoing decomposition spontaneously; and it
seems that most other writers who have attempted an explanation
of the phenomena presented by these singular fossils, have made
the same assumption. We meet, for instance, with such explana
tions as the following:—“It seems probable that, after the forma
tion of the conglomerate beds, many of the calcareous pebbles
in them continued to decompose at the surface, and thus allowed
water, holding siliceous matter in solution, to pass through the
rock; and that, in passing, it deposited the chalcedony on the

                       Structure, and Formation of Beekite.                                                  99
diminished pebble, which in most cases continued to decompose.”
Of what nature is the decomposition of limestone which is here
spoken off and how did it originate 7 or did it occur at all? The
whole    problem before us resolves itself into two parts, which it
will   be better to examine separately.   We have to account for—
         I. The         chemical composition of Beekite; and
        II.   Its      physical appearance.                                                                  -

   The chemical causes concerned in the formation of Beekite
appear to me of peculiar interest.      It is reasonable to believe
that the removal of carbonate of lime from a shell or a coral, and
its replacement by silica, has been effected by the agency of
water holding carbonic acid and silica in solution together. Such
solutions occur frequently in nature, not only in springs like
those in the neighbourhood of the Iceland Geysers, but in several
places in Great Britain,_silica being, indeed, an almost invariable
constituent of common waters.      We may argue, then, that such
a solution filtering through  the débris of organic forms, not only
removes their carbonate of lime by virtue of the solvent power
of     its
       carbonic acid, but deposits some silica instead.    This sup
position has been tested and confirmed         experiment.      frag  by                             A

102    •: Qn the Composition, Structure, and Formation of Beekite.
These Imies are referable rather to the effects of pressure than to
 am bºgenit; ºrigin;-the frequent angularity of the specimens
póniting in the same direction.
     In a fragment of a silicified Pecten from the Greensand of
 Haldon, Devon, the elevated ridges, characteristic of the shell,
are preserved intact, notwithstanding the complete displacement
 of the carbonate of lime by silica, and the assumption by the
 silica of that arrangement in concentric rings characteristic of
most Beekites. In the present specimen of shell, some of the
 systems of rings are partly situate in a furrow of the exterior
 surface, bend upwards, and follow the curve of a ridge, and then
 dip into another furrow : the inner aspect of the shell being
level, shows no corresponding contortions of the systems of con
centric ridges. In like manner, in the Beekite proper, silica
 displaces rather than increases the original substance,—for the
organic structure is generally traceable in every part of the
 tubercles and ridges, even to their summits, being in fact more
conspicuous on the exterior surface of most of the hollow speci
mens than on their interior.
     The tendency to deposition in a circular form, though not
 peculiar to this substance, is seen in many other varieties of
silica—stalagmitic quartz or quartz-sinter, for instance, such as
 that from the Geysers of Iceland, and the hot springs of Luzon
in the Philippine Isles. A specimen from the latter place is
represented in figs. 5 & 6. Eyed agate (fig. 7) shows the same
arrangement. Float-stone from Menil Montant, near Paris,
when examined with a lens, often displays minute beads and
concentric ridges; while menilite, or liver-opal from the same
locality, presents an appearance very closely resembling that of
the Beekite No. 9.
     The annexed letter from Dr. Gladstone, commenting as it does
on both the physical and chemical questions under discussion,
may not inappropriately conclude the present paper:—
     “MY DEAR MR. CHURCH,-Your Beekites seem to me very
interesting, not only in a chemical and geological, but also in a
physical point of view, as affording a remarkable illustration of
the tendency of certain bodies to assume a globular form during
deposition.     I say ‘ deposition,’ because it is evident that the
Beekites are not fossils owing their mammillated appearance to
the organic form which has been silicified, but are rather deposits
on some substratum, which may be a coralline, a sponge, a shell,
or even a piece of stone.        Yet this deposition seems always
accompanied by the replacement of part, or the whole, of the
carbonate of lime by silica.
    “Many of the concentric globular deposits in your specimens
bear a striking resemblance to the globular deposits of carbonate

the charcoal fire by which the water in a boiler was kept boiling,
a gas-lamp which effects the same purpose, and does not require
the presence of the operator.
     The substance submitted to experiment is usually placed in a
brass wire-gauze basket M, provided on the inside with a cylinder
of brass-foil, in which is fitted the bulb of the thermometer T
which marks the temperature of the substance.               This basket is
 suspended by a silk thread, which traverses a hollow metallic
 stopper R. . The thermometer T is inserted in a stopper to
such a depth that the division 100 degrees only projects above
the bath by about a centimetre.
     The hot bath consists of three concentric envelopes. The
 internal cylinder A, in which is arranged the basket and the
                                     º

desirable to determine the specific heat of metallic lithium.
M. Debray provided me with an opportunity, by placing at my
disposal a small quantity of lithium which he had carefully pre
pared by Bunsen's method.        It consisted of a large globule
weighing about a gramme, and of 12 grains of the size of a
small pea.              I
                 endeavoured in vain to fuse these small grains
into a single globule; but the layer of oxide with which they were
coated prevented them from completely welding.            preferred                              I
to operate solely with the large globule, which in the cold could
be readily worked by the hammer, and presented a very lustrous
surface.
   To preserve the metal from contact with the                during the                   air
experiment,      was  ithermetically  enclosed       leaden   box,  repre   in   a

            METALs wilicii Accom PANY PLATINUM.
  I have had frequent occasion to determine the specific heat of
some of the metals which accompany platinum (Ann. de Chim. et
de Phys. 2nd series, vol. lxxiii.; 3rd series, vol. xlvi.), but   I
                                                                had
doubts as to the purity of several of the specimens used.        M.
Chapuis lent me, in June 1857, several specimens of rhodium,
osmium, and iridium, which he had prepared with the greatest
care by the methods described by him in the following Note:—
   1. The osmium was obtained by roasting osmium-iridium.
Osmic acid, condensed in a solution of caustic potash, was con
verted into osmite of potash by alcohol, and then washed for a
long time with a solution of chloride of ammonium. The double
chloride of osmium and ammonium was heated in a current of
hydrogen, and the spongy osmium thus formed united by com
pression into a single ingot.
   2. The iridium was obtained by heating with nitre the residues
of platinum-mineral previously freed from osmium. The product,
washed with water, was treated with aqua regia, and the liquors
precipitated with chloride of ammonium. The double salt was
calcined in a platinum crucible, the temperature being slowly
raised. The metallic mass was again washed with a solution of
sal-ammoniac, and then heated in the muffle; a considerable
quantity of osmium was given off. After these operations it
was found that the iridium still contained perceptible quantities
of platinum, palladium, and gold. It was again treated with
weak aqua regia; and as the presence of foreign metals was still
apprehended, it was again fused with nitre, and the oxide thus
obtained treated with aqua regia.    The evaporated liquors gave
well-defined crystals of the double chloride of iridium and potas
sium: the double chloride was heated in a crucible with car
bonate of soda, and the iridium thus obtained was compressed
into a single cylinder by percussion.
   3. The rhodium was extracted from the residues of the pre
paration of iridium.    These residues, exhausted by the treatment
with aqua regia, were mixed with fused salt and then heated to
redness in a current of dry chlorine.       The substance was then
treated with  boiling  water, and the solution gave, on evaporation,
beautiful octahedral crystals of the double chloride of rhodium
and sodium. These crystals were redissolved in hot water, and
sal-ammoniac added; on cooling, needle-shaped crystals of the
ammoniacal double chloride were deposited. This substance,
heated in a muffle, gave metallic rhodium.      As some doubt still
remained of   its purity, it was again treated with aqua regia, the
metallic residue again fused with common salt, and the mixture
heated in a  current of   dry chlorine. The substance was redis

solved in boiling water; and the solution gave, by boiling, the
crystallized chloride of rhodium and sodium. From this salt,
treated as before, metallic rhodium was obtained, which was
compacted by percussion.
                                                  Osmium.
     The osmium consisted of a single cylinder strongly compacted
by hammering.                  I

   The specific heat of osmium, as deduced from this experiment,
is C=0.03113.      This number scarcely differs from the number
0.03063, which             I
                    obtained for osmium prepared by M. Fremy
(Ann. de Chim. et de Phys, 3rd series, vol. xlvi. p. 162). The pro

0.03063,   is88:11; osmium therefore completely follows the law

   This experiment clearly proves that iridium is always altered
by considerable proportions of one or more metals with low equi
valents which accompany platinum, that           palladium, rhodium,       is,
and ruthenium.      Palladium can scarcely         there; for                    be                     it       is   so

 Prof. Regnault on the Specific Heat of                             some      Simple Bodies.     115
  This specific heat is much lower than that which I found for
metal prepared with the oxalate, and the product of the specific
heat by the atomic weight 350 is 35-33.       I think that the
metal contained some foreign body.
  M. Dumas placed at my disposal another quantity of cobalt
which he considered to be pure. One portion of it consisted
of small bars; the other formed three almost spherical bullets.
The metal was malleable enough to be flattened in the cold by
the hammer, and the file readily cut it; but the small ingots
grasped in a vice were broken when struck transversely by a
hammer.
  The metal in bullets gave the following results:—

determinations (Phil. Mag. vol. xv. p. 115, and vol. xviii. p. 278),
gives cobalt a higher atomic weight.      My determinations of the
specific heats favour the latter conclusion; but the differences in
question are so small that it is impossible to decide the question
by a determination of the specific heats, until the experiments
can be made with absolutely pure metals.
                                           Tungsten.
   The specific heat of tungsten was given in my first memoir.
The metal was obtained by calcining, at furnace-heat in a lined
crucible, oxide of tungsten previously reduced by hydrogen.          It
was to be feared, however, that the metal had by this process
absorbed carbon and silicon.                   I
                                   found, in fact, the specific heat to
be  0.03636,   which, multiplied  by  the atomic weight 1150, now
usually admitted for tungsten, gives 41-81, a number distinctly
too high for the law of specific heats.
    M. Rousseau placed at my disposal a large quantity of tungsten.
He had prepared it by reducing tungstic acid at a high and
steady long-sustained temperature by means of hydrogen. This
tungsten is crystalline, but pulverulent.          To determine                             its
specific heat,   was pressed

     The experiments made with the silicon melted by M. Caron
are evidently the most reliable, because they were made with a
sufficient quantity of substance.    They lead to the result that
the specific heat of silicon is 0.1750, which is virtually the same
as that    of crystallized silicon                                (p.   119).
     The mean specific heat, 0.176, multiplied
          by   the atomic weight, 266-7, gives the product 46-92

   Silicic acid forms, with alcohol and wood-spirit, three silicic

  M. Wöhler has recently described a siliciuretted hydrogen
which is spontaneously inflammable in the air, and presents the
greatestanalogy with phosphuretted hydrogen.
  The  protoxide of silicon discovered by the same chemist would
correspond to phosphorous acid; chloride of silicon to chloride of
phosphorus,     &c.
    But it is difficult to refer to this formula for silicic acid (Si2O")
the numerical results which analysis assigns to many compounds
of silicon.    I confine myself at present to calling the attention
of mineralogists to this subject.          Moreover it is possible that
silicon   presents   in        its
                             calorific  capacity   anomalies like those
which I     have met with for carbon            its different conditions.

    In  each of these experiments the quantity of boracic acid
formed was determined: in the first 0-56 grim. was found; so
that at the moment of immersion the brass vessel contained
1987-95 of boron, and 0-56 of boracic acid.               In like manner in
Experiment II. there were—
                  Boron . . . . . .                   1997:10
                  Boracic acid . . . .                 0-35

                  Boracic acid     .   .   .     .     0-49
    The specific heat of anhydrous boracic acid is 0.2374 (Ann. de
 Chim. et de Phys. 3rd series, vol. i. p. 148).             If there were no
other sources either of the disengagement or absorption of heat,
the perturbation produced by the presence of the boracic acid
could be calculated.      But the boracic acid is probably formed in
the anhydrous state in the bath; in the water of the calorimeter
it changes into hydrated acid, which dissolves more or less com
pletely in this water during the time which elapses between
 immersion and the observation of the stationary temperature.
                                               I
 These are new sources of error which was not able to take into
 account.
     Simply making the correction due to a replacement of part of
 the boron by boracic acid, the specific heat of boron is found to
 be—
                     I.      .   .   .   .    .     0-4053

                     III.    .   .   .   .    .     0-3598
 These values agree very little with each other, and             I think they
 cannot even be regarded as approximate.                       *
     I then tried to study amorphous boron in the isomeric modi
 fication which it experiences, according to M. Deville, when
 heated to 200° in an oil-bath in a current of hydrogen.              I  placed
 in a  glass flask discs of  amorphous       boron which had been pre
pared by percussion. The flask having been placed in an oil
 bath, a current of hydrogen was passed through, and the tem
 perature of the oil-bath gradually raised to 200°, where it was
 maintained for about half an hour.                In this experiment did  I
 not observe either incandescence, or any visible phenomenon of
 molecular modification. The oil-bath having been removed, the
 current of hydrogen was continued for two hours. The sub
  stance had not changed in appearance; but when                 I was trans
  ferring the discs from the flask into a porcelain capsule, they
  took fire one after the other, and burned with a lively incan
  descence.    A funnel placed immediately over the ignited boron
  was  immediately   covered with abundant drops of water.

     It      appears     from this that amorphous boron,                                          in     becoming

                                       Evaporameter.
        instrument enables us readily to determine with con
Thissiderable precision the amount of evaporation which takes
place from a given surface of water at different states of the atmo
sphere.   The most direct and probably the most accurate method
of determining this consists in exposing a known weight of
water, placed in a large shallow pan, to the action of the air; and
then, after the lapse of a certain time, by weighing the pan with
the residue of water, the weight of the water which has been
evaporated becomes known.       This method, however, is not only
troublesome, but supplies no correction for the rain or moisture
that may have fallen during the period of exposure.      The instru
ment which I have constructed not only takes the rain-fall into
                                                 of its
account, but is also simple in     use, and sufficiently accurate                                         in

water.   By means of this instrument the following laws of
evaporation have been established:—
   1. Other things being the same, the rate of evaporation is
nearly proportional to the difference of the temperatures indi
cated by the wet- and dry-bulb thermometers.
   2. Other things being the same, the augmentation of evapo
ration, due to air in motion, is nearly proportional to the velocity
of the wind.
   3. Other things being the same, the evaporation is nearly
inversely proportional to the pressure of the atmosphere.
   By means of Apjohn’s formula, or by Glaisher's multipliers
and a special constant, this instrument therefore may be used
as a hygrometer, giving indications vastly more delicate, if not
more reliable, than those of the wet- and dry-bulb thermometer
commonly employed.      It is believed that the proposed instru
ment would supply a desideratum in meteorological observations,
inasmuch as it would give with the utmost delicacy the evapo
rating capacity of the atmosphere, or, what amounts to the same
thing, the comparative dryness and salubrity of the atmosphere
extending over given intervals of time; whereas other hygro
meters only give the state of the atmosphere at the particular
time of observation.   When used as a hygrometer, the instru
ment should be placed in a situation where there are no currents
of air.
         Results of Experiments relating to Absorption.
   The following experimental   researches form a continuation of
those given by me in the  Philosophical  Magazine for 1860–61.
   1. When water is diffused from a central point through the
pores of an absorbent (with a certain proviso), nearly equal
volumes of water are absorbed in equal times.
    Dry calico, in four folds, was laid on the tube of the absorbo
meter represented in fig. 2. At first the absorption was very
rapid, but after the lapse of a few minutes it became nearly uni
form; thus the number of minutes corresponding to each suc
cessive interval of 2 inches on the tube were 3:16, 3-3, 3-5,
3-6, 3:8, 38.
    Plaster of Paris being placed on the tube, gave the following
results: the numbers of seconds corresponding to successive
intervals of 4 inches on the tube were 55, 60, 62, 64.
    For a very porous sandstone, the numbers of seconds corre
sponding to successive intervals of 4 inches on the tube were
70, 75, 80, 80.
    For a sandstone of greater density and closer in  its pores, the
numbers   of  minutes corresponding   to  the absorption    of
                                                             succes
 sive half cubic inches of  water were  36, 39,41.   Similar results

       SIR,
    the February Number of the                                Philosophical Magazine
IN this                                                    for
        year, you have published the description of some expe
riments tending to prove that, contrary to Ampère's theory, the
contiguous parts of an electric current attract instead of repel
each other.     And in the April Number of the same Journal,
Mr. Croll of   Glasgow     endeavours to show that the experiment
by which Ampère believed he had proved the reality of this repul
sion might be explained in an entirely different manner. The
result of experiments, partly old and partly new, which we have
made, leads us to differ from you as to the import and signifi
cance of the results which you have obtained; and from Mr.
Croll, as to the validity of his explanation. We shall describe
these experiments and communicate the reflections which they
have suggested, requesting you to publish them in the same
Journal if they seem to you to be worth the attention of physicists.
   We shall commence with Mr. Croll’s article. We shall not
discuss it from the theoretical point of view, nor ask the author
how, if he admits that two currents, one of which is directed
towards their point of intersection, and the other from           repel                          it,
each other when     they   make   any given  angle with  each other,                                        it
is possible     deny this repulsion
                   to                    the single case
                                                       in   which this                     in

On the Repulsion of a Rectilinear Electrical Current on itself.                                   141
experiments, two small mercury cups C were placed upon a suit
able support.     In these cups were placed the two pointed ends
of a conductor of copper wire about a millimetre in diameter;
they were bent in such a manner as to neutralize the action of
the earth’s magnetism, and to present a horizontal part DD at
right angles to the partition between the two compartments.
By altering the height of the support, the distance between this
horizontal part of the conductor and the surface of the mercury
in the compartments could be changed. Two fixed conductors,
EE, connect one end of each of these compartments with one of
the mercury cups.       By connecting the two other ends of these
compartments by means of the binding-screws FF with the poles
of a battery, the current passed through the mercury from one
end of the compartment to the other, then by one of the fixed
conductors through the moveable conductor, and then returned
to the other pole of the battery through the second fixed con
 ductor, and the mercury in the second compartment. When,
first, the two cups were fixed at such a height that the part
DD of the moveable conductor was only about a centimetre
 distant from the mercury in the trough (that              about half         is,                   as
 distant    the same part
           as                 one of  Ampère's floating conductors),

                                                     perceptible motion
in  the conductor. At this      distance,  therefore,   the crossed cur
 rents were not strong enough         displace visibly
                                               to          part      con      a           of  a

 in the part b c of the floater.   But the very opposite takes place;
 the floater moves  briskly  towards the points P and N, just as is
 required by Ampère's experiment.        Here, it appears to us, is a
 result which scarcely agrees with the explanation of the motion
 of this floater by the action of crossed currents. How, then, is it
 to be explained, if not by Ampère's theory itself?        If there is
 any doubt on this point, we call to remembrance the experiment
 which we published three years ago in the French journal Cosmos.
 Permit us to describe it:—
      “One of ussucceeded, twelve years ago, in showing directly
 the repulsion of the parts of the same current, by employing a
 dozen iron bullets 8 or 9 millims. in diameter, suspended like
the ivory balls in experiments on the impact of bodies, touch
ing each other, and so that their centres were in the same right
line.  By means of conductors suitably arranged and moveable
in  mercury, the two terminal bullets could be connected with the
two poles of a battery; there was besides on each a light thin
rod, by which their motion could be read off on a graduated
scale.    When the current from ten Grove’s elements was passed
through   the bullets, the terminal ones were seen to diverge
about a  millimetre, and between each pair of bullets small sparks
were continually seen to pass.     When the battery was not too
strongly charged, and the action of the current not continued
too long, so as to prevent a permanent connexion in consequence
of a fusion of the bullets at the point of contact, the bullets, so
soon as contact was broken, were seen to approach each other
and resume their primitive position, which proved that the effect
was not due to heat, and gave a confirmation of Ampère's law at
once simple and direct.
   “But,” you will perhaps say, “you have appealed to facts,
and my experiments furnish facts which demonstrate an attrac
tion instead of a repulsion of the contiguous parts of the same
conductor.”    But these experiments, Sir, are they conclusive?
You will permit us to doubt        To justify this doubt, we com
                                           it.

whenever in your experiments you have observed a true attrac
tion at a distance, the two parts of your conductor were neces
sarily disjoined; that is to say, there could be no current other
than that which is propagated by the sparks; and you will
agree with us that every spark indicates a marked difference in
the electrical condition of the two surfaces between which it
springs, a difference which ought necessarily to produce an
attraction between the two. The current transmitted by these
sparks is always too feeble, in too small quantity, as would
formerly have been said, to produce any appreciable mechanical
effect.   But in making contact between the two portions of your
conductor, there was certainly a current; an attraction at a
distance could not be perceived, but instead of it you have seen
an adhesion which lasted some time after the current had been
broken. Could not this persistence be an indication that this
adhesion is not a direct effect of the current (the rupture of
which ought to stop it instantaneously), but is a secondary effect?
 We think so. In our opinion the explanation of the pheno
 menon is as follows.
   As soon as the current is closed, the moveable current is re
pelled.  It only, however, moves to a slight distance, which can
not be otherwise, seeing that the force of repulsion, not very
great itself, must overcome that of torsion while only acting
during an excessively short time, and on a relatively consider
able mass.    It would go further than it does, if at the same
moment that it quits the conductor an induction spark, a small
voltaic arc, did not instantaneously pass between the two. This
arc, as is always the case when it springs between two fusible elec
trodes placed at a very small distance, is almost entirely composed
of a kind of melted metal.         It is broken after a very short exist
ence; but the rupture of the circuit brings about a new induc
tion with          its
                 arc, which also quickly breaks, and             on. You      so
have often heard these sparks: this            the fizzing noise
                                                          is          which             of

144              Prof. Van Breda on the Repulsion of a
to each other. The unequal contraction of the two parts of the
conductor, of different form and often of two different metals,
sometimes causes a spontaneous rupture of this junction after a
longer or shorter time, as you have observed.
   There is fortunately one means of preventing this welding; and
that is by using a metal, mercury, which is liquid to begin with,
and then you can observe the Ampèrian repulsion.      In the same
article of Cosmos, of which some lines have been cited, we have
described an experiment which has much analogy with your own.
We described it thus:—
  “On   one of the arms of a small and delicate balance is suspended
a copper-wire   conductor about 3 millims. in diameter, and bent
in the form of an inverted U. The other arm is loaded with
weights which almost counterbalance the conductor; that being
done, the two ends of the latter are respectively immersed in two
mercury cups, placed at such a height that they are not immersed
to a greater depth than 2 millimetres at most.      As soon as the
circuit is closed so that a pretty strong current passes from the
mercury to the conductor, and from the other end of the con
ductor to the mercury in the other cup, the conductor is briskly
repelled out of the mercury; the current is broken, and the con
ductor falls again to be again repelled, and so on indefinitelyº.”
   The current for this experiment ought to proceed from four
Grove's elements, each presenting an active surface of 12 square
inches, and connected so as to form a series of two elements of
double the size. By using a weaker current, the repulsion is not
strong enough to throw the conductor entirely out of the mer
cury; it merely rises a little as soon as the current begins to
pass. We have lately improved the apparatus by fixing at the
other end of the balance a small glass disc, on which there is a
scale divided into tenths of a millimetre. This can be observed by
means of a small fixed microscope magnifying about twenty times,
and with cross-wires on its ocular. In addition to this, plati
num wires are soldered to each of the ends of the bent conductor;
they are about a millimetre in diameter, and are covered with
glass so as only to leave the two ends free. The results obtained
by means of the apparatus thus modified have appeared interest
ing to us, because they have confirmed us in our point of view,

Gore's sphere, which touches each of the two rails in almost a
mathematical point, the heat developed at the point of contact
may in fact be one of the causes of motion: if we were unaware
of the repulsion which ought to be developed on this point inde
pendently of the heat, the cause of the phenomenon would have
to be attributed to the latter. In the case of the vibrating blocks
of Trevelyan this explanation becomes less probable, because the
weight of the upper block ought to render the two surfaces in
contact much greater. In fact if their surfaces are increased n
times, the heat developed, and the resultant sudden expansion,
ought to be n° times less.                         If
                                     now one of the two is a liquid
metal, like mercury, which assumes exactly the extent of surface
of the solid conductor immersed in                              it,
                                              and which ought therefore

XX.     Remarks     on  M. Hermite's Argument relating to the Alge
    braical Resolution of Equations of the Fifth Degree.            By G. B.
    JERRARD*.
1.       WAS not        aware of what      M. Hermite had written with
           respect    to the  impossibility      of effecting generally the
algebraical resolution of equations of the fifth degree, until             I
saw an abstract of his argument in a paper by Mr. Cockle which
appeared     in the last Number of the ‘Quarterly Journal of Pure
and Applied Mathematics.” The abstract to which I refer is
this:—
    “M.     Hermite's argument may help to settle a still vexed
question. It is as follows:
    “Let us assume that between the roots of the sextic réduite of
the general quintic there exist relations which render that sextic
an Abelian.         These relations would, in effect, lead to the con
clusion that the réduite is resolvible algebraically by quadratic
and cubic radicals; and without having recourse to the demon
stration of Abel, we may at once convince ourselves that it would
follow that the equation of the fifth degree is resolvible by
radicals of the same knd.          Let us call wo, wi ag, as, a, the roots
of this equation, and put
                    u-2021 + 2122 + æ22'3 + æ32'4-H      4:42 on
                    v=a'oºz-H  2.24 4-H a 471-Ha'la's  + æsæo,
the quantities u + v and up will be, the one rational, and the
other a root of an equation of the sixth degree resolvible alge
braically by hypothesis. Then u and v and their various values
will be expressed by means of quadratic and cubic radicals. The
same conclusion will hold with respect to the more general
functions
            u,-(ror,)*-H (a,a)*-H (agº)"+ (rsº)"+(aºro)",
            v, -(aorº)*-H    (wº)"+ (wº)"+ (a|ws)"+(agro)",
whatever be the       integral exponent a.        It follows that
                        40°1  wº,     ºgºg,   0.324,  2470,
 for example, will satisfy an equation of the fifth degree, the co
 efficients of which will only involve radicals of the kind in ques
 tion. But with two values of u, and v, it will be possible to form
 two equations of the fifth degree having a common root, for
 example      aori,   the others being        different.      Hence we  may
 deduce aori, and consequently the similar function ao-Hari, in
 terms of cubic and quadratic radicals; consequently also ao and
 al, so that the equation of the fifth degree would be resolvible
 without quintic radicals.

       “Such             a    conclusion is of course inadmissible.    M. Hermite's
argument is given, with developments, in his “Considérations
sur la Résolution Algébrique de l'équation du 5 degré.” See
pp. 326–336 of vol. i. of the Nouvelles Annales de Mathématiques
(par MM. Terquem et Gerono), 1842.”

   The following communication was read:—
   “On  the Distribution of Aqueous Vapour in the Upper Parts of
the Atmosphere.”      By Lieut.-Col. Richard Strachey, F.R.S.
   The experiments   of chemists having shown that any gas will flow
into a space occupied by another gas, and diffuse itself there as
          ñºf
though the space were a vacuum and the second gas not there, it
was            by Dalton that the atmosphere might be considered
to be a combination of as many distinct atmospheres as it has gase
ous components, and that the actions of each of these might be
treated of separately, and irrespective of the others. Meteorologists,
pursuing this idea, have proposed to separate the pressure of the
aqueous vapour from the whole barometric pressure of the atmo
sphere, and thence to infer the pressure of the permanently elastic
portion, or as it has been called, the Gaseous Pressure, or the
Pressure of the Dry Air.
   It is my object to inquire how far the facts of the matter will
support Dalton's suggestion of the possible independent existence of
an atmosphere of aqueous vapour, and whether we can in truth eli
minate the pressure of this vapour by subtracting the observed ten
sion from the total barometric pressure, in the manner that has com
monly been done of late years.
   And first as to the hypothesis of an atmosphere of aqueous vapour
pressing only upon itself.                              If
                                      there be such an atmosphere, the
general laws of pressure of elastic fluids will apply to                 they                           it,     as        do

      Hence, up to about 3000 feet, the temperature of the air would
   be found to be higher than the dew-point, and the supposed tensions
   might of course exist. But the temperature of the air, it will be
   seen, diminishes much more rapidly as we ascend than that of the
   dew-point; and the former will therefore soon fall below the latter.

 On the Distribution of Aqueous Vapour in the Atmosphere.                                                                              157
done in the case of the entire atmosphere, by the height of a column
of the density observed at the surface. The height of a homogeneous
atmosphere of vapour, equivalent to an independent vapour atmo
sphere, on Dalton's hypothesis would obviously be             of the height
of the  homogeneous   air  atmosphere,          ;
                                        that is of   26,250    feet, or about
42,000 fect.
    But the vapour actually existing is much less than this. Taking
the results of Dr. Hooker's observations, and considering the den
sity at the surface to be unity, the mean density of the whole vapour
below 20,000 feet will readily be calculated to be about 47; so that
the whole of the vapour up to this height would be equivalent to a
homogeneous column of 9460 feet of density 1-0. Now it may be
assumed approximately that the quantity of vapour above 20,000 feet
will bear the same relation to the entire quantity, as holds good be
tween the densities at that height and at the surface; and as we see
from the Table that the density at 20,000 feet is             of what it is at                           ºr
the surface, we may infer that this is the proportion of the vapour
 above that altitude, the remainder, or           being below          Conse      ºr                                    it.

observations, would        equivalent   be   homogeneous column       to   '4'"

 x9460,        or
             11,260 feet.    Using the balloon observations, the height
would      rather less than this, viz. 10,050 feet,
              be                                          that we may infer                         so

sophy in the University of Glasgow; and it has been shown as a
first result, that there certainly is sodium in the sun's atmosphere.
The recent application of these principles in the splendid researches
of Bunsen and Kirchhoff (who made an independent discovery of
Stokes's theory), has demonstrated with equal certainty that there
are iron and manganese, and several of our other known metals in the
sun. The specific heat of each of these substances is less than the
specific heat of water, which indeed exceeds that of every other
known terrestrial solid or liquid. It might therefore at first sight
seem probable that the mean specific heat of the sun's whole sub
stance is less, and very certain that it cannot be much greater, than
that of water.       But thermodynamic reasons, explained in the paper,
lead to a    very  different conclusion, and make it probable that, on
account of the enormous pressure which the sun's interior bears, his
specific heat is more than ten times, although not more than 10,000
times, that of liquid water.       Hence it is probable that the sun cools
by as much as 14°C. in some time more than 100 years, but less
 than 100,000 years.
     As to the sun's actual temperature at the present time, it is
remarked that at his surface it cannot, as we have many reasons for
believing, be incomparably higher than temperatures attainable arti
 ficially at the earth's surface. Among other reasons, it may be men
 tioned that he radiates heat from every square foot of his surface at
 only about 7000 horse-power.          Coal burning at the rate of a little
 less than a    pound   per two seconds would generate the same amount;
 and it is estimated       (Rankine, “Prime Movers, p. 285, edit. 1859)
 that in the furnaces of locomotive engines, coal burns at from 1 lb.
 in 30 seconds to 1 lb. in 90 seconds per square foot of grate-bars.
  Hence heat is radiated from the sun at a rate not more than from
 fifteen to forty-five times as high as that at which heat is generated
 on the grate-bars of a locomotive furnace, per equal areas.
     The interior temperature of the sun is probably far higher than
 that at the surface, because conduction can play no sensible part
 in the transference of heat between the inner and outer portions of
  his mass, and there must be an approximate convective equilibrium of
  heat throughout the whole; that is to say, the temperatures at dif
  ferent distances from the centre must be approximately those which
  any portion of the substance, if carried from the centre to the surface,
  would acquire by expansion without loss or gain of heat.
       PART   II.  On the Origin and Total Amount of the Sun's Heat.
     The sun being, for reasons referred to above, assumed to be an
  incandescent liquid now losing heat, the question naturally occurs,
  how did this heat originate         It is certain that it cannot have ex
  isted in the sun through an infinity of past time, because as long as it
   has so existed it must have been suffering dissipation; and the finite
  ness of the sun precludes the supposition of an infinite primitive store
   of heat in his body. The sun must therefore either have been created
   an active source of heat at some time of not immeasurable antiquity
  by an overruling decree; or the heat which he has already radiated
   away, and that which he still possesses, must have been acquired by
   some natural process following permanently established laws. With
   out pronouncing the former supposition to be essentially incredible,

162     Mr. S. W. Wood                 on the Form and Distribution               of the
elevations appear to have emanated from foci of force, where the
volcanic action was the most exerted, or at least where it found
the least resistance, and produced the greatest dislocations; in a
word, the upheaval (however prolonged) of mountain chains, has
converted large tracts falling within their influence into dry land.
Now if we can in imagination remove the inequalities produced
by any volcanic upheaval, and by so doing restore the surface as
it existed before such upheaval took place, it is clear that we
should remove the chief difficulty in arriving at a correct view of
the relative configurations of the land and water during the an
tecedent period.
   Again, consider how during every successive geological epoch
since the close of the palaeozoic period, but more particularly
during the Jurassic and cretaceous epochs, the sea over the
º,
south-east of England and north of France has returned to the
basin occupied by it during the immediately preceding geological
         where no anticlinal has interfered to change the relative
 evels of the surface: thus we see the outcrop of the jurassic and
cretaceous formations, and even of the older tertiaries over this
district, forming a series of concentric rings, the newer formation
lying within the older*.                    If
                               we can so plainly perceive this where
powerful dislocations have taken place subsequent to the older
tertiaries, which have not only interfered with the old and gra
dually narrowing sea-basin of the secondary and older tertiary
seas, but reversed the very inclination of the surface, so that the
land, from which came the sediment that supplied the clays and
limestones of those ancient formations, now falls away to the
west under the deepening water of the British Channel towards
the Atlantic, how much more plainly ought we to perceive it in
those parts of the world where the strata have remained over
great areas undisturbed by anticlinals since they were deposited,
as in Russia, North America, &c., places in which, if the tracts
were now sufficiently depressed, the ocean would again wash
almost the same coast-line which it did in the secondary periods.
Even in England, which is a geological microcosm, and where a
more regular succession of strata exists than in any other known
tract of equal size, there is by no means that overlay of successive
 deposits to the extent that apparently exists, since not only does
the whole jurassic series thin out as it recedes from those ancient
lands the drainage of which formed the sources whence was de
rived the sediment of                  its   deposits+,   but the basins which the

If we admit   that every elevation takes place at the expense of
material removed from subterraneous places to the surface, the
void thus caused must, even if we conceive a cavernous structure,
be supplied sooner or later by other material subsiding into the
cavity, so that in such case we may assume that every volcanic
elevation is accompanied by a depression coequal in amount
(although perhaps not in area), and also contiguous. Did moun
tain chains come into existence by one great catastrophe, instead
of their being formed (as the evidence shows) by a multitude of
minor and spasmodic volcanic outbursts, this contiguity would
not so necessarily accompany the volcanic elevations; but the
smallness of the effect produced by each volcanic elevation when
compared with the sum of their action, as seen in mountain
chains, shows that, upon the principle stated above, the depres
sions are contiguous. Thus, as it seems to me, every volcanic
outburst has a tendency, by the contiguous depressions that it
                                                       as its
causes, to bring the drainage into           neighbourhood.     This
drainage     generally the ocean; but,
             is                                the Caspian,     may

 be only waters having their origin from the surrounding land
collected into the depressed area.     And hence         that great        is   it
waters are not only contiguous         to

   The volcanic forces which prevailed during the later part                                            of
the palaeozoic period,   least during the carboniferous age, appear

sions which broke           up
                         the palaeozoic deposits, and formed the
mountain systems which governed the geographical configuration
of  the secondary period, have obliterated these features                                          to   a
greater extent than have the tertiary upheavals obliterated those
 of secondary age; enough, however, remains           show this east   to

probably was caused) by an entire change in this alignement:
the volcanic bands which brought into existence the extensive
mountain systems which are formed out of the palaeozoic strata,
broken up and thrown into parallel ridges of immense extent,
obliterating almost entirely the alignement which the palaeozoic
strata had previously possessed, appear to have burst forth, not
merely in one hemisphere, but over the whole world as far as
hitherto examined, in a direction more or less from north to
south, and to have maintained this direction during the whole
secondary period. These old volcanic bands have left their evi
dences in several great systems which have been examined by
competent geologists, and, there is reason to believe, in other
mountain chains of similar direction not yet examined.           The
well-marked and examined     systems   consist, in the northern he
misphere, of the Alleghanies*, the Ouralt, and of the system of
Portugalf prolonged into the North of England; and in the
southern hemisphere, of the great system of Eastern Australia § ;
of like origin with which appears to be the palaeozoic and schis
tose system of New Zealand; and lastly, the grand systems of
the Rocky Mountains || and of the Andes".

origin at the close of the palaeozoic period.
   The way in which the secondary formations occur upon the
flanks of these known systems, stretching from them in success
ive outcrops, indicate that throughout the secondary period the
tracts falling within the influence of these                              were,
with some interruption, undergoing a steady continuous eleva
tion. Thus, to commence on the east with the Oural Mountains,
we see that the elevatory action of that chain commenced after
the close of the carboniferous period, but was in full action during
the last age of the palaeozoic period, the Permian, the deposits of
which spread over large tracts, and that this action, prolonged
into the secondary period, elevated the Permian deposits into
º
ridges subordinate to the original ridge of the Oural but parallel
with     it,while the Jurassic deposits were formed               the same but       in

Australia in the examination of their geological features.    The
similarity of these features over a large tract, coupled with the
exhibition of similar features wherever exploring vessels have ex
amined the eastern sea border, favours the inference that the
whole of Eastern Australia is one geological system composed of
disrupted palaeozoic formations, and having a strike throughout
from north to south. The resemblance of this structure to that
of the Appalachian and Rocky-Mountain chains is striking.
Here, as there, the Devonian and carboniferous deposits have
been broken up into numerous parallel ridges from north to
south, showing the origin of the system to be subsequent to the
carboniferous period, but prior to the deposit of the coal-bearing
strata of this continent, which, like those of India, appear to be
of secondary age, these coal-bearing strata resting in Australia
unconformably on the true carboniferous and older palaeozoic
strata+.
   The schistose system of New Zealand seems evidently due to
the same elevatory action as that which formed the Australian
system, since the coast-line of that island is almost identical with
the opposite shore of Australia in a somewhat lower latitude.
   Lastly, we have the grandest mountain system of the world—
the Andes—exhibiting       similar features to the other systems
above discussed.     This chain exhibits the greatest constancy of
                                       of its

volcanic rocks penetrating the palaeozoic portion or core of the

the secondary formations were deposited,—illustrating, Iventure

foci is due to the depressions caused by the volcanic action,                                         its

  measured their respective lengths and diameters and brought

unnoticed, though it may,            I
                                 think, serve to explain several phe
momena recorded in   physiological    chemistry, the cause of which is
still enveloped in obscurity. In a paper “On the Occurrence of
Indigo-blue in Urine”,”          I
                                stated that when urine which is free
from   sugar  is mixed with   sulphuric   or muriatic acid and boiled,
it deposits a large quantity of brown flocks, and that the liquid
filtered from these flocks, after being made alkaline, gives the
reaction of sugar with salts of copper.         Hence             I
                                                           inferred that
urine must contain some substance which, by decomposition with
acids, yields sugar, the brown flocks representing the body or
bodies with which the latter was originally associated in the
manner so well known to chemists; and               I
                                                   ventured to surmise
that this substance might be the so-called extractive matter of
urine, regarding which so little is yet known. This supposition
has been fully confirmed by further investigation. My experi
ments have led to the conclusion that human urine contains, as
Berzelius supposed, no less than three distinct extractive matters.
I  have succeeded in separating these from one another, and from
the other constituents of urine. When quite pure, their compo
sition is uniform, even when they have been obtained from various
sources at considerable intervals of time; and hence it is to be
inferred that, like urea and uric acid, they must be classed
among the last and simplest products of decomposition which the
tissues are capable of affording under the circumstances usually
occurring in the animal frame. When decomposed in watery
solution by means of strong acids, they yield brown pulverulent
or resinous bodies insoluble in water, which contain the whole of
the small quantity of nitrogen originally present, and a species
of glucose, which, though it has the composition and some of the
properties of grape or diabetic sugar, differs from the latter in
being uncrystallizable and insipid.
    The bearing of these facts on several important questions in
physiological chemistry will be apparent at once. The origin of
 the sugar occasionally found both in health and disease in various
animal secretions is still a matter for speculation. It has been
 surmised that it may be formed by the decomposition of albu
 minous substances; but direct experiment has hitherto failed to
 confirm this supposition. The extractive matters of urine, how
 ever, probably represent the missing link connecting the tissues
 on the one hand with the sugar on the other;                   or,

the commencement, cause it to disappear before it could be eli
minated in the urine. It is possible to conceive that, in certain
morbid states of the system, a process of decomposition may be
set up inducing a further metamorphosis in the extractive mat
ters, and leading to the formation of a greater quantity of sugar
than can be got rid of by oxidation. Some such process may
perhaps serve to account for the large amount of sugar found in
the urine in diabetes, the origin of which is still involved in so
much obscurity. . It is well known that in this disease hippuric
acid is found in the urine in much greater abundance than in a
state of health. Now the composition of two of the urinary ex
tractive matters is such, that they may be supposed to split up
into sugar, hippuric acid, and acetic acid; while in the case of
the third it is only necessary to suppose that the acetic acid is
replaced by formic acid.       It seems to me not improbable that
some such process of decomposition may take place in the body,
perhaps under the influence of a peculiar ferment, and that the
extractive matters are the immediate source of the sugar occur
ring in the urine in this disease, the remote source being of
course the tissues themselves.       The saccharine state of the urine,
which, according to Dr. Pavy, is produced by the injection of
acids into the circulation, may possibly be caused by the action
of the acid on the urinary extractive matters, as well as on the
glycogene of the liver.
   I  will not trouble you with any further speculation on the
subject, as my experiments, which have suffered considerable         in
terruption from unforeseen circumstances, will,         I hope, soon be
brought to a conclusion.         On the     present  occasion I merely
wish to announce the fact that ordinary healthy urine contains
substances which, by decomposition with acids, yield among
other products a species of sugar, and that these substances are
simply the extractive matters always contained in the secretion.

  A belief has been  hitherto entertained that the metal of this gun
 contained a  proportion  of gold, and silver, in consequence of an
 existing tradition that it was the custom of the high dignitaries
 to throw articles of gold and silver into the metal at the time of
 casting.   The results of analysis have demonstrated the erro
 neous nature of this tradition, at any rate as applied to this
particular instance, as no trace of the precious metals was
discovered in the specimens of the gun examined.
    Three specimens of the metal composing the gun have been
submitted to quantitative analysis, -one sample having been
taken from near the muzzle, a second from between the trun
mions, and the third from the breech.            The means of the-
analytical results obtained show that—
    1. The metal of which the main casting itself consists is
composed of lead, tin, and copper; and the proportions in
which these metals have been employed vary to a very marked
extent in different parts of the gun.     The alloy composing the
portion near the trunnions contains considerably less lead, and
larger proportions of copper and tin, and is therefore compara
tively harder and more tenacious, than that forming the front
portion, or chase of the gun.
   2. The mass of metal enclosing or forming the exterior of the
breech of the gun consists of an alloy of copper and zinc, resem
bling ordinary brass in               its
                                composition, and containing small
quantities of  iron, lead, and tin, which probably existed     acci                     as
dental impurities       the metals used. These results confirm the
                        in

sistsofa   distinct casting.                                                                   -

  On either side of this large gun, in front of the Royal Artillery
Barracks, are two very highly ornamented and perfect bronze
cannon, of considerable size, though small as compared with the
Bhurtpoor gun.
   These four cannon were cast in Florence about the year 1750,
by the sons of Andreas Morenus, for Francis, Duke of Lorraine
(who, by marriage with Maria Therese, became Emperor of
Austria). The guns are         exactly alike       all

  A   considerable number                         of   large Chinese guns, believed                         to   con

                           some large Chinese                     Guns.                   185
sist of bronze, were brought over to this country at the close of
the last and the preceding war with China.       Several of these
guns are very interesting as specimens of the ingenuity and the
decorative skill of the Chinese. Some of the largest are beauti
fully and very highly ornamented with elaborate carvings. In
external form these resemble the heavy guns of bronze and iron
produced in European countries, excepting that they are almost
uniform in diameter throughout their length. The thickness of
their metal is very considerable in proportion to their calibre.
Other of the guns are devoid of ornament, with the exception of
numerous projecting rings or narrow hoops, forming part of the
casting and distributed over the entire length of the gun. Some
of these particular guns contain linings of iron, the alloy which
composes the gun having evidently been cast upon a cylinder of
that metal.
   The majority of these Chinese cannon consist of metal closely
resembling brass in colour; but a few among those most recently
brought to this country are even of a deeper colour than bronze.
A sample taken from one of the light-coloured guns was found
on analysis to have the following composition:—

   Neither silver nor sulphur could be detected in the metal.
   It would seem from these results that the dark-coloured guns
are produced from the commercial copper of the country, with the
addition perhaps of a very small proportion of zinc. The front
part of the gun examined appears to have been cast of a metal
somewhat different from and inferior to the remaining portion.
In several parts of the gun the metal was in an exceedingly
porous condition, and appeared to have been cast at a very low
temperature. Some portions contained many cavities lined with
the oxidized metal.

    a paper read before the British Association last year, and
            in the October Number of this Journal, it is shown
that when a drop of an independent liquid (i.e. not a solution)
is gently deposited on the surface of another liquid (such as
water), it flattens out into a peculiar and characteristic figure,
which is the resultant of                      its
                                      cohesive force,       density, and the    its

  areas were respectively—A, 3 inches   in diameter; B, 6inches; C,
  34 inches; and   D,  6inches: another object in selecting D was
  to notice the effect of a great body of water as compared with A.
      Sulphuric ether was washed, and drops from a pipette depo
  sited on the centre of A.    A moderately good figure was formed,
  but it was strongly attracted by the thick sides of the glass.
  When the ether was delivered to the centre of B, instead of the
  usual sharp defined figure, about the size of a florin, a much
  larger figure was produced, and this was distorted and torn by
  the attraction of the larger surface and the sides of the vessel,
  to which it bounded up with rapidity.                The characteristics of
  the figure were evident in the midst of the distortion.                 On C
  the  figure   was most      perfect  and  satisfactory.    On D the    figure
 was not so much distorted as on B.              The attraction of the sides
 was not so strong; but it must be noted that the sides were
 thin and upright, whereas in B the raised inner edge of the
 plate was on a level with the surface of the water.
     On mixing a portion of the washed ether with about one
 fourth of alcohol, good steady figures were produced on                   four                all
 surfaces.       The figures were more nearly confined              one spot,          to
 and the attraction           the sides was less marked,
                                    of                           consequence      in

                                        the water for the alcohol than for
 the pure ether.

lourless fluid, very limpid; No. 3, a perfectly transparent fluid,
limpid; No. 4, an opalescent white jelly, gelatinous camphor in
fact, slightly yellow; No. 5, colourless transparent fluid resting
on perfectly colourless jelly. When the whole of the distillate

No. 3 formed a large film, or rather double film, viz. an outer faint
one, and an inner thicker one; the latter opened with a display
of iridescent rings, which disappeared when the film was perfectly
formed. But no sooner was the film formed than cohesion began
to reassert itself, and, adhesion struggling with     the film broke                          it,

with the lower series and gradually ascending.        The colours
cover the film in irregular bands,  producing  exquisite harmony.
Suddenly the film opens into holes, which, in the midst of the
colours, have a striking effect.   The colours disappear with the
film, leaving a network or lace-pattern, the holes becoming
ovoid and many-sided, and the colour a beautiful steel-blue.
   A charming effect may be produced by holding a drop of tur
pentine from the end of a glass rod over the blue lace-pattern.
The vapour condensing upon the lines, causes them to swell out
and apparently to crowd closer together, while the colour becomes
changed to a silvery white.
   The effects above described succeed each other much more
rapidly on a bright warm day than on a damp or dull one,—a
remark that equally belongs to many other films.

   The modifications which take place in cohesion-figures by the
mixture of one liquid with another in varied proportions are
very striking.    For example, balsam of copaiba, when pure,
forms a figure consisting of very perfect concentric rings of
great breadth and splendid metallic colours, changing and dis
appearing as the film becomes thicker.         The outer edge of the
film is quite sharp and perfect.

school-girl problem given by Mr. Woolhouse, if we write his files
of young ladies horizontally instead of vertically.
   The derangements
                     GP, GQ, GR, &c.
of a group G are in general of two kinds—those which are, and
those which are not derived derangements. The first are such that
                          GP=PG,               GQ=QG, &c.;
in   the other,
                        GP is not PG, GQ is not QG, &c.
    A   derived        derangement         GP of G is obtained either by              the
operation
                                               PG,
which denotes the result of effecting on every substitution of G
the substitution P, or by the operation
                                               GP,
which denotes the result of effecting upon the substitution P in
turn every substitution of G.
   A derived derangement GP, of G by P, is both the derivate
PG of G by P, and the derangement GP of G by P.
   Any other derangement GR of G, which it will be convenient
to call a simple derangement of G by R, is no derivate RG of G
by R, nor is it a derivate of G by any substitution.
   Thus the simple derangement G1 above written is obtained by
effecting upon the substitution

fication, and they often pass under the slightest influences from
the first into the second condition. The solution of hydrated
silicic acid, for instance, is easily obtained in a state of purity,
but it cannot be preserved.        It may remain fluid for days or
weeks in a sealed tube, but is sure to gelatinize and become in
soluble at last. Nor does the change of this colloid appear to
stop at that point; for the mineral forms of silicic acid, deposited
from water, such as flint, are often found to have passed, during
the geological ages of their existence, from the vitreous or colloidal
into the crystalline condition (H. Rose). The colloidal                                                      is,   in

of salt present in each jar was 10 grammes, which was found at
the end to be distributed as follows in the different sectional
strata of fluid, numbering them from the top downwards:—
   In the first or highest stratum, 0.103 and 0-105 gramme of
salt in A and B respectively; in the second stratum, 0.133 and
0-125; in the third stratum, 0.165 and 0.158; in the fourth
stratum, 0.204 and 0.193; in the fifth stratum, 0.273 and
0-260; in the sixth stratum, 0.348 and 0.332; in the seventh
stratum, 0.440 and 0.418; in the eighth stratum, 0.545 and
0.525; in the ninth stratum, 0.657 and 0.652; in the tenth
stratum, 0-786 and 0-747; in the eleventh stratum, 0.887 and
0-875; in the twelfth stratum, 0.994 and 0.984; in the thir
teenth stratum, 1.080 and 1:100; in the fourteenth stratum,
1:176 and 1'198; in the fifteenth and sixteenth strata together,
2-209 and 2.324 granimes.              With differences so moderate in
amount between         corresponding     strata in the two experiments,
this method of       observing     diffusion may claim a considerable
degree of precision.
   In similar    experiments made at the same time and temperature
with sugar, gum-arabic and tannin of nut-galls, the final distri
bution of each substance was different in each case, and the
results may be placed together in illustration of unequal diffusi
bility, as exhibited by this method of observation.               Two experi
ments were made on each          substance,     as with chloride of sodium,
but the mean result only need be stated.

        Mr. T. Graham       on   Liquid Diffusion applied to Analysis. 211
        The superimposed    column of water being 111 millimetres
  (4:38 inches) in  height,  the chloride of sodium, it will be observed,
  has diffused in sensible quantity to the top, and could have risen
  higher; the upper layer being found to contain 0.104 gramme
  of salt, or 1 per cent. of the whole quantity present. The apex
 of the diffusion column of sugar appears to have just reached the
 top of the liquid in the fourteen days of the experiment, for -005
 gramme only of that substance is found in the first stratum,
 followed by 008, '012, '016, and .030 in the following strata.
 Again, no gum appears to be carried by diffusion higher than
 the seventh stratum (2:2 inches), which stratum contains 006
 gramme, followed by 031 gramme in the eighth stratum. The
 minute quantities of substance shown in the first to the sixth
 stratum, and which do not altogether exceed 020 gramme, are
 no doubt the result of accidental dispersion, arising probably
 from a movement of the upper fluid occasioned by slight inequali
 ties of temperature. The diffusion of tannin is even less advanced
 than that of gum ; but the former numbers are apparently                               in
 fluenced by a partial decomposition, to which tannin is known to
 be liable, and which gives rise to new and more highly diffusible
substances.
    Experiments continued, like those last described, for a con
stant time, do not exhibit the exact relative diffusibilities, although
these could be obtained by proceeding to ascertain, by repeated
trial, the various times required to bring about a similar distri
bution and equal amount of diffusion in                   the salts.all The
numbers observed, however, may afford data for the deduction
 of the relative diffusibilities           by
                                      calculation.

other less diffusible substances.  In comparing the two Tables
together, it appears that a fourteen days’ diffusion of sugar is
greater in amount than a four days’ diffusion of chloride of so

The diffusion of chloride of sodium appears to be pretty nearly
three times greater (or more rapid) than that of sugar.
   The following experiments were made upon hydrochloric acid
and chloride of sodium at a somewhat lower temperature and for
times which are different, but which give a nearly equal

   The diffusion of hydrochloric acid in three days corresponds
closely with the diffusion of chloride of sodium in seven days.
The times of equal diffusion for these two substances, at the tem
perature of the experiment, appear accordingly to be       (hydro                        l
chloric acid) and 2.33 (chloride of sodium).     Hydrochloric  acid
and the allied hydracids, with other monobasic acids, are the
most diffusive substances known.     The general results of several

        The experiments were conducted  in the absence of light, and
there is no reason to believe that the iodine acted chemically
upon the alcohol. The diffusion is more advanced in the iodine
than in the acetate of potash, but in both is moderate in amount,
confirming the early experiments with phials, which appeared to
show that the diffusion process was several times slower in
alcohol than in water.     The small quantities of iodine found in
each of the six   superior   strata are nearly equal, and were no
doubt  accidentally elevated by the mobility of this fluid, arising
from       its
         high dilatability                      by
                                heat compared with that      water                                  of         at

   In the upper part of the Table chloride of potassium always
appears in excess, but not in so large a proportion in the first
three strata as in the fourth.          This inequality may be partly
owing to mechanical dispersion of the mixed solution, but is to
be referred chiefly,    I  believe, to errors of analysis from a loss of
the chloride of potassium difficult to avoid in the determination
of minute proportions of that salt by means of chloride of platinum.
Of 92 milligrammes of salt found in the fourth stratum, 75 mil
ligrammes, or 81.5 per cent, are chloride of potassium. The
first six strata contain together 561 milligrammes, of which 404
milligrammes, or 72 per cent, that is nearly three-fourths, are
chloride of potassium. We have to descend to the tenth stratum
before the salts are found in equal proportions.         The progression
is then inverted, and chloride of sodium comes to preponderate
in the lower strata.
    It is evident that the preceding experiment might be so con
 ducted as to diffuse away the chloride of potassium and leave
 below a mixture containing chloride of sodium in relative excess,
 to as great an extent as the chloride of potassium is found above,
 in the last experiment.
    Further, the mixture in which chloride of potassium was con
 centrated in the experiment described, so as to form 72 per cent.
 of the whole mixture, might be subjected again to diffusion in
 the same manner.          In an experiment upon a mixture of 7.5
 grammes of chloride of potassium and 2.5 grammes of chloride
 of sodium, the six upper strata gave 640 milligrammes of salt,

 of which 610 milligrammes, or 95.3 per cent., were chloride of
 potassium.     It is obvious that by repeating this diffusive recti
 fication a sufficient number of times, a portion of the more
 diffusive salt might be obtained at last in a state of sensible
 p urity.

    Here the separation is still more sensible than before with the
bases.    The six upper strata contain 263 milligrammes of salt,
of which 239 milligrammes, that is 90.8 per cent., are chloride
of sodium. The salt of the upper eight strata amounts to 695
milligrammes, of which 583 milligrammes, or 83.9 per cent.,
are chloride of sodium.
    How long the diffusion should be continued in a liquid column
of limited height, such as in these experiments, so as to produce
the greatest separation, is a question of some interest, which can
only be answered by experiment. The last diffusion was ac
cordingly repeated, with the difference that it was continued for
double the former time.

                  2. Effect of Temperature on Diffusion.
   Diffusion is promoted by heat; and separations may accord
ingly be effected in a shorter time at high than at low tempera
tures.   In a series of observations made upon hydrochloric acid,
the diffusion of that substance was carefully determined at 15°.5
(60° F.), and at three higher points, advancing by 11°11
(20°F.). The ratios of the diffusions observed were as follows:—
   Diffusion of hydrochloric acid at 15°55                       (60°F.),      1
        2x                    29                   at 26°-66     (80° F.),      1:3545
        22                    22                   at 37°77 (100°F.), 17732
        32                    22                   at 48°.88 (120° F.), 2-1812
   The increments of diffusibility, 0.3545, 0.4187, and 0.408 for
equal increments of temperature, are probably affected by small
errors of observation, but they appear to indicate that the diffu
sion increases at a higher, although not greatly higher, rate than
the temperature.    The average increase of diffusibility for the
whole range of temperature observed is 0.03543, or gº for each
degree (0.01969, or           3's
                        nearly for 1°F.).
   The preceding experiments                  were made          by   diffusing    a2    per

    As the ratio between the diffusates of hydrochloric acid, at the
same two temperatures, was 1 to 2-1812, it appears that the acid
is less increased in diffusibility than the salts at the higher tem
perature; chloride of sodium also is slightly more increased than
chloride of potassium. The more highly diffusive the substance,
the less does it appear to gain by heat.      Chloride of sodium ap
pears to be sensibly 24 times more diffusible at 48°88 (120°F.)
than at 15°55 (60°F.): this gives an average increase of 0.014,
or ºr for 1 degree (0.025 for 1°F., or 3's). The inequality of
diffusion which the three substances referred to exhibit at a low
temperature becomes therefore less at high temperatures; and
it would appear to be the effect of a high temperature to assimi
late diffusibilities.    Heat, then, although it quickens the opera
tion of  diffusion,   does not appear otherwise to promote the sepa
ration of unequally diffusive substances.
   The results in such experiments are less disturbed by changes
of temperature, if at          all
                              gradual, than might       supposed. be            A

to95°C. in two hours, and maintained at the latter temperature
during four hours more.       Diffusion appeared to be accelerated
about six times at the    higher  temperature.
  At low temperatures, again, diffusion is proportionally slow.

peratures appeared to be,

     For nitrate of silver           at 5°-3 (41°.5 F.), 1; at 17°.4 (63°4 F.), 13914.
  The salts are unequally affected to a sensible extent; and it
will be observed that the superiority of chloride of potassium over
chloride of sodium, in diffusibility, is increased at the low tem
perature.
  Within the range of temperature of the preceding experiments,
the diffusibility of chloride of sodium being taken as 1 at 17°4

 The size of the small spheres, or their distance from the needle, was
 varied in the different experiments, so as to bring different parts of the
 axle to rest on the agate planes. The mean of the ten experiments
 was 70°02'-9 N., corresponding to the epoch 1821.65 : the extremes
 being 70° 00:1 and 70° 05'-9. The whole of the experiments were
 made by myself, and are detailed in a paper in the Phil. Trans. for
 1822,      Art. I.
    Epoch of 1838.-The experiments on this occasion were made on
 different days in 1837 and 1838, in the course of the magnetic survey
 of Great Britain, by Messrs. Robert Were Fox and John Phillips,
 Captain (since Admiral) Sir James Clark Ross, Captain Edward
 Johnson of the Royal Navy, and myself. The instruments employed
were those of Robinson, Gambey, and Jordan: the particulars are re
corded in the 8th volume of the Reports of the British Association for
the Advancement of Science (1839), Table 10, p. 64. The localities in
which the experiments were made were—l. The same spot in the
Regent's Park where those of 1821 had been made. 2. Kew Gardens.
3. Westbourne Green, a locality which has been since built over.
Separate determinations were made on 13 days between May 30, 1837,
and December 10, 1838, the mean epoch being 1838.3, and the mean
dip 69° 17'-3 N. The extremes of         the observers and all     the

      the Dip at Kew, from the commencement of those observations until
      August 1859, when it was exchanged for No. 33, which has subse
      quently been, and is now, in regular employment for that purpose.

         Correction for Annual Pariation.—Wherever, in the middle lati
    tudes of the northern hemisphere, observations of the dip have been
    made with sufficient care, it has been found that, after elimination of
    the effects of secular change, the north dip is somewhat greater in
    winter than in summer. In the 3rd volume of the Toronto Observa
    tions, pp. cxxii and cºxiii, the following Table is given as the result of
    fifteen years of careful observation made throughout at the same spot
    and according to the same method of observation, comprising 1920
    independent determinations nearly equally distributed in the different
     months, and averaging about 128 determinations for each of the
    twelve months; by combining the months equidistant from Jul
             :-

a mean annual secular change of                     –2'69;
                                        mean epoch, 1840.6.
   Between No. 1 and No. 2, comprising an interval of 16.65 years,
we have a mean secular change of –2'-77; mean epoch, 1830.0.
   Between No. 2 and No. 4, comprising an interval of 21.2 years, we
have a mean secular change of –2'-63; mean epoch, 1848.9.
   Hence we may infer that the yearly diminution of the Dip from
secular change, though very nearly uniform throughout the whole
interval of 37.85 years, was somewhat greater in the earlier part of
the interval than in the later; and that the rate of diminution
may admit of being more exactly represented by the introduction of
a second term.

   The progressive diminution of the Dip in London during the last
forty years has thus been traced and followed by the observations
recorded and discussed in this paper; and the further progress of the
research will now devolve on the systematic observations which are
made for that purpose monthly at the Observatory at Kew.
   The rate of diminution in the last forty years does not appear to
differ materially from the mean rate in the preceding hundred years.
The experiments of Mr. George Graham between March and May,
 1723, recorded in the Philosophical Transactions for 1725, No. 389,
give a mean dip in London at that epoch of “nearly” 74°40'. Com
paring this with 69°11'-95 in 1840.0, we have a difference of 5°28'l
in 1167 years, equivalent to a uniform diminution of 2'-81 annually;
or if the formula
          0=69°11'-95–2'.713 (t–t.)+0.00056 (t–t.)”
be employed, it gives the dip in March 1723.3 equal to 74° 36' 1, being
a difference of less than 4' from the result of Mr. Graham's experi
ments; which difference is doubtless less than the probable error
of that gentleman's determination with the instruments then in use.
   An expectation appears to have prevailed in some quarters that the
decrease of the Dip in London should have ceased, and     subsequent                                 its
increase have commenced, contemporaneously with the alteration
which took place           the secular change

  The following communications were read:—
   1. “Note on the Bone-Caves of Lunel-Viel, Hérault.”       By M.
Marcel de Serres.   Communicated   by  the President.
  These bone-caves in Miocene limestone, on the Mazet estate,
near Montpellier, discovered about 1823, and described in 1839 by
MM. Marcel de Serres, Dubreuil, and Jean-Jean, comprise a large
cave and some smaller fissures, containing a red earth with pebbles
and an abundance of bones and coprolites of Hyaena, Lion, Bear,
Wolf, Fox, Otter, Boar, Beaver, Rhinoceros, Horse, Deer, Ox, &c.,
with Birds and Reptiles. The author expressed his belief anew that
the association of pebbles with the bones in caves is a common
phenomenon, and an evidence of the accumulation of the materials,
gnawed bones and coprolites included, by the running water of violent
inundations,—the caverns being of Tertiary origin, the detritus being
contemporary with the old alluvium of the Rhone, and the fauna
indicated by the bones having been antecedent to the latter.
  2. “On the Petroleum-springs                      in North America.”   By Dr. A
Gesner, F.G.S.
    After some observations on the antiquity of the use of mineral oil
in North America and elsewhere, and on the present condition of
the oil- and gas-springs and the associated sulphur- and brine
springs in the United States, the author stated that 50,000 gallons
of mineral   oilare daily raised for home-use and for exportation.
The oil-region comprises parts        Lower and Upper Canada, Ohio,

 These trees stand on the 6-inch coal in Group XV. One (Sigillaria

 skeletons of Hylonomus Lyellii, one of H. Wymani, a number of
 specimens of Pupa vetusta and Xylobius Sigillaria, and some rem
 nants of Insects (in coprolites).
    In a lower bed (1217 feet beneath—in Group VIII.), a Stigma
 rian under-clay 7 feet thick, the Pupa was found abundantly in a
 thickness of 2 inches—with fragments of Reptilian bones. The
 coal-seams between the trees and this bed indicate that this Pupa
 must have existed during the growth and burial of at least twenty
 forests.

    4. “On a Volcanic Phenomenon observed at Manilla, Philippine
 Isles.”    By J. G. Veitch, Esq. In a Letter to Dr. J. D. Hooker,
 F.G.S.
    On the 1st of May 1861, the River Pasig, at Manilla, from 15 to
 18 feet deep, was disturbed by a violent ebullition from 6 to 10 A.M.
 for a distance extending to a quarter of a mile. Its temperature
 here was 100° to 105°Fahr. (elsewhere 80°). A bank of fetid mud
 was thrown up several feet above the water, and had a temperature
 of 60° to 65° only.
    The Chairman remarked that a bank of mud, 30 feet high, and
 more than a mile long, had lately been thrown up in the southern
 portion of the Caspian.

    The following communications were read:—
    1. “On the Bovey Basin, Devonshire.”         By  J. H. Key, Esq.
    The author first described the physical features of the Bovey
Basin, and then the strata, as proved by borings and diggings for
clay and lignite. Having pointed out the evidences that exist of
the basin having once been a lake in which the several strata of clay,
sand, lignite, gravel, &c. were deposited, and having considered
the probable conditions of such a lake having been gradually filled
up by fluviatile deposits brought down from neighbouring granitic
hills, the author remarked:— 1st. that the Bovey deposits are
composed of materials almost identical with the component parts of
granite.    2. The strata run, for the most part, parallel with the
outline of the marginal hills, and dip from the sides towards the
centre, often thinning away in that direction.       3. The finer mate
rial is deposited towards the sides, and the coarser towards the centre.
4. Where the basin is contracted the finer beds often disappear,
but thicken where the basin widens. 5. That the upper beds of the
northern part are coarser than those of the middle and lower portions.
6. On the eastern side the fine-clay beds are more developed than on
the western side.      7. The various beds run in the direction of, and
seem to    point to, the River Bovey as the source from whence they
were   derived;  but the old outlet of the lake was towards Torbay,
and not    along the Teign as it is at present.   Some observations on

     On the Bracklesham     Beds   of the Isle of Wight Basin.        241
the peculiar absence of animal-remains in these deposits, often rich
with vegetable-remains, concluded the paper, which was illustrated
by several original plans, sections, and sketches.
  2. “On two Volcanic Cones at the Base of Etna.”            By Signor
G. G. Gemmellaro.
   These two cones occur at Paternö and Motta (Sta. Anastasia);
and the existing remains of their craters and nuclei were described
in detail. The author concludes that these were two contempora
neous doleritic volcanic cones, that were formed in the Post-pliocene
period, previous to the deposition of the calcareous tuff of the vici
nity of Paternò,    also that they were cones of eruption, and not of
elevation, for the neighbouring strata are not disturbed—and      that
they were independent eruptions, and not parasitical cones of Etna.

   “On the Bracklesham Beds of the Isle of Wight Basin.” By the
Rev. O. Fisher, M.A., F.G.S.
   After noticing the researches of Prestwich and Dixon, the author
proceeded to state that most of the “Bracklesham Beds" are dis
played at low water at Bracklesham Bay; but other and higher beds
belonging to the same series are to be observed in the New Forest,
at Stubbington, and in the Isle of Wight.     By means of the fossils,
for the most  part, Mr. Fisher divides the series into four groups:–
A. The   uppermost   abounds in Gasteropoda, and has several fossil
beds. One of   these, in the eastern part of  its

    The  following  communications were read:—
     1. “On the Carboniferous Limestone of Oreton and Farlow, Clee
Hills, Shropshire.” By Professor John Morris, V.P.G.S., and
George E. Roberts, Esq. With a Note upon a new species of Pte
richthys; by Sir P. de M. G. Egerton, Bart., M.P., F.G.S.
    The rocks described in this paper are a series of thin beds of
limestone and sandstone lying between the Old Red Sandstone of
South Shropshire and the Millstone Grit which forms the basement
of the Titterstone Clee Coal-field.
    In consequence of the opening of new quarries and the cutting of
a  roadway    through the Farlow ridge, transversely to the strike of
 these deposits, the authors were enabled to add somewhat to the
description of the locality given in ‘The Silurian System.” The
series of deposits from the Old Red “cornstone,” upwards, was
shown by them to be :—l. Laminated yellow sandstones, with peb
ble-beds and sands. 2. Bright-yellow sandstones containing Pteri
chthys. 3. Brecciated yellow sandstones, pebble-beds, sandy layers,
and laminated sandstones.       4. Sandy and concretionary limestone.
5. Grey oolitic limestones, containing palatal teeth of great size.
6. Clays, with ferruginous bands.       7. Shaly Crinoidal limestones.
8. Clays with limestone-concretions, and shaly limestones. Against
the last-mentioned bed, the Millstone Grit rests unconformably.
   These beds thicken out at Oreton, a mile East of this Farlow section,
and are there extensively worked for various economic purposes, the
oolitic limestones, locally termed “jumbles,” being used for decora
tive purposes under the name of Clee Hill marble. In describing
the physical conditions of the localities, mention was made of the
“mole river,” which, losing itself at the West end of the ridge, takes
a subterranean course nearly parallel with its axis, and re-appears
at   its
       lower end,    mile distant.

identity of the genera Pamphractus and Pterichthys.         In addition to
Pterichthyoid remains, scales of two species of Holoptychius, one
probably new, had been found by them.
   The richness of the overlying limestones in palatal teeth was shown
by a fine series of examples, amongst which Orodus ramosus, of
unusual size and in perfect condition, and an undescribed Paecilodus,
of great magnitude, were most conspicuous.          Other genera repre
sented were Helodus, Psammodus, Cladodus, Cochliodus, Petalodus,
and Ctenoptychius.     Ichthyodorulites,   of large size and rich orna
ment, chiefly belonging to the genera Ctenacanthus and Oracanthus,
accompany these teeth.
    The notices of the invertebrate fauna given by the authors proved
the assumed lowness of the Oreton limestones in the Mountain
limestone series,<-the zone of Rhynchonella pleurodon being well
marked, Crinoidal and Bryozoan remains abundant though fragmen
tary, and Corals nearly absent.
    A large series of Pterichthyes and of rock-specimens were ex
hibited in illustration by Mr. George E. Roberts; and a collection
of palatal teeth was liberally sent for exhibition by W. Weaver
Jones, Esq., of Cleobury Mortimer, and by Edward Baugh, Esq., of
Bewdley.

Coal-measures of Lancashire.”         By E. W. Binney, Esq., F.R.S.,
F.G.S.
    After noticing the views taken of the structure of Lepidodendron
by Hooker and others, the author proceeded to describe three por
tions of calcified stems, Lepidodendroid in external appearance, two
of which exhibit in section a central axis composed, not of cellular
tissue, but of large, transversely barred, hexagonal vessels. These
two specimens the author refers to a new species, Sigillaria vascu
 laris. The third specimen differs from the others in the absence of
the thin radiating cylinder of barred vessels around the central axis;
this he terms Lepidodendron vasculare.
    Microscopical preparations and photographs of sections were sup
plied by the author.
    3. “Supplemental Notes on the Plant-beds of Central India.” By
the Rev. S. Hislop. In a Letter to the Assistant-Secretary.
    Mr. Hislop, in noticing the discovery of more remains of Plants,
Insects, and Fishes at Kota on the Pranhita, stated that he certainly
now thought that the ichthyolitic beds of Kota (probably Lower
Jurassic in age) are higher in relative position than the plant-sandstone
of Nagpur, which, with the Sironcha sandstone underlying the Kota
limestone, belong to the Damuda Group.            He remarked also that,
in his opinion, the Taeniopteris of Kampti would prove that the Da
muda and Rajmahal groups cannot be widely separated.

           ON A DEW-BOW SEEN ON THE SURFACE OF MUD.
      To the Editors     of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
   HERE      was seen today (February 13, 1862) by myself and some
     other persons  in this neighbourhood, a very beautiful phenomenon,
of which the cause is obvious, and of such a nature that one would
expect the phenomenon to occur frequently; but I do not remember
to have yet seen any instance of it recorded in any scientific publi
cation.    I refer to a prismatically-coloured hyperbolic iris, or bow
of the first order, exactly resembling that sometimes seen on a field
of dewy grass; but in this case it was displayed on the muddy sur
face of a by-road near Glasgow, and on the less trodden parts of
an adjoining turnpike road, throughout a distance of more than a
mile.    The time was between 12" 30" and 1" P.M. Greenwich time;
the morning had been hazy, but the mist had cleared away, and the
sun was shining brightly.
   The angular dimensions of the iris were obviously the same with
those of a rainbow of the first order; its colours were complete,
from red to violet, and very bright and distinct, especially where the
mud was softest and moistest; where a sheet of water, how thin
soever, covered the mud, the iris vanished.           No trace of an iris
could be seen on the   grass,  in the sky, or anywhere   but on the mud;
and on those   parts of the  turnpike   road where the mud had been
much disturbed no iris was visible.
   The necessary conclusion from this appearance            that the sur   is,
face  ofthe mud must have been thickly covered with globules         pure                of
water, perfectly spherical, and not        absolute contact with the mud,
                                                    in
although resting     it; but those globules must have been extremely
                    on
minute, for they were invisible         the closest inspection with the
                                               to
naked eye.

        NOTE ON THE THEORY OF SPHERICAL CONDENSERS.
                     BY M. J. M. GAUGAIN.
 I    have indicated     my preceding communications
                           in                                general             *   a

                                questions relative  condensers may       to
 be transformed into questions      propagation, and thus brought

                         of                           this principle       of
has been already demonstrated experimentally,–1,        the case              in              of

it for a new class of condensers, that of concentrical spherical con
densers.                                                         -
   The   problem  which I  proposed   to solve was as follows:–Given
two concentrical spheres, suppose that the inside sphere, whose
radius is r, is placed in contact with a constant source of electricity,
and that the external sphere whose radius is R, is placed in contact
with the ground; it is required to express the charge of the inside
sphere in terms of the radii r and R.
   In order to obtain the corresponding question of propagation, it
is sufficient to suppose that the insulating substance, which sepa
rates the two spheres in the case of condensation, is replaced by a
medium which is a conductor, but to a far less extent than the
substance of which the spheres consist.        The problem then con
sists in finding an expression for the intensity of the current
transmitted from the internal sphere to the external one; and this
latter question is easily solved.
   Suppose two concentric spheres very near each other, and having
the radius a. and a +                 da:
                              being less than
                                            (a    and greater than r);         R

    The differences obtained between the calculated and observed
charges are small, considering the imperfections of the modes of
measurement;       and we see that the formulae deduced from the
theory of propagation may be applied to the case of condensa
tion, as well in the case of spherical condensers as in the case of the
cylindrical and plane condensers with which I have been previously
occupied.     I believe that the proposition may without temerity be
generalized, and be considered applicable to condensers of any
shape.
    To appreciate the interest of this principle, it is important to ob
 serve that the theory of condensers, which has been usually pre
 sented as a branch of statical electricity, comprehends really the
 whole of this subject. When an insulated and electrified conductor
 is placed in any room, the electricity with which it is charged is
 usually called free electricity; but, as Mr. Faraday has shown by
 numerous experiments, this electricity is no more free than that on
 the inner coating of a Leyden jar. The insulated conductor is only
 the inner coating of a large condenser, the external coating of which
 is constituted by the whole of the adjacent conductors.          In fine, all
 questions relating to the distribution of electricity which is said to be
free, depend on the theory of condensers, and may therefore be
 solved by means of the theory of propagation. By the principle
 which I have propounded,            all
                                  questions    statical electricity may

 resolved into questions      dynamics, and vice versd.

    The want      of apparatus has prevented me from investigating
 whether the numerous results which Coulomb obtained                   his re in

XXXIV.       On the Passage of Radiant Heat through moist Air, and
    on the Hygroscopic Properties of Rock Salt.  By G. MAGNUsl.
Tºp   deportment of our
  of the solar
                          atmosphere in reference to the passage
                   through it
                 heat            appeared especially important to
me in the investigation on the  propagation  of heat in gases, of
which I gave an account to the Königliche  Academie on the 30th
of July 1860t, and 7th of February 1861. Although it could be
foreseen that the small quantity of aqueous vapour which the air
can take up at the ordinary temperature would exercise a scarcely
perceptible influence on the passage of the thermal rays, yet, after
it had been made out that, under the same circumstances, olefiant
gas only transmits half as many rays as oxygen, and ammoniacal
gas still fewer, it appeared desirable to investigate whether that
anticipation was well founded or not.          Experiment completely
                  it:              by
                            the application

     Heat         by
              Gases and Vapours,” published simultaneously with
the above investigation, contained the statement that undried
 atmospheric air,            on
                          certain day, exhibited fifteen times

250                   Prof. Magnus on the Passage of Radiant
atmosphere,   and mainly to the aqueous vapour.”          He has, he
continues, led by the experiments which I have made, again
investigated this subject, and the experiments have shown that
the action of aqueous vapour was enormous. On the 10th of
October he found that the absorption by the air of the laboratory
consisted of three components.        If the first, which is due to
pure air, be designated by the number 1, the second, produced by
the transparent aqueous vapour is 40, and the third, caused by
the effluvia of the laboratory and the carbonic acid, is 27. The
total action of foreign substances on that day was certainly 67
                                                                           as air
times as great as that of the atmospheric         alone, and that                                         of
the aqueous vapour was certainly 40 times          great.

   Melloniº found that a layer of pure water of a millimetre
in thickness transmits no heat which comes from an obscure
source of heat.    Of the rays of ignited platinum, 57 per cent.
are transmitted. In Melloni’s experiments t, a saturated solution
of rock salt transmitted       more      the rays from

    I
    do not venture to maintain                           that        the remarkable results
which Dr. Tyndall obtained on the 10th of October of this year,
depend on the hygroscopic properties of his plates of rock salt,
since I neither know sufficiently the quality of these plates, nor
the precautions which Dr. Tyndall took in his experiments.         My
only object is to call attention to the difficulties incidental to the
use of plates of rock salt in such experiments.
        XXXV.             Remarks on Recent Researches on Radiant Heat.

§ 1.         last Number of      Poggendorff's Annalen contains a
        THEshort paper by Professor      Magnus, “On the Passage
of Radiant Heat       through  moist   air,” a translation of which
appears in the present Number of the Philosophical Magazine.
This paper has excited considerable interest and some dis
cussion among the scientific men of London, and it is on many
accounts desirable that I should not delay attempting to offer
an explanation of the differences which exist between my emi
nent friend and myself.     A brief sketch of the history of the sub
ject is also considered desirable; and this, as far as the extremely
limited time at my disposal will admit                               of,

my caustic potash, and of pure glass for my sulphuric acid. But
with these also a long time elapsed before      I   was master of the
anomalies which from time to time made their appearance.          The
dust of a   cork; a  fragment   of  sealing-wax,  so minute as almost
to escape the eyesight; the moisture of the fingers touching the
neck of the U-tube, in which the sulphuric acid was contained
—these, and many other apparently trivial causes, were sufficient
entirely to vitiate my results in delicate cases, giving me on
many occasions effects which I knew to be large multiples of
the truth.     Thus, while perfectly safe as regards the stronger
gases whose energy of action masked small errors, prolonged
experiment was needed to connect these with the feebler ones, and
to refer them to air as a standard. In short,       I   thought it due
both to the public and myself to abstain from giving more than
a clear general account of my inquiry until I had mastered every
 anomaly that had arisen.    I   cannot regret having exercised this
patience, more especially when   I    find one of the ablest and most
 conscientious  experimenters  of modern times falling, as I believe,
 into error on some of the   points   which most perplexed me.
     A few weeks subsequent to the receipt of my paper by the
 Royal Society, that is to say, on the 7th of February, 1861, an
 account of experiments on the transmission of radiant heat
 through gases was communicated by Professor Magnus to the
 Academy of Sciences in Berlin.         In this inquiry the absorption
 of heat   by vapours   was left   untouched,   nor did it embrace the
 reciprocity of radiation and absorption which my investigation
 revealed.    But as regards absorption by gases, Professor Magnus
  and myself had operated on the same substances; and consider
 ing the totally different methods employed, the correspondence
 between our results must be regarded as very remarkable.
     Previous to occupying himself with the transmission of heat
  through gases, Prof. Magnus had made an investigation on the
  conduction of heat by gases, and he was led naturally by this
  inquiry to take up the question of gaseous diathermancy. My
  knowledge of his great skill and extreme caution as an experi
  menter entirely ratifies a statement which he has repeated more
  than once in his published memoir, namely, that his results on
  the diathermancy of gases were already obtained at the time he
  communicated his results on conduction to the Academy of
  which he is a member, that is to say, in the month of July
  1860; in fact the very experiments intended to determine their
  conduction, really revealed the absorption of the gases. I am
  quite persuaded that the results of Prof. Magnus are inde
  pendent of mine, and that, had I published nothing on the sub
  ject, his own inquiries would have led him to the discoveries
  which he has announced. That my researches preceded           his   by

258            Prof. Tyndall on Recent Researches on Radiant Heat.
more than a year, is simply to be ascribed to the fact of my
attention having been directed to the radiation of heat through
gases long before even his researches on conduction had com
menced.       It is needless to dwell upon the value of such a general
corroboration as that which subsists between Prof. Magnus and
myself. However private interests may fare, science is assuredly
a gainer when independent courses of experiment lead, as in
the present instance, to the same important results.
    § 3. But while furnishing, by an independent method, a
highly valuable general corroboration of my results, there are
some special points on which Prof. Magnus differs from me;
and one of these (the action of aqueous vapour on radiant heat)
he has made the subject of special examination.                      My first
experiment gave the action of the vapour of the London air on
a November day to be 15 times that of the                    itself. Only          air                             a
few weeks     subsequently     Prof.   Magnus    announced,   and cited very
clear experiments          support
                                 in                    of
                                          his statement, that the amount
of  aqueous vapour capable             being takenof         air        tempe up   by          at

         Prof. Tyndall on Recent Researches on Radiant Heat,                                                       259
rays of heat.       Such a solution on the surfaces of my plates
might account in part for the extraordinary absorption which 1
have observed. In a series of experiments made with the express
intention of wetting the plates of salt by precipitation, Prof.
Magnus exalts the absorption to 4 times that of air; but
though the plates were visibly wet, no nearer approach than
this could be made to my result, which makes the absorption of
 aqueous vapour 40, 50, and even 60 times that of air.                It was
 only on the inner surface of the salt, which came into contact
with the saturated air, that the moisture was precipitated in the
 experiments of Prof. Magnus; the outer surface, which was in
 contact with the common air of his laboratory, remained dry;
 and even the wetted surface, when exposed for a time to the
 same air, became dry also.         I would here, at the commencement,
remark that it is with this common outer air, and not with air
 artificially saturated with moisture, that          find the absorption of      I
 aqueous vapour to be 50 or 60 times that of the air in which it is
                                      I
 diffused. In fact, if am correct, the action of aqueous vapour
 upon radiant heat might be applied in the construction of a
 hygrometer surpassing in delicacy any hitherto devised.
     I  think it would be hardly possible for a person of any experi
 mental aptitude whatever, to work, as I have done, for three years
 with plates of rock-salt, which must be kept polished and bright,
 without becoming aware of                               all

 me more        or less cripple ever since.

        But   I have
                not relied on the inspection of the outer surface
alone of   my    rock-salt plates.                             I
                                          have taken my apparatus

reason to  expect  precipitation,  but have not been able to find a
trace of moisture on my plates.
   This, however, did not entirely satisfy me, and I therefore
made an arrangement of the following kind:—An India-rubber
bag was filled with                     air
                            and subjected       gentle pressure.     By  to

forced either through      succession    atubes containing fragments

which   fragments       glass      of

A  current     either dry

the wet air, under precisely the same conditions, into             open                               an

would be quite impossible for me to carry out my experiments
with a pile thus circumstanced; for after the instrument had
been either heated or chilled dynamically, it required in some
cases hours for the needle to return to zero.    I may add that                                                  I
have made these experiments on dynamic heating and chilling

their motion visible to the most distant members of the large

 of glass 2.6 millimetres in thickness.        It is therefore almost
 certain that 70  per cent. of the entire heat emitted by the lamp
 of Prof. Magnus   were lodged in his first glass plate.       A much
less quantity of the direct heat would be absorbed by his second
plate; but here the amount absorbed would be most effective as .
a secondary source of heat, on account of the proximity of this
plate to the thermo-electric pile.
    With the blackened tube, then, we had three sources of heat
acting directly or indirectly upon the pile—the lamp, the first
plate of glass, and the second plate.        In reality, however, the
sources reduce themselves to two.         For,  glass being opake to
the radiation from   glass, the heat emitted by the first plate was
expended in exalting the temperature of the second, close to
which the pile was placed.      On admitting              the ordinary               air    at

nummulitic eocene beds of Cutch similarly connected with the

siderable area in Western India.            There seems to me every
reason to infer that the suggestion of M. d’Archiac, quoted by
Sir Roderick Murchison*, affords the true explanation of the
phenomena presented, viz. that the eocene formations of Western
Europe were but the littoral deposits of the great nummulitic
gulf+, and were formed by the sand and mud of rivers debouch
ing into the gulf at the spots where these formations occur, the
deltas of which rivers have furnished the estuarine and fluviatile
beds which are associated with these deposits. The mollusca

     Land-tracts during the Secondary and Tertiary Periods.           277
to the northward by a continuous shore, formed of deposits
which had been land since the close of the secondary period,
and closed from any connexion with the North American seas,
we have in the Vertebrata of the period most satisfactory evidence
of a continuous land-connexion between the American and the
Europeo-Asiatic continents.           Associated in the same bed at
Kyson in Suffolk, there have been found remains of the Macacus
(Eopithecus), an exclusively eastern genus of monkey, and the
Didelphis, an exclusively American form of marsupial. In the
fluviatile deposit of Hordle in Hampshire, the remains of a type
of crocodile resembling the American form (the cayman) occur;
at the not far distant locality of Bracklesham, in the marine
though slightly older portion of the same delta, the true Asiatic
gavial has been found; and in the London clay the true Eastern
form of crocodile. In the same fluviatile of Hordle there occurs
in the greatest abundance the remains of the peculiar freshwater
fish the Lepidosteus, now an exclusively American form; and
associated with these Vertebrata, a land-shell (Helix labyrinthica)
now existing only in North America; and the river in whose
deposits these forms occur, discharged into a sea containing
mollusca whose affinities, as I have shown, are entirely with the
East. Continuing eastward into Asia from the European termi
nation of this Atlantic bridge, by following the line of secondary
formations, which extend through Northern Europe and Western
Asia uncovered by any eocene deposits (they having been already
traced as far east as the Aral Sea), we perceive the wide stretch
of land which at the dawn of the tertiary period connected the
Asiatic region with America. The dissimilarity between the
mollusca of the European and American eocene formations, to
which I have already adverted, militates against any hypothesis
of a coast-line joining the seas in which such formations were
respectively deposited; and this agrees with what might be              in
ferred from the indications afforded by the configuration of the
secondary strata which skirt the eocene basins of England, Bel
gium, and France, which         is, that the latter countries formed the
head   of the nummulitic gulf, the coast-line connecting England
with the shore    of   the American eocene sea being          on  the other
side  of the land thus     closing      that
                                       in     gulf.
    The extension    of   the European continent westward          at   the
       of       tertiary   period,     the manner have        attempted to

                                                  I

                                         a
 gulf from the Atlantic,   is    further shown   by   the circumstance   of
 the  European    and American fauna          becoming   more assimilated
 when they occur     in   formations which were due      to   the sediment
of   one common      ocean,    the   Atlantic.    Thus  Sir  Charles  Lyell

278        Mr. S. W. Wood on the Form and Distribution of the
long ago showedº the connexion of the American and European
miocene formations by the presence of several marine molluscous
forms in common. Now, the absence of any similar connexion
between the eocene marine mollusca of the two continents, while
so close a connexion exists between the terrestrial fauna                                       of the
eocene of Europe with that now existing in America, seems
only intelligible upon the hypothesis of a land tract at once
joining the continents, but severing the seas. That this land
connexion has been gradually disappearing since the eocene
period, is shown by the agreement among naturalists that the
molluscous fauna of the shores of the Western Isles, the Madeiras,
and of Portugal, affords evidence of the extension of Western
Europe in this direction between the miocene and the pleistocene
epochs, forming a province to which they have given the name
of Lusitaniant.
   The probability of the configuration, at the dawn of the tertiary
period, which I have described, receives support also from a con
sideration of the climatal conditions which the fossils of that
period indicate.
   It has not unfrequently been remarked, as inconsistent with
any theory of a gradual refrigeration of climate during geological
periods down to the pliocene, that the eocene fauna of Europe,
both vertebrate and invertebrate, should at so late a stage in
the geological succession, present at least as tropical a character
as that presented by the fauna of any preceding stage in our
latitudes. The explanation of this fact, standing out as it does
at variance with any law of gradual refrigeration, should, think,                         I
be sought in a consideration of the geographical configuration
of the period. It            is,
                       with reference     this subject, also worthy
                                                          to                                       of
remark that           we   do
                      not find this tropical eocene fauna extending
 up  into high latitudes,                                                                           of

280      Mr. S. W. Wood    on the Form and Distribution      of the
distribution of animal life during the cretaceous era, this collec
tion is of the highest interest. It shows that during two suc
cessive stages of that era the climatal influence, as affecting
marine animals, did not vary in intensity in the Indian, Euro
pean, and American regions, whilst the later of the two [Verda
chellam and Trinconopoly stage] had specific relations with the
seas of Europe which are absent from the earlier [Pondicherry
stage]. The cause of this remarkable fact is not to be sought
for in a more general distribution of animal life at one time than
at another, but rather in some great change in the distribution
of land and sea, and in a greater connerion of the Indian and
European seas during the epoch of the deposition of the upper
greensand than during that of the lower.            To this cause must
also be attributed the   peculiar  tertiary  aspect  of the Indian col
lections, depending upon the presence of a number of forms
usually regarded as characteristic of tertiary formations, such as
 Cypraea, Oliva, Triton, Pyrula, Nerita, and numerous species of
 Voluta, the inference from which, since not one of the species is
identical with any known tertiary form, should not be that the
deposits containing them are either tertiary or necessarily con
nected with the tertiary, but that the genera in question com
menced their existence earliest in the eastern seas.”            By the
expression   I  have  copied  in  italics,  the author,   I apprehend,
meant a greater connexion of the seas by a more continuous
shore line, affording facility for migration of mollusca; and this,
in order to join these regions, would necessarily be in an easterly
and westerly direction. The origin of the characteristic eocene
molluscous forms in the east, and their subsequent development
westerly, thus suggested by Mr. Forbes, seems to me to lend
support to the view that I have taken, of the connexion of the
seas of Western Europe with those of Eastern Asia, in the form
of a gulf stretching from Eastern Asia as far at least as the most
westerly limits of Europe, at the epoch when the sea again occu
pied a part of the area which had been continent during the
intra-cretaceous and tertiary interval.
   If  at the commencement of the tertiary period we find the
evidences of a tropical climate extending northwards to the
52nd parallel, due to the peculiar geographical configuration of
the period, how excessive may we conceive the climate of the intra
cretaceous and tertiary period to have been, when a vast level tract
of desiccated sea-bottom, uninterrupted by mountain chains of
any importance, extended through the whole region between the
tropic of Cancer and the parallel of 50° N., from England
on the west to the Bay of Bengal on the east, and (from the
evidence of the eocene land-fossils) appears to have been con
tinued westward in a lower latitude to America.           Whether this

hypertropical belt of continent was continued eastward beyond
the Aralian region, we have not any evidence to affirm; the
opening-up of Central Asia will alone disclose this, and until
then the limit of this extension cannot be realized; but it should
not be overlooked that the great region of Oceanica, which Mr.
Darwin has shown to consist of submerged mountain chains of
immense extent, and to be now in a state of elevation and depres
sion in alternate bands, is traversed by that great volcanic band
to the operation of which has been due the formation of the
major part of the Europeo-Asiatic continent, that         the part                            is,

                        cretaceous and tertiary formations.                                                 It   is
to the extreme climate and widely different conditions          which
this configuration must have given rise, that venture           think           I                   to to

Absorption       of moisture by sulphuric acid from an atmosphere
                     saturated with the vapour           of water.
    Equal measures of strong sulphuric acid diluted with different
proportions of water were introduced into a beaker 2; inches in
diameter, the liquid being half an inch from the edge of the glass;
and the beaker with the acid was placed on a tray containing
 water, and covered over with a large receiver about 1 foot in dia
meter. The absorption by strong sulphuric acid, during twenty
 four hours, being first determined, the strong acid was succes
 sively diluted with four equivalents of water, and the weights of
 moisture absorbed in twenty-four hours by the respective liquids
were determined as follows:–

                the Laws   of Evaporation and Absorption.          287
capacity   for  absorption    decreases according to a geometrical pro
gression.
   It   will be hereafter seen that a similar law applies to the solu
tion   of absorbent   salts.
   It   was further determined that, the strength of the acid being
constant, the amount of absorption in equal times varies (approxi
mately) inversely as the depth of the liquid from the edge of the
vessel in which it is placed.
    Other things being the same, the rate of absorption increases
with the temperature. It was also found that the rate of absorp
tion, other things being the same, increases with the decrease of
the atmospheric pressure.
Absorption     of  moisture by solutions of chloride of sodium from
          an atmosphere saturated with the vapour of water.
   In   this case 2824 grains of a saturated solution of the salt
were successively diluted with 1000 grains of water, the diameter
of the vessel exposed to the humid air of the receiver being 6
inches: thus the second solution contained 2824 grains of the
saturated, or first solution, with the addition of 1000 grains of
water; the third solution contained 3824 grains of the last solu
tion, with the addition of 1000 grains of water; and so on to the
other solutions. The results of experiment were as follows:–
    In twenty-four hours, the first, second, third, and fourth solu
tions respectively absorbed 25, 15:4, 9-0, 6-0 and 4.1 grains of
moisture.
    Now these results are approximately expressed by the formula
                                a=25 x 6k,
where k=r<U+017F><U+017F>ºn of the weight of the water added to the saturated
solution.
    It will be seen that this law of absorption is similar to that
 determined for sulphuric acid. It appears, therefore, that the
rate of absorption has a determinate atomic relation.
  Spontaneous evaporation of moisture from different surfaces      ex
                         posed to the atmosphere.
    It  has been shown       in one of the foregoing papers, that the
 evaporation from absorbents saturated with moisture is for the
most part uniform, the temperature and hygrometric state of the
air being constant.
     1. The rate of evaporation of moisture from damp porous sub
 stances, of the same material, is proportional to the extent of the
 surface presented to the air, without regard to the relative thick
nesses    of the substances.
    Thus two pieces of calico, presenting 150 square inches of
 surface, but the one folded double whilst the other was single,

were saturated   with moisture and suspended in a quiescent,
atmosphere.    After the lapse of two hours the single thickness.
of calico had lost 41.6 grains of moisture by evaporation, whilst
the double thickness had lost 42 grains.
   In this respect spontaneous evaporation differs entirely from
spontaneous absorption, which, as we have seen, is dependent
(within certain limits) upon the thickness or weight of the mate
rial, and not upon the extent of     surface.                 its

ascensional current of vapour, which would facilitate the process
of evaporation; but this can only take place during continued
sunshine: in other cases the temperature of the damp surface
(owing to the cooling effect of evaporation) is from 1 to 6 de
grees below that of the surrounding air; and under such circum
stances, according to the results of these experiments, we can
have little or no ascensional current of vapour tending to pro
mote the process of evaporation.
    The temperature and hygrometric state of the air being con
stant, the process of evaporation is very much accelerated by
aérial currents and by direct sunshine.
    4. The rate of evaporation from a damp surface is very much
affected by the elevation at which the surface is placed above the
ground.
    About half an hour before sunset, with a clear sky and a calm
air, the two tin plates, with their damp surfaces somewhat below
saturation, were placed as follows: one about an inch above the
 grass, the other at an elevation of three feet, both damp surfaces
 being placed upwards. In the course of two hours the former
 had gained 7.5 grains of moisture by absorption, whilst the latter
 had lost 5 grains of moisture by evaporation.     In another expe
 riment, the temperature of the air being higher, the former had
 lost 12.7 grains by evaporation, whilst the latter had lost 21.2
 grains by evaporation.     Here the damp cloth at the surface of
 the ground was cooled down with the grass by radiation, whilst
 the upper cloth was nearly maintained at the temperature of the
 air at that elevation.
                                                   -
    5. The rate of evaporation is affected by the radiation of sur
 rounding bodies.
    The plates, as described, were placed in the shade at the height
 of six inches above the ground, with their damp surfaces up
 wards, the sky being clear, but one plate had a screen placed
 over   it.      In
               the course               of
                              two hours the latter had lost   grains       8
 by  evaporation, whereas the former had lost only 3.5 grains;
  that  is,
          the evaporation from the surface with the screen was
  about double that from the surface without the screen.         On
 another occasion the evaporation                from the surface with the screen
 over   it   was found        to   be   32.6 grains, whilst from the other surface
it   was only         25   grains.

  first to the diffusion of crystalloids through a gelatinous or
colloid mass, the circumstances of the experiment being varied
as little as possible from those of jar diffusion.
   Ten grammes of chloride of sodium and 2 grammes of the
Japanese gelatine, or gelose of Payen, were dissolved together in
so much hot water as to form 100 cub. centims. of fluid.      Intro
duced into the empty diffusion-jar and allowed to cool, this fluid
set into a firm jelly, occupying the lower part of the jar, and
containing of course 10 per cent. of chloride of sodium. Instead
of placing pure water over this jelly, it was covered by 700 cub.
centims, of a solution containing 2 per cent. of the same gelose,
cooled so far as to be on the point of gelatinizing,  the jar at the
same time being placed in a cooling mixture, in order to expedite
that change.     The jar with                           its

   Diffusion of a crystalloid thus appears to proceed through a firm
jelly with little or no abatement of velocity. With a coloured
crystalloid, such as bichromate of potash, the gradual elevation of
the salt to the top of the jar is beautifully illustrated.   On the
other hand, the diffusion of a coloured colloid such as caramel,
through the jelly, appeared scarcely to have begun after eight
days had elapsed. The diffusion of a salt into the solid jelly
                                                                on its

was conveniently applied to dialytic experi
ments. Two sizes of the bulb were employed,
3.14 and 4:44 inches in diameter respec
tively, and of which the dialytic septa pos
sessed an area very nearly of Tluth and
#ºnth of a square metre (15.6 and 7.8
square inches).     With 100 cub. centims. of
fluid in the osmometer (the volume usually
employed), the septum of the smaller instru
ment was covered to a depth of about 20
millimetres (0:8 inch), and the septum of
the larger to a depth of 10 millimetres
(0.4 inch). The thinner the stratum, the
more exhaustive the diffusion in a given                    =-         3
time. It is generally unadvisable to cover the septum deeper
than 10 or 12 millimetres (half an inch), where a considerable
diffusion is desired within twenty-four hours.           The following
practical observations may be found useful in applying the dialyser
to actual cases of analysis. They refer to the parchment-paper
septum, which is much the most convenient for use.
    With a 2 per cent. solution of chloride of sodium, containing
2  grammes    of the salt, and covering a septum of nearly 0.01
square metre (15.6 square inches) in area, to a depth of 10 milli
metres, the salt which diffused in five hours amounted to 0-75
gramme, and in twenty-four hours to 1.657 gramme, leaving
behind 0.343 gramme, or 17.1 per cent. of the original salt.
The following experiments, made with the same osmometer and
solution, show the effect of reducing the volume of liquid placed
in the dialyser. The proportion of salt which diffused out in
twenty-four hours was—                     -  - -
          From 100 cub. centims. of solution 86 per cent.
          From 50 cub. centims. of solution 92 per cent.
          From 25 cub. centims, of solution 96 per cent.
    In all cases the volume of water outside into which the salt
escaped was ample, being from five to ten times as much as the
volume of fluid placed in the dialyser, and it was changed during
the continuance of the experiment. A much less volume of ex
ternal water suffices, provided it is changed at intervals of a few
hours. The temperature was 10° to 12°.             It will be observed
that these volumes correspond to a depth of       liquid in the dialyser
of 0-4, 0-2, and 0.1 inch respectively.
   The time of travelling through the thickness of the parchment
paper itself may be observed, and is worthy of remark.                -
    Of the quality of parchment-paper always used in these experi
ments, as quare metre, when dry, weighed 67 grammes, and when
charged with water 1086 grammes.           Taking the specific gravity
of cellulose at 1:46, that of the lighter woods, the parchment-paper
described will, in the humid state, have a thickness of 0.0877

 millimetre, or THT of a millimetre.           Wet parchment-paper so
thin is  highly   translucent.     Gelatinous starch, slightly coloured
with blue    litmus,   was   applied  by a brush to one side of the wet
parchment-paper.           Immediately afterwards a drop of water,
containing Tºroth part of hydrochloric acid, was applied on
the point of the finger to the other (the lower) side of the
paper. The time required by the acid to affect the litmus, in
five successive trials, was 6 seconds, 5.5 seconds, 6 seconds,
and 5 seconds.          The mean is 5:7 seconds, which is therefore
the time required by hydrochloric acid, diluted already 1000
times, to travel a distance of 0.0877 of a millimetre, by the agency
of diffusion. The temperature was 15°.
   With hydrochloric acid diluted twice as much as before (water
containing 0.0005 dry acid), the average time of passage was
10.4 seconds, or nearly double the preceding time.
   Water containing rºomth of sulphuric acid (an acid less rapidly
diffused than hydrochloric acid) reddened the litmus in 9:l se
conds, and when doubly diluted, in 16:5 seconds.
   These results are not affected, it is believed, by any sensible
diffusive movement on the part of the litmus.             The diffusion of
that colouring matter, in a colloid medium, is so slow that it may
be entirely disregarded.        The acid, therefore, is not met in                                         its
way    by the litmus, but really travels the entire distance expressed
by  the thickness         the parchment-paper.

   Picric acid and theine were actually diffused from 1 per cent.

crystallizable principles, theine, salicine, and amygdaline, appear
greatly more diffusible than gallo-tannic acid, or than gun, as
has been already seen. Such inequality of rate is likely to
facilitate the separation of vegetable principles by the agency of
dialysis.
            4. Preparation         of Colloid         Substances by Dialysis.
  The purification of many colloid substances     may be effected
with great advantage  by placing  them on the dialyser.     Accom
panying crystalloids are eliminated, and the colloid is left behind
in a state of purity.      The purification of soluble colloids can
rarely be effected by any other known means, and dialysis is
evidently the appropriate mode of preparing such substances free
from crystalloids.
    Soluble Silicic Acid.—Asolution of silica is obtained by pouring
silicate of soda into diluted hydrochloric acid, the acid being
maintained in large excess.      But in addition to hydrochloric acid,
such a solution contains chloride of sodium, a salt which causes
the silica to gelatinize when the solution is heated, and otherwise
modifies        its
                 properties. Now such soluble silica, placed for

of water were brought together, and the solution placed upon a
hoop dialyser, 10 inches in diameter. After four days the solu
tion had increased to 1235 cub. centims, by the action of osmose,
colloid bodies being generally highly osmotic.      The solution
now gave no precipitate with nitrate of silver, and contained
60.5 grammes of silica, 67 grammes of that substance having
been lost.    The solution contained 4.9 per cent. of silicic
acid.
    The pure solution of silicic acid so obtained may be boiled in
a flask, and considerably concentrated, without change; but when
heated in an open vessel, a ring of insoluble silica is apt to form
round the margin of the liquid, and soon causes the whole to
gelatinize. The pure solution of hydrated silicic acid is limpid
and colourless, and not in the least degree viscous, even with 14
per cent. of silicic acid. The solution is the more durable the

298     Mr. T. Graham    on Liquid Diffusion applied to Analysis.
represented by    NaO +36SiO4 (Gmelin). This silicate is probably
a co-silicate of soda in the pectous condition.         Soluble silicic
acid produces a gelatinous precipitate in lime-water, containing
6 per cent. and upwards of the basic earth. This and the other
insoluble earthy co-silicates appear not to be easily obtained in
a definite state.    They gave out a more basic silicate to water on
washing. The composition of these salts and that also of the
co-silicate of gelatine were found to vary according as the mode
of preparation was modified. When a solution of gelatine was
poured into silicic acid in excess, the co-silicate of gelatine formed
gave, upon analysis, 100 silicic acid with 56 gelatine, or little
more than half the gelatine stated above as found in that com
pound prepared with the mode of mixing the solutions reversed.
The gallo-tannate of gelatine is known to offer the same variability
in composition.
    The gelatine used in the preceding experiments was isinglass
 (colle de poisson) purified by solution in hydrochloric acid and
subsequent dialysis. As the acid escapes by diffusion, a jelly is
formed in the dialyser. This jelly is free from the earthy matter,
 amounting to about 0.4 per cent, in isinglass, and is not liable
 to putrefaction.
     Cosilicic acid also precipitates both albuminic acid and pure
 caseine.
     Soluble Alumina.--We are indebted to Mr. Walter Crum for
                                                              º
 the interesting discovery that alumina may be held in solution
 by water alone in the absence of any acid. But two soluble
 modifications of alumina appear to exist, alumina and metalu
 mina. The latter is Mr. Crum's substance.
     A solution of the neutral chloride of aluminium (Al” Cl”),
 placed on the dialyser, appears to diffuse away without decom
 position.     But when an excess of hydrated alumina is
 dissolved in the chloride, the latter salt is found to escape by dif
 fusion in a gradual manner, and the hydrated alumina, retaining
 little or no acid, to remain behind in a soluble state. A solution
 of alumina in chloride of aluminium, consisting at first of 52
 parts of alumina to 48 of hydrochloric acid, after a dialysis of
 six days, contained 66.5 per cent. of alumina; after eleven days
 76.5 per cent. ; after seventeen days 92.4 per cent. ; and after
 twenty-five days the alumina appeared to be as nearly as possible
 free from acid, as traces only of hydrochloric acid were indicated
 by an acid solution of nitrate of silver. But in such experi
 ments the alumina often pectizes in the dialyser before the
 hydrochloric acid has entirely escaped.
     Acetate of alumina with an excess of alumina gave similar
 results. The alumina remained fluid in the dialyser for twenty
 one days, and when it pectized was found to retain 34 per cent.

to 282 equivalents of alumina.
    Soluble alumina is one of the most unstable of substances—a
circumstance which fully accounts for the difficulty of preparing
it in a state of purity. It is coagulated or pectized by portions,
so minute as to be scarcely appreciable, of sulphate of potash
and, I believe, by       other salts; and also

This blue liquid is quite incapable of passing through the dialyser,
and is equally colloidal with ordinary prussian blue. So also is
basic prussian blue prepared by the spontaneous        oxidation of
precipitated ferrocyanide of protoxide of iron. This last colloid
might probably be purified with advantage upon the dialyser.

   Sucrate of Lime.—The well-known solution of lime in sugar
forms a solid coagulum when heated.       It is probably, at a high
temperature, entirely colloidal. The solution obtained on cool
ing passes through the septum, but requires a much longer time
than a true crystalloid like the chloride of calcium.
   The blue solution of tartrate of copper in caustic potash con
tains a colloidal compound, which has not been fully examined.
    Soluble Chromic Owide.—The definite terchloride of chromium,
being a crystalloid, diffuses away entirely when placed in solu
tion upon the dialyser. This salt dissolves, with time, a certain
portion of freshly-precipitated hydrated chromic oxide, and
becomes of a deeper green colour.          Such a solution, after dia
lysis for twenty-two days, contained 8 hydrochloric acid to 92
chromic oxide; and after thirty-days, 4.3 acid to 95.7 oxide, or
1 equiv. acid to 10-6 equivs. oxide.         After thirty-eight days,
the solution gelatinized in part upon the dialyser, and then con
tained 1.5 acid to 98.5 oxide, or 1 equiv. acid to 31-2 equivs.
chromic oxide.      This last solution, which may be taken to repre
sent soluble chromic oxide, is of a dark-green colour, and admits
of being heated, and also of being diluted with pure water with
out change.      It was gelatinized with the usual facility by traces
of salts and other reagents which affect colloid solutions, and
was then no longer soluble in water, even with the assistance of
heat.     It appeared to be the green hydrated oxide of chromium
as that substance is usually known.         A metachromic oxide may
possibly be obtained by heating and dialysing the acetate, but I
have not attempted to form            it.

      The precipitated and gelatinous peroxide                of       tin   is   largely

306     Col. Sir H. James   and Capt.    A. R. Clarke on Projections
soluble in the bichloride of the same metal. Such a solution,
when placed in the dialyser, allows the whole chlorine of the
salt and a portion of the tin to diffuse away. Peroxide of tin,
or stannic acid, remains behind, but not in a soluble state.         It
forms in the dialyser a semitransparent gelatinous cake, which
after a few days is entirely free from chlorine. The original
solution, containing excess of stannic acid, was diluted to various
degrees, but was dialysed always with the same result.            The
coagulum was insoluble in hot or cold water, but dissolved
readily in dilute acids.     It was evidently the peroxide of tin
unaltered.
   The metastannic acid, or nitric-acid peroxide of tin of Berzelius,
forms a solid compound with a small quantity of hydrochloric
acid. This compound is not dissolved by an excess of acid, but
is soluble in pure water.     The solution placed in the dialyser is
readily decomposed, and leaves behind a semitransparent gela
tinous mass of pure hydrated metastannic acid, insoluble both
in water and acids. There appears, then, to be no soluble form
of either hydrated stannic or metastannic acid, although both
are colloidal substances.
   Precipitated titanic acid was dissolved in hydrochloric acid and
                 jºid
submitted to dialysis. The hydrochloric acid readily diffused
away, leaving               titanic acid, gelatinous and insoluble,
upon the dialyser. The proportion of titanic acid which escaped
from the dialyser and was lost amounted to 0.050 gramme out
of 2.5 grammes. Titanic acid thus resembles stannic acid in
not presenting itself in the form of a fluid colloid.
   Metallic protoxides are not soluble in their neutral salts, and
therefore cannot be submitted to dialysis in the same conditions
as the preceding peroxides.        It was observed, however, that
oxide of copper and oxide of zinc, when dissolved in ammonia,
are capable of diffusing through a colloidal septum, and are
therefore not colloids themselves.        The water outside the dia
lyser should be charged with ammonia in such an experiment.

projections,” by G. B. Airy, Esq., Astronomer Royal, which
appeared  in the Philosophical Magazine for December 1861,
and in examining the numerical results given in the Tables in
which the relative advantages of the Projection by Balance of
Errors, by Equal Radial Degrees, by Unchanged Areas, and in
the Stereographic (attributed to Hipparchus), and my Projection
of two-thirds of the sphere, I was struck with the fact that the
numbers given as representing the Radial distances from the
centre of the Map, the Exaggeration of the projected areas, and
the Distortion of the form, did not show such advantages in
favour of the Projection by Balance of Errors as    was naturally                I
led to expect from the ingenious method employed by Mr. Airy
for obtaining them.
  I  therefore requested Captain Alexander R. Clarke, R.E., to go
through the mathematical process employed by Mr. Airy, and
examine the numerical results given in the Tables.        I subjoin
the result of Captain Clarke's examination; and it will be observed
that, from a mistake inadvertently made in one of the constants,
the projection by Balance of Errors has greater advantages than
 Mr. Airy has given it in his Tables.
   The fundamental equation of this very beautiful method of
development is readily obtained in the following manner.            Let

      THIS morning (March 21) noticed    extremely interesting                an
I    case    regelation.

        Prof. Challis on the Principles of Theoretical Physics.                                  813
 house was attached.         Air slightly warmed, acting on the glass
 surface from underneath, melted the snow in immediate contact
 with the glass, and the layer in consequence slid slowly down
 the glass roof. The inclination of the roof was very gentle, and
 the motion correspondingly gradual. When the layer overshot
 the edge of the roof it did not drop off, but bent like a flexible
 body, and hung down over the edge for several inches. The
 continuity of the layer was broken into rectangular spaces by the
 inclined longitudinal sashes of the roof, and from local circum
 stances one side of the roof was warmed a little more than the
 other; hence the subdivisions of the layer moved with different
 velocities, and overhung the edge to different depths.            The bent
 and   down-hanging      layer  of snow in some cases      actually   curled
 up inwards.
    Faraday has shown that when small fragments of ice float on
 water, if two of them touch each other they instantly cement
 themselves at the point of contact; and on causing a row of
fragments to touch, by laying hold of the terminal piece of the
 row you can draw           the others after it.
                               all                     similar cementingA

 the surface      the glass. But Faraday has also shown that, when
                     of
two fragments         ice are thus united,
                          of                   hinge-like motion sets

and the success with which new facts are elicited and new laws
established.    In consequence, perhaps, of the striking character
of these   achievements,     compared with the slow and uncertain
steps with which theoretical physics have of late advanced, the
idea seems to be gaining ground that theory may be dispensed
with, and that the domain of natural philosophy includes only
the discovery of facts and educing laws out of them. On this
point I beg to offer a few observations.
   Natural philosophy, as the history of               progressive steps           its
seems clearly       point out, consists
                        to                   two parts, related but

gravitation: Newton,          fact, did not use them for that purpose.

They were rather problems for solution, which Newton succeeded

for the transmission of light from one point of space to another.
And certainly this is a reasonable and a philosophical idea. For
letus consider what is the most general and patent fact in regard
to light that we have to account for. Some impulse, or action,
originates at a position in space, for instance, at a star unnum
bered millions of miles distant, and after a time is felt by a
 spectator on the earth's surface.   The rate of transmission, it
 has been ascertained, is  nearly two hundred thousand miles in
 one second.   By what means, it may be asked, has the impulse
 been transmitted from so distant a point at so rapid a rate 7 To
 say that small particles of matter are violently driven off from
 the star in           all
                directions, must     pronounced             clumsy

of taking it for granted in prosecuting further                                             researches, would
certainly be a great step in theoretical physics. The other class
of hypotheses do not admit of the same kind of verification,
because phenomena (such as are some of those of light) which
depend on the qualities of the constituents of bodies, require in
general for their direct theoretical explanation the knowledge
of the mutual action between the aether and the atoms, and the
number, magnitudes, and arrangements of the latter.                     But this
knowledge cannot be furnished in the present state of physical
science, and ought rather to be looked for as the final result of

tion was drawn to the experiments for the determination of the
velocity of sound made in the arctic regions under the superin
tendence of Captain Parry, by the reference made to them in
Mr. Earnshaw's paper “On the Theory of Sound,” in the
Transactions of the Royal Society (Part     1860, p. 139).  It is          º
stated that several times in the experiments made on February  9,
1822, the word of command to fire was heard after the report of
the gun; and though the same circumstance was not remarked
on other days, it is to be said that on that day the number                                                      of
experiments was greater than on any other, the distance was                                                     in

was still and barometer low.    Taking        circumstances into           all
account, the experiment seems     establish the fact        to

to the series.
   As necessary chemical works, we may suggest the following:—
1.   Ashort, simple, introductory book explaining the scope and lan
guage     chemistry, and describing fully the way
           of                                             performing                       of                     a

few easy and instructive experiments; such a book as every student
might go through previously to attending lectures or entering the
laboratory. It might also be used as the elementary school-book of
chemistry. 2. A text-book of the most important chemical facts
and theories. 3. A complete dictionary or work of reference. 4. A
set of manuals of analysis, qualitative and quantitative.           As to the
first of these works, we do not at present possess in the English
language a simple compact introduction to chemistry on the unitary
system; but Prof. Odling has undertaken to supply the second book of
the series; for the third we must wait; while the commencement of
a set of analytical manuals was made more than three years ago. For
in November 1858 an important original work was published, which
Prof. Odling by a strange oversight neglects to notice, although he
mentions in his preface a much smaller handbook which was after
wards issued, of no particular excellence, but owing any merit it
may possess to the German work of Prof. Will, on which it is based.
This adaptation by Mr. Conington attempts to embrace too much,
while it lacks the clearness and precision attained in the systematic
treatise of Messrs. Northcote and Church. The plan of the latter
volume seems to anticipate in some of                            its
                                                    details the subsequent
work      Prof. Odling.

  While the author feels no hesitation in calling hyposulphite of
sodium thiosulphate, a change which will be scarcely relished by
photographers, he has scruples about altering sulphamide into sulpho
diamide, saying (p. 228), “sulphamide ought analogically to be called
sulphodiamide, and sulphimide sulphamide; but the use of these two
words to signify the compounds expressed above is too general to
allow of their alteration.”  We confess that we have not heard or
seen much either of sulphamide or sulphimide; but our chemical ex
perience has been perhaps too limited. The free use, as an equiva
lent notation, of dashes attached to the symbols, is an important
feature of the work, and has already been employed with great ad
vantage by Prof. Kekulé in his Lehrbuch der Organischen Chemie.
 . The volume before us is characterized by a force and precision of
style, and by a happy originality of view, which it would require
long quotations properly to illustrate, and which render the work a
valuable contribution          to English chemical literature.

mula C, H, Cy,4-4 (AgO, NO.). The crystals are soluble in water
and alcohol, insoluble in ether. When heated, they melt and explode
like gunpowder.     They do not detonate on percussion. This com
pound may possibly throw some light on the constitution of the
fulminates.
  I  have also slightly modified the process I gave in my last note
for succinic          acid.    The   modified         process is very productive, and
yields the acid at once in a state of purity. From 1500 grains of
bromide of ethylene I obtained 480 grains of succinic acid, or nearly
33 per cent. }. gave on analysis 40-54 instead of 40.07 per cent. of
carbon.
   We are now enabled, thanks to the researches of Messrs. Perkim
and Duppa and of M. Kekulé”, to build up three highly complex
organic acids (succinic, paratartaric, and malic) from a simple hydro
carbon; and, what is more important,..we are enabled to do this by
processes every stage of which is perfectly intelligible.
   With the view of ascertaining whether or not the homologues of
succinic acid could be obtained in a similar manner, I have endea
voured to prepare pyrotartaric acid from the cyanide of propylene,
propylene being the radical of propylglycol.
   Preparation of Cyanide of Propylene.—A mixture of one equi
valent of bromide of propylene and two of cyanide of potassium, to
gether with a considerable quantity of alcohol, was exposed to the
temperature of a water-bath for about sixteen hours.       The alcohol
was then filtered and distilled. A liquid residue was thus obtained,
which was dissolved in ether. The body left on evaporating the
etherial solution was then submitted to distillation.      Almost the
entire liquid passed over between 265° and 290° Cent. The fraction
distilling between 277° and 290° Cent. was collected apart and ana
lysed. It gave 62-0 instead of 63.8 per cent. of carbon. This body
cannot be obtained purer by distillation under atmospheric pressure,
as it suffers partial decomposition during the process.
   The properties of this cyanide very much resemble those of the
 preceding.    It differs, however, in                its
                                          physical state, which    that                 is

                                               of              the                                             by

the enclosure which surrounds             that,          it,

theoretically from the law of exchanges, and the experimental evi.
dence upon which it rests, are both of a very simple nature, it has
been thought well to restate them

                                      here before proceeding further in
this investigation.
   Let us imagine to ourselves an enclosure of lamp-black kept at a
constant temperature, and containing two pieces of polished rock
salt similar to one another, except that the thickness of the one is
greater than that of the other.
   Now it is evident that since the thick piece absorbs more of the
heat which falls upon it from the sides of the enclosure than the thin
piece, it must likewise radiate more in order that it may always re
main at the same temperature.         Here then we have the fact of in
termal radiation in the case of rock-salt deduced as a theoretical conse
quence of the law of exchanges; experimentally it is found that a thick
piece of rock-salt radiates very considerably more than a thin piece.
   The fact of internal radiation being conceded, it is easy to see
that the amount of heat which a particle radiates must be indepen.
dent of its distance from the surface. For besides that this is the
simplest hypothesis, the absorption, and consequently the radiation
of two similar plates of rock-salt placed with their surfaces together,
ought to be the same as from a single plate of double the thickness;
and experiment shows that this is the case.
   It being therefore supposed that the internal radiation of a particle

                                            of this is obvious in problems
                                           optical principles. But we may
go even further. For we know that in tourmaline, and in some other
crystals cut parallel to the optic axis, the ordinary ray is more ab
sorbed than the extraordinary; and the experiments of Prof. Kirch
hoff and the author have shown that in tourmaline the ordinary ray
is also radiated in excess. It thus appears that, in the case of crystals,
we have not only a separate equilibrium for each wave-length, but
for each of the two rays into which the incident ray is divided.
    The following method of comparing together two streams of radiant
heat has been adopted:—Consider a square unit of surface to be
placed in the midst of a solid of indefinite thickness on           sides, and                     all
find the amount                 of
                       radiant heat which      passes across this square   unit

evident that the expression for the internal radiation         any direction                  in
may      beobtained              by
                         operating upon terminal surfaces bearing every

clearly independent                   of

ultimately disappear from the expression for the internal radiation.
   The author then endeavours          show that such       adaptation does
                                                           to                            an

dependent of the position of the surface.
   For the extraordinary ray, the internal radiation is found to be
                                                       Rr"

ellipsoid into which the extraordinary ray will have spread in the
crystal in the same time that in vacuo it would have spread into a
sphere whose radius = unity; and lastly, r denotes the radius of this
ellipsoid in the direction in which the internal radiation is measured.
    The author concludes by remarking that the fundamental law,
which is intimately connected with the theory of exchanges, and
which renders an equilibrium of temperature possible in the case
under consideration, seems to be the law of the equality between
action and reaction in the impact of elastic bodies.
     He also considers that the law which is      expressed by saying
“That   the absorption of a particle is equal to    radiation, and that        its
for every description    heat,” expresses another law
                                     of                      action and                        of
reaction which holds when the motion which constitutes radiant heat
is not conveyed from particle       particle without loss,
                                                  to          when the                          or
bodies under consideration are not perfectly elastic.
     These two laws             of
                                action and reaction are viewed    supplement               as

further collections of Shells from the gravel-pits at Biddenham and
Harrowden, has determined seventeen other species besides those no
ticed by Mr. Prestwich, and among these is Hydrobia marginata (from
the Biddenham pit), which has not been found alive in this country.
At Kempston, Mr. Wyatt has examined the sand beneath the gravel
(which is destitute of shells), and at 3 feet in the sand (19 feet from
the surface) he found Helia, Succinea, Bithynia, Pupa, Planorbis, &c.
with a flint implement. The upper gravel contained several flint flakes.

   In a ravine at the village of Wookey-Hole, on the southern flanks
of the Mendips, and two miles N.W. of Wells, the River Axe flows
out of the Wookey-Hole Cave by a canal cut in the rock. In cutting
this passage, ten years ago, a cave, filled with ossiferous loam, was
exposed and about 12 feet of                           its
                                         entrance cut away.           1859                              In

Tchihatcheff.
     M. Tchihatcheff's observations were made at Torre del Greco and
Naples from December 8th to 25th. Near Torre del Greco several
 small craters (9–12) have been formed close to each other in an
E.N.E.-W.S.W.         line, at a distance of about 600 metres E.S.E. of the
 crater of 1794, and either on a prolongation of the old fissure or on
one parallel.      The phenomena mentioned by Signor Palmieri were
 also described by M. Tchihatcheff in detail.
     3. “On Isodiametric Lines as means of representing the Dis
 tribution of Sedimentary (clay and sandy, Strata) as distinguished
 from Calcareous Strata, with especial reference to the Carboniferous
 Rocks of Britain.”       By E. Hull, Esq., B.A., F.G.S.
     The author, in the first place, made a comparison of argillaceo
 arenaceous with calcareous deposits, as to their distribution, both in
 modern and in ancient seas, and stated that he objected to calcareous
 strata being regarded as sediments, in the strict sense of the word.
 After noticing the distribution of sediments in the Caribbean Sea, he
 referred to the relative distribution of limestones as compared with
 shales and sandstones in the Oolitic formations (comparing those of
 Yorkshire with those of Oxfordshire), in the Permian strata of Eng
 land, and in the Lower Carboniferous strata of Belgium and West
 phalia. After some observations on the nature of calcareous deposits,
 and on the contemporaneity of certain groups of deposits, dependent
 on the oscillatory movements of land and sea, the author described
 his plan of showing on maps the relative thicknesses of the two classes
 of strata under notice, by means of isodiametric or isometric lines.
     Mr. Hull then proceeded to indicate the application of the isodia
 metric system of lines to the Carboniferous strata of the midland
 counties and north of England; showing that there is a south-east
 erly attenuation of the argillo-arenaceous strata, and a north-westerly
 attenuation of the calcareous strata. The existence, in the Carbo
  niferous Period, of a barrier of land crossing the British area, imme
  diately to the north of lat. 52°, was insisted upon; and, although
  this barrier was probably broken through (in South Warwickshire)
  in the latter portion of that period, yet it divided, in the author's
  opinion, the coal-area into a north and a south portion, the latter
  having a very different set of directions in the attenuation of its
  strata—the shales and sandstones thinning out eastward, the lime
  stones in the contrary direction.
     In conclusion, the author stated that, in his opinion, the source of
  the Carboniferous sediments was in the ancient North Atlantic Con
  tinent, for the existence of which Lyell, Godwin-Austen, and others
  have argued; and he inferred that the shores of this Atlantis, com
  posed principally of granitoid or metamorphic rocks, were washed on
  the west side by a current running S.W., which drifted the sediment
   in that direction, and on the other by      a current running S.E., which
   carried sediment over the submerged British area.

   WHE very close correspondence between the theoretical ratedf cool
     ing in ascending, and the actual, indicates a rapid transmission
of the atmosphere from above to below, and vice versd, continually
going on. We may believe that during thunder-storms this inter
change goes on with much greater than ordinary rapidity. At a
considerable distance from the thunder-cloud,                                     where the atmosphere
is free from cloud, the air descends, acquiring temperature according
to the law of convective equilibrium in dry air.         The air then tra
verses the ground towards the region where the storm is raging,
acquiring moisture as it proceeds, but probably without much dimi
nution of temperature, on account of the heated ground making up
for the cold of evaporation.       Arrived under the thunder-cloud, the
air  rises, losing temperature,   but at a diminished rate, owing to the
condensation of its    vapour    to form part of the immense cumulus
cloud which overcasts the sky on these occasions. The upward
current of air carries the cloud and incipient rain-drops upwards, but
presently, in consequence of the increased capacity of the mass from
the presence of a large quantity of water, the refrigeration of the air
in consequence of                its

falls might thus be constantly increased until the balance between
it and the inductively electrified earth is restored by a flash of light
ning. If the hail is negatively electrified by the dry air with which
it comes in contact, the latter will float off charged with positive
electricity, which may account for the normal positive condition of
the atmosphere in serene weather, as well as the electrification of
the upper strata evidenced by the aurora borealis.      The friction of
wind has been supposed by Herschel to contribute to the intense
electrification of the cloud which overhangs volcanoes during erup

        ONTHE INFLUENCE OF HEAT ON PHOSPHORESCENCE.
                            BY M. O. FIEBIG.
  The author has investigated the deportment of several phosphor
escent bodies in reference to heat—whether phosphorescence could be
developed by heat alone, without the substance having been previously
submitted to the action of light. The sulphides of calcium, of barium,
and of strontium were prepared by the method of M. Becquerel, and
their phosphorescence confirmed. These substances, observed in
darkness, ceased to be luminous at the expiration of a certain time,
and were then subjected to the calorific action of a plate heated some
thing below redness. Phosphorescence reappeared, but after a second
disappearance it could not be reproduced by the same method.                 A
fresh exposure of the substance to light rendered the substance again
phosphorescent.
    An analogous experiment was made with a fragment of green
fluoride of calcium.       According to M. Becquerel, this substance
becomes phosphorescent under the action of heat until it has lost
colour; but in this condition it has lost the property.               A strong
elevation of temperature developed at first an intense violet light in
the fluoride of calcium; after having been cooled it was again heated,
but to a less extent than at first; the fragment remained quite
dark, although it had retained                   its
                                        colour, which was seen           expo         by

decrepitation commenced; phosphorescence again appeared, and
when viewed           by
                      daylight       had lost
                                           it       colour.     its
                                                                Nevertheless,
heated afresh     again   became luminous.       These     experiments    show
that fluoride     of it
                   calcium possesses the property            becoming phos  of
 phorescent under the action                of
                                     heat after    previous insolation, and

      GENTLEMEN,
   I am indebted to Professor Clausius of Zürich for having pointed
out an oversight in some tables of coefficients of resistance to the
conduction of heat which appeared some time ago in a work of
mine “On the Steam-engine and other Prime Movers.'            Those
coefficients were computed   from data  given  by M.  Peclet; but in
the computation the difference of the French and British units of
weight (the kilogramme and the pound) was neglected. I now beg
leave to send you the annexed Tables of the corrected values of those
coefficients.   Their meaning will be best understood by the aid of
the following formula.
   Conceive two media, whose temperatures, in degrees of Fahren
heit, are respectively T" (the higher), and T (the lower), to be sepa
rated from each other by a layer of any given substance, whose
thickness, in inches, is denoted by                  ar.

found by operating on temperatures so high, and under pres

it is   subjected.       These limit densities obtain with                       gases,                        all

 one which he proposes          to substitute for it; but as his funda

   fact that the action of the element of a current on a magnet de

apprehension that the moment which arises is of a higher order
of small quantities than those included in the rest of the inves
tigation, whereas it is of the same order. Accordingly another
term, with 8 for its coefficient, and therefore of the second order,
needs to be added to the general equation numbered (5) in
my paper. This term is easily calculated: but, without being at
the pains of going through the work, it is easy to see that it will
behave exactly as the other small terms which have been included.
In fact the new term arises from the difference of the action of the
current on the two poles of the needle; and as this difference
would gradually decrease to nil if the centre of the needle
were moved from the position it occupies in Gaugain's galvano
meter into the position it has in the ordinary galvanometer, it is
plain à priori that the most considerable term of the series ex
pressing the moment (which is of the second order of small
quantities) vanishes as the needle approaches the latter posi
tion.
   Hence no term of the second order needs to be added to for
mula (6), which has reference to the common galvanometer; but
a new term of that order should be added to formula (7), which
relates to Gaugain’s instrument,          thus leaving the conclusion at
which     I
          arrived   undisturbed,    that,  “though in Gaugain’s galva

the length of the needle, it is necessary to attend carefully to

                uncertainty still prevails regarding the true compo
              UCH
          sition of Lievrite or Ilvaite.   The earlier analyses of this
mineral, those of Wauquelin and Collet-Descotils, made the sub
stance essentially a silicate of sesquioxide of iron and lime.
Stromeyer's analysis, which followed those of the above-named
chemists, gave the iron, on the other hand, as protoxide.            A
subsequent examination by Von Kobell disclosed the presence of
both oxides, as fully established by the later analyses of Ram
melsberg and others. These analyses, the correctness of which
it is impossible to doubt, do not lead, however, to any general
formula; nor can any formula of a satisfactory character, in a
mineralogical point of view, be obtained from them.          It will be
as well to    quote their results before proceeding  with our inquiry.

serve to connect our mineral with other species of kindred cha

                                                     in

  850          Prof. Chapman on the Position of Lievrite
 prism-angle, 71° 10'); 1.684 (= V 4; prism-angle, 61°47').
 In Lievrite, the two commonly occurring prisms give respect
 ively 0-6840 (=V; prism-angle, 111° 12) and 1370(= V2 :
 prism-angle, 72°16'). To make these correspond with the chry
 solite values, the first prism must bear the symbol V3, and the
 second W 3.     The vertical axes stand to each other very nearly
 in the ratio of 5 to 4. But we need not attempt to push these
 analogies beyond their legitimate limits.     The affinity in general
 characters and conditions of occurrence of Lievrite to Fayalite
 (and through this latter to chrysolite) cannot be overlooked if we
take the entire relations of these substances into consideration.
 Single characters, in the determination of analogies, are neces
 sarily useless.
    Now the atomic constitution of the chrysolites is perfectly well
established. The oxygen atoms in base and acid are equal, and
the base consists of simple oxides only, the general formula being
2(RO), SiO4; or two atoms of monoxidized base + one atom of
silica. In the normal chrysolites the base consists of magnesia;
in the olivines, of magnesia and protoxide of iron; and in Faya
lite (at least, essentially) of the latter oxide alone. In Lievrite,
on the other hand, as shown above, both protoxide and sesqui
oxide of iron are present; and the oxygen-atoms of the silica do
not correspond with those of the bases.
    In  attempting to reconcile these discrepancies,       I called to
recollection a fact that came under my notice some time ago.        In
examining a specimen of Lievrite that had been broken up into
small pieces,    I  found that certain fragments exerted a much
more powerful influence on the magnet than others. Whilst
some of the particles scarcely showed a trace of magnetism,
others were magnetic in a marked degree.         These latter, tested
by the blowpipe, seemed almost free from silica; whilst the
feebly-magnetic fragments gave very readily, with microcosmic
salt, the well-known reaction of that substance.       It occurred to
me, therefore, that the analysed specimens of Lievrite might
have contained a certain portion of magnetic iron ore,           a cir
cumstance easily      conceivable,  if we call to mind the      geolo
gical associations of our mineral.      The nearly uniform propor
tions of the Fe0 and Fe’ O’ found in the various analyses seemed,
it is true, opposed to this idea; but it appeared at least possible
that the crystallized specimens might be able to take up a certain
proportion, and no more, of the magnetic oxide.           I calculated
therefore, from the first four analyses given above, the mean
composition of Lievrite, and reduced this, with the following
results, to 100 parts:—

                             in the Mineral Series.                             351

            Protoxide of manganese.                      1:35 =     1.46

   Now 23:25 parts of Fe? 0° require 10:46 parts of Fe0 to form
magnetic iron ore (= Fe0, Fe2O"). This, deducted from 31:49,
leaves 21:03 for the protoxide of iron present (on the above sup
position) in the silicate. The analysis consequently stands as
below:—
            Silica    .     .     .     .    .    .     29.66  = 44.75
            Protoxide of iron . . .                     21:03  = 31-72
            Protoxide of manganese.                      1:46 =     220

   Calculating the oxygen-ratios of the above, we obtain—
          SiO2 .    .     .    .     .     .    .    .   23:24=1}=7=14

          CaO .     •     *     *
   Here,then, we have 8 atoms of RO to 14 atoms of SiO2, in place
of 2 to 1, as required by the chrysolite formula.                   If the oxygen
ratios in  any  of the above           analyses        had come out as 9:6:14,
we  might   have written the formula
                   7(RO, SiO2)+2(Fe0, Fe2O3);
but the analyses do not yield these values.                    The view, therefore,
as suggested above, that the peculiar composition of Lievrite
may arise from the presence of magnetic iron ore, cannot be
sustained.
   But the formula of Lievrite may be brought to coincide with
that of the chrysolite series by assuming the iron to have been
originally present in the condition of Fe0 only.                         If this be
assumed—and the         assumption           is in    part  warranted  by  the well
known fact that Lievrite is especially subject to alteration, the
conversion of the Fe0 into Fe‘O’ still going on in many speci
mens—the difficulty is at once removed.                         Taking the mean
composition as given above, and calculating the weight of Fe0
corresponding to the 23:25 per cent. of Fe2O3, we obtain 20-92.
Adding this to the Fe0, and correcting the whole to 100
parts, the analysis reads as follows:–

   Although these values do not come out exactly equal, the
lead evidently to the common chrysolite formula 2GRO), SiO’.
If we  adopt, consequently, the assumption on which the above
calculation is based, the Lievrite falls naturally into the minera
logical group to which it undoubtedly belongs; whereas on the
other view, founded on the bare results of analysis, not only
does the atomic constitution of the mineral remain uncertain,
but   its
        composition fails     harmonize withto    physical characters          its

                assume that the causes        and    are absolutelyA         B                           in

                                          each other; viz. not only the
 probability         acting, but also the probability
                               A                                 acting                 of   its
 efficiently, are each                  of
                           them the same whether       does not act,          B                           or
 acts inefficiently,     acts efficiently; and the like for

    2ndly.      I        do
                  assume that the same experience which establishes
                                    Prob.         A=    a,    Prob.    B=8,

     3rdly.      I assume        not only
                Prob. A=a,                 Prob.         B=8,          Prob.     AB=28,
but also as 1st above stated; and I consider that, inasmuch as
the result of the investigation is to show that the conditions
q—ap+ 0, p-AEq+ 0 are necessary and sufficient conditions, it
is also a result of the investigation that these are the conditions
of consistency among the data, viz. the conditions in order that
the data may be consistent with the above assumptions as to the
independence of the causes.     It is clear that since, as just stated,
I  do assume something beyond the last-mentioned three equa
tions, the conditions of consistency ought to be narrower than
those in Prof. Boole's 3rdly.
   4thly.        I
             had not overlooked, but ought to have stated, that    I
Prof. Boole's conditions were actually the conditions of consist
ency in the data.
   5thly.        I
               contend that the conception of A and B as causes
does alter the nature of the problem.              For when A and B are
conceived of as causes, there is a definite notion of the efficient
or inefficient action of A or B; and in particular when they both
act, one of them, say A, may act inefficiently.           But according to
the concomitance       statement,   then either there is no such notion
as that of the efficient or non-efficient happening of A or B (I
believe this to be so), or else the only notion of efficient or ineffi
cient happening is happening in concomitance or in non-conco
mitance with E; but in this view, if A, B, E               happen, then          all                          A
                          happens   efficiently.        argument

quantities in my method of solution is possible; because they
are not of the nature of additional data, and their introduction
does not limit the problem as any hypotheses which are of that
nature do.         I
                do not see any difficulty whatever in the concep
tion of the ideal problem.”
  We thus join issue as follows: Prof. Boole says that there is
no difficulty in understanding, I say that I do not understand,
the rationale of his solution.
  It may   be remarked that the question may be, not to find any
actual probability whatever, but only to find a Boolian probability
or probabilities. Thus the equations (L), p. 356, omitting the
last member, which alone involves u, determine in terms of the
data a, 3, ap, 34 the Boolian probabilities w, y, s, t of the events
A, B, AE, BE.
  In a subsequent    hastily-written letter, Prof. Boole gives an
explanation of the equations (L), which appears to me little more
than a translation of these equations into ordinary language.

LII. Remarks on Ampère's Erperiment on the Repulsion of a
  Rectilinear Electrical Current on itself. By Mr. JAMEs CRoll.
   To the Editors      of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
     GENTLEMEN,
IN van
    the Philosophical Magazine for February last, Professor
       Breda of Haarlem describes an experiment wherein, in
                                +
order to show that the movement of the conductor in the experi
ment of Ampère is not due to the influence of angular currents,
he suspends the conductor above the mercury, and allows the
currents in the latter to pass underneath. A current which was
found to be more than sufficient to move the conductor when
floating upon the mercury, according to Ampère's experiment,
was made to pass through the apparatus; but not the least motion
in the suspended conductor could be observed, and he therefore
concludes that the motion of the conductor in the experiment of
Ampère cannot be due to the influence of angular currents.
   It   is remarkable how Prof. van Breda did not observe that a
motion of translation in the case of his suspended conductor was
absolutely impossible; for he allows his conductor to cross the
currents in the mercury; and the consequence, of course,           is,
                                                                 the

366     Mr.       J. Croll           on Ampère's Experiment on the Repulsion
parts, and repel the horizontal part D.D.                 Prof. van Breda             If
 were to cut his conductor asunder at the points where they                                                        in
tersect the currents in the mercury, and by some contrivance or
other still allow the current to pass, he would find that the hori
zontal part would be instantly repelled, and the perpendicular
parts instantly attracted; but when the whole is in one rigid
piece, as in his apparatus, no motion can possibly take place.
   Granting that the conductor is moved by the repulsion of the
current on itself, still it certainly must be admitted that Am
père's experiment cannot prove the fact; for if we admit, in
regard to his experiment, that the same motion under exactly
the same conditions ought to take place from the influence of
angular currents, then, when the motion does take place, we have
no warrant to conclude that it is not due to angular currents,
but to some other cause. The inference is the same whether
the conductor be composed of solid copper or of fluid mercury;
for the motion does not depend upon the nature of the conductor,
but simply upon        position    its relation    the impelling current.

periment are entirely changed; for then Ampèrian repulsion
and angular currents act               direct opposition       each other,                     to

I    do not see how          follows,    it                  as
                                            Prof. van Breda and others
seem   to suppose, that, because two currents              possible angles          at   all
affect each   other,  they    must                          do
                                          the same when they are both
on  the same   straight   line;    because    they act only      right lines
                                                                  if                                in
from their sides,                  no
                        effect can possibly take place when they are
both    onthe same   straight    line.                           In
                                             this case curved line would              a

question     at   issue;                 for
                            does not follow that, because the mole

              of a Rectilinear Electrical Current   on itself.         367
The fact that a current is passing along a chain of molecules is
a proof that these molecules are not statically in the same condi
tion. This fact has been proved experimentally by Kohlrausch,
in his investigations into the laws of Ohm. The differences in
their statical condition are the immediate cause of the current;
for the current is simply the discharge of the electricities of the
contiguous molecules upon each other, so as to bring them under
the same conditions. What, then, are the mutual tendencies of
molecules thus differently charged ? Is it to approach or to re
cede from each other?     Prof. van Breda and others reply, facts
show that they do recede from each other. Be it so; still we
must allow that the electricities with which the separate mole
cules are charged do not recede.       If the molecules themselves
recede, the electricities approach; for it is the tendency of the
electricities on the contiguous molecules to combine which pro
duces the current.     The contiguous sections of the current must
therefore attract, not repel each other. It may be difficult to
conceive how a mutual attraction of the contiguous sections of
the current should result in a mutual repulsion in the contiguous
molecules of the conductor carrying the current; but if such
be the fact, this is enough.
   The difficulty will, however, in a great measure disappear
when we reflect that the molecules offer resistance to the trans
ference which constitutes the current, the amount of the resist
ance depending upon the nature of the molecules, the conduc
tibility of bodies for electricity being inversely as the amount of
resistance offered by their molecules.       Now if the current is
produced by a tendency in the electricities on the contiguous
molecules to combine, then it is quite natural to suppose that
the molecules themselves would recede from each other in order
to prevent combination. Their very endeavours to resist the
transference of their electricities would cause them to recede
from each other.     If we suppose that the molecules are not
simply passive, but active in their resistance (and we have every
reason to believe that they are), then recession from each other,
when the current is passing, is what might be anticipated.
   The same conclusion will follow should we suppose that the
passing of the current tends to produce a disturbance in the equi
                                                         by its
librium of the molecules; for each molecule, in      endeavour           to
avoid disturbance     in    its
                         statical condition caused      the presence
        its
      neighbour, will recede from     it.   In               implied
in of
                                           fact recession         is
   the very idea     of
                   molecular resistance.

              5.       Dialysis    of Organic Colloid    Substances.
     ANNIN.—The tannin       employed was that extracted from gall
     nuts by the ether process of Pelouze. A two per cent. solution
of this substance, covering a surface of paper-parchment of the
area of about Tºoth of a square metre, or 15.6 square inches, to
a depth of 10 millimetres, was diffused at 10° to 13° of tempera
ture. The diffused matter amounted, in successive periods of
twenty-four hours, to 073, '040, 021, '021, '024 and 024
 gramme, derived from the two grammes in solution.             Probably
the earlier diffusates were increased by the presence of a little
gallic acid, which, being a crystalloid, would no doubt be rapidly
eliminated by diffusion. The latter observations indicate that
tannin passes through a paper-parchment septum about 200 times
less rapidly than chloride of sodium does, in similar circumstances
 as to temperature and strength of solution.        The diffusates from
the tannin solution gave a precipitate with gelatine, and therefore
contained tannin unaltered.           But the diffusates probably con
tained also throughout some products of decomposition of a
crystalloid character.                 -
                diffusibility   of tannin may be ascribed the remark
                                       º
    To the low
ably slow penetration of skins by that substance in the ordinary
 operation of tanning leather. Tannin appears to form compounds
of much stability with certain other colloids, as tanno-gelatine,
and the compound with albumen which appears to be the primary
basis of the vegetable cell (Frémy).
    Gum.—The diffusate                   from a solution containing 2
grammes of gum-arabic, in experiments corresponding in their
conditions with the experiments upon tannin just related, was
'013 gramme per day. The power of gum to penetrate the
colloid septum appears, therefore, to be one-half less than that
of tannin, and 400 times less than the diffusibility of chloride of
sodium. Gum gave the same amount of diffusate with a mucus
septum as with parchment-paper.              When substances of the
crystalloid class are mixed with the gum, the diffusion of the
latter appears to be still further reduced, and may even be
entirely extinguished. The separation of colloids from crystal
loids by dialysis          is, consequence, generally more complete
                                 in
than   might      be
                 expected     from the relative diffusibility   the twoof
classes   of substances.

   Mr. T. Graham      on Liquid Diffusion applied to Analysis.          369
known, precipitates lime from the gum very imperfectly. Hydro
chloric acid may be used to separate that base from a solution of
gum    placed upon the dialyser, with more effect.               It is only
necessary to add to a strong solution of gum 4 or 5 per cent. of
hydrochloric acid, and to dialyse till the gum solution gives no
precipitate with mitrate of silver. In an experiment made upon
a 20 per cent. solution of gum, the ash was reduced to 0.1 per
cent. of the gum in five days. The gummic acid possesses a
sensible acid reaction, about equal to that of carbonic acid. This
acid reaction was neutralized in 100 parts of gummic acid by 2.85
parts of potash.     This amount of potash is very nearly equiva
lent to the lime originally present in the gum (1:72 lime, or 3.07
carbonate of lime, being equivalent to 2.89 potash). When the
gummate of potash itself was dialysed without addition, the pot
ash gradually diffused away, possibly in the state of carbonate,
and left the gum again possessed of an acid reaction.              Gummic
acid, well dried at 100°, becomes insoluble in water, but swells
up in that liquid, like gum-tragacanth.         We appear to have here
the  pectous  form of  gummic    acid.
   It is worthy of inquiry whether such native gums as are               in
soluble in water are not the pectous form of soluble gum, rather
than allotropic varieties of that substance.         So also of the meta
gummic acid of Frémy, formed by the action of strong sulphuric
acid on mucilage. This last substance is insoluble in water, but
was found by Frémy to afford, when neutralized by lime and
alkalics, a soluble gum undistinguishable from gum-arabic.
   Gummic acid produces a remarkable compound with gelatine.
When solutions of these two colloids are mixed, oily drops fall
and form a nearly colourless jelly on standing. This jelly is
very fusible, melting at 25°, or by the heat of the hand. The
gummate of gelatine may be washed without decomposition, but
is soluble to a certain extent in pure water, and still more so in
a solution of gelatine. Prepared with gummic acid in excess,
the compound, when dried at 100°, consisted of 100 parts gummic
acid with 59 gelatine. The drops and the jelly contained 83.5
per cent. of water.     Solution of gelatine is not precipitated by
unpurified gum, nor by the gummate of potash.
   Dextrine—A two per cent. solution of dextrine, prepared from
starch, was diffused in the same conditions as the preceding sub
stances, but through a mucus septum.             It gave in twenty-four
hours 034     gramme   of diffusate  from  2  grammes,       or about three
times more diffusate than was      given  by  gum-arabic.
   Caramel.—The dialytic examination of this substance adds to
the accurate information on the subject lately supplied by M. A.
Gélisl, and places caramel indisputably in the colloid class.

The crude caramel obtained by heating cane-sugar at 210°–
220°, when placed on the dialyser, allows certain intermediate
coloured substances (Caramelane and Caramelene of Gélis) to
diffuse out with considerable facility, while the compound con
taining the largest proportion of carbon remains behind.     The
latter substance, as obtained by me, possessed five times the
colouring-power of the original crude caramel, weight for weight.
This highest soluble member of the caramel series may also be
obtained, more quickly, by precipitation from    aqueous solution                   its

     Mr. T. Graham       on      Liquid Diffusion applied to Analysis.                  871
is dialysed, the potash is quickly reduced to the proportion of
about 9 per cent, which forms a neutral compound.       If an excess
of acetic acid now be    added,  the whole  potash is soon diffused
away, and pure soluble caramel remains on the dialyser.        Even
carbonic acid will  carry away  the  potash.
   The extremely low diffusibility which has been assigned to
caramel in former Tables, belongs to that substance as last
described,—the brown intermediate substances which accompany
it in crude caramel being considerably more diffusive, although
they, again, are much less diffusive than any variety of crystalli
zable or uncrystallizable sugar.    When the molasses of the cane
sugar are diffused, much the greater portion of the colouring
matters remains in the dialyser.
   With the parchment-paper septum the fluid caramel appeared
even less dialysable than gum, the diffusate in twenty-four hours
from a 2 per cent. solution of the former being 009 gramme
only, while that of the latter was 013.    Caramel may be stated,
approximately, to be 600 times less dialysable than chloride of
sodium, and 200 times less so than sugar. Hence liquids
coloured with caramel, such as porter and coffee, may be dialysed
for a day with the passage of very little colouring-matter.
   Before leaving caramel, the analogy may be referred to which
the insoluble form of that substance presents to coal. Carame
lization appears the first step in that direction—the beginning
of a colloidal transformation to be consummated in the slow lapse
of geological ages.
   Albumen.—The purification of albumen is effected with much
advantage upon the dialyser. The solution of egg-albumen is
mixed freely with acetic acid and then dialysed. The earthy
and alkaline salts are speedily got rid      and     of,

about four times greater than the volume of organic fluid in the
dialyser.     The water of the basin is generally found to remain
colourless after the lapse of twenty-four hours; and after being
concentrated by evaporation, it admits of the application of the
proper reagents to precipitate and remove a metal from solution.
One-half to three-fourths of the crystalloidal and diffusible con
stituents of the organic fluid will generally be found in the water
of the basin.

have been   slightly retarded by the fixing of the gelatinous solu
tion.    This is probably due to the arrest of mechanical move
ment within the gelatinous stratum, and not to any sensible
impediment offered by the jelly to diffusion.
   In another experiment, similar to the last, but continued for
four days instead of twenty-four hours, the tersulphide of arsenic
weighed 0-320 gramme, equivalent to 0.257 arsenious acid.
   5. A quantity of white of egg, amounting to 50 grammes, to
which 0-01 gramme of arsenious acid in solution had been added,
was coagulated by heat.    The solid mass was then cut up into
small pieces and placed on the dialyser, mixed with 50 grammes
of water; after the usual period of twenty-four hours, the dif
fusate gave 0.01 gramme of tersulphide of arsenic, equivalent to
0.008 gramme arsenious acid.     Here, of the mass upon the dia
lyser, the arsenious acid formed only                   Timºth         part; yet four
fifths of it are recovered.
   6. One hundred grammes of milk, charged with Tºmth
part of arsenious acid (0.01 gramme), and forming a stratum on
the dialyser of 10 millimetres, gave a diffusate which yielded
0-010 tersulphide of arsenic, equivalent to 0:008 gramme of
arsenious acid. The outer liquid was colourless, and gave no
indication of caseine, but it contained, of course, the saltsw and the
sugar of the milk.
   7. The same experiment was repeated with sized writing
paper as the septum, applied to the same bulb. The result
was a slight increase in the quantity of arsenious acid recovered.
   It appears, then, that arsenious acid separates on the dialyser
from gum, from gelatine, albumen, fluid or coagulated, and from
caseine, and is obtained in a solution        for the application
                                                            fit                       of

  Mr. T. Graham            on   Liquid Diffusion applied to Analysis.     375
water, about 32° C., for twenty-four hours. The whole was
then thrown upon a dialyser for an equal time. Arsenious acid
diffused out so free from colloidal matter that the action of
reagents was not interfered with.     A high temperature in di
gesting the intestines is quite unnecessary, and appeared indeed
to increase the difficulty of diffusing out the arsenious acid
afterwards.
   The tartrate of potash and antimony, mixed in the small pro
portion of mºnth, with defibrinated blood and with milk,
was separated by dialysis quite as effectually as the arsenious
acid above.
   Strychnine also was separated from organic fluids in the same
manner, a small addition of hydrochloric acid being first made to
the fluid on the dialyser.
   Dialysis, then, appears of general application in the preparation
of a liquid for examination by chemical tests, whether the poison
looked for be mineral or organic. All soluble poisonous sub
stances, whatever their origin, appear to be crystalloids, and
accordingly pass through colloidal septa.
                   7. Colloidal Condition of Matter.
   I  may be allowed to advert again to the radical distinction
assumed in this paper to exist between colloids and crystalloids
in their intimate molecular constitution.            Every physical and
chemical property is characteristically modified in each class.
They appear like different worlds of matter, and give occasion to
a corresponding division of chemical science.             The distinction
between these kinds of matter is that subsisting between the
 material of a mineral and the material of an organized mass.
    The colloidal character is not obliterated by liquefaction, and
 is therefore more than a modification of the physical condition
of solid. Some colloids are soluble in water, as gelatine and
 gum-arabic;      and some are insoluble, like gum-tragacanth.
 Some colloids, again, form solid compounds with water, as gela
 tine and gum-tragacanth, while others, like tannin, do not. In
 such points the colloids exhibit as great a diversity of property
 as the crystalloids.      A certain parallelism is maintained between
 the two   classes,  notwithstanding    their differences.
    The phenomena of the solution of a salt or crystalloid pro
 bably  all  appear      the solution

Gummic acid, for instance, may be represented by C*Hi! Oil:
but, judging from the small proportions of lime and potash
which suffice to neutralize this acid, the true numbers of its
formula must be several times greater. It is difficult to avoid
associating the inertness of colloids with their high equivalents,
particularly where the high number appears to be attained by
the repetition of a smaller number. The inquiry suggests itself
whether the colloid molecule may not be constituted by the
grouping together of a number of smaller crystalloid molecules,
and whether the basis of colloidality may not really be this
composite character of the molecule.
     With silicic acid, which can exist in combination both as a
crystalloid and colloid, we have two series of compounds, silicates
and cosilicates, the acid of the latter appearing to have an equi
valent much greater (thirty-six times greater in one salt) than
the acid of the former. The apparently small proportion of acid
in a variety of metallic salts, such as certain red salts of iron, is
 accounted for by the high colloidal equivalent of their bases.
 The effect of such an insoluble colloid as prussian blue in carry
 ing down small proportions of the precipitating salts, may admit
 of a similar explanation.
     Gelatine appears to hold an important place as a colloidal base.
 This base unites with colloidal acids, giving a class of stable
 compounds, of which tanno-gelatine only appears to be hitherto
 known.      Gelatine is precipitated entirely by a solution of meta
 phosphoric acid added drop by drop, 100 parts of gelatine
 uniting with 3-6 parts of the acid. The compound formed is a
 semitransparent, soft, elastic, and stringy solid mass, presenting
 a startling resemblance to animal fibrine.           It will be an interest
  ing inquiry whether metaphosphoric acid is a colloid, and enters
 into the compound described in that character, or is a crystal
  loid, as the small proportion and low equivalent of the acid
  would suggest.       Gelatine is also precipitated by carbolic acid.

hydrates. The water in alcohol of greater strength than corre
sponds with the density 0-926, which represents the definite
hydrate C*H* 0°4-6HO, is certainly in a state of chemical
union.    But alcohol so high as 0.906, contained in a close
vessel, is concentrated in a notable degree by contact with dry
mucus, gelatine, and gum, and sensibly even by dry parchment
paper.     Dilute alcohol divided from the air of the atmosphere
by a dry septum of mucus, gelatine, or gum, is also concentrated
by evaporation, as in the well-known bladder experiment of
Sömmering.       The selective power is here apparent of the
colloid for water, that fluid being separated from alcohol, and
travelling through the colloidal septum by combination with
successive molecules of the latter, till the outer surface is
reached and evaporation takes place.       The penetration in this
manner of a colloid    by a foreign substance may be taken as an
illustration of the  phenomena   of cementation. Iron and other
substances which soften under heat, may be supposed to assume
at the same time a colloidal constitution.   So it may be supposed
does silica when fused into a glass by heat, and every other
vitreous substance.
    Gelatinous hydrates always exhibit a certain tendency to
aggregation, as is seen in the jelly of hydrated silicic acid and
of alumina.     With some the jelly is also adhesive, as in glue
and    mucus;   but, unless they be soluble in water, gelatinous
hydrates, when once formed, are not in general adhesive;
separated masses do not reunite when brought into contact.

a distant analogy   to gum incompletely dried, to glue, or any
other firm   jelly.   Ice further appears to be of the class of
adhesive colloids. The redintegration (regelation of Faraday) of
masses of melting ice, when placed in contact, has much of a
colloid character.    A colloidal view of the plasticity of ice demon
strated in the glacier-movement will readily develope itself.

membrane, and it forms the osmose.            The contact of the saline
fluid is thus attended by a continuous catalysis of the gelatinous
hydrate, by which it is resolved into a lower gelatinous hydrate
and free water.        The inner surface of the membrane of the
osmometer contracts by contact with the saline solution, while .
the outer surface dilates by contact with pure water.             Far from
promoting this separation of water, the diffusion of the salt
throughout the substance of the membrane appears to impede
osmose, by equalizing the condition as to saline matter of the
membrane through                 its
                           whole thickness. The advantage which

                                      the extreme lands           South                  of
America     at   the present time exemplifies the effect                        of     the    humi

                 produced by great Geographical Changes.                                     883
dity produced by this north and south alignement of continent
upon the capacity of what are considered the inhabitants of
warm countries to support a very inclement climate.    Here is
found the fuchsia having perennial foliage, but which when
transported to the dry but less inclement climate of England
becomes deciduous.     Here also the humming-bird finds food,
enabling it to continue through rain and snow, while within 10
degrees of latitude to the southward the snow is perpetual at
the waters’ edge.
   The climatal effects of the contrary configuration are shown in
the Asiatic continent, where the extremes of heat and cold alter
nately prevail in much lower latitudes than the southern point of
America, and where in the tropical and hypertropical countries
there are substituted for these extremes the equally trying alter
nations of extreme aridity and excessive moisture. It is true
that at the present day the effect of a trend of continent from
north to south, where it still occurs, does not, much as it modifies
the climate, present us with conditions analogous to those
afforded by the secondary period, as we cannot suppose that at
the extreme southern point of America reptiles such as existed
during the oolitic age could still exist. Nor is this to be ex
pected, as allowance has to be made for the effect on terrestrial
climate produced by the numerous mountain chains of great
elevation which have come into existence since the secondary
period, to which in point of altitude we find no approximation
among the mountain chains of that period; for even the Andes
(which during that period would seem to have been a chain of
volcanic islands) could not have had an altitude at approaching            all
that which           has    present,
                              at          since the secondary deposits now
occur  in   it   at it considerable
                         a                elevation.  Allowance also should
 be made for the effect            on
                             the temperature       the ocean,   ofthe                    by

of the mountains”.      Besides this, we are not    lose sight    the

  The disappearance of this great tetrabranchiate family affords,
I think, the clue to the disappearance of the secondary marine
saurians; while the development of the dibranchiate family has
been commensurate with that of the Cetacean order, of some of
which they form the food. The numerous family of Cestraciont
fishes must have been mainly dependent   upon a copious supply
of mollusca for their food; and this   most probably consisted
mainly of the tetrabranchiate Cephalopoda, the means for the
crushing of whose dense shells were afforded by the palate or
tubercle teeth of these fishes. We may not unreasonably infer
that the habits of fish feeding upon nearly stationary food, such
as mollusca, would, unlike those of the Squalidae, which now feed
upon fish, have been sluggish.     The marine Saurians, again, we
may infer, procured their food from fish, and from those forms
among them whose sluggish habits admitted of the easiest capture.
Now the disappearance of the Tetrabranchiata, of the Cestra
cionts, and of the marine Saurians, was contemporaneous; and
we can hardly refuse to admit that such a triple destruction
must have arisen either from some common cause, or from these
forms being successively dependent for existence upon each
other. The habits of existing Squalidae show that that order is
not unsuited to a wide range remote from the shores, and thus
independent of causes operating upon coast followers.         The
Squalidae survived the post-cretaceous changes; but of the shore
followers existing at the cretaceous epoch,                      all
                                                the marine Sauria,
all all
     the Tetrabranchiata except the Nautilus and Aturia, and
    the Cestracionts except the one-surviving Australian genus,
perished between the cretaceous and the eocene epochs.

           I have   endeavoured           to show that a remnant of the continental
tracts of the secondary period appears in the present Australian
continent.     Now it is an important fact that, with the possible
exception of the Stereognathus, the nearest living affinities of the
 Mammalia yet discovered in secondary formations exist in Aus
tralia and           its
                adjacent islands*, and           Madagascar. Many   in                                          of

   These coincidences have, it is true, been explained by some on
the ground that Australia, like the secondary lands, was adapted
only for such forms of life, and that the animals most                                                        fit   to   in
habit     have been specially created there; but this explanation
         it
fails completely before our daily experience; and the explanation
                                 sought      other grounds. The

ring in countries where the true Carnivora occur are those of the

canic bands prevailed during the carboniferous epoch, being
resumed, and that this direction has prevailed to the present
time, being that generally of the mountain systems and other
anticlinals which have an origin more recent than the cretaceous
period, as well as of the chief volcanic bands now in activity other
than the Andean and Rocky-Mountain band, which, as I have
shown, is of ante-cretaceous origin; that this resumption of the
volcanic direction of the carboniferous epoch by no means repro
duced the geographical features of that palaeozoic age (which were
those of low-lying lands having an insular rather than a conti
mental character), but brought into existence those stupendous
upheavals of the earth’s crust that have culminated at a very
recent date in the formation of mountain chains incomparably
exceeding in elevation, and consequently in their climatal effect,
any of the upheavals of the secondary periods*; that this change
produced, during the intra-cretaceous and tertiary interval, a
vast continental extent of land uninterrupted by great mountain
chains, extending from America on the west, to the Bay of
Bengal on the east, if not perhaps to the centre of the South
Pacific, and accumulated mainly in low latitudes; that the for
mation of such a continent introduced climates the most unlike
those of the secondary period, and had           effect both       the          its                           on

chiate Cephalopoda which supplied their food; that the forms
of Reptilia preserved or developed during this period were those
(as the procoelian Crocodilia) which at the present day we find
subsisting under these new and different conditions; that in
several parts of the Southern Hemisphere there are still preserved
to us remnants of the warm-blooded fauna of the secondary period
in a state of isolation from different stages in that period; and
that the disappearance of the wingless birds of the Trias, except
the Struthionidae, has taken place at the times when, and in the
places where, they were exposed to the attacks of the Felinae, or
other carnivora of power and activity equal to the mastery of
such powerful birds, or of man, and that the Struthionidae
alone, by their superior means of escape, have withstood these
enemies.
   The topics discussed in this paper are in harmony with Mr.
Darwin's law of natural selection.    The unequal rate at which
some forms of mammalia      have,  when compared with others,
changed their generic and specific characters, and even those of
the suborders to which they belonged, as shown in the compa
rison of the change in the Opossum and Macacus with the true
Ungulata, appears to be due to the greater influence which
changing external conditions have upon some than upon other
forms of life. The competition for existence, and the consequent
elimination of new types of being, has had            maximum upon       its

392.           Mr. S. W. Wood            on the Effects upon              Animal Life
adapted to the conditions of habitat, and especially created with
reference to the conditions under which it was to exist. We see
the latter hypothesis fail when tested by the effect which the
introduction of domestic animals, and of some of the wild ones
which follow man in his migrations, has had in these regions—
an effect so unmistakeable, that we cannot doubt but that the
later introductions will eventually exterminate the indigenous
population, and would have done so ages ago had the geogra
phical conditions permitted the migration of the animals of the
Europeo-Asiatic continent into these sequestered portions of an
earlier land.
   The preservation of the fauna of past geological periods in a
state of isolation more or less complete has not, so far as         am                                   I
aware, yet received much notice from geologists, doubtless from
the reluctance hitherto exhibited by them to argue from any
premises which involved the admission that           animated beings          all
originated from common parents; but we now appear                                                       to   be

    LVI.   Note on the Occurrence     of Flint Implements in the Drift.

       GENTLEMEN,

                       pretending to be a geologist, I may yet be per
                      to point out a general property of matter which
may perhaps tend to modify the conclusions which some have
derived from the occurrence of flint implements in the drift.
Taking it for granted that such implements have been found in
this deposit, and that they are the work of human hands, I do
not yet feel prepared to allow the great antiquity of our race as
a logical conclusion.
   May it not be laid down as an axiom in physical science, that
no substance whatever possesses a quality in such perfection as
to exclude absolutely the opposite and antithetical quality?
   In proof of this statement, it may be asserted that the most
mobile liquids with which we are acquainted are yet viscous in
some degree, and have therefore so                            far

                                                                              is of

able fact, that while flint implements                   abundance have been
                                                                        in

perhaps not more than a small fraction of an inch in a year.    It
would of course be very desirable to obtain experimental evidence
of such a property of the drift; but this would be an exceedingly
difficult and tedious task. In absence of such experiments, cor
roborative evidence may perhaps be derived from the fact of the
disappearance of Roman villas which are afterwards exhumed.
Coupling this testimony with that derived from the general cha
racter of the matter which surrounds us, it cannot be denied that
such a property of the drift is at least possible; in which case
we should,         I
                think, be deterred from framing any theory regard
ing the great age of our race based upon the position of these
implements, especially when such views are contradicted by
strong evidence from another quarter.

observers happened to be ready, who recorded ample statical facts
and many valuable dynamical results.
    Advancing gradually, the first cautionary or storm-warning signals
were made early in 1861, but on that occasion were unhappily dis
regarded in the Tyne; and on the following days awful losses of life
were witnessed on the north-east coasts.           From that time to the
present similar warnings have been given there and elsewhere—with
increasingly advantageous effects, it appears, if one may judge, in
the first instance, by applications since sent officially from all the
principal ports, and from the chief associations of Underwriters, in
addition to Admiralty approval and the cooperation of the Coastguard.
   In August 1861, the first published “forecasts” of weather were
tried; and after another half-year had elapsed for gaining experience
by varied tentative arrangements, the present system was established.
Twenty reports are now received each morning (except Sundays),
and ten each afternoon, besides five from the Continent.             Double
forecasts (two days in advance) are published, with the full Tables
(on which they chiefly depend), and are sent to six daily papers, to
one weekly, to Lloyds', to the Admiralty, and to the Horse Guards,
besides the Board of Trade.
   These forecasts add almost nothing to the pecuniary expense of
the system, while their usefulness practically is said to be more
and more recognized”. Warnings of storms arise out of them; and
(scarcely enough considered) the satisfaction of knowing that no
very bad weather is imminent, may be very great to a person about
to cross the sea. Thus their negative evidence may be actually little
less valuable than the positive.
   Prophecies or predictions they are not: the term forecast is strictly
applicable to such an opinion as is the result of a scientific combina
tion and calculation, liable to be occasionally, though rarely, marred
by an unexpected “downrusht” of southerly wind, or by a rapid
electrical action not yet sufficiently indicated to our extremely
limited sight and feeling.       We shall know more and more by de
grees.    At present it is satisfactory to know that the measures
practised daily in these proceedings do not depend solely on one in
dividual.    They are the results of facts exactly recorded, and deduc
tions from their consideration, for which rules have been given. An
assistant has been practised and is able to share their responsibility.
Others are also advancing in the subject of dynamical meteorology.
   Air-currents sometimes flow side by side, though in opposite
directions, as “parallel streams,” for hundreds or even thousands of
miles.    Sometimes they are more or less superposed, occasionally,
indeed frequently, crossing at various angles; sometimes combining,
and by the composition of their forces and qualities causing those
   * At  a recent meeting of the shareholders of the Great Western Docks
at  Stonehouse,  Plymouth, it was stated officially that “the deficiency (in
revenue) is to be attributed chiefly to the absence of vessels requiring the
use of the graving docks for the purpose of repairing the damages occa
sioned by storms and casualties at sea.” (Feb. 24, 1862.)

toward or from the equator or the nearest pole; and sometimes so
antagonistic in their angular collision as to cause those large circling
eddies or rotatory storms called cyclones (in modern parlance), which
are really like the greater storms in all parts of the world, although
they do not quite assimilate to those local whirlwinds, dust-storms,
and other commotions of atmosphere which seem to be more elec
trical in their characteristics, if not in their origin.
   Whenever a polar current prevails at any place, or is approaching,
the air becomes heavy, and the barometer is high or rises. When

than at others around the British Islands, give frequent premoni
tions; and therefore great differences of pressure (or tension) shown
by barometer, of temperature, of dryness, or moisture, and direction
of wind should be considered as signs of changes likely to occur soon.
    It will be observed, on any continued comparison of weather
reports, that during the stronger winds a far greater degree of uni
formity and regularity is shown than during the prevalence of mode
rate or light breezes: and this should be remembered.
   When neither of the greater and more extensive atmospheric
currents is sweeping across the British Islands (currents of which
the causes are remote, and on a large scale), the nature or character
of our winds approaches, and is rather like, that of land and sea
breezes in low latitudes, especially in summer.
   Either the cooler sea-wind is drawn in over land heated by the
summer sun, or cold air from frosty heights, snow-covered lands, or
chilly valleys moves towards the sea, which is so uniform in tempera
ture for many weeks together, changing so slowly, and but little in
comparison with land during the year.      These light variables may
at such times be  numerous,  simultaneously,  around the compass, on
the various coasts of the British Islands.
   Frequently it has been asked, “In this country, how much rise or
fall of the glasses may foretell remarkable change or a dangerous
storm      **
   To which can now be replied, great changes or storms are usually
shown by falls of barometer exceeding an inch, and by differences
of temperature exceeding about fifteen degrees. A tenth of an inch
an hour is a fall indicating a storm or very heavy rain. The more
rapidly such changes occur, the more risk there is of dangerous
atmospheric commotion.

    Consecutive storms, at the meetings of main currents in zones of
latitude at certain periods, have had appearances of continuity. The
familiar instance of the ‘Charles Heddle' has so often been adduced
as proof of continuing circuitous action or gyration, that it may
seem injudicious to doubt the evidence; but knowing how frequently
circuits or cyclones succeed each other rapidly, and how unreliable
are some of the earlier logs of events in a storm written after its
cessation,   especially respecting directions of wind and courses

    Full warning was given along our eastern coasts of that storm in
which the Prussian corvette‘Amazon' was totally lost; and so struck
were the Prussian authorities by the facts of that period, taken in
connexion with other known cases, that an official application was
soon afterwards made to the Board of Trade for information, with
the view of enabling a similar system to be organized in the Baltic,

     “Note on Professor Faraday's Recent Experiments on ‘Regela
tion.’”     By Professor James Thomson, Queen's College, Belfast.
   Some time ago*, Principal James D. Forbes showed that two
slabs of ice, having each a face ground tolerably flat, and being both
suspended in an atmosphere a little above the freezing-point upon a
horizontal rod of glass passed through two holes in the plates of ice,
so that the plates might hang vertically and in contact with one
another, would unite gradually so as to adhere strongly together.
This interesting experiment Principal Forbes adduced as being in
opposition to the theory offered by met of the plasticity of ice, and
of the tendency of pieces of thawing ice to unite when placed in
contact.    He thought it showed that pressure was not essential to
the union of the two pieces of ice. I pointed out, in reply t, that
the film of water between the two slabs, being held up against gravity
by the capillary tension or contractile force of            free upper surface,its
and   being  distended besides     against the  atmospheric     pressure,       the                          by

 ternally to simply atmospheric pressure:—and though                I
                                                            shall also, in
what   follows, point out some additional  conditions, almost necessarily
present in the experiment, which, under my general view of the
plasticity of ice, would act in conjunction with those already adduced,
and would increase the rapidity of the union.
    Professor Faraday, holding it in view to remove the ground on
which my explanation of Principal Forbes's experiment was founded,
has contrived and carried out a set of new and very beautiful experi
ments from which the capillary action referred to has been com
pletely eliminated, and he has still found the union of the ice to
occur, and to increase with time, and has met with a curious addi
tional phenomenon of “flewible adhesion”*. In these experiments,
when two pieces of ice, rounded so as to be convex at their points
where mutual contact is to be allowed, are placed in water, and are
either anchored so as to be wholly under water, or are placed floating
when so formed that they can touch one another only under water,
and that, at the water surface, there shall be a wide space between
them so that there shall be no capillary action drawing them to
gether, he showed that the pieces of ice, in either of these cases, if
brought gently into contact, will adhere together; unless indeed the
movement bringing them into contact be so directed as to introduce
forces capable of tearing them apart again by obliquity of action, by
agitation of the water, or by other disturbances.       He showed also
that, if when the two pieces of ice have become attached at their
point of contact, a slight force, such as may be given by one or two
feathers, be applied, tending to separate them, at one side of their
point of contact, they will roll round one another with a seemingly
flexible adhesion; or that, if the point of a floating wedge-shaped
piece of ice is brought under water against the side of another float
ing        it will stick to that piece like a leech. He showed that if
        piece,
the pieces  be allowed to remain for a few moments in contact, their
adhesion will become rigid, so that on a force being applied sufficient
to break through the joint, the rupture will occur with a crackling
noise, though the pieces may still continue to hold together, rolling
on one another with the flexible adhesion.     He made some other ex
periments nearly the same as these, but in which he showed the
flexible and rigid adhesion to occur while there is constantly a decided
tensile force applied externally tending to pull the pieces asunder
instead of any external force tending to press them together.            He
thinks that the phenomena of flexible and rigid adhesion “under
tension” go towards showing that pressure is not necessary to “re
gelation.”    He then gives his own idea of the flexible and rigid
adhesion in the following words:– “Two convex surfaces of ice come
together; the particles of water nearest to the place of contact, and
therefore within the efficient sphere of action of those particles of        ice
which are        on
                both sides    them, solidify;

remain until a force sufficiently great to break through it is applied.
But if the direction of the force resorted to can be relieved by any
hinge-like motion at the point of contact, then think that the union                      I
is broken up amongst the particles on the opening side of the angle,
whilst the particles on the closing side come within the effectual
regelation distance;    regelation ensues there and the adhesion is
maintained, though in an apparently flexible state. The flexibility
appears to me to be due to a series of ruptures on one side of the
centre of contact, and of adhesion on the other,           the regelation,
which is dependent on the vicinity of the ice surfaces, being trans
ferred as the place of efficient vicinity is changed. That the sub
stance we are considering is as brittle as ice, does not make any dif.
ficulty to me in respect of the flexible adhesion; for if we suppose
that the point of contact exists only at one particle, still the angular
motion at that point must bring a second particle into contact (to
suffer regelation) before separation could occur at the first; or                                                        if,     as

 thus appears to put it out of the condition in which my theory has
 clearly indicated a cause of plasticity, and I presume makes it cease,
 or almost entirely cease, to be plastic.    I believe no plastic yielding
 of ice to tension has been discovered    by observation in any case, an
 I  think there are theoretical reasons why ice should be expected to
 be very brittle in respect to tensile forces.   The isthmus then being
supposed devoid of plasticity at            extended side, ultimately breaks   its

and the tension in the extended part cannot be of small intensity,
being sufficient to break that side of the isthmus.              In the experi
ments which gave flexible adhesion seemingly under tension, it is not
to be admitted that tension was really the condition under which the
ice existed at the places where the union was occurring.                To apply
a  simple    disruptive   force to the whole isthmus of        ice,  it would be
necessary to take very special precautions in order to arrange that
the line of application of the disruptive forces should pass through
the point of contact of the two pieces.                 If
                                                      that were done, and the
forces were gradually increased till the cohesive strength of the isth
mus were overcome, it is clear that the two pieces of ice would sepa
                                                              .
rate altogether, and there would be no flexible adhesion; but the
flexible adhesion, when it occurs, is essentially dependent on the
existence of an intense pressure at the side                the isthmus remote
from the line of the         externally  applied   disruptive  forces, or of the
single force applied in some of the experiments to one only of the
pieces, and resisted by the inertia of the other.
    It is further to be observed that tremors and slight agitations to
which the two pieces of ice united at their point of contact, may be
subject, arising from undulations imparted to the water in which the
ice is immersed, by manipulation of the experimenter,-from the
tread of people on adjacent floors,         from the passage of vehicles on
neighbouring streets, from convective movements of the water,
and from other causes,—will be sources of power or energy operative
in bringing about an increase of adhesion with time; that is to say,
in changing gradually the flexible into the rigid adhesion.
    It will now of course be obvious that the conditions involved in
the explanation just offered of Prof. Faraday's experiments must
also usually be present in the experiment of Principal Forbes. Their
incidental occurrence, however, as additional causes increasing the
rapidity of the union of the two slabs of ice, does not overthrow the
particular explanation of Principal Forbes's experiment which had         I
offered as a perfect answer to the objection raised by that experiment
against my general view of the plasticity of ice; and as indicating
clearly and certainly the occurrence of            all
                                                   the conditions required for
 the union   of  the two pieces       ice under my theory. The contingent
                                       of
 occurrence   of   the additional conditions now specially brought for
ward, was indeed from the first somewhat familiar                  my mind, but
                                                                    to

                                             as   unessential and not perhaps
 quite so   clearly apparent.     Their occurrence has, however, now be
                         the explanation         Prof. Faraday's new experi

     The following communications were read:—
     1. “On the Drift containing Arctic Shells in the neighbourhood
  of  Wolverhampton.”      By the Rev. W. Lister, F.G.S.
    In the parish of Bushbury, at the junction of the London and North
 Western, the West-Midland, and the Stour-Valley Railways, is a
 gravel, with clay, sand, and pebbles, rolled Liassic fossils, flints,
 pieces of coal and of wood, and more or less fragmentary shells of
 the following species (as determined by J. G. Jeffreys, Esq., F.R.S.,
F.G.S.):-Astarte arctica, Cardium echinatum, C. edule, Cyprina                                      Is
 landica, Modiola modiolus, Tapes virginea, Tellina solidula, Venus
 striatula, Litorina squalida, Nassa reticulata, Purpura lapillus, and
 Turritella communis.      The Astarte and the Litorina are not now
found living in our seas. Similar fossil shells have been also
found by the author at Oxley Manor, half-a-mile to the N.W.; by
Mr. G. E. Roberts at Acleton, eight miles to the S.W.; and by
Mr. Beckett elsewhere. Liassic fossils have also been found in the
gravel at Compton Holloway and at Wightwick (both in the parish
of Tettenhall), and at Wolverhampton.
     2. “On a Split Boulder in Little Cumbra, Western Isles.”           By
James    Smith,  Esq., F.R.S.,  F.G.S.
    The Islands of Great and Little Cumbra have (like the west coast
of Scotland) a cliff and terrace, indicating an elevation of about 40
feet above the present level of the sea, and the removal of at least
 100 feet of rock (sandstone and trap), the sea at            present level  its
having worn away the rock                     to
                                     the extent     only          of

of an inch. The terrace on the Little Cumbra has been moreover
ground down and scratched                     by
                                     ice-action, the striae passing unob
literated under the     present  sea;    and                 on
                                                 the terrace lies      split              a

had observed          in
                  the bed             of

Spean, and then an eastern course on one hand up Loch Laggan,
and a western, on the other, down the Spean.      Up Glen Roy the
ice had apparently passed north-eastwardly, over the watershed, to
wards the Spey.      In Knapdale, Argyllshire, similar evidence is
obtained of a  great   ice-stream passing over hill and dale, here
falling into the Sound of Jura.    The author referred to Rink's and
Sutherland's observations on the continental ice of Greenland as
affording a probable solution of these phenomena; and, objecting
to the hypothesis either of floating ice and of debacles being suffi
cient to account for the conditions observed, he thought that
land-ice, moving from central plateaux downwards and outwards,
has effected the extensive erosions referred to, both in Scotland and
other northern regions, at a time when the land was at a much
higher level than at present. This must have been followed by a
deep submergence, to account for the stratified and shell-bearing
drift-beds.

   The following communication was read:—
   “On the Glacial Origin of certain Lakes in Switzerland, Scot
land, Sweden, and North America.”            By A. C. Ramsay, F.R.S.,
 President of the Geological   Society.
   The author first stated that in this memoir he proposed to extend
his theory of the glacial origin of the smaller mountain-lakes of
Wales and Switzerland (published in ‘The Old Glaciers of North
Wales') to those greater lakes of Switzerland which, like the

l: PURE        and dry oxygen, however rarefied, is never phospho
           rescent when traversed by the induction spark.
  2. Any other gas, simple or compound, if rarefied when alone,
never presents the phenomenon of phosphorescence.
  3. A mixture of oxygen and nitrogen in the proportion of 37 per
cent. of oxygen gives a phosphorescence, but it is feeble and very
little durable.
    4. It becomes more pronounced if to the preceding gaseous mix
ture a little vapour of monohydrated nitric acid is added.         -
   5. The phosphorescence is splendid and permanent if to the above
gaseous mixture a drop of Nordhausen sulphuric acid or a small
quantity of anhydrous sulphuric acid is added.
   6. The same result is attained by passing the induction spark
through a rarefied mixture of the three gases, oxygen, nitrogen, and
sulphurous acid, in the following proportions:—

need merely successively be placed at the minimum deviation for each
ray of the spectrum, and a hollow prism used which is filled with
sulphide of carbon, and closed by two parallel quartz plates.    Flint
glass prisms have not always the same refracting power.
   12. Lastly, with sufficient length, and in a barometric tube where
the vacuum is made with the greatest care, the electric current can
only be passed when the tension is very great; and in this case the
prismatic analysis of the feeble light which passes shows that the
electricity can only strike through long distances by detaching
metallic particles from both electrodes, and, so to speak, forming for
itself a bridge of material molecules.—Comptes Rendus, November 4,

          ON  THE SPECTRA OF PHOSPHORUS AND SULPHUR.
                          BY M. J.-M. SEGUIN.
   Phosphorus and sulphur are volatilized in a current of hydrogen,
and the sparks from a moderate-sized Ruhmkorff's machine passed
through the mixture of gas and vapour.       The electrodes consisted
of fine platinum wires, covered with glass within a few millimetres
of the end, and at a distance of a few millimetres from each other.
They did not become red during the experiment.           The spectrum
was viewed through the prism with the naked eye, which gives the
well-marked rays.
   The vapour of phosphorus in hydrogen gives a red ray, an orange
ray almost as visible as the red, two less well-marked green rays at
the more refrangible end of the visible part of the green, and, at an
interval comparatively dark, a bluish-green ray, then some blue or
violet rays which are not easily distinguished.       The orange ray,
which is very bright, as well as the two feeble green rays, appear or
disappear according as the receiver which contains the phosphorus
is heated. They consequently belong to this substance. The red
and bluish-green rays probably belong to hydrogen.
.  This experiment was confirmed in the main points by operating
on phosphuretted hydrogen, and on a mixture of terchloride of phos
phorus and hydrogen.
   The spark in a mixture of sulphur vapour and hydrogen is of a
bright blue, while it is of a pale rose in hydrogen alone. In the
spectrum there is a red ray, and three distinct green rays almost
equidistant from each other.     The first, and often the second, ap
peared almost yellow from their lustre; the third is slightly less
bright, and it extends a little on the side of the others; it seems to
comprise several fine and near rays; there are also a bluish-green
ray, two blue rays, and two violet rays, which form flutings in the
most refrangible part of the spectrum. The three green rays are the
most salient part of the spectrum of sulphur.    Most of the blue and
violet rays belong to this substance.
   The spark was also observed in sulphuretted hydrogen and sul
phurous acid. The three green rays showed with such precision
that it was impossible to mistake their identity.—Comptes Rendus,
December 30, 1862.

     I
     must, however, observe that Jochmann’s paper does not come
up to my expectations, inasmuch as nowhere find in it strict         I
        but only opinions which are generally entertained, or are
  ased  upon   analogies, and from which, in my judgment, no
safe conclusions can be drawn.                                   I
                                      intend, in the first place, to
discuss a point which has been raised by Jochmann (and upon
which great stress has been laid in other quarters also) as con
clusive against this hypothesis, namely the conduction of heat by
gases, and reserve to myself to return to other points at a future
time.          I
          will, however, at once remark that I consider the rest
of Jochmann's objections as equally without foundation.
                                                           º
heat, after the appearance of Krönig's memoir,    mentioned that, accordingI
to a communication I had received, the idea of the motion of the molecules
of gaseous bodies had already been pronounced by Joule, and that Joule.
again, had mentioned Herapath as               receded himself.  Somewhat
later P. Du Bois Reymond pointed out that Dan. Bernoulli had expressed,
 and to a certain point worked out, the same view in his Hydrodynamica.
 Quite recently my attention has been called to a book edited by Prevost
 (Deua Traités de Physique Mécanique, publiés par Pierre Prevost, Genève
 et Paris, 1818), which contains two memoirs—one by G. L. Le Sage,
 edited after his death by Prevost, and one by Prevost himself, in which
 Le Sage’s views are worked out further. In these memoirs, likewise, the
idea is put forth and discussed, that the molecules of gases are in a state
 of progressive motion; and although they contain much, in reference to the
 way in which this motion is produced and sustained, greatly at variance with
my own views, the manner in which the expansive force of gases is explained
by means of it is essentially the same.
    Le Sage quotes a series of authors who, previously to himself, had enter
tained similar ideas.      At page 126 his words are:-" On trouve des ves

  II.      Behaviour          of the molecules            emitted from an infinitely thin
                                                    stratum.
   § 3. We will begin by considering somewhat more closely the
nature of the motions of the individual molecules.
º:
   We will suppose two parallel planes to be placed perpendicu
larly to the axis of w and infinitely near to each other, so as to
          an infinitely thin stratum.   Since molecules are continu
ally flying through this stratum in        directions,         all
                                                        must some                            it
times  happen    that two molecules strike each other within       and                                       it
then rebound again. For the sake                               of
                                          shortness we will call these
molecules, which, after having lost their previous motions          the                                          by
impact, leave the stratum again with different motions, the mo
lecules emitted from the stratum; and         will now     our atten we                        fix
                                                                   -
tion upon their motions.
   These motions differ very much from each other; and we must
distinguish between variations        two kinds, occasioned
                                                         of        two                                       by
mutually independent causes, and therefore susceptible           being                                      of
separately considered.                     The one kind consists                        of   those      irregular
variations which always prevail                           in
                                       the molecular motions called
heat, and which would therefore also occur           the gas were                  if                                 of
uniform    temperature   and density  throughout.    They   arise from
various accidental inequalities accompanying the individual im
  acts: we will designate them accidental variations. The other
  ind     of
          variations    caused  is  the circumstance by   the gas not                        of
having         an
             equal temperature and density throughout.           These
variations   depend                 in
                             definite manner
                                          a    upon  the laws which
govern the differences         temperature and density existing
                                           of                                                                         in
different parts      the gas: we will call them normal variations.

     It  the latter which have especially
        is                                         considered       the  to      be                          in
conduction           of
                  heat, and we will therefore direct our attention
first of all        to
                them.

   The cause of their occurrence depends, in the case before us,
upon the fact that when two molecules, coming from different
sides, strike each other within the stratum, the molecule which
comes from the warmer side has in general a greater velocity
than the one which comes from the cooler side.       The magnitude
of this difference is determined by the distances from the stratum
in question of the points at which the said molecules commenced
their motions; and since the distances through which the mole
cules move between each two impacts are in general very small,
this difference must also be very small, so that we can regard the
mean value of this difference as a magnitude of the same order
with the mean excursions (Weglinge) of the molecules.             We
must now try to determine what influence this difference, exist
ing before the impacts, exerts upon the motions after the impacts.
    § 4. The behaviour of two impinging molecules is not in every
respect the same as that of two elastic spheres; but we can never
theless in many respects obtain a useful insight into the beha
viour of molecules by starting from the consideration of elastic
spheres.    The mutual action of two impinging elastic spheres is
very comprehensively treated by Maxwell in the memoir already
mentioned.      I will here only quote a few principles, which may,
however, be considered as sufficiently well known without my
                                                                      -
doing so.
   When two elastic spheres move with equal velocity in opposite
directions, and with their centres in the same straight line, so
that they strike each other centrally, they rebound from each other
in such a manner that each sphere moves back with the same
velocity in the direction of the point from which it came.        But
if the spheres move, before the impact, still in opposite direc
tions, but with their centres in two parallel straight lines instead
of in the same straight line, and so that the spheres consequently
impinge excentrically, they rebound again with equal velocities,
their centres again move in opposite directions in two parallel
straight lines; but the direction of these straight lines is not
the same as that of the straight lines in which the centres moved
before the impact. The new direction depends upon the position
on the two surfaces of the point of contact; and since the spheres
may strike each other on an infinite number of different points
of their surfaces, the rebound may also take place in an infinite
number of different directions; and it can be easily shown that
each possible direction in space is equally likely for the motions
of the spheres after the impact.
    Let it now be assumed, as a general case, that the two equal
spheres move before the impact with any velocities whatever and
in any directions whatever. We will decompose the motion of
each sphere    into two components.    We will take as the first com

ponent the motion of the common centre of gravity of the two
spheres; the second component must then be the motion of the
two spheres in question relatively to their common centre of gra
vity. The former motion is equal and in the same direction for
both spheres; the latter motion is equal and opposite for the
two spheres. The former is not altered by the impact; the latter,
on the other hand, is altered exactly in the same way as it would
be if it existed alone and there were no common motion.               In
relation to          it,
                 what has already been said          the case       two          of                      of
spheres moving         parallel straight lines, and which assume
                            in
various directions after impact, according         the point     which       to                        at
they strike each other,      applicable. is    thus becomes evident    It
how far the motions after impact,          molecules which impingeof
upon each other irregularly, are dependent upon their motions
before impact, and how far they are independent           them. The                      of
motion     of
            each sphere consists                   of
                                    two components, the first    which                                 of
is entirely determined, both                      as
                                     magnitude and direction,

motions before impact, and the second         which has also     deter of                           a

to the above         if s” be used as the multiplier before integration

   The mean length of excursion is somewhat different for those
molecules which do not move perpendicularly to the axis of a ; we
can express this by substituting, for the coefficients c and cºin
the foregoing equations, magnitudes dependent on the direction.
This dependence on the direction rests upon two circumstances,
each of which may be considered separately.
   The first circumstance is this—that a different temperature
and density prevail at the points from which the molecules start,
and in the strata through which they have to pass before they
arrive at the stratum under consideration, from those which prevail
in that stratum. If the cosine of the angle formed by a given
direction of motion with the axis of a be denoted by p, then the
distance of a molecule whose excursion is s, from our infinitel
thin stratum, is equal to us. The differences of temperature                                 .#
density existing at this distance can be represented, in the man
ner already known, by series which progress according to whole
powers of ps.      Now, since the modifications which the coeffi
cients c and cº   undergo  owing to the differences of temperature
and density must correspond to these differences themselves, we
may conclude that the modified coefficients can be represented
by similar series, containing, however, the proper mean values,
instead of the particular values s,              s”,

     LX.        On the general Differential Equations of Hydrodynamics.

                                       the intention of bringing under
 review, are contained for the most part in communications to
 the Numbers of the Philosophical Magazine for January 1851,
 March 1851, December 1852, and February 1853. In the
 references that will be made to these communications, the
 meanings of the symbols will be supposed to be known; and in
 the present one the same symbols will be used, and in the same
 significations.      The article “On the Principles of Hydrody
 namics” in the Number for January 1851 contains definitions
of two fundamental properties of a perfect fluid, and the proofs
 of six propositions founded on these properties, and on self
evident principles.        The first five of the propositions need not
be   particularly    dwelt upon, as the reasoning by which they are
established is not new, and has been generally accepted.                     Re
specting the fundamental properties, viz. that the parts of a fluid
press mutually and against the surface of a solid, and that, if the
fluidity be perfect, the parts are separable by an infinitely thin
partition without assignable force,                               I
                                                 will only remark that as
they are obvious and distinctive, and rest on experimental
evidence, they seem to be the most appropriate that can be
thought of for the basis of mathematical reasoning applied to
fluids.     The proofs of Propositions I. and                            II.

plane. But clearly in these cases the condition that the lines of
motion are normals to continuous surfaces is satisfied, and the
principle above enunciated as the foundation of a third general
equation is consequently involved.        For the solution of other
problems, the differential function uda + way--wdz is equated to
                                        *

                       “T               dy”
any problems have been attempted in which that supposition
has not been actually or virtually made.         But whence arises the
necessity for a new variable, and what does the variable itself
signify    Respecting the meaning of the variable, a very explicit
answer can be given.      For since in the expression ude--vdy-H waz
the differentials dr, dy, dz are independent and arbitrary, we may
assume them to be such that that expression is equal to zero.         It
will then be seen that (dd)=0 is the differential equation of a
surface which is everywhere cut at right angles by the directions
of the lines of motion in the elements through which it passes.
It is evident that there will be an unlimited number of such
surfaces, the function ºf being applicable at                     parts     all                      all

 the conclusion that a third fundamental equation is necessary
 for eliminating the unknown function A, and obtaining a result.
 ing general differential equation in which the principal variable
 is k, and the other variables are c, y, z, and t. I proceed to
 the investigation of this third equation.
    6. Preparatory to the investigation, it will be proper to take
 account of the following general dynamical circumstance. The
 accelerative forces which act on a given particle at any time are
 the extraneous forces X, Y, Z, and the force due to the pressure
 of the fluid, the components of which in the direction of the axes
 of   coordinates     are
                            # # #.                         Now these forces are by hypo
 thesis finite, and consequently the direction of the motion of a
given particle cannot alter per saltum, as it would require an
infinite accelerative force to produce this effect in an indefinitely
 short time. Thus, although the course of a given particle cannot
generally be expressed by means of algebraic functions of con
stant form, it must still be such that the tangents at any two
consecutive points do not make a finite angle with each other.
Hence also the directions of the surfaces of displacement which
cut at right angles the lines of motion in a given element at two
successive instants do not change per saltum.

                       also to be noticed that the equation (3),
although  it does not contain explicitly accelerative force, was
deduced on the principle that the action of the forces is such
that changes of position of the surfaces of displacement do not
take place per saltum.    Having made these statements,       might                            I

                          have seen no reason to call in question
the exactness of the   analysis  there employed.    Since, however,
the proposition is an important one, the investigation will be
repeated here in a condensed form.        Representing by s any line
drawn at a   given   instant   constantly  in the directions of the
motions of the particles through which it passes, and termi

have the consequence

But   º,    being proportional                  to   the velocity        V,   does not vanish, and
 we  must therefore have (ds)=0.     Hence                                    by integration s-cl.,
which   equation  means that does not vary                                 in   passing from point
   point       given surface displacement.    of s                              By taking any other

to              a
surface     displacement we should similarly                                  have s-ca, and the
difference between the two values     would                of  s              be constant. Thus
                be
there   will    a     constant interval between the two surfaces, which
cannot     be
           the case unless the trajectory                             be a    straight line and the
motion be rectilinear.
      As this result has been reached without employing            the                             all
 three   general  differential  equations,   cannot     affirmed that
                                                                 it                 be
 rectilinear motion       general and necessary. According
                                 is                                the                             to

Hence by integration, the function k, which, as said before,
may include a term which is an arbitrary function of the time,
becomes approximately an arbitrary function of coordinates.
Hence, while in those instances the motion, so far as it depends
on the mutual action of the parts of the fluid, will still be recti
linear where ude--wdy--wdz is strictly an exact differential, it
cannot be shown to be such generally, although it may be
gathered from that form of the function ºf that the lines of
motion will approximately be straight lines.

     Itis not improbable that the metals combine with mercury
in atomic proportions, and, in this event, that the resulting
compounds are dissolved in the overplus of mercury.
   Such a combination would undoubtedly modify the distances
of the compound atoms, and hence also the conductibility of the
mass.     The conductibilities of tin, zinc, gold, and silver-amal
gams from the tests in question show an expansion                      of the
molecules, those of lead and bismuth a contraction, supposing
that expansion of the molecules causes a decrement, and con
traction an increment of conductibility.
   In adopting the opinion of a chemical combination and sub
sequent solution, the very conditions prohibit the adoption of a
common formula which shall express with exactitude, for every
metal,         its
             amalgam conductibility, unless that formula embody
a term   embracing     the effect                 of

formula which combines the conductibilities of the metals in                                        a
fluid state, without being absolutely correct,                 near enough is

A"      Hove, near Brighton, is an old quarry in the upper chalk
      that presents some appearances of more than ordinary inter

and broken the layers of flint, splitting them in every direction,
and reducing them in some places almost to powder. Some of
these fissures are filled up with a mineral whiter than the sur
rounding chalk, and perfectly distinct from      which runs also           it,

 * The mineral agrees, both in physical characters and in chemical
composition, with that which has been described under the name
of Collyrite, and to which the formula SiO2,2A1*0°,+10 HO
has been attributed; but our specimen appears to have been
purer, and to have given more accurate numbers for the disilicate
 of alumina than those analysed by previous observers.
     But no two portions analysed gave exactly the same composi
 tion.     Some had a larger amount of carbonate of lime: thus a
 piece which was considerably harder, and broke with a conchoidal
 fracture, was found to contain between 5 and 6 per cent. of lime
 salt. Some had a much smaller amount of silica: thus a piece

      But the most remarkable specimens were from another part
  of the quarry.      They had the same physical characters as those
  already described;      but quantitative analysis showed that they
 contained more carbonic acid than was necessary to saturate the
 lime, and that there was no other base present except the
 alumina.        Now as bicarbonate of lime is soluble in water, and
 carbonate of alumina is unknown as a mineral species, and has
 seldom, if ever, been procured even in the laboratory, it seemed
  desirable not to depend on one analysis. A quantity of one
 specimen was therefore pounded up and several determinations
  were made of each constituent, and that by different processes,
 the mean results of which are given in the first column of the
 subjoined Table.         Another specimen was reduced to powder,

     We are disposed, therefore, to regard this mineral as collyrite
- mixed with a varying amount of a hydrated double carbonate of
  alumina and lime. If it should bear a distinct name, it may be
  termed Hovite, from the place where it was first recognized.
      On looking over published analyses of silicates, it did not
  appear that a carbonate had often been found entering into the
  composition of such minerals, yet there is a perfectly analogous
  instance on a smaller scale. Allophane is another hydrated
  silicate of alumina, and it occurs in a chalk-pit at Charlton,
  also in the upper chalk, and under circumstances almost iden
  tical with those under which we found the collyrite at Hove.
   In Mr. Dick's analysis of thisl, and in the analyses of four differ
   ent specimens by Mr. Northcotet, there was always found more
   carbonic acid than was required to saturate the lime. In none
   of these instances, however, did it exceed 1.31 per cent., and
   Mr. Northcote propounded no other view than that it existed as
   a bicarbonate.
      On inquiring about the quarry at Charlton from which this
   mineral was obtained, we were informed by Mr. Church that
   the allophane was accompanied by a substance resembling our
   collyrite. Some of this was obtained, and the two following
   analyses were made of portions having rather different physical
   characters.
     The first was more compact and more vitreous in                        its    fracture
   than the specimens from Hove, and not   perfectly white.
                                                       so                               It
   more closely resembled the specimens  collyriteof the British       in

and pouring over it acidulated starch-paste containing iodide of
potassium, you will perceive the effect produced. The fact which
I have ascertained, that the purest water mixed with a little che
mically pure sulphuric acid or potash and kept for some time
evaporating in the open air at a temperature of 50° or 60° C.
(the loss of the liquid being now and then restored) contains, in
the first case, a perceptible quantity of ammonia, and, in the
second case, of nitrous acid, may now be easily accounted for.
You know that about eighteen months ago found that, during                            I
the slow combustion of phosphorus in moist atmospheric air,
very perceptible quantities of nitrite of ammonia are formed, and
 drew from that fact the inference that the salt is engendered by
 3 equivalents of water combining directly with 2 equivalents of
 nitrogen.    Now there is to me hardly any doubt that the pro
 duction of that nitrite is due to the evaporation of water taking
 place about the phosphorus, whose temperature, in consequence
 of     its
        burning state, proves                 higher than that

                 has investigated several decompositions of chlo
      ride of acetyle. When this substance is enclosed in a scaled
tube with pentachloride of phosphorus and heated for some time
to 100°, and for a short time to 190°, an action takes place the
result of which is that the tube contains nothing but liquid. On
opening the tube, a stream of hydrochloric acid escapes; and on
subsequently distilling the contents, a series of bodies is obtained,
the first of which is terchloride of phosphorus, followed by a little
oxychloride of phosphorus. The distillate which passed over at
about 118° consisted of chloride of trichloracetyle, C*Cl”0 Cl, as
was proved by converting this substance into trichloracetic ether.

     Chemical Notices:—Linnemann            on Sulphocyanic   Acid.  473
    Sulphocyanic acid,     §}    S, can be regarded as sulphuretted
hydrogen in which an equivalent of hydrogen is replaced by
cyanogen.       Linnemann has prepared the corresponding anhy
dride of    sulphocyanic    acid by the action of iodide of cyanogen
on the sulphocyanide of silver.

              of silver.    cyanogen.    silver.      cyanic acid.
The reaction is exceedingly regular; it takes place at a moderate
temperature, and is best effected when an etherial solution of
iodide of cyanogen is triturated at a gentle heat with the corre
sponding quantity of the silver-salt. The product is treated
with bisulphide of carbon, by which the sulphide of cyanogen is
dissolved out, and, on cooling, is obtained in transparent rhombic
plates, or long thin laminae.         It sublimes at 30° or 40°, and is
thereby obtained in small, highly refringent thin laminae.           It is
 heavier than bisulphide of carbon; it is dissolved by ether, alcohol,
 and water, and readily crystallizes from the hot supersaturated
 solution.     It is decomposed by potash into cyanate and sulpho
 cyanide of potassium; and with nascent hydrogen, sulphuretted
 hydrogen, and sulphide of potassium it yields the same products,
 namely hydrocyanic acid and sulphocyanic acid. It unites with
 two molecules of ammonia to form a sulphide of cyanammonium
 —a reaction quite analogous to that of sulphuretted hydrogen on
 ammonia, which yields sulphide of ammonium.                Thus,

     According to Lassaigne”, volatile chloride of cyanogen can be
  obtained by the action of chlorine on an aqueous solution of
  cyanide of potassium. A current of the gas is passed into a
  solution of one part of cyanide of potassium contained in a roomy
  flask which is kept cold with ice; in the cork of this flask is
 fixed a tube leading to a U-tube placed in a mixture of ice and
  salt: the greater part of the chloride of cyanogen condenses in
 this tube to colourless crystals.
     Bromide of cyanogen may be formed in an analogous manner
  by adding bromine, which has been cooled to 0°, to a solution
  of cyanide of potassium in water contained in a retort, which is
  kept cold by means of ice. After a sufficient quantity of bro
  mine has been added, the retort is stoppered and gently warmed,

     Lautemann has shown that, by the reducing action of hydriodic
  acid, lactic acid may be reduced to propionic acidt.              Propylic
  glycol stands to propylic alcohol in the same relation as lactic
 acid to propionic acid; and by the action of hydriodic acid on
 propylic glycol, Wurtzf has shown that it is reduced to propylic
 alcohol. When the former substance was heated in the water
 bath for some time with concentrated hydriodic acid, the mix
 ture became dark from the separation of iodine; and on subse
 quent neutralization and distillation, a heavy liquid was obtained
 which proved to be iodide of propyle, C*H7 I. This had been
 formed in consequence of a double reaction—reduction of propylic
 glycol to propylic alcohol, and change of the latter to iodide of
 propyle in consequence of the further action of hydriodic acid.

    This production of propylic alcohol differs from the result ob

 reduction, while Lourenço's reaction is a case of inverse substi
tution.
    Wurtz has also obtained iodide of butyle, by a precisely analo
gous reaction with hydriodic acid and butylic glycol.               Ethylic
glycol, as Simpson has shown $, is converted by hydriodic acid
into iodide of ethylene.

with alcohol a saccharine substance was dissolved out, which
Boutlerow calls methylenitane.     It is uncrystallizable, and, heated
on platinum-foil, emits the odour of burnt sugar.          Its aqueous
solution is feebly acid, and reduces a solution of tartrate of copper
even in the cold. When heated with excess of butyric acid, it
forms an oily compound, which is somewhat viscous at ordinary
temperatures; it is decomposed by baryta-water with formation
of butyrate of baryta. It was not possible to free it entirely
from an inorganic substance, probably formiate of baryta, and
the analyses were not very concordant.       Boutlerow assumes pro

                 MM.        Zwenger and Dronke on a new Glucoside.                                477
of the liquid, robinine  separates out in yellowish crystals, and is
purified by repeated recrystallizations from water.
   It is a neutral substance, with a feeble astringent taste. Very
soluble in hot water, it is slightly soluble in alcohol, and inso
luble in ether. It melts at 195°, and solidifies to an amorphous
mass.    It is dissolved by alkaline solutions with a fine golden
yellow colour. It readily reduces an alkaline solution of oxide
of copper, and also chloride of gold.
   It is readily decomposed by boiling with dilute hydrochloric
acid, with the separation of quercetine, while the solution contains
sugar.    Emulsine does not produce this change.           This decom
position reveals a connexion between this new glucoside and quer
citrine; both of them yield quercetime by decomposition, but
differ in the nature of the saccharine substances which they con
tain as a copulate.     This is the first instance of the kind in which
such a difference occurs in the glucoside.        Zwenger and Dronke
have prepared quercetime by the decomposition of quercitrine,
and found that this is quite identical with the body prepared
from robinine.
   Robinine, dried at 100°, has the formula C9H800”; dried

   “On some new Phenomena of Residuary Charge, and the Law of
Exploding Distance of Electrical Accumulation on Coated Glass.”
By Sir W. Snow Harris, F.R.S.
   A main object of this paper is to prove that residuary charge in the
Leyden jar, subsequent to explosive discharge through an external
interrupted circuit, as in the case of discharge by a Lane's electro
meter, is not the result of a spreading of the charge upon the un
coated part of the glass, or of penetration within                its
                                                         substance, but

Sir W. Harris             on some new Phenomena                          of Residuary             Charge.        485
  The author introduces his subject with sundry observations on
Lane's discharging electrometer, and the law of explosive discharge,
and adverts to the fact recorded by Nicholson in the Royal Society's
Transactions for 1789, that “although in moderate charges the ex
ploding distance appears exactly, or very nearly, proportionate to the
charge itself, yet for high intensity, the distance to which the charge
is carried     exceeds that proportion:” this the author finds to be the
case generally, and quotes an experimental example showing the
amount of deviation from Lane's law in that particular instance.
He further shows, that in order to obtain explosive discharges at the
increased distances agreeing with the calculated number of measures,
the distances must be slightly increased by certain small quantities.
     The probable sources of these differences are now adverted                    and                       to,
the common objections                  Lane's discharging electrometer con

   electric will      be                          which this penetration                                         of

plates of glass of various kinds, as also of gum-lac, rosin, bees-wax,
&c., and found the capacity of these substances for electrical charge
different—phenomena recently explained by Faraday's fine discovery
of Specific Inductive Capacity.
    This last celebrated philosopher also recognizes the penetration or
infiltration of electrical charge within the substance of coated and
charged electrics, and attributes it to a certain amount of conducting
power in the electrical substance. All substances, he infers, are con
ductors of electricity in a greater or less degree, and thus admit of
infiltration of charge through their substance. In the case of charged
 electrics, the infiltrated electricity subsequently returns upon its path,
 and hence residuary charge.
    The author has no disposition to question the experimental results
 arrived at by either of these eminent men, but is of opinion that they
 apply to a different case of electrical force than that of secondary and
 immediate discharge, supervening upon a primary discharge of an
 electrical jar through an external explosive circuit, which he thinks
 can neither be referred to any previous spreading of the charge upon
 the glass, or to any penetration of it into                               its

given quantity of charge would be less. The effect would be greater
on the first measured quantity than on succeeding quantities; hence
for explosion at a first distance, an additional two or three measures
might be required, which, as the spread upon the glass became
satisfied, might not be requisite in the same proportion upon suc
ceeding measured distances, in which case discharge would ensue
with a less number of measures than calculation determines according
to Lane's law, making it appear as        according              if,

nexion with the inner coating of the jar. The intensity or attractive
force of the residuary or remaining charge is now noted, but as this
force is necessarily small, it is taken with the attracting plates at a
diminished distance from 1 to 3 of an inch or more, as the case may
require, and subsequently reduced to the standard distance of one
inch, taking the force to vary, as demonstrable by the electrometer,
as
     *            This being determined, the relative quantities of electricity
in the full charge and the residual charge will be as the square roots
of the respective attractive forces or intensities; the total force, as
also demonstrable by the instrument, being as the square of the ac
cumulation.    Let, for example, the quantity of charge communicated
to the jar  be 100 measures, and the attractive force, or intensity at
distance one inch, be 144 degrees, and suppose intensity of residual
force at the same distance='08.     In this case we have the simple
proportion 100 measures:                           a measures: :               V144       :   V:0s :: 12:           .283

jar exposing 5-5 feet of coated glass, first coated with metal and sub
 sequently with paper, gave the following results under a charge of
 100 measures.
   Exploding distances, as in the former case, nearly the same, being
 *23 and 25; attractive forces or intensity also nearly the same,
being 158° and 160°; residual measures with the metal coating 2:5
measures, or about the ºth of the total charge; with paper coating, in
some experiments 80 measures, or about ºths of the total charge, so
that the residual charges with metal and paper are as 1:32. Thermo
electric effect for metal coating 8°, for paper coating nothing. It
appears from these and similar experiments, that the interposition of
imperfect conductors between the coating and the glass of the Leyden
jar must necessarily impair
                                          of its

sandstone beneath, previously recognized as Permian, are here re
ferred to the Rothliegende; and the sandstones above are regarded
as belonging to the Trias. Detailed descriptions of the sandstones

     2. “On the Date of the Last Elevation of the Central Valley of
  Scotland.” By Archibald Geikie, F.R.S.E., F.G.S.
      After alluding to the position and nature of the raised beach
  which, at the height of from 20 to 30 feet above the present high
 water-mark, fringes the coast-line of Scotland, the author proceeded
 to describe the works of art which had been found in it. From their
 occurrence in beds of elevated silt and sand, containing layers of
  marine shells, it was evident that the change of level had been
  effected since the commencement of the human period.           The cha
  racter of the remains likewise proved that the elevation could not be
  assigned to so ancient a time as the Stone Period of the archaeologist.
  The canoes which had from time to time been exhumed from the
  upraised deposits of the Clyde at Glasgow clearly showed that, at
  the time when at least the more finished of them were in use, the
  natives of this part of Scotland were acquainted with the use of
  bronze, if not of iron. The remains found in the corresponding beds
  of the Forth estuary likewise indicated that there had been an up
  heaval long after the earlier races had settled in the country, and that
  the movement was subsequent to the employment of iron. From
  the Firth of Tay similar evidence was adduced to indicate an up
  heaval possibly as recent as the time of the Roman occupation. The
  author then cited several antiquaries who from a consideration of
  the present position of the Roman remains in Scotland had inferred
   a considerable change in the aspect of the coast-line since the
   earlier centuries of the Christian era.   He pointed out also several
   circumstances in relation to these Roman relics, which tended to
   show a change of level, and he referred to the discovery of Roman
   pottery in a point of the raised beach at Leith. The conclusion to
  which the evidence led him was that since the first century of our
  era the central parts of Scotland, from the Clyde to the Forth and
  the Tay, had risen to a height of from 20 to 25 feet above their pre
   sent level.

NOTE ON THE ELECTRICITY                 DURING EVAPORATION
                                              DEVELOPED
      AND DURING EFFERVESCENCE FROM CHEMICAL ACTION,    BY
      PROFESSORTAIT AND J. A. WANKLYN, Esq.
ON:beenof Professor W. Thomson's divided-ring electrometers having
          recently procured for the Natural Philosophy collection in
the University, we have made use of it in repeating and extending the
experiments of Volta, Pouillet, and others, on the electricity pro
duced during the evaporation of various bodies.       In some cases our
results agree with those already known, but in others we find effects
differing totally in kind or degree from the accepted ones; and with
some substances we find occasionally contradictory indications among
our own results.
   The electrometer is in every respect a far superior instrument to
the gold-leaf electroscope, which (sometimes with the addition of a
condenser) was used by former experimenters, and enables us to give
our results in a form easily reducible to absolute measure. The
charge of the instrument was such that, when the half-rings were
respectively connected with the zinc and platinum of a single Grove's
cell, the deflection observed amounted to about 5-8 scale divisions.
This was found to be the most useful charge for the bulk of our expe
riments, but it was easily increased twenty or thirtyfold when we
sought to verify any very delicate indications.
   Our apparatus consisted of a platinum dish, placed on an insula
ting stand, and connected with the insulated half-ring. A lamp
could be placed on the stand so as to heat the dish; and while this
was going on, the indications of the electrometer gave us the atmo
spheric charge. The experiments were                         all
                                              conducted when the latter
was very small;           so
                     that, although the sputtering    the fluids dropped    of
 on the hot  plate may  have   prevented   from       us
                                                  observing  some slight
effects, the large deflections we observed     many instances can have

different disposition, which enabled                us

ether   or alcohol         on
                        the dish itself when the lamp was removed.
   We agree generally with previous experimenters, that during the
continuance        the spheroidal state there
                   of                                 little, is any, perceptibleif

by the fact that when fluids are forcibly squirted upon the hot dish
the electrical indications are very much increased, and that                 con               a
cave surface gives far more powerful deflections than                  convex one     a

                                                                    or

   The sulphate-of-copper solution is by far the most remarkable
that we have tried. The smallest globule, on leaving the spheroidal
state, gave intense effects, sending the lamp-image entirely off the
scale.
    We have also commenced a set of experiments with a view to test
the electricity developed during the brisk disengagement of a gas by
chemical action, which was discovered eighty years ago by Volta. In
some of these experiments it was observed that when the gases were
disengaged with considerable effervescence, and in a mass of large
bubbles foaming over the platinum crucible in which the experiment
was conducted, the bursting of each bubble was attended by a simul
taneous increase of deflection in the electrometer. These experiments
are as yet exceedingly imperfect, but they seem, like the preceding.
to indicate friction as a main cause of the observed results. The
effects on the electrometer are by no means so uniform, either as to
kind or quantity of electricity, as those given by evaporation.

       GENTLEMEN,
   In my paper “On Chinese Astronomical Epochs” which you pub
lished in your Number for January last, I substituted in a formula the
English measure of 12 inches for the foot, whereas I ought to have
used 10 only, the French measure.      In consequence of this, the 0:25
at the  top of p. 3 ought to be changed  into 0-30. The effect of this
is that the range of time within which the Chinese observations may
have been made is 45 centuries, instead of 374; and therefore the
uncertainty arising from the ill-defined termination of the shadow of
the gnomon is still greater than I make it in that paper.     I shall be
much obliged by your inserting this letter in your next Number after
receiving        it.
I   take this opportunity                   of   asking you      to   make two more        correc
tions; viz.

                     observations
August, continuously during 24 hours of uninterrupted sunshine,
were graphically equalized, the curve drawn, and ordinates mea
sured off at every 20 minutes. This was the only opportunity
that occurred of continuous observation between such favourable
limits of altitude as to indicate the direction of a line with some
precision.
   § 6. In the Table of observations given in the Appendix*, the
date and apparent time are given in the first two columns. The
timepiece was regulated daily by the one o’clock signal-gun.       The
third column contains the values of r, the observed difference
between thermometers X and Y.              The film of talc that was
interposed between the sun and X was found to reflect 3%ths of
the incident rays. This ratio was determined by observations
taken with the film off during calm weather.           The value of r
without the film to r with the film on was as 1.18 to 1:00, the
sun's power not sensibly varying during the interval.         This pro
portion was maintained at low values of r, and even when the
source of radiation was a gas-flame.      The fourth column contains
the observed values of r increased in this ratio.            The fifth
column contains the corrections required to reduce the values in
the third to a vacuum. The correction is taken from a scale
that was constructed by means of an empirical formula derived
from observations on the cooling of X, as detailed in the Appen
dix. The sixth column is the final value of r as it would appear
in a naked vacuum, that                    is,

    From this we may compute the quantity of heat supplied to a
unit of surface by the sun in a unit of time corresponding to any
value of r. As an example, suppose r-10° and 8t=l second,
then
       &=} =0°.030453,              or 3° 0453 in 100 seconds, is the
rate at which the sun communicates heat to a thermometer whose
bulb is a sphere 0.42 inch in diameter, when r=10°.
    Suppose the glass of the bulb to be ºth of an inch thick,
there would be 0108 cubic inch glass and 0287 cubic inch
mercury heated 3° 045 in 100 seconds.              If r=20°, the same
heating would take place in 50 seconds, and so on.
    To reduce this to thickness of ice melted in 1 minute, we have
   Specific heat of mercury 033, and of glass 177.
   Specific gravity of mercury 13:5, and of glass 29.
   •0108 cubic inch glass equal in weight to 0313 cubie inch water.
   *0287 cubic inch mercury equal in weight to 387 cubic inch water.
   •0108 cubic inch glass raised 3° 045 takes as much heat as 0313 cubic
      inch water raised 0°54.
   •0287 cubic inch mercury raised 3°045 takes as much heat as 387 cubic
      inch water raised 0° 101.
   •0313 cubic inch water raised 0°54 takes as much heat as is required to
      raise 1 cubic inch 0°-0169.
    387 cubic inch water raised 0°-101 takes as much heat as is required to
      raise l cubic inch 0°0391.
    The entire bulb of the thermometer thus raised 3° 045 is thus
 equal to 1 cubic inch of water raised 0169-1-'0391=0°.056.
    Now the transverse section of bulb is 0.138 square inch; and
 since specific gravity of ice is 0.93, and it requires 140° to melt
 ice, we have 140 x 0.738 x 0.93 x         a- 3-045; hence ac-0-00312
 inch, the thickness of ice melted by the sun in 100 seconds,
 when r=10°.          This is equivalent to 0-001872 inch in 1 minute.

502                    Mr.   J. J. Waterstom              on Solar Radiation.
With r=20°              the thickness would be double this amount, and so
on.   Thus the presumed extra atmospheric value of r being 67°
gives 00124 inch thickness melted per minute.
   From June to December the amount may be expected to vary
Tººth, corresponding to alteration of sun’s distance. In Her
schel’s ‘Meteorology’ the probable thickness is stated to be
•0109 inch.
    § 8.        If the law
                   indicated by straight lines on the chart is true,
it would require                                   to give the extra
                             extremely accurate observations
atmospheric constant of solar radiation with precision*. From a
single observation made in Bombay some years ago, am disposed                            I
to believe it may exceed 67° considerably.
   $ 9. The mode of approaching the law of absorption is as fol
lows:—Project the values of r as ordinates to the secants of
zenith distances as abscissae: the resulting curve is evidently
hyperbolic in character.                       If
                                it is the conic hyperbola, the reci
procals of the ordinates laid off to the same abscissae should
range in a straight line. The obvious plan is therefore to lay
 off the reciprocals of r in this way, and see how far their range
 agrees with the straight; and if it differs, the character of the
 divergence might lead us to the true function that expresses
 the natural law, if it was not very complicated, and if the
 condition of the atmosphere did not vary so rapidly as to
obscure          it.
   The observations, though taken under unfavourable conditions,
favour the simple hyperbolat.
   § 10. It will be remarked, on inspecting the Chart, that the
value of r at the same altitude of the sun diminishes with the
declination as the season advances.  If continuous observations
were possible for a few hours each day, when the altitude of the
sun ranged between 15° and 45°, we might expect to see the
projection of the equalized observations range each day in a
different line; but these lines ought      converge    nearly         all    to                    on
the same  point              in

may imagine the sun’s rays to pass through a similarly con
stituted atmosphere in which the thickness of the same layers
proportionally diminishes from unity or radius to zero.       The
reciprocal of r diminishes for values below radius at the same

greater than in the other. In the same way we might compute
the potential temperature of an angular space occupied by many
thousand flames placed one behind the other, extending in a line
from the observer, and probably we should find it cumulative in
the ratio of the number of flames.

                         have made on gas-flames with the radia
tion-meter, fig. 1, it would seem to require about 4000 bat's-
wing flames ranged behind each other to give a potential equal
to that of the sun.
     If
      the upper radiating matter of the sun is in any degree
transparent or permeable to radiation from lower strata, it is
obvious that the actual-
                          temperature may thus be much below
the potential.

     § 25. The factor K contains only magnitudes which   relate to
the normal condition of the gas, and is therefore only a constant
dependent on the nature of the gas under consideration. Accord
ingly, the form of the last equation enables us at once to draw
two general conclusions.
     First. For a 9given value o dt , the conduction of heat increases
                                 dx
with the temperature which the gas has at the place under consi
deration.  This increase takes place in the same ratio as the
increase in the velocity of sound by rise of temperature, namely,
proportionally to the quantity    1 +              v                 at.
   Secondly. The conduction    heat           of
                                      not affected                                                  by       the pressure
                                                       is of is
to   which the gas      is   exposed.         This                   explained                  by      the circum
stance that, although the number      molecules which can convey
                                                                is

creased pressure, the distances traversed     the individual mole           by

   The complete numerical determination of these values requires
that the factor e should be known.     A direct theoretical calcu
lation of this quantity, according to the principles developed
above, is not possible, because for this it is necessary to know
the radius of the sphere of action p. We must therefore make
use of other data for the determination of e.  Maxwell has calcu
lated the mean   length  of excursion of the molecules from the
result of experiments on the friction of air in motion and on the
diffusion of gases, and in both cases has arrived at figures which
do not differ much from

This calculation leads therefore to a conducting-power for heat
which is 1400 times smaller than that of lead.*.
     Ifthis number can but lay claim to a small degree of accu
 racy, so that it can only be regarded as an approximation to the
 truth, we may at least regard it as proved that the conducting
power of gases for heat, which can be theoretically deduced from
the hypotheses respecting the molecular motions of gases which
lie at the foundation of this memoir, is much less than that of
the metals—a result which entirely accords with observation.
The objection that this hypothesis involved so rapid a distribu
tion of heat that local differences of temperature within the gas
are impossible, is accordingly completely without foundation.
We may even quote, as a fresh argument in favour of this hypo
thesis, the very phenomenon which has been urged with such
particular emphasis against                         it.

 antimony or sulphur be present, the colour is somewhat masked
 and a dull-coloured white lead is produced. That the presence
 of iron has nothing whatever to do with this appearance, is mani
fest from the fact that the lead containing only an inappreciable
 trace of copper which gave pure white corrosions, contained quite
 as much iron as the specimens which afforded pink corrosions.
    Proceeding upon the results given above, Derbyshire lead,
which, when properly smelted, contains from 2 ozs. to 5 ozs. of
copper per ton, was crystallized three or four times and pro
duced remarkably pure lead.         Numerous analyses have con
firmed the fact          in  #.
                             dealing with a metal containing up to
5 ozs. or perhaps 7 ozs. per ton, the copper is always concen
trated along with the silver. But a most remarkable fact was
discovered upon applying this method of purification to lead
containing above 10 ozs, of copper per ton.
    Five tons of lead, containing 0.0774 per cent. of copper, or
25 ozs. per ton, were submitted to Pattinson's process.      At the
fourth  operation      following  was the distribution of copper in

   The method here described may be used in many cases, but it
requires that the introduction and removal of the apparatus from
the furnace takes place without detriment to the operation. I
have devised another apparatus, which has the advantage over
this of always remaining in one place, and of serving as often as
necessary to measure the variable temperatures of the same fur
nace.  I proposed to employ it in determining the temperatures
at which enamels and the different kinds of painting on porcelain
are baked at the Imperial Manufactory of Sèvres.
   The apparatus consists of a tube, A B, fig. 7, of wrought
iron, the length of which varies according to the extent of the
space whose mean temperature is to be determined.   Its internal
diameter varies from 2 to 5 centimetres; it is more when the
tube is somewhat long. This tube is closed at both ends by
iron discs which are screwed and braced, each of which is pro
vided with an iron capillary tube a b, c d passing through the
side EE' of the furnace.   To construct these tubes, a very soft
and frequently reheated soft iron cylinder, perforated by a lon
gitudinal aperture 3 or 4 millims. in diameter, is drawn out in
the drawing-frame.     Each of these capillary tubes terminates
outside the furnace in a three-way stopcock, R. R. By means of
the stopcock R, the large tube A B can be successively connected
with either of the two tubulures e and f. By the stopcock R'
the same tube communicates with either of the tubulures g, h.
The metallic tubulure h is soldered to the end of a copper tube
C, filled with oxide of copper.
   When the temperature of the furnaces is to be determined at
a given  moment, the stopcocks R and R' are placed in the posi
tions represented by fig. 7; by means of a caoutchouc tube, the
tubulure   f
           is connected with an apparatus which furnishes a
constant supply of dried and purified hydrogen; the hydrogen
expels the     air   of
                 the tube      through the tubulure
                                     A
                                     B                 which                      g,
remains open. The disengagement         hydrogen  ofcontinued                is
until the air     completely expelled: any oxide which might

exist on the inner side of the tube A B will be reduced to the
 metallic state.
    The stopcock R is then turned into the position 2 (fig. 8), the
hydrogen-apparatus is detached from the tubulure f, and the
tubulure e is connected with an apparatus which disengages,
when convenient, dry air with a velocity which can be regulated.
This apparatus, represented by fig. 9, consists of a tubulated
flask V, into which water passes from a higher reservoir X,
through a leaden tube a b, provided with a stopcock r, by which
the flow of water can be regulated. The air of the flask V traverses
a tube c d, filled with pumice saturated with strong sulphuric
acid.   When the stopcock r" is closed, the air in the flask V is
under a higher pressure than that of the atmosphere, for it sup
ports in addition the pressure of the column of water a b.
    Thus, when the temperature of the furnace is to be determined,
the tube A B is filled with hydrogen under the pressure of the
atmosphere Ho, and at the unknown temperature w.             Further, the
copper tube C, filled with oxide of copper, is heated to redness by
a row of gas-burners; lastly,                   its
                                      second tubulure,    communicates             i,
with     U-tube,
           a       filled with  pumice   saturated with sulphuric acid,
and which has been previously weighed. The stopcock                                                 R      is

542                 M. H. Karsten on the Oridation of Gaseous
carbonic acid, gaseous hydrocarbons and other volatile products,
as yet for the most part only imperfectly known.      When oxygen
is completely excluded, they remain unchanged under water +.
   After the completion of my former investigation, it still re
mained to determine the manner in which the gaseous hydro
carbons produced by the process of putrefaction, and the other
gaseous and solid organic bodies (odorous substances, &c.) which
are also present in the air, behave when they are diffused through
the atmosphere—a problem of the greatest importance in relation
to the vital process of the animal organism.
   The results of my former experiments rendered it probable
that these hydrocarbons would be acted on by contact with free
oxygen in the same way as others, but it still seemed desirable
to confirm this supposition by experiment.
    Two methods presented themselves for the attainment of this
object, which, as supplementary to each other, required both to
 be carried out.
    In the first place, atmospheric air which still contains volatile
hydrocarbons, when passed through a series of vessels filled alter
mately with air and with lime-water, must give up carbonic acid
to the lime-water until                 all
                                 the hydrocarbons contained             are                in   it

                     be                                       those which
follow,     the

     In the second place,        atmospheric air laden with hydro
                                        if
carbons       heated

thus freed from carbonic acid,           ought not it   deposit anythingto

precautions already indicated, the closest observation could not
detect any evolution of gas; evidently no formation of carbonate
of lime had taken place.               -

                   and the Phenomena which attend them.                     547
   Not insisting here on the discussion and study of these inves
tigations, from which it results that the aurora is an electro
atmospheric phenomenon,            I
                                will simply call attention to the fact
that it is satisfactorily accounted for by admitting, in conformity
with the data furnished by direct observation, that, the waters of
the ocean being continually charged with positive electricity, the
vapours which arise from them act as a conductor of this electri
city as far as the upper strata of the atmosphere, where, carried
towards the polar regions by the trade-winds, they form as it
were a positive envelope to the earth, which itself remains charged
with negative electricity. But the earth and the highly rarefied
air of the elevated atmospheric regions being perfect conductors,
they may be regarded as forming the two conducting-plates of a
condenser, of which the insulating stratum is the inferior por
tion of the atmosphere. The two antagonistic electricities must
then necessarily be condensed by their mutual influence in those
portions of the atmosphere and of the earth to which they are
the nearest, consequently in the regions near the poles, and there
neutralize themselves in the form of discharges more or less fre
quent as soon as their tension reaches the limit which it cannot
exceed.       These discharges should take place almost simulta
neously at the two poles, since the earth being a perfect con
ductor, the electric tension should be nearly the same at each;
there can only be differences in the intensity of the discharges
in one region and the other, and from one instant to another in
the same region, since the resistance of the stratum of air which
separates the two electricities must constantly vary from sundry
causes.     It is evident, too, that the neutralization of the opposite
electricities would not be effected instantaneously, but, consider
ing the low conducting-power of the medium through which it
takes place, by successive discharges more or less continuous and
variable in intensity.
   These principles admitted,                I
                                         endeavoured to produce artifi

of   strong electro-magnets             on
                                       luminous electric discharges          in
 highly rarefied air—an influence which explains that              of
                                                                terrestrial
magnetism          on
                    the aurora. The magnetic and electric pheno

                                                                   be

and by Mr. Loomis in America, show that these currents vary
every moment during the appearance of an aurora, not only in
intensity, but also in direction, flowing sometimes from N. to
 S.,  sometimes from                S.          N.

take   place   simultaneously        the two terrestrial poles, and which
                                              at

   But what is still more remarkable is what takes place in the
contrary case, that in which, as happens in nature, negative
electricity comes in by the soft iron which represents the terres
trial pole, and the positive by the metal ring which represents the
atmosphere.     In order that the discharge may be well seen, the
air must not be so rarefied as in the preceding case; if it is too
much so, a little air may be introduced by means of a cock
placed for this purpose, or better still a few drops of water, which
evaporate, until a single jet is at first observed; then at the
moment the soft iron is magnetized the jet commences to rotate
and to throw off a multitude of brilliant little jets issuing from
the luminous ring which surrounds the end of the soft iron, and
terminating in the metallic circle. These jets are equidistant,
and perfectly distinct from each other, like the spokes of a wheel,
and turn with more or less rapidity.      We have here a perfectly
faithful representation  of what takes place in the aurorae boreales
when the auroral arcs send out luminous jets into the high regions
of the atmosphere. It is a very remarkable fact that the produc
tion of these jets can only occur when the current is directed from
the circumference to the centre, as in the natural phenomenon, in
which the discharge takes place from the atmosphere to the earth.
None are to be seen when the current is directed from the centre
to the circumference; there are then but two concentric arcs,
one of a rosy red round the soft iron, the other violet which
envelopes the metallic ring; the two separated by a perfectly
obscure annular space.
   Looking now at the galvanometer 10 or 12 metres off, where
terminate the wires which separate the metallic plates fixed on
the moistened bands of the sphere which represents the earth, we
shall make the following observations.
   The sphere is divided by the equatorial band of paper into two
hemispheres, each of which has a magnetic pole, and which we
will style northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere. We
at first place the two metallic plates whence proceed the wires
connected with the galvanometer, at a little distance from each
other, on the same side of the equator, on the moistened band
which extends like a meridian from one pole to the other. If
the discharge takes place at the north pole, the needle of the gal
                                                                       70

 from the N. to the S. It is essential that care be taken, before
 exhibiting this second derived current, to assure oneself that the
 metallic plates have lost the secondary polarities which they had
 derived from the effect of the first.       For these polarities give
 rise of themselves to a current     moving   likewise from the S. to
 the N., since it is the contrary of that which has produced them.
 This current is added to that which is derived from the altera
 tion of the position of the discharge, and greatly augments                                                               its

part in the currents of telegraphic wires.                                Therefore,          although
proceeding from the same cause, these two kinds of phenomena,
notwithstanding that they are subject to the same general varia
tions, present remarkable differences in their phases.
     Iwill add that I have failed to discover how it is that, under
conditions apparently perfectly identical, the discharge takes
place at one of the poles sooner than at the other,            what                          or,        is
still more remarkable, why, after occurring for some time          one                             at

   The following communications were read:—
   1. “On     some Remains    of Chiton from the Mountain-limestone
of Yorkshire.”    By J. W.  Kirkby, Esq.
   These remains consist of eight separate plates of four species of
Chiton, found by Mr. Burrow, of Settle, in the Lower Scar Lime
stone of that neighbourhood.       These new species, determined by
Mr. Kirkby, are Chiton Burrowianus, Kirkby, Ch. coloratus, Kirkby,
two species undetermined, and a trace of Chitonellus (?). These
appear to be the first Chitons observed in the Carboniferous Lime
stone of England; but fourteen others, and a Chitonellus, have been
found in strata of the same age in Belgium and elsewhere, and have
been described by Münster, De Koninck, and De Ryckholt.
   2. “On some Fossil Reptilia, of the Order Ganocephala, from the
Coal-measures of the South Joggins, Nova Scotia.”         By Professor
Owen, F.R.S., F.G.S.
   The specimens described in this communication were (together
with remains of Xylobius and Pupa) obtained by Dr. Dawson, F.G.S.,
in 1861, from two fossil stumps of trees, and were referred to in his
communication read before the Society on November 6, 1861. Pro
fessor Owen has determined among the specimens submitted to him
the following small Reptilian forms—Hylonomus Lyelli, Dawson,
H. aciedentatus, Dawson, H. Wymanni, Dawson, Hylerpeton Daw
soni (nov. gen. et sp.), Owen, and Dendrerpeton Acadianum, Owen.
   3. “On     the Occurrence    of Mesozoic and Permian     Faunae  in
Eastern Australia.”     By the Rev. W. B. Clarke, F.G.S.
   Mr. W. P. Gordon having been requested by the Rev. W. B.
Clarke to search for fossils in his neighbourhood (between the
Balonne and Maranoa Rivers) and in the Fitzroy Downs, Queens
land, was successful in making a large collection of specimens at the
Wollumbilla Creek. These he sent to Mr. Clarke, who forwarded
them to Professor M'Coy, at Melbourne, for his examination. They
prove to be chiefly of Lower Mesozoic genera; there are also a few
(from the Fitzroy Downs, about thirteen miles to the N.W.) which be
long to lower beds. Some fossils long since obtained from the Man
tuan Downs (200 miles N. of Wollumbilla) prove to be of Permian
character (Aulosteges or Strophalosia).    Productus and Cyathocrinus
(Carboniferous?) have been met with on the Dawson River.
   Mr. Clarke considers his unfossiliferous Wianamatta Beds, above
the coal-measures, near Sydney, as being probably the equivalent of
the fossiliferous strata at Wollumbilla Creek.      Professor M'Coy
regards the latter as belonging to the same formation as the coal
beds with Glossopteris.    The fossils are included in the Catalogue
of the Products of New South Wales for exhibition in London in
1862.

  4.    “On       the Foot-print of an Iguanodon, lately found at Hastings.”
By A. Tylor, Esq., F.G.S.
   After alluding to former accounts of fossil foot-prints (and natural
casts of foot-prints) found in the cliffs near Hastings, and having
stated that Dr. Harwood in 1846 suspected these prints to have been
due to the Iguanodon, the author described a large three-toed foot
print, 21 inches long, by 94 in width, lately exposed by a fall at
East Cliff. A cast of this print was exhibited by Mr. C.         Mann.                  J.
Mr.  Tylor   alluded to Professor Owen's  figure  of the bones of the
three-toed foot of an Iguanodon as illustrative of a foot capable of
producing such imprints as those referred to.        The author then
showed, by a newly constructed section of the Hastings coast, that
the foot-prints occur in at least two zones of the Wealden beds,-
one of them being just above the chief sandstone (or Castle Sand
rock) of Hastings, and dipping down to the west on the top of the
Bexhill cliffs; the other zone being about 100 feet below, as already
pointed out by Mr. Beckles, near Lee Ness.

     ON THE FREEZING                    OF SALINE           solutions.                   BY DR. RüDoRFF.
   The author showed in a previous communication that pure ice is
formed by the freezing of saline solutions, and that some salts affect
the freezing-point of the water in which they are dissolved as an
hydrous salts, others as salts containing water.    M. Dufour tried to
prove, in a paper which appeared simultaneously, that the ice
which separates from a saline solution contains salt which separates
in the solid form at the same time as the ice. The well-known fact,
that the proportion of salt contained in ice so formed is always
smaller than that contained in the original saline solution, and that
it is smaller the slower has been the formation of the ice, is explained
by M. Dufour by supposing that the remaining solution redissolves
the salt which separates out with the ice. The following experi
ments afford, however, an additional proof that the salt contained in
ice produced in this way is due to a portion of the solution adhering
to it or being enclosed by                   a it.
     It   well known that
          is                   solution      the magnificent dichroic of
double salt, the platinocyanide        magnesium,     perfectly colour
                                                           of                            is
less.     If
          such    solution
                         a     allowed     freeze, the resulting ice
                                             is                      to                                               is
equally free from colour.      At last, when the quantity
                                                                                                             no of

                    in     ice      great that the remainder
                                        of        is   so        longer
suffices    retain the whole quantity
                to                            salt    solution, the ice   of             in
begins    get coloured red and green from the separation
               to                                               crystals                                of
of salt.
  The following experiment proves                               a in      still more striking manner
that salt does not separate out from              saline solution a         solid form             in

a degree below their freezing-points, which had been approximately
ascertained by preliminary experiments, and then, by means of a
small piece of ice, he occasioned a slight freezing of the solutions.
In these, as in his former experiments, it was observable that the
lowering of the freezing-point was in a certain manner proportional
to the quantity of salt dissolved, if it is assumed that in some solu
tions the salt is dissolved in the anhydrous, and in others in the
hydrated state.   For instance, solutions of hydrochloric acid contain
the  compound    HCl--12 HO; solutions of sulphuric acid, the
compound SO3 + 10HO ; of chloride of copper, CuCl-H 12HO;
of protochloride of manganese, Mn Cl-H 12 HO; of caustic soda,
NaO +4HO ; of caustic potash, KO-F5HO ; of ammonia, NH4O
+2HO.
   Experiments with solutions of chloride of copper showed that
solutions  containing less than 20 per cent. of chloride of copper
hold in solution the compound CuCl4-12 HO, and solutions con
taining more of the copper-salt the compound CuCl4-4HO.
   This change in the constitution of the solution, which is recog
nizable by means of the freezing-points, is accompanied also by a
change in the colour of the solutions,—those which contain the salt
CuCl-F 12 HO being blue, while those which contain CuCl-H4HO
are green.   The author had previously detected a similar case of
change in the constitution of a saline solution, unaccompanied, it is
true, by change of colour, in the case of chloride of sodium, which
dissolves at common temperatures as an anhydrous salt, but below
 –9°C. is contained in solution in combination with 4 equivalents
of water.
   The experiments with solutions of sulphuric acid show that they
contain the compound SO"+10HO.          It is proved by experiments
on the electric conducting power of liquids that both water and
anhydrous sulphuric acid are exceedingly bad conductors of elec
tricity, but that a good conductor is formed by the combination of
the two; the compound which offers the smallest resistance to the
passage of electricity     is,
                           however, not the first hydrate, nor even
the second, but, according     Wiedemann's determinations, the one

  The most important class       minerals containing niobium are the
                                      of
columbites, which appear         to
                              occur    nature much more plentifully

than the other niobiferous compounds, most       which are still among
                                                          of

M. Wornum and afterwards     by M. Peretz. Subsequently, through
the liberality of M. von Samarski, the author was enabled to have
the analysis repeated by Mr. Chandler, according to improved
methods.
  Hitherto Samarskite has been found only in the Ilmen Mountains,
near Miask, in the Ural.  It is indisputably in  original condition,              its

external appearance, but, nevertheless, alters      density       very                its               in   a

    Fergusonite contains, besides hyponiobic acid and small quantity                        a
 of  oxide       uranium, zirconic acid, not, however,
                of                                                   any notable            to

                                                         of
 yttria, small quantity

    Seeing that the atomic constitution                                 of
                                                     zirconic acid differs from
 that       hyponiobic acid, we cannot assume that the bases are com
           of

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                                            563
bined in the same ratio with both acids.       With the hyponiobic acid,
the bases are not combined to a neutral salt, as in the columbites
and in Samarskite, but they form a basic salt wherein the oxygen of
the bases amounts to two-thirds of that of the acid.            With the
zirconic  acid, on the other   hand,   the bases are combined in such
proportion that the oxygen contained in them is equal to that con
tained in the acid, thus again forming a basic salt.
   It was announced some time ago by A. E. Nordenskjöld that a
mineral similar to the Fergusonite of Greenland occurred, together
with yttrotantalites (which contain tantalic acid and not hyponiobic
acid), at Ytterby in Sweden.      This Fergusonite contains, according
to  Nordenskjöld,   no zirconic  acid;   and its specific gravity, namely
4'89, is also considerably lower than that of the Greenland mineral.
The Fergusonite of Ytterby is the only mineral hitherto found in
Sweden which contains niobium.
    Tyrite.—This mineral has been supposed to be identical with
Fergusonite; but a carefully conducted analysis by Potyka has proved
that it consists of hyponiobic acid in combination essentially with
yttria and potash. Besides hyponiobic acid, the only acids contained
in it are very small quantities of zirconic, tungstic, and stannic
acids; but, in addition to the bases already mentioned, it contains
protoxide of uranium, protoxide of cerium, and lime in somewhat con
siderable quantities, together with very small quantities of the oxides
of lead, copper, and iron (but not of manganese), and an equally small
quantity of magnesia. The oxygen of the bases taken together is to
that of the acids as 1 : 1; and this ratio remains essentially the same if
the mineral is supposed to contain, in place of protoxide, sesquioxide
of uranium, this compound being regarded as an acid capable of
replacing hyponiobic acid—an assumption which the composition of
 Samarskite justifies.   But if the mineral may be regarded as a basic
salt, it is not a simple, but a double salt; for potash and yttria
cannot mutually replace each other in combination.         Tyrite consists
 therefore essentially of basic  hyponiobate    of yttria and basic hypo
niobate of  potash.
   Tyrite contains, further,      a somewhat considerable quantity of water,
which, as obtained by distillation, contains a little sulphuretted
hydrogen, and is milky from the presence of sulphur suspended in                                         it.
This    no
        doubt arises from    tracea   enclosed iron-pyrites.ofStill,
notwithstanding the water contained         the mineral  appears  in   it,                               to
 be   essentially undecomposed.
   In the niobiferous minerals which have been examined, the hypo
niobic acid     combined with strong bases
               is                                 various proportions.       in
