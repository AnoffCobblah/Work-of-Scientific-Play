behind a small hole in the shutter of a carefully darkened room,
an inverted image of external objects is at once obtained which
possesses, in great perfection, many of the desired properties. We
have here absolute faithfulness to nature; pictures at once of
near and of distant objects, a field of vision as near to 180° as
we please, and either a plane or a curved image.       The expense
of such an apparatus is small enough, and        convenience indis                   its
putable:       short, the picture obtained fails only

    silver plates, coated with iodine, were alone employed; and the

     ever, stepped         in
                       with more   efficient means,  and  Prof. Petzval,

     about constructing his first object-glass, destined principally for
     portrait-taking.

                      to                                minimum. The              to

                                    of
     the focal length may vary; the achromatism depends                   the                                on

                                   their surfaces.    The three conditions,
     therefore, can            be
                         fulfilled                 by

however,         will result from employing two converging lenses
 instead of one. These lenses must of course be achromatic; and
 by theory, in order that a good image may be produced, they
 must be separated from each other by a distance not less than
 one-third of the focal length of the lens next the object. In
 order to form the eight requisite elements, therefore, seven lens
 surfaces and one distance may be selected.                  By this selection
 the first lens need but present three surfaces to be disposed                                                        of,

Calc-spar and Glauconite found by him at Nágpur: the two mi
nerals mutually penetrate each other, the calc-spar giving a form

space, it is not a little surprising that an explanation of the cor
relation of the several forces should not have been sought for in

urged that if the smallvibrations of the aether are always composite,
 and this property explains the composition of light, there ought
 to be some indication of the same property in aérial vibrations,
the aether having been assumed to be constituted like air.                                                     I
 believe, for reasons which follow, that such indication is given
by certain audible sounds, which have been named Tartini’s beats,
from their having been first discovered, or specially noticed, by
that musician. These beats are to be distinguished from the beats
of imperfect consonances, which are heard when the ratio of the
periods of vibration in two series of waves is a little different
from the ratio that produces harmony, whereas Tartini's beats
are best heard when the concord is most perfect.         This differ
ence was well understood by Smith (‘Harmonics,” Prop. XI.
 Schol. 3), who for distinction calls the latter “flutterings,” but
 appears to have noticed them only in sounding together notes
the ratio of whose times of vibration was expressed by numbers
too high for musical harmony. When the ratio is that of two
low numbers, as 3 and 5, the “flutterings” of Smith become
“ the grave harmonic” of Tartini.          Recently, Professor De
Morgan, in the Cambridge Philosophical Transactions (vol. x.
part 1. p. 136), has proposed to explain the grave harmonic by
a certain relation of the phases of the component vibrations, thus
making it dependent as to degree and quality on the manner in
which the aërial pulses are started.        But Tartini and other
musicians tell us that if  only the condition of perfect consonance
is fulfilled, the grave harmonic is always equally heard.     There
 is,therefore, still something      account for. The explanation

the composition of the two resultants                                 is   a    harmony, more or less
agreeable, according to the simplicity    of the ratio of the values
of A. This   effect,  it appears,  is independent   of the resulting
phases.   But the    component    vibrations of each note may also
be grouped according to the values of c; and assuming these
values to be quam provime consecutive, the number of the groups
may be very numerous; and       two may be selected, one from each
set, such that the maxima or    minima of their condensations shall
be very  nearly  coincident at equidistant  points along the line of
propagation.    The resultant of these two groups will stand out
by this circumstance from       the other resultants  alltwo groups;                       of

 object of the present paper to examine a few of the peculiarities
  of submarine cables in general, and the Atlantic Cable in par
 ticular, together with the electrical appliances employed for the
 latter, with a view of ascertaining, if possible, the suitability of
 the means to the end, and thence drawing some practical con                   -
 clusions, which it is hoped may serve for future guidance.
     In order to do this, we must take a brief view of the different
 conditions and functions of atmospheric and subaqueous lines,
 and the phaenomena to which they give rise."

     With a freely-insulated atmospheric wire, that is to say, with
 a wire suspended in the air by insulating supports, after the
 manner of our ordinary telegraph wires, the study of the phae
 momena developed in working through it is comparatively
 simple, and the laws easily deducible. They resolve themselves
 principally into the relation between the electro-motive force
 of the battery, and the resistance of the wire through which
 the current has to pass.                  I
                                    use the term resistance because it
 is a more    significant   term than the converse one of conducting
 power. It was formerly the custom to designate metals con
 ductors of electricity; and so they are to a certain extent, but
 they are     all
                relatively           so,

mass and conducting power to a copper wire of No. 15 or 16 wire
gauge, the size of tolerably stout bell wire. This is not so thick
as would be used on overland lines if copper were employed
instead of iron. Now even with the best insulation, and the
most favourable conditions of which these overland wires are sus
ceptible, it is found that currents of high intensity are constantly
required in long lines; yet it appears extraordinary that this fact
should have been overlooked in the determination of the size of
the Atlantic wire, placed as it is under conditions which tend to
divert the electrical effects of the currents through every inch of
 itslength.

quite practicable, another disadvantage presents itself, viz. the
necessity     adapting the recording instruments

       From    a   careful consideration               of   this instrument and its effects,
 it appears      me open
                   to          many objections, both

 from my own form           the induction coil, was prepared

    workmen employed, might fall very far short of what was ori
     ginally expected.        Indeed the induction coil is an instrument
    the success of which depends so much upon the experience de
     rived in the course of repeated manufacture, that the greatest
    wonder is that Mr. Whitehouse's coils have succeeded at all
     under such disadvantageous circumstances.               They possess the
     elements of enormous power, if judiciously arranged and con
     structed; but since they give such unmistakeable evidence of de
    fective construction, it would be hardly fair to attribute their
     present failure to a faulty arrangement.                                I

    ever, from stating my general objection to every portion of the
    plan upon which they are made.             One peculiarity in particular,
    which renders them totally unfit for the purpose for which they
    are intended, is that the secondary current is deficient in inten
    sity, and that             its
                            quantitative effects are not only far too great
    for the required purpose, but the current itself, instead                 being                  of
    abrupt and instantaneous, possesses             amount      anduration quite     of
    incompatible with the rapid reiteration             signals.         some ex

                        Mr.   J.   N. Hearder          on the        Atlantic Cable.                              41
    Bearing in mind the tiny character of the Atlantic wire, one
is  irresistibly  led to inquire what end such a battery as this was
destined to accomplish, and whether the same end might not
have been attained by much smaller means.
    Its object, then, is not to generate a current of electricity to
be passed through the cable, but through the primary wires of
the induction coil, in order to excite magnetism in             iron core;                       its
and    it
       is   the  magnetism     thus excited which has          react upon                   to
the secondary coil, and generate the current            electricity which          of
is    to   employed for working through the cable. The electrician
            be
will not fail here       predicate many chances
                               to                      loss      power,            of            of
the conditions requisite for developing the greatest amount                                                       of if

to submarine cables, to be highly objectionable.        The employment
of a return   wire,  especially of  large  conducting    capacity, would
prevent much of the inductive action which now takes place
between the inner conductor (the wire) and the outer conductor
(the sea).      I believe also that a current of moderate quantity
and high tension, such as is developed in my own form of the
induction coil (Phil. Mag. Dec. 1856), would be far better cal
culated to overcome the difficulties met with in the Atlantic or
other submarine cables, than the contrivances           which have been
hitherto adopted.

   Although the garnets are here fre
quently an inch in diameter, yet the cry
stals which have been metamorphosed
are those of about the size of a pea,
and the altered crystals occur only on
the exterior of the rock,-the modifying
agent, here evidently external, not having
penetrated above three inches in depth:
 taking this into consideration, along with
the situation of the crystals, and seeing that the chief change from
an almadine garnet to chlorite consists in a diminution of silica,
increase of magnesia, and addition of water, we may conclude
that the change has been due to the action of the sea.

HAYº.    of  those
                  during the last four
                     small eddies
                                          years studied the phaenomena
                                    of wind   common in many parts of
Australia   during    the summer    months,    and having deduced prin
ciples which are, I believe, applicable to the solution of all, or
nearly all, circular movements of the atmosphere,           I   am induced
to  lay the results of   my  observations before    your  Society,  hoping
that   they  may tend to clear     up   some of the doubts entertained
concerning the origin of circular winds.
   Lying, as Melbourne does, within the limits of one of the
great hurricane tracks, the subject is one of great importance;
and even if the opinions         I am about to lay before you prove
erroneous, still good must ensue from the attention of your
                                                              -
 Society being directed to the subject.
   The small eddies of air of common occurrence in this colony,
are examples of the simplest form of a whirlwind. Taking them,
therefore, as a starting-point,      I shall propose a theory to account
for their violence and circular      action, and then seek to apply the
 same to the elucidation of the grander convulsions of the at
 mosphere.
   Much of my reasoning must of necessity be from analogy;

 carry     up  render their       upward     spiral   motion very conspicuous.
 The columns sometimes remain stationary, but generally they
 have  a   regular horizontal movement.                 Clouds        dust envelope   of
 their  base,   out    of which    they   rise        considerable height, often

trade-winds are affected. Thus, suppose the cyclone A origi
mates a few degrees south of the equator, and B and C are
currents of air moving towards it in opposite directions. The
course of the current B is from south to north; but inasmuch
as the parallels of the earth’s surface, over which it moves,                                            in
crease in velocity as it approaches the equator, and it does not
acquire this accelerated motion, it lags behind, and assumes a
direction west of the point towards which it is moving.
   The current C, on the contrary, is coming from regions
having a greater velocity than those at which it is constantly
arriving, so that it acquires an impetus towards the east; and
this impulse is sufficient to determine the direction of the rota
tion of the storm, which would otherwise be liable to take either
course indifferently.   In the northern hemisphere it is evident
that the rotation of the earth has an opposite effect upon the
meteor.
     As the cyclones progress                towards the poles, they rapidly                             in
crease in diameter                   and decrease in violence.   Thus, when                               a
hurricane is met with within the tropics, its diameter will not
exceed 300 miles; when it has reached the 50th parallel, it will
extend over 1500 miles.          It is not only the ascending column
of air that acquires the rotatory motion, but the whole of the
air moving towards it must partake of                            it,
                                                    and thus the dilatation
of  the whirl increases          long    asthe      as
                                                 cyclone  lasts.          pro            It     is

rotatory gales are experienced in Great Britain in the depth of
winter. These storms have, however, originated in warmer lati
tudes, and seem to follow down the course of the great Gulf
stream, the warmth of which is brought into greater contrast at
that season with the surrounding regions.          It must also be

the profession of               a    printer—a             profession
                                                   to which he became
ardently attached.      On Sir James Smith's recommendation, he
was apprenticed to Mr. Davis of Chancery Lane, London, a
printer of eminence, from whose press issued many scien
tific works of importance. During this period of his life, his
leisure hours seem to have been employed in the study not only
of the classics, but also of the mediaeval Latin and Italian authors,
especially the poets, of whose writings he formed a curious
collection.    From these, his “old dumps” as he was wont to
call them, he derived great pleasure to the last moments of his life.
He also became a proficient scholar in French, Flemish, Anglo
Saxon and several of the kindred Teutonic dialects,          a proficiency
which afterwards proved of eminent utility in his professional
career, by far the greater number of the Anglo-Saxon works, and
works connected with that branch of literature, published in
London during the last forty years, having issued from his press.
    On the expiration of his apprenticeship, he carried on business
for a short time in Chancery Lane, in partnership with a Mr.
Wilks; but on his birthday in the year 1803, at the age of
twenty-two, he established himself, in partnership with his
father, in Blackhorse Court, Fleet Street, from whence he soon
after removed to Shoe Lane, and subsequently to Red Lion
Court.     His press speedily became the medium through which

       In
      the year 1807 he became a Fellow of the Linnaean Society,
 and at the anniversary of 1810 he was elected Under-Secretary,
 an office which he retained for nearly half a century, and in
 which he earned for himself the cordial esteem and good-will of
 every member of the Society. In his Diary, under date of
 the anniversary of 1849, he notes that he had “served with
 M“Leay, Bicheno, Dr. Boott, and Mr. Bennett, under the suc
 cessive presidencies of the founder Sir                    J.

 and dear friend of my parents and my warm friend), of the
 Earl of Derby, the Duke of Somerset, and my excellent friend
 Dr. Stanley, Bishop of Norwich.” To the names of the Presi
 dents he might subsequently have added those of Mr. Brown
 and Mr. Bell; and he must have felt, though he was too modest
 himself to note it down, how highly he was esteemed by them

   For many years he represented the ward of Farringdon
Without (in which his business premises were situated), in the
Common Council of the City of London, and constantly paid
 strict attention to his representative duties.         Of     the objects                  all

 intercourse with the world, and the natural benevolence                his                              of

upward and outward pressure on beds originally horizontal or nearly
horizontal.   For in all such mountains there are found to exist some
stony layers dipping at 10°, 15°, 25°, or even higher angles; and
according to the assumed law, such an inclined position of the beds
must have been acquired subsequently to their origin.
   After giving a brief sketch of the controversy respecting “Craters
of Elevation,” the author describes the results of his recent visit
(October, 1857) to Mount Etna, in company with Signor Gaetano
G. Gemmellaro, and his discovery there of modern lavas, some of
known date, which have formed continuous beds of compact stone
on slopes of 15°, 36°, 38°, and, in the case of the lava of 1852, more
than 40°.    The thickness of these tabular layers varies from 1} foot
to 26 feet; and their planes of stratification are parallel to those of
the overlying and underlying scoriae which form part of the same
currents. The most striking examples of this phenomenon were
met   with—lst, at Aci Reale; 2ndly, in the ravine called the Cava
Grande near Milo, where a section of the lava of 1689 is obtained ;
3rdly, in the precipice at the head of the Val di Calamma, in the lava
of 1852–53; and 4thly, at a great height above the sea near the
base of the Montagnuola.
    Sir C. Lyell then alludes to the extraordinary changes which had
taken place in the scenery of the Walley of Calanna and the Val del
Bove since his former visit to Mount Etna in 1828—changes effected
by the eruption of 1852–53, one of the greatest recorded in history.
A brief account is given, extracted from contemporary narratives and
illustrated by a map, compiled with the assistance of Dr. Giuseppe
Gemmellaro, of the course taken in 1852–53 by various streams of
lava, some of them six miles in length, flowing during nine succes
sive months from the head of the Val del Bove to the suburbs of
Zafarana and Milo. The present aspect of this lava-field, parts of
it still hot and emitting vapour, and the numerous longitudinal ridges
and furrows on         its
                       surface are described.     As     the origin
                                                               to       these   of
superficial inequalities, the author inquires whether they may            due       be

                     lava      subterranean tunnels,

   The origin            of
                       the Val del Bove has been variously ascribed                                                   to
engulfment, explosion, and aqueous erosion. Admitting the probable
               ofthe two first causes, the author calls attention

Joule, LL.D., F.R.S. &c.
   A résumé of the greater part of this paper has already appeared
in the ‘ Proceedings’ for January 29, June 18, and November 26,
 1857. The author has since examined the expansion by heat of
wood cut across the grain, which, as well as that cut in the direction
of the fibre, he finds to be increased by tension and decreased by
moisture. When a sufficient quantity of water has been absorbed
the expansibility by heat ceases, and wood is contracted in each di
rection by rise of temperature. Nevertheless, when wood, saturated
with water, is weighed in water of different temperatures, the result
shows cubical expansion of the substance of the wood by heat. The
inference drawn by the author from these facts    that the contraction          is,
 of   the dimensions          of   wet wood         is   owing         to   the action            of     heat       in      di
minishing the force  capillary attraction, and that thus the walls

    These reactions succeed without much difficulty. On submitting
 carbanilide and sulphocarbanilide to the action of agents capable of
 fixing aniline (anhydrous phosphoric acid, chloride of zinc, and even
hydrochloric acid gas), the former yields cyanate of phenyle, a sub
stance which     Idiscovered many years ago among the products of
decomposition of oxamelanile”, while the latter furnishes a remark
able body, sulphocyanide of phenyle, which had not been previously
obtained.
    The general features of cyanate of phenyle having been delineated
in a former memoir, I have for the present been chiefly engaged with
the examination of sulphocyanide of phenyle.      This body, which is
readily obtained in a state of absolute purity by rectification over
anhydrous phosphoric acid, is a colourless transparent liquid of
1’ 135 density at 15°5, and of a perfectly constant boiling-point at
222°C. under a pressure of 0”762. The odour is aromatic and
pungent; it distantly resembles that of mustard; the body in
question is in fact the mustard                oil   of
                                      the phenyle-series.

of ethylene        ammonia, a short account of which I have lately

then working in my laboratory, to study the deportment of the same
bromide with aniline, a characteristic representative of the class of
primary monamines.         In the following pages                 I

                                             I
of a series of experiments which carried out myself after Mr. Bassett
by circumstances had been prevented from a further continuation of
the inquiry.
   A mixture of 1 volume of the bibromide of ethylene and 2 volumes
of aniline, when exposed to the temperature of boiling water for an
hour or two, solidifies into a crystalline mass of more or less solidity.
This mass is chiefly hydrobromate of aniline; it contains, however,
in addition, three new organic bases, partly free, partly in the form
of hydrobromates. These substances are formed in very different
quantities,    a beautiful crystalline body, difficultly soluble in alcohol,
being invariably the chief product of the reaction, while the two
other bases, the one solid but extremely soluble in alcohol, the other
likewise solid but quite insoluble in this liquid, are found to be pre
sent in much smaller proportions.
   The preparation, in a state of purity, of the principal product of
the reaction presents no difficulty.           The solid mass obtained by
digesting bibromide of ethylene and aniline in the stated propor
tions is mixed with water, and submitted to distillation, when any
bibromide left unchanged, together with some unaltered aniline, passes
over. The residuary liquid is then mixed with a strong solution of
potassa, which separates           all
                                   the bases existing       hydrobromates
                                                                      as                      in
the form of      semi-solid resin.
                   a                   This     washed with water and then
                                                    is
again submitted        distillation with water, when, together with more
                            to
 or less water,    additional quantity
                       an                     aniline distils. The residuary
                                                  of
mass, when treated with boiling (methylated) spirit, leaves the in
soluble base        white, flour-like powder, while the other two bases
                   as
                   a
dissolve. On cooling, the solution deposits          beautiful crystallization

the spirit.     The crystals are rather difficultly soluble           alcohol;     in
two    orthree crystallizations from this solvent render them absolutely
  ure.
   Thus obtained, the new base, for which,           accordance with the re

           On the Action      of  Bromide    of Ethylene upon Aniline.          67
in ether.       The solutions are without action on vegetable colours.
The      substance dissolves readily in hydrochloric, sulphuric and nitric
acids, especially on gently heating the liquids, which on cooling de
posit well crystallized saline compounds. The hydrochlorate yields
yellow precipitates with bichloride of platinum and terchloride of
gold. When exposed to the action of heat, ethylene-phenylamine
fuses at 148°C.; at a temperature approaching 300° it begins to boil
and to distil, the larger portion undergoing decomposition. Among
the products of decomposition which are not yet sufficiently exa
mined, considerable quantities of aniline make their appearance. The
 results obtained in the analysis of ethylene-phenylamine lead to the
 formula
                                      C, H, N
 as the simplest molecular expression for this compound.
      This formula is confirmed by the analysis of the hydrochlorate
 and of the platinum-salt, the preparation of which, on account of
  their instability, requires some management.
      These salts contain respectively
                    Hydrochlorate......... C, H, N, HCl.
                    Platinum-salt ......... C, H, N, HCl,        PtCl.
  The reaction which gives rise to ethylene-phenylamine is            expressed by
  the following equation:—

      What is the constitution of this new base? This question could not
   be answered without further experiments, on account of the twofold
   nature of bibromide of ethylene.           In many cases this remarkable
   compound exhibits the character of the hydrobromic ether of a
   biacid ethylene-alcohol, of (C, H,)"Br, whilst in the majority of re
   actions it splits into hydrobromic acid and the bromide C, H, Br,
   which might be considered as the hydrobromic ether of a monacid
   alcohol, C, H, O, homologous to allylic alcohol.            It remained there
   fore uncertain whether the new basic compound retained the original
   molecule (C, H,)" replacing 2 equivs. of hydrogen, or the modified
   molecule C, H, replacing 1 equiv. of hydrogen.              In other words, it
   had to be established by further experiments, whether the base was

The deportment of the substance with iodide of methyle and ethyle,
which immediately will be mentioned somewhat more in detail, has
decided in favour of the former view, and in accordance with it the
name of the substance has been selected.
     It         to be moticed, that there are already two other bases
          deserves
known which have exactly the same composition, the one obtained
by M. Natanson in the reaction of bichloride of ethylene upon aniline,
and described by him as acetylaniline, the other discovered by M.
Dusart among the derivatives of nitronaphtaline and designated as
phtalidine.   It is only necessary superficially to glance at the descrip
tion of these bodies in order to see that they are essentially different
from ethylene-phenylamine.       The constitution of acetylaniline and
phtalidine has not been experimentally fixed.         It is probable that
Natanson's base contains the molecule C, H, formerly called acetyle,
but for which the more appropriate term vinyle has lately been
proposed, while phtalidine probably derives from the hydrocarbon
styrole or an isomeric body, so that the difference in the constitution
of the three bodies would be expressed in the following formulae:—

  fortunately discovered other bones of the same animal; and these,
 having been compared with the remains in the Elgin collections,

 Red Sandstone,        or Devonian group,        the following being among the
 chief reasons for his adherence to this view.
     1st. That these sandstones have everywhere the same strike and
 dip  as  the inferior red sandstones containing Holoptychii and other
 Old Red Ichthyolites, there being perfect conformity between the
                                                       a
 two rocks, and         a  gradual passage from the one into the other.

                                                                      of

 3rdly. That, whilst the concretionary limestones called “Cornstones”
are seen amidst some             the lowest red and green conglomerates,

Stagonolepis  into a reptile of high organization, though of nondescript
characters, did not interfere with his long-cherished opinion—founded
on acknowledged facts—as to the progressive succession of great
classes of animals, and that, inasmuch as the earliest Trilobite of the
invertebrate Lower Silurian era was as wonderfully organized as
any living Crustacean, so it did not unsettle his belief to find that
the earliest reptiles yet recognized, the Stagonolepis and Telerpeton,
pertained to a high order of that class.

Thomas H. Huxley, F.R.S., F.G.S., Professor of Nat. Hist,
Government School of Mines.
  The unquestionable remains of Stagonolepis Robertsoni which
have hitherto been obtained consist partly of bones and dermal scutes,
and partly of the natural casts of such parts.     The former have been
obtained only at Lossiemouth, and are comparatively few in number ;
the numerous natural casts, on the other hand, have all been pro
cured at the Findrassie Quarry, in which no bones or scutes, in their
original condition, have been discovered.
   The considerable series of remains exhibited to the Society did not
embrace    allthose which had been subjected            examination, but
                                                                       to

rians,—the obliquity of the articular faces of the centra, so charac
teristic of the vertebrae of Stagonolepis, being, as the author of the
paper pointed out, a very common character of Teleosaurian, and
even of modern Crocodilian, vertebrae.     Of the sacral vertebrae, only
a natural cast of the posterior face of the second had been obtained ;
but it was sufficient to demonstrate the wholly crocodilian charac
ters of this region in Stagonolepis.
    The dorsal vertebrae present a remarkable peculiarity in the strong
upward, outward, and backward inclination of the transverse pro
 cesses, and in the size of the facet for the head of the rib.                 The
vertebra thus acquires a Dinosaurian character; but no great weight
was attached to this circumstance, as the amount of upward                                                    in
clination of the transverse processes of the anterior dorsal vertebrae
varies greatly in both Crocodilia and Emaliosauria.
   The ribs have well-marked and distinct capitula and tubercula;
and the scapula is extremely like that of a crocodile.                 The femur,

     A  second tube of the same length, of a spherical form in the
 middle and with conical prolongations at the two ends, presented the
  same phaenomenon        at the negative pole; but in the light of the
 positive pole, independently of the streaks previously indicated, there
 were two small dark streaks in the blue.
     The wires soldered into the glass tubes were of platinum.       In the
  cylindrical electrical egg with brass electrodes, the phaenomena are
 the same as in these tubes, with this difference only, that the ne
 gative light between the two broad black bands appears greenish,
 nearly like the space between F and b in the solar spectrum, and
 that in the spectrum of the positive light, besides the bands in the
 red and green, several also make their appearance in the blue.
     If the point at the negative pole be replaced by a ball, the
 positive pole remaining the same as before, there appears in the red
 of the negative light a small dark streak, whilst in the positive light
 two strong dark streaks become visible in the blue. Thus the phae
 nomenon becomes modified, as if each of the two lights, positive and
 negative, contained a slight proportion of the other.       In every case
 the   spectra  remain     different, of which it is  very   easy to con
vince oneself, when the fissure is long enough to allow the two
 spectra to be observed at the moment when the prolongation of the
 one penetrates into the other.
    To observe the spectrum of the spark, the points of a spark-micro
meter were placed in communication by a thread of glass, and in
 this way a stream of sparks was obtained, in the light of which the
 characteristic brilliant streaks were strongly marked.
    Non-continuous spectra, such as those above described, are pro
duced by coloured flames, or when a source of white light is sub
mitted to the absorption of coloured gases. Now, as the space which
separates the poles is not an absolute vacuum, we may suppose that
various gaseous matters, or a single gas in different states, occur at
these poles. The two cases suppose, it is true, a certain duration
in the action of the pole and an action which increases with this dura
tion. If we introduce a commutator between the pile and the Ruhm
korff's apparatus, the two spectra immediately change, and remain
without alteration, which is contrary to the hypothesis in question.
    When the luminous current is deflected by means of a strong mag
net, no change is observed in the spectra.
    The luminous phaenomena presented by electricity in vacuo exhibit
a  striking analogy with those of the aurora borealis, which has caused
them to receive the name of artificial aurorae boreales. The fiery red
of the positive pole particularly resembles the red which characterizes
many auroras; and the author has of late years repeatedly had the
opportunity of remarking this resemblance, especially in two cases of
aurora borealis seen at Berlin. The peculiarities presented by the
electric light in vacuo are so marked, that it appears easy to decide
definitively by prismatic analysis whether the light of the aurora
borealis is or is not of an electrical nature.--Poggendorff’s Annalen,

X. On the Mean Length of the Paths described by the separate
   Molecules    of Gaseous Bodies on the occurrence of Molecular
   Motion: together with some other Remarks upon the Mechanical
   Theory of Heat.       By R. CLAUSIUsl.
(1.)
      Titºtains February Number of Poggendorff’s Annalen con
                     a paper by Buijs-Ballot “On the Nature of
the  Motion which we call Heat and Electricity.”       Amongst the
objections which the author there makes against the views ad
vanced   by Joule, Krönig, and myself concerning the molecular
motion of gaseous bodies, the following deserves especial con
sideration.     Attention is drawn to the circumstance that, if the
molecules moved in straight lines, volumes of gases in contact
would necessarily speedily mix with one another,      a result which
does not   actually  take place.  To  prove that such mixture does
not occur, the following facts are adduced (p. 250):—“How
then does it happen that tobacco-smoke,       in rooms, remains so
long extended in immoveable layers?”         Mention is also made
of the same appearance with clouds of smoke in the open air.
Further,   “If   sulphuretted hydrogen or chlorine be evolved in
one corner of a room, entire minutes elapse before they are
smelt in another corner, although the particles of gas must have
had to traverse the room hundreds of times in a second.”
Further, “How could carbonic acid gas remain so long in an
open vessel   ?”
   These objections may, at first glance, appear to have very great
               I
weight; and consider it therefore necessary to prove, by special
considerations, that the facts adduced are perfectly reconcileable
with the theory of the rectilineal motion of the molecules.      In
deed,  I  rejoice at the discussion of this point by M. Buijs

82               Prof. Clausius on Molecular Motion,
Ballot, inasmuch as it affords me a desired opportunity of com
pleting this part of my theory (which was perhaps discussed too
briefly in my paper), and to prevent thereby further misunder
standings.
    (2.) It is assumed in the objections, that the molecules traverse
considerable spaces in straight lines; this appears prominently
in the second objection, in which it is said that a molecule must
have had to traverse the room many times in a second. This
assumption can, however, in nowise be considered as a necessary
consequence of the views advanced by me concerning the condi
tions of gases. Amongst the conditions which must be satisfied if
Mariotte and Gay-Lussac’s law for a gas is true with perfect
 strictness,  I have adduced the following,      “that those portions
 of the   path  of a molecule  throughout   which the molecular forces
 are of influence in sensibly altering the motion of the molecule,
 either in direction or velocity, must be of vanishing value com
 pared with those portions of the path throughout which such
 forces may be considered as inactive.”        Now in actually exist
 ing gases, Mariotte and Gay-Lussac’s law is not strictly, but
 only approximately true; and it hence follows that in them such
 first portions of the paths of the molecules must be small, but
 not vanishingly small, compared with the entire paths.          Inas
 much, now, as one of the fundamental conditions upon which
 the whole theory rests is that the molecular forces are only
 effective at small distances from the molecules, a path which
 is very great in comparison to the sphere of action of a molecule
 may yet, considered absolutely, be very small.
     By a few simple considerations, an approximate idea may be
 formed of the mean magnitude of the paths traversed by the
 separate molecules:      I purpose endeavouring to elucidate this in
 what    immediately   follows.
     (3.) For this purpose it will be advisable to prefix some re
  marks concerning the manner in which it is possible to view
 the molecular forces, and what has accordingly to be understood
  by the sphere of action. These remarks are not to be considered
  as an essential part of the subsequent development, but are
 merely intended to fix our ideas.
     If  we do not take into account the forces of chemical affinity,
  and   only consider such molecules as are chemically indifferent to
  one   another,   I imagine that there are still two forces which
  are to be distinguished.        I believe, namely, that when two
  molecules approach one another an attraction is at first exerted,
  which begins to be of sensible effect even at some distance, and
  which increases as the distance diminishes; but that, when the
  molecules have arrived into the immediate neighbourhood of one
  another, a force comes into play which seeks to drive them

            with Remarks upon the Mechanical Theory of Heat.                                                                  83
asunder.    For the view which it is here intended to take, it is
indifferent what kind of force this repulsive one is supposed to
be, that         is,
              whether,       the case        as
                                        solid elastic bodies,

strives     separate
               to    the molecules when   they  are    actual contact                             in

                               the same manner, we need not here

a  more subtle    substance,   with which the    ponderable   particles
matter are furnished.
    Let        us
             now imagine two molecules moving            directions such                         in
that,      they preserved them unchanged, they would not strike
          if
one another, but pass             some distance. by  Two cases may here
                                                      at
occur.         If
               the distance      very small, the molecules which were
                                                  is
drawn towards one another, even from some distance,                    the                                            by
force      of
            attraction, approach                                so
                                       closely that the repulsive force
comes into play, and         rebounding    a the molecules results.       of                                                  If
the distance          somewhat greater, the paths
                            be                             the molecules                          of
 only suffer      certain
                       a   change     direction   through     of
                                                           the attractive
 force, without the repulsive force being able         act.    Finally,                      to                               at
 still greater distances, the effect          the molecules upon one      of
another may          altogether neglected.

    How    great   the distances must            order that the one       be   in                                             or
 other case might occur, could not              determined universally,        be

          if                                       the molecular forces;            of
    for   velocity                              reciprocal

distances may    obtained. We will therefore suppose that the
distance      given
                 p  for such
                       is        mean value, which forms the    a
boundary between the first and second case, and the meaning                                                                     of

star-shaped masses are formed exactly similar to the liquid spaces
produced by the sunbeam in my experiments.           The process of
liquefaction is simply an inversion of the process of solidification;
and to me it seems perfectly natural that the phaenomena should
be of this complementary character.
   Prof. Thomson also objects to my conclusion, that it might
be inferred from the experiments on internal liquefaction that ice
was a uniaxal crystal+.                            I
                                   look at the matter purely from a phy
 sical  point  of  view;   and thus regarded, nothing,             think, can be                I
 more certain than the conclusion referred                           line may         to.   A                            be
drawn through             mass a    ice, round which the particles are
                                                   of
 arranged with perfect symmetry; and there                    but one direction       is
through the substance round which this symmetry prevails. To
me       appears certain that this line will
        it                                                the optic axis         be

crystal, and that the crystal will possess but one such axis.                 The
liquefaction experiments prove the facts; and                    that we know             all                            of
optical phaenomena confirms the conclusion.

             think, unless influenced by previous theoretical views,
entertain any  other opinion.”    Is it to be supposed that convic
tions thus strongly uttered, based upon years of observation,
and established, according to the above quotation, by the testi
mony of the senses themselves, are meant to be reversed by a
single observation which, after all, is essentially defective,                                                  in
volving, in reality, not a fact, but an opinion ? The supposition is
unreasonable, and will appear still more so when it is remembered
that throughout the entire letter Prof. Forbes never once tells
us that he has changed his views regarding the origin of the
veined structure, though he does acknowledge a change of view
upon a different subject.
   On the conversion of névé into ice the latter is sufficiently
clear; on the subject of the structure it is altogether vague and
unsatisfactory.      Prof. Forbes refers to pressure, as he did in his
earliest communications upon this subject; but by far the most
reasonable interpretation here           that              is,

 he  distinctly states, “necessarily takes place under intense pres

          of so

98                      Prof. Trowbridge on Deep-sea Soundings.
   In the year 1845, Lieutenant (now Commander) Charles H.
Davis, U.S. Navy, while running a line of deep-sea soundings
across the Gulf-stream, under the direction of the Superintend
ent of the Coast Survey, obtained one cast of 1350 fathoms, and
brought up a specimen of the bottom with the “specimen-cup *
of Lieut. H. S. Stellwagen, U.S. Navy.       With regard to this
sounding, Lieut. Davis remarked as follows:– “U.S. Brig
‘Washington,’ Oct. 29th, 1845. Sounded with 1300 fathoms
line (13 mile), and found bottom at that depth. . . . After the
lead was felt to strike the bottom, the line became slack, so that
the quartermaster could haulit in hand over hand.... It appeared
to fall      off
           again from the side    the bank, and took the remainder
                                                         of
of  the line, amounting        1350 fathoms”      all). “The cup
                                                    to                                     (in

3  P.M. sounded again with 715 fathoms line, and found the
same bottom       before.” The cup referred
                             as                  was the Stellwagen                   to

 bottom: but in the latter case the temperature of the water was
 recorded at the depth named.    In 1848, in the explorations off
 Cape Hatteras, the officer engaged in the explorations lost his
 instrument, with 3300 fathoms of line out.
   These Gulf-stream explorations were undoubtedly the first
 systematic deep-sea explorations ever undertaken.
   Our principal object, however, is to notice those great depths
 where no bottom was found, and to examine whether the failure
 to find the bottom was, under the circumstances, any proof that it
 did not exist at much less depths than those reported, or whether
 any conclusion whatever can be derived from the results.
    When we reflect that two-thirds of the earth’s surface is co
 vered with water,   while the remaining third is dry land, and
 that the figure of the solid part can only be known when we
 can trace with certainty the mountain-ranges and valleys along
 the bottom of the sea, it becomes important to scrutinize those
 reported measurements which give such enormous depressions
 in different parts of the sea, compared with which the highest
 mountain-ranges are insignificant elevations.       Numerous                        in
 stances have been reported in which soundings have been made
to the depth of five, six, seven, eight, and nine miles without
finding bottom; and again over large areas the bottom of the
sea is represented as a comparatively level plain submerged to
the depth of two, three, or four miles.   Supposing these reported
measurements     to have been correct, we should have still very
insufficient data for arriving at any correct conclusions with
regard to the elevations and depressions of the ocean-bed. What
idea could be formed, for instance, of the topography of our
country, if our knowledge of                  its
                                    surface consisted      knowing        in

error in height of one or two miles is unimportant, or that the
elevations of ordinary mountain-ranges need not be noticed when
compared with the area of a continent. We are dealing with
finite quantities, not with the infinite with which they may be
compared; and an error of several thousand feet in two or three
miles is hardly within the limits of scientific accuracy.
    Prominent among the instances of these reported unfathom
able depths, stands the sounding of Captain Denham of the
British Navy, in H.M.S. ‘Herald,” made in October 1852, on
a voyage from Rio de Janeiro to the Cape of Good Hope.           This
is an extreme case; but since it is reported among the greatest
 deep-sea casts, it will serve best for illustration*. All other great
casts   of the lead which   have been reported are subject to the same
causes of error, which are to be found in this, some in a greater
and some in a less degree; so that it is not necessary for us to
believe yet anything with regard to them, except that they
gave no result. The sounding of Captain Denham was made
with a lead weighing nine pounds, attached to a line one-tenth
of an inch in diameter; and it is reported that this lead descended
to the depth of nearly nine miles in the sea without touching
bottom.
    In accordance with a plan which originated with the lamented
G. M. Bache, United States Navy, in 1846, in the explorations of
the Gulf-stream, and which has constantly been followed since,
Captain Denham noted the time of running out of the successive
portions of the sounding-line during the nine hours of its sup
posed descent.       According to these observed times of descent,
the   nine-pound   lead communicated to the descending line at the
depth of 3000 fathoms, or 18,000 feet, a velocity of two feet per
second; a result which is philosophically impossible, since the re
 sistance of the water acting upon a line of this diameter, moving
 with a velocity of two feet per second, at the depth mentioned,
 amounts to more than three times the weight of the lead or shot
 used.    It will hardly be necessary to enter into any argument to
 show that there can be no motion of descent when the resistance
to that motion is three times the weight of the moving mass.
 Further, the observations show that the nine-pound shot and line
 were running with a velocity of two feet and a half per second
 at the depth of 2000 fathoms, or 12,000 feet.       Here the result
 contradicts in quite as strong a manner the mechanical laws of
 the descent; and in fact below 1000 fathoms, or 6000 feet, if
 we credit the observations, a velocity was observed in the running
 out of the line which it was impossible for the lead to communi
 cate to   it.      fact but small part

been produced by the descent of the lead.  Here we have a reli
able result to the depth of 1000 fathoms only. The difference
between this result and the conclusions of Captain Denham is
simply the difference between one mile and nine miles.
   In measuring the distance to the sun, an error of eight miles
would hardly be worth noticing, perhaps; but what conclusions
can be drawn from a measurement in which the probable error
amounts to eight times the whole distance
  Popular ideas with regard to the sinking of bodies in the sea
have heretofore been vague,     for the reason, perhaps, that the
laws which govern this descent, and which are derived from the
well-known laws of fluids, have never been fully defined in
their application to the depths of the ocean.   Some imagine that
ships which founder at sea, sink to a certain depth, and there
float about until broken to pieces, or thrown upon some bank
beneath the sea; and, indeed, a recent writer in England has
published a book sustaining this absurd notion.      Others, again,

as successive   lengths of line are drawn into the water, the re
sistance is constantly increased; so that at 2000 or 3000 fathoms
depth, the weight will be almost entirely suspended in the sea
by the resistance of the water along the sides of the line.
    Some idea of the resistance which opposes the motion of a
sounding line may be formed from the fact, that upon 1000 fa
thoms of a line one-tenth of an inch in diameter, moving with a
velocity of three feet per second, the resistance is between twenty
five and thirty pounds. And if the velocity be increased to six
feet per second, the resistance upon the line becomes a hundred
pounds nearly. Or, if the length of the line be doubled, with
the same velocity, the resistance is doubled; and it is also
directly proportional to the diameter of the line.
    These are some of the reasons why an improvement in the
mode of measuring the depths of the sea is not only desirable,
but necessary, before a certain knowledge of those depths can
be obtained.

 turned aside, or diffracted, according to laws which the wave
 theory has explained. Now Professor Stokes has shown that,
when the incident light is polarized, the plane of vibration of the
diffracted ray must differ from that of the incident, the two
planes being connected by a very simple relation. It only re
mained, therefore, for observation to determine whether the
planes of polarization of the incident and refracted rays were
similarly related, or not. The experiment was undertaken by
Professor Stokes himself, and he has inferred from it that the
original hypothesis of Fresnel is the true one; but, as an oppo
site result has been obtained by M. Holtzmann on repeating
the experiment, the question must be regarded as still undeter
mined.    The difference in the experimental results is ascribed
by Professor Stokes to the difference in the nature of the gra
tings employed, the substance of the diffracting body being sup
posed to exert an effect upon the polarization of light, which is
diffracted by it under a great obliquity.                         I
                                               learn from Professor
 Stokes that he  proposes  to resume the experimental   inquiry, and
to test this supposition   by  employing  gratings  of various sub
stances.   If the conjecture should prove to be well founded, it
will, unfortunately, greatly complicate the dynamical theory of
light.”
   It must be admitted that the question thus presents a very
unsatisfactory aspect.      Considering the amount of talent that
has been   brought    to bear upon                  it,

 abrupt change of condensation caused by a break of continuity
 of the circumstances of the fluid. So far as the sudden retarda
tion acts in the direction of the axis of the wave-ray, it produces
reflexion, but no polarization, because this action is symmetrical
with respect to the axis.    Reflexion also takes place by a sudden
retardation of the transverse vibrations, because such retardation
causes a sudden increment of condensation or rarefaction along
the axis and contiguous parts. (The effect of transverse action
is considered in a communication to the Philosophical Magazine
for February 1853, under Proposition XIII.) . If the transverse
vibrations be resolved in directions perpendicular and parallel to
the plane of refraction, no polarization appears if the retardations
of the two sets of vibrations are equal.      Polarization is in pro
portion to the difference of the retardations, because, if such dif
ference exists, the action on the wave-ray is not symmetrical
about         of its
           axis.   The plane    polarization              of

first, the ball to be steady and the electric current to pass. Now
push the ball forward—there is rupture of contact and a spark
behind the new point of contact; a nipple suddenly emerges from
the metal at the point where the spark occurs and pushes the
ball forward.   It is doubtless to this incessant rupture of con
tact that the crackling noticed by Mr. Gore is due.     Mr. Gore
confines his attention to electric conduction; but bad conductors
of electricity are also bad conductors of heat—at least among
the metals. That a bad conductor of heat produces a better
effect than a good one, is a perfect illustration of the justice of
Faraday’s remark regarding the influence of bad conduction in
the experiment of Trevelyan, namely, that it confines the heat to
the neighbourhood of the surface, and therefore increases that
local expansion which keeps up the motion.—J. T.

          Note on the Stratifications of the Electric Light.
                By Messrs. QUET and SEGUIN*.
    S the cause of the luminous stratifications obtained with
       Ruhmkorff's induction apparatus is not yet known, it is
perhaps not useless to endeavour to reproduce the phaenomena
from other sources of electricity, and to modify them by means of
external agents.   Messrs. Grove and Plücker have already tried
the action of the magnet  on the stratified light.
         Stratifications obtained with the Electric Condenser.
   Ifa Leyden jar be discharged through a cylindrical Geissler's
tube, a wave of light is obtained which is usually dazzling, and
in which stratifications are not observed.  After the first dis
charge, it is easy to obtain two or three others,            each  of which
gives a wave of stratified light throughout the               length of the
tube: the same phaenomenon is obtained at the                first discharge
if the jar be feebly charged.                                       -
   The luminous stratifications may be produced       by converting
the Geissler's tube into a condenser by means of a covering of
tinfoil.    The tube is charged like a Leyden jar, by passing the
electricity of an ordinary plate machine, either into the very rare
fied gas which it contains, or on to the armature of tin, the second
conductor of the tube being placed in communication with the
earth.     The discharge of this apparatus produces in the tube a
wave of stratified light; and strata are seen either on the covering
 of tinfoil, or on the part of the tube left exposed between the
envelope and the electrode which is discharged on             it.

 110        MM, Quet and Seguin        on the Stratifications
 of which exhibit the phaenomena of luminous strata: the experi
 ment also succeeds when the tinfoil is replaced by the hand.
 The electrophorus is sufficient to charge the tube; but when the
 machine is used, the armature of tin and one of the electrodes
 must be arranged so that the discharge takes place of itself, and
 thus the appearance of the wave of stratified light is frequently
 renewed.   With a simple winding of metal wire applied on the
 tube instead of the tin, and communicating with the earth, some
 strata are produced.
  Action of Conductors on Electric Currents, which produce either
                 stratified or unstratified Light.
    When the current of an induction coil is passed through a
 Geissler's tube, by connecting the two extremities of the induced
 wire with the electrodes of the tube, stratified light is immedi
 ately obtained.   But if only single contact be made, and sparks
  drawn at the other electrode, there is obtained in the place of a
  stratified wave, a luminous wave without perceptible interruption,
  whose diameter is less than that of the tube.         This stream con
  tinues to show itself always at the negative       pole:   sometimes it
 extends from one pole to the other; occasionally, besides the
  continuous wave, luminous strata are seen, which commence at
 a greater or less distance from the negative electrode and extend
 to the positive electrode.     The length of the part of the tube
 occupied either by the continuous light or by the stratified light
 depends on the movement of the hammer, and on the density of
 the pile, on the force of the induction apparatus, and on the ex
 plosive distance from the pole of the tube; and the two dis
 charges may be established at pleasure in the tube. With a
 feeble pile, and holding the hammer with the finger, the wave
 may be made continuous from one end to the other; by exerting
 on the hammer sufficient pressure, brilliant stratifications are
 produced with an almost dark space round the negative pole.
 Conductors brought near to the tube are not without influence
 on the two kinds of discharges, which Mr. Grove has already
 distinguished from one another.
     When the stratified light is produced by the contact of two

                                                                   of It
also   on          of
            the force   the pile, and  on  the movement        the ham
mer.       By supporting the hammer and using feeble pile, the

dark interval may attain a length    of 6 centimetres. When the
tinfoil or the fingers  are caused to glide towards the positive
pole, it appears as if the strata in front merge into each other,
whereas they appear to recede from each other if the conductor
moves towards the negative pole.
  A very marked effect of conductors on the stratified light is
obtained when the fluid of the inductive machine comes into
the tube by one of the poles only, the other pole and the other
end of the wire being insulated.   The luminous strata are then
very feeble; if the tube be encircled by the hand without touch
ing, their diameter diminishes; they appear contracted towards
the axis of the tube, but are more distinct.              If
                                                    the hand be
pressed on the tube, or if a piece of tinfoil not insulated be
affixed, the light becomes feeble between the conductor and the
inactive electrode, but on the side of the active electrode the
strata become more brilliant.    At the same time, if the active
electrode be positive, there appears on this side, at the edge of
the tinfoil, a large dark space, as if this edge had become the
negative pole.
   The wave of continuous light, obtained by drawing sparks on
one end   of the tube while the other is in contact with the induced
wire, is also influenced by external conductors.       The hand which
encircles without touching the tube, contracts the wave towards
the axis.    The contact of the fingers spreads it into a spindle;
and if the pile be not very strong, the internal light appears to
press against the glass in front of the external conductor.           In
the last case, the tube being simply taken between two opposite
fingers, the continuous wave appears to undergo a disruption,
and, further, not far from the positive pole, a brilliant layer is
seen to be produced.        By touching another section with two
other  fingers, a second   rupture  is effected, which produces the
appearance of a second luminous stratum.          Often the stratified
wave which occupies that part of the tube near the positive pole,
pushes the strata to a junction with those which the influence
of the fingers has produced.
   When only one of the poles is active, if the tinfoil which en
velopes part of the tube be touched by the free extremity of the
induced wire, the space situate between the tin and the inactive
pole becomes much darker, and the other increases in brilliancy;

   It is well to observe that the conductors are electrified by                                    in
fluence in these experiments.        This is proved by insulating
them, and making them communicate with an electroscope.
Thus the tinfoil, when one of the poles is active and the second
extremity of the induced wire is insulated, gives to the electro
scope an electricity like that of the active pole.  If the insulated
extremity of the induced wire touches the tinfoil, the electroscope
is charged with the electricity given by this wire to the con
ductor: the experiment must be made with attention, for the
electricity appears alternately to approach and recede from the
electroscope.   This instrument may also be charged with the
tinfoil when the two poles of the tube are active.
XVI. A Proof         that every Equation has as many Roots as                                  it has
                  Dimensions.    By Professor CHALLIs”.
   T will   probably be conceded that this theorem, which has
       been the subject of so much discussion, will receive a legi
 timate proof, if a method, however operose, be indicated, by
 which as many roots of any numerical equation as there are                                        di
 mensions can be actually found, whether they be possible or
 impossible, and at the same time it be shown that no other
 quantities are roots.    It might perhaps be questioned whether
 any other kind of proof does not involve a petitio principii.
    The method          I
                     am about to propose rests on the following
 algebraic principles.   Algebra consists of two parts, the distinc
tion between which is seldom marked with sufficient clearness in
algebraic treatises.    One part is wholly concerned with rules of
operation and the generation of different kinds of symbolic
                                                                         in to,
representation of quantity, and is preparatory          and indepen
dent   of,the other part, which entirely consists       the formation
and solution       of
                  equations.                In
                                    the former the sign        equality             of
means identity          of
                     the functions     separates, under difference
                                                 it                                                of
forms;   in the latter the same sign means equality          value for              of
certain values     of       an
                      unknown   quantity.    These two   significations
might with advantage          distinguished
                                      be           difference   by  the

and thus there are two equations for determining the values                                                                  of

The solution gives     +y and —y simultaneously, because, as is
known by other reasoning, impossible roots enter equations by
pairs. Thus a quadratic factor of X(w)=0 is found,and the equa
tion may be put under the form Q1. x, (a)=0. The equation
X,(a)=0 may be treated in exactly the same manner, and so on,
till a number of quadratic factors be found equal to half the                        di
mensions of Xi(r)=0. Hence if the dimensions be 2n, we shall
have X1(a) = Q, ..       Q.
                          Qs ... Q.-0.      There cannot be more
quadratic factors than these, because if there were, the dimen
sions of their product would exceed the dimensions of X1(a);
and there cannot be different factors from these, because if
any other quadratic factor divided X1(a), it must also divide
Qi. Q2. Q3...Q., which is in possible, because, not being iden
tical with any one of these factors, it is prime to each. Conse
quently the number of the impossible roots is equal to the dimen
sions of X1(a); and the whole number of roots, possible and impos
sible, is equal to the dimensions of the given equation f(a)=0.
    The complete solution of the equations b1(r, y”) = 0 and
*1(z, y”)=0, might give corresponding values of 2 and y, one
or both of which might be impossible, and yet be such that
2+y     V-1   would satisfy the equation X(w)=0.         It suffices
                                                                                     at for
the   foregoing   argument, that there will always          one set be
least     corresponding possible values
         of                                   and   of    y,
                                                     which will make

  We have great pleasure      thanking here Mr. Siméon Stoiko

                    XVIII. On Iodo-arsenious Acid.
           By WILLIAM WALLAcE, Ph.D., F.C.S., Glasgow”.
     results of a recent     investigation on the compound of
THEarsenious  acid with chloride     of arsenic, to which gave                                      I
the name of chloro-arsenious acidt, have induced me to prosecute
the inquiry whether similar combinations could be formed con
taining bromine and iodine. I have succeeded in obtaining a
bromo-arsenious acid having a remarkably close resemblance to
the chlorine compound; but as my experiments on this inter
esting body are not yet completed, 1 reserve a description of them
for a future communication.
   The iodine compound differs very much from those containing
chlorine and bromine. I find that it has already been described
as an arsenite of teriodide of arsenic by Plisson, and also by
Serullas and Hottot i, but neither of these authorities have
given any analysis of    nor           it,
                                they appear            do
                                               have understood                      to
its true nature.

acid     the iodide.
          in
   The iodide requires for solution              the boiling temperature
                                                                    at

 lization will be best understood by conceiving, as he does, that
  the polyhedron is projected on a concentric sphere, so that the
 faces become spherical polygons.      Then for the ordinary polyhe
 drons of geometry, the sum of the angles at a vertex = 4 right
  angles; but it may, according to the more general notion, be = e
 times 4 right angles.     In like manner for the ordinary polyhe
 drons, the sides of a face subtend at the centre angles, the sum
 of which is = 4 right angles; but according to the more general
 notion, this sum may be (viz. if the polygons are stellated) = e!
 times four right angles.      And finally, the sum of the spherical
 polygons is ordinarily equal to the entire spherical surface; but
 according to the more general notion, it may be = D times the
 spherical surface. (e is Poinsot's e, e does not occur in Poinsot;

sum of these is simply four
right angles, or e= 1.     On
account of the stellation,
e'=2.    Each of the project
ing parts of the face is equal
# of the face of the ordinary
icosahedron; and if we reckon
the area of the stellated pen
tagon to be that of the inte
rior pentagon plus the pro
jecting parts, the area of the
face will be 5+3,                  or 49 of
the face of the                    ordinary
icosahedron; and                  the sum
of the faces will                  be four
times the spherical surface, and accordingly Poinsot writes                              E=4.
If,however, what seems preferable, we reckon the area                                   of    the
stellated pentagon    five times the triangle, having for
                                 as                           vertex               its

same thing, reckon the stellated pentagon        twice the interior  as
pentagon plus the projecting parts), then the area          the face          of
will    be

called D is reciprocal to itself; this is not the case for Poinsot's
E; and I have not been able to define E in such a manner as to
enable me to form the definition of a reciprocal number E': this
may be possible, but in the mean time it seems better to dis
card E altogether, and use instead of it the number D.

e' is different from unity; the general form is

XX. on       Apatite, Wagnerite, and some artificial species of Me
     tallic Phosphates.  By Messrs. H. SAINTE-CLAIRE DEv1LLE
     and H. CARoN *.
      MONG the            more abundant minerals is found a well-defined
        and crystallized substance, the phosphate of lime, which
is principally  met with in veins in the older rocks and in volcanic
lavas.   The singular composition of apatite, first determined by
M. Gustav Rose in 1827, shows that it is a definite compound
of chloride and fluoride of calcium with phosphate of lime. The
chemical examination of this substance, and the establishment
of   its
       analogies, formed       interesting subject
                                     an                  inquiry; and  of
the researches which we have undertaken have led            results of      to
great simplicity.

130     On Apatite, Wagnerite, and        some   Metallic Phosphates.
phorus over lime; M. Manross+ and M. Brieglebt, in conti
muation of the remarkable researches made in the laboratory of
Professor Wöhler, have reproduced apatite in more distinct and
more beautiful forms by taking advantage of the double decom
position of alkaline phosphates and chloride of calcium; M.Forch
hammert, by acting on phosphate of lime with chloride of sodium,
has obtained very beautiful specimens of the same mineral
species.
  We employed a more direct and more general method, founded
on the fact that the phosphates are soluble at a red heat in the
chlorides of the metals whose oxides serve as base in the salts
employed, or in analogous chlorides.     Thus by taking bone
phosphate, and mixing it with sal-ammoniac to transform the
carbonate of lime, which it always contains, into chloride of cal
cium, and adding an excess of chloride and fluoride of calcium,
we obtain by fusion at a red heat a fluid which appears homo
geneous, and from which apatite crystallizes S on cooling.     is          It
well to operate as much as possible with crucibles or vessels of
graphite from gas-retorts; for the phosphates strongly attack clay
crucibles: the phosphate of lime may be replaced by any of the
phosphates mentioned. This may be prepared for the purpose
by calcining one equivalent of commercial phosphate of ammonia
with three equivalents of the oxide or nitrate of the metal in
question. The salt obtained is mixed with the coresponding
chloride and heated.      On cooling, the excess of chloride is sepa
rated  by  washing  with distilled water.   Iron apatite (Zwieselite)
is obtained   by treating  phosphate  of iron with chloride of man
ganese, a process which yields it in crystals frequently a centi
metre long.
   The exact determination of the crystalline form of Wagnerite
is difficult on account of the numerous striae in the facets, more
especially    of those zones the most easily measured             We must
further observe that the phosphates retain fluorine with such
persistence as to lead to most serious errors if the analysis be
not made very carefully.
   The occurrence of apatite in veins has led M. Daubrée to
think that this substance may have been conveyed into                   itsposi
tion   in the form    ofvolatile products, and      particular

both in the anhydrous state, for about thirty hours to a temperature
of 170° C., the liquid will be found to be converted into a black
mass, either soft and viscid, or hard and brittle, according to time

   This black mass, which adheres firmly to the tubes in which the
reaction has been accomplished, is a mixture of several bodies. On
exhausting with water, a portion dissolves, while a more or less solid
resin remains behind.
   The aqueous solution yields, on addition of potassa, an oily preci

   The bromine in this compound exists in two perfectly different
forms; addition of nitrate of silver precipitated only one-half of this
element as bromide of silver, while even by protracted ebullition the
second half remained untouched.      The result changed, however, on
digestion with freshly precipitated oxide of silver, when the whole of
the bromine separated at once in the form of bromide of silver.
   On adding to the solution of the bromide an excess of nitrate of
silver, filtering off the bromide, and removing the excess of silver by
hydrochloric acid, a corresponding chloride was obtained, from which
bichloride of platinum precipitated a beautiful orange-yellow pla
tinum-salt.      In a moderately diluted solution which had been pre
viously gently heated, no immediate precipitate was produced; but
on cooling, the same salt was deposited in magnificent needles, which
 could be recrystallized from boiling water, or better from hydro
chloric acid.     This compound contained
                           C, H, BrPCl,        PtCl,.
  A difficultly soluble gold-salt, crystallizing from boiling water in
small scales, was found to have the corresponding composition,
                           C, H, BrPCl, AuCl,
  Very different results   were observed when the whole  of the bromine
was removed by means         of oxide of silver.         A
                                                    powerfully alkaline
solution was thus obtained, which, converted into hydrochlorate, gave,
with bichloride of platinum, a precipitate only after very considerable
evaporation.   The precipitate was likewise of a deep orange-red
colour; it readily dissolved in boiling water, from which it separated
on cooling in the form of well-defined octahedra having the compo
sition
                             C, H, PCl, PtCl,.
  Terchloride of gold furnished likewise a crystalline precipitate
very similarin appearance to the gold-salt previously mentioned, but

  The action of bibromide of ethylene on triethylphosphine, and
the subsequent transformation of the compound produced, is readily
explained. The two substances unite in equal equivalents, the product
of the reaction being the bromide of a phosphonium, in which the
fourth equivalent of hydrogen is replaced by a compound molecule,

   The compound phosphonium of this bromide possesses very con
siderable stability, as is sufficiently evinced by              its

  138                          Royal Society    —
     The analysis of the crimson crystals has shown that they contain
                C. H. P.S.-C, H. P.+C, S.–E, P+C, S.
 They    are therefore formed by the direct union of 1 equivalent of
 triethylphosphine with 2 equivalents of bisulphide of carbon.
     In the dry state the bisulphide of carbon compound may be pre
 served without being altered.        In the presence of moisture, however,
 it is  decomposed,      especially  during   hot weather. On examining
 some    specimens    which had been      kept  during several months, the
 crimson colour was found to have           disappeared, the substance had
 assumed a light yellow colour, and on opening the bottles the odour
 of sulphuretted hydrogen became at once apparent. The yellowish
 substance on recrystallization proved to be pure bisulphide of tri
 ethylphosphine.       I  leave it undecided whether this transposition had
 taken place according to the equation
                 E, PC, S,--2HO=E, PS,--2HS+C, O,
 Or
             E, PC, S,--2HO-H2O=E, PS,--2HS+C, O.
    What is the constitution of the crimson body ? In mineral
  chemistry we are acquainted with a compound closely allied in com
 position and formation to the new compound. Bisulphide of carbon,
when treated with an alcoholic solution of ammonia, furnishes, together
 with other products, a salt crystallized in long lemon-yellow needles,
 which is known by the name of sulphocarbamate of ammonium.
    This compound,
                              (H, N) H, N, C. S,
when treated with diluted acids, is converted into an oily acid       of but
little stability, sulphocarbamic acid:
                                   HH, N, C, S.
    If we replace in this compound the hydrogen by ethyle, the nitrogen
by phosphorus, in other words, if we replace the ammonia by tri
ethylphosphine, we arrive at the composition of the body which forms
the subject of this note.
    I  have convinced myself experimentally that trimethylphosphine
exhibits with bisulphide of carbon a perfectly similar deportment.
The compound formed is likewise of a crimson colour, but of a some
what lighter tint; it is more volatile and more readily soluble in
alcohol than the corresponding ethyle-compound: it is also somewhat
soluble in water.
    Triethylarsine is not altered by the addition of bisulphide of carbon;
after some time, however, long needles are formed in the mixture of
the two bodies. These needles are probably an analogous arsenic
compound :       I  have not however examined them.          A mixture of
triethylstibine and bisulphide of carbon was preserved for several
months, without undergoing any change.

          1.   Action of Bibromide of Ethylene                          on Trimethylamine.
  The unexpected result obtained in the action of bibromide of ethyl
ene on triethylphosphine,   induced me to examine the deportment of
the tertiary amine-bases under the influence of the same agent. As
a characteristic representative of this class I have selected trimethyl
amine, which may be readily procured in tolerable quantity and in a
state     of purity.                                                      -
  On submitting trimethylamine to the action of bibromide of ethyl
ene, phenomena are observed which are perfectly similar to those
which occur in the analogous experiment with triethylphosphine.
On account of the volatility of the trimethylamine,         have never                       I
worked with the anhydrous base, but invariably either with aqueous
or alcoholic solutions.   At the common temperature bibromide of
ethylene is only gradually acted on by an aqueous solution of trime
thylamine.     Frequent agitation and contact for several days are
necessary to complete the reaction;     addition of alcohol accelerates
 theprocess; which may                        be

composition of this compound with that of the bromide formed by
the action of bibromide of ethylene on triethylphosphine.      The de
portment of the two salts with nitrate and with oxide of silver is also
similar in every respect.
   By treatment with nitrate of silver, the bromine not belonging to
the ammonium may be removed without affecting the bromine of
the radical. The nitrate thus obtained, after separation of the excess
of silver, furnishes with bichloride of platinum a difficultly soluble
octahedral salt, crystallizable from a large quantity of boiling water,

   “An Experimental Inquiry into the alleged Sugar-forming Func
tion of the Liver.” By F. W. Pavy, M.D.
   The author commenced by stating that the question to be discussed
in his communication was, not whether sugar was to be found in the
animal system independently of a saccharine alimentation, for that
he considered to stand upon irrefutable ground; but whether the
sugar encountered in the liver after death was a natural representa
tion of the condition during life, or was only the result of a post
mortem occurrence.    He had noticed as early as February 1854,
that the blood removed by catheterism of the right ventricle during
 life, was almost completely destitute of saccharine impregnation.
 The observation did not then, however, receive the attention it
 deserved ; but on repeating the experiment at a later period, and
 meeting with a similar result, an investigation was made which has
 led to the conclusions advanced in his communication.
     From upwards of sixty observations, it is asserted that the con
 dition of the blood after death can no longer be taken as indicating
 its  state during life.    For,    blood      ifwithdrawn from the right

during life. At the outset         the inquiry,of      agent was sought for an

Dr. Pavy on the alleged Sugar-forming Function of the Liver.                               143
which would check the transformation of the sugar-forming material
after death, and thus present the liver in a condition as near as pos
sible to that which existed during life.       Potash was found to possess
this effect without    destroying   the  principles   concerned. A strong
solution of it was then  injected,  as instantly  after death as practicable,
through the portal vein into the liver; and, as the result, the organ
presented scarcely any appreciable trace of the presence of sugar. A
liver similarly treated when it had been allowed to remain a short
period after death, gave the usual strong reaction of sugar that has
been hitherto noticed.      By injecting only a part of the organ with
the   alkali, it is most  strikingly  susceptible of demonstration, that
the  presence   of sugar is in  reality  due to a post mortem occurrence,
and can therefore be no      longer  looked upon as a representation of
the natural ante mortem condition.
    The sudden abstraction of heat from the liver instantly after
 death, leads to a similar arrest of the production of sugar, and thus
 enables us likewise to represent the real condition of the organ
belonging to life.     In one of the experiments mentioned, where a
 dog was sacrificed, and a piece of the liver instantly sliced off and
 thrown into a freezing mixture of ice and salt, the absence of sugar
 was almost complete; the amount at least was so small, that it was
 found impossible to arrive at a quantitative determination with a
 concentrated spirituous extract, notwithstanding the process is sus
 ceptible of so great a delicacy.     The portion of the liver which was
 not submitted to the action of cold, and which was allowed to remain
 a short time in the animal, yielded on analysis an indication of 2.96
 per cent. of sugar.
    Division of the spinal cord in the lower part of the cervical region,
 the effects of which have been noticed by Bernard, but differently
interpreted, leads to a corroboration of the deductions drawn from
  thethe
    preceding experiments.    When the weather    cold    moderate,             or

144                       Royal Society       —
communication to the Parisian Academy of Sciences. Bernard's
interpretation of it is connected with the relative activity of the ab
dominal circulation; but, for myself,   I   bring it forward as strongly
supporting the views that have been advanced, and consider it to be
explained by the influence of temperature on the post mortem pro
duction of sugar.
   The material which occasions the presence of sugar in the dead
liver, has been called by Bernard “Glucogenic matter,”—a term
which, being only specially applicable after death, it is suggested
should be abandoned, and replaced by Hepatine.
   The amount of hepatine in the liver of the dog is much greater
under a vegetable than an animal diet. The amount is also increased
by mixing sugar with animal food.         From the examples given, it is
shown likewise that the relative     weight  of the liver presents a pro
portionate variation, according to the quantity of hepatine present.
In eleven dogs taken indiscriminately, that had been restricted to
an animal diet, the weight of the liver was one-thirtieth that of the
animal. The average per-centage of hepatine yielded by eight livers,
also taken indiscriminately after an animal diet, was 6'97.           Five
instances have been collected of dogs restricted to a vegetable diet
for some days prior to death. The average weight of the liver was
one-fifteenth that of the animal.        In only three of the examples
was the actual amount of hepatine determined, but in the other two
it was noticed to be exceedingly large. The average given by the
three was 17-23 per cent. Four dogs were placed upon an animal
diet, and about a quarter of a pound of ordinary cane-sugar ad
ministered daily for a short period.      The average weight given by
the four livers was one-sixteenth and a half that of the animal, and
the average amount of hepatine yielded was 14.5 per cent.
   The matural destination of hepatine in the living body remains to
be determined.      It has also to be shown how it resists transforma
tion into sugar during life, when it is so rapidly changed at an
elevated temperature immediately after death.         A possible analogy
may be presented by the following occurrence;—When a solution of
hepatine, in a neutral state, is placed in contact with saliva, an
almost instantaneous transformation into sugar takes place; but if
a little acid alkali or carbonated alkali be added, scarcely a trace of
change is for some time discoverable.                               -
   Under normal       circumstances,  rarely  an  appreciable  amount of
sugar is encountered in the circulatory system—only, according to my
analyses, from about 047 to 073 of a grain in 100 grains of defi
brinated right-ventricular blood; and this would appear to result
rather from a simple escape of a small amount of hepatine from the
tissue of the liver into the blood whilst circulating through the
capillaries, than from a special functional operation of the organ; for
when a disturbance of the circulation, whether by congestion or the
opposite, is occasioned, sugar makes    its appearance      to
                                                             aconsiderable
extent  in   the system, because the admixture     of  hepatine with the
blood is   favoured. It    canbe   easily shown   by experiment, that  on
introducing hepatine into the circulatory system,       asaccharine state

           Dr. Marcet      on the   Action   of Bile   upon Fats.           145
of the blood is induced, and if enough have been employed, a
strongly marked diabetic condition of urine is established.
   Sacrificing an animal and maintaining the circulation by perform
ing artificial respiration, occasions a well-marked diabetes.   With
the destruction of life, the transformation of hepatine into sugar
takes place, and this, being carried away by the blood, is eliminated
by the kidneys, and thus renders the urine strongly saccharine.
   Many phenomena which were before obscurely explained, receive
a lucid interpretation    from the new facts which have now been
brought to light.
  “On the Action of Bile upon Fats; with Additional Observations
on Excretine.” By W. Marcet, M.D., F.R.S.
   Having formerly observed and communicated to the Société de
Biologie of Paris, that by heating a solution of neutral tribasic
phosphate of soda (2NaO. HO. PO) mixed with animal fatty acids,
an emulsion was obtained attended with the formation of a small
quantity of soap, while no such action occurred if neutral fats were
used instead of fatty acids, I was induced to inquire into the nature
of the action of bile on neutral fats and fatty acids (sheep's bile being
used), with the final object of throwing, if possible, some additional
light on the digestion of fats. These investigations led to the fol
lowing results:—
   1. A mixture of bile and neutral fats (stearine, oleine and marga
rine), heated to a temperature above the fusing-point of the fat, un
dergoes no change, and no chemical action takes place.
   2. A mixture of bile and fatty acids (stearic, oleic, and margaric
acids), heated to a temperature above the fusing-point of the fatty
acids, is transformed into a solution, a very few and minute globules
only of fat remaining unacted upon from the presence of oleic acid.
This solution becomes a perfect emulsion on cooling, and is attended
with a chemical decomposition of the bile; and further, if the emul
sion of bile and fatty acids be filtered when quite cold, and the
residue on the filter thoroughly washed with distilled water, the            fil
trate and washings mixed together again possess the property of
forming an emulsion with another quantity of fatty acids, being also
at the same time partly decomposed, although in the previous
operation the bile appeared to have exhausted               its
                                                            power       on
                                                                        the
fatty acids.    The filtrate and   washings  from this second operation
 again act upon  a   fresh quantity   offatty acids, and       on; only
                                                                  so             in
 every subsequent operation the proportion             of
                                                       emulsion obtained
 appears to   diminish, and the induced chemical decomposition              to   be
 lessened.
   3.   Pure oleic acid, when agitated with bile, cold       hot, produces
                                                             or
 no emulsion or chemical action whatever.
    4. The stomach during digestion has the power decomposing of
 the fats contained  in  the food into fatty acids, fats acquiring thereby
 the  property of  being  acted upon chemically

    The chemical action, or saponification, induced by the fatty acids
under the above circumstances, was proved by the mixture acquiring
a strong acid reaction; and it was further observed that the acid    fil
trate from the cold emulsion was not precipitated by hydrochloric
acid, showing apparently that fatty acids exert on bile a chemical
decomposition at least as extensive as hydrochloric acid. With the
view of determining precisely the amount of soap formed, a method
of analysis was adopted calculated to indicate the proportion of fatty
acid remaining unacted upon by the bile : the difference between the
fatty acids used and the result of the above operation was equal to
the weight of the fatty acids saponified. It was found, in three ana
lyses, that the mixture of bile and fatty acids being exposed for three
hours (in Analysis II. for 3; hours) to the heat of an open water-bath,
contained an amount of soap in which the proportion of fatty acids
was 30-21 per cent., 20.5 per cent., 11.5 per cent. of that employed
in the analysis. The filtrate from the emulsion in analysis No. II.,
mixed with the solution obtained by washing the emulsion with di
stilled water, was treated for three hours on the water-bath with a
fresh quantity of fatty acids, which operation yielded a proportion of
fatty acid saponified equal to 12.7 per cent. of that used in the ana
lysis.   Finally, the filtrate and washings obtained in this last group
were mixed with another quantity of fatty acids, and exposed for three
hours to the heat of the water-bath, in which case the proportion of
fatty acid saponified was equal to 3.8 per cent. of that used in the
analysis.    The various operations had been attended with the forma
 tion of an emulsion.
    In order to be certain that, after exposing a mixture of bile and
fatty acids to the heat of a water-bath for three hours, the chemical
 action thus induced was completely exhausted, two analyses were
undertaken according to the process just mentioned, and with
bile from the same gall-bladder; but in one operation the mixture
was heated for three hours, and in the other for six hours: the
 proportion of fatty acid saponified was the same in both cases,
 showing that after three hours the bile had ceased to act on the
fatty acids.
    Having obtained the above results, an inquiry was next undertaken
 respecting the state of the fats of food in the stomach during diges
 tion. . For this purpose the contents of the stomach of several dogs,
 fed with cooked meat and neutral sheep's fat, were examined at dif
 ferent stages of digestion; the acids of the stomach soluble in water
 were removed by protracted washings with distilled water, and the
 residue being treated with alcohol and ether, yielded solutions found
 to contain fatty acids. In some cases the contents of the stomach.
 were first treated with alcohol, and the fatty matters thus obtained
 subsequently washed with distilled water, and finally again dissolved
 in alcohol and ether. These analyses constantly yielded fatty acids,
 which, when heated with fresh sheep's bile, were found to dissolve
 and produce an emulsion.

tion; the meat was then mixed with alcohol and allowed      stand for                                 to

   2. “On some Points in Chemical Geology.” By T. Sterry Hunt,
Esq., of the Geological Commission of Canada. (Communicated by
Prof. A. C. Ramsay, F.G.S.)
   § I. Referring to his communications to other Societies in which
he had endeavoured to explain the theory of the transformation of
sedimentary deposits into crystalline rocks, and to the researches of
Daubrée, Senarmont, and others, the author remarked, in the first
place, that the problem of the generation, from the sands, clays, and
earthy carbonates of sedimentary deposits, of the various siliceous
 minerals which make up the crystalline rocks, may be now regarded
 as solved; and that we find the agent of the process to be water,
holding in solution alkaline carbonates and silicates, acting upon
the heated strata.       Under some circumstances, however—such as
 the presence of gypsum or magnesia—such anomalies might occur
as are presented by the comparatively unaltered condition of some
portions of the strata in metamorphic regions.
    § II. Many crystalline rocks, formerly regarded                   plutonic
                                                                          as   of
origin, are now found         to represented among altered sedimentary
                                    be
 strata; and the chemical student          geology
                                                in      now brought
                                                               is          the      to
conclusion that      metamorphic    rocks, such      granite,
                                                          as   diorite, dolo
mite, serpentine, and limestone, may, under certain conditions,
appear      asintrusive rocks.    This      chiefly owing
                                                is              the pasty to             or
 semi-fluid state which these rocks must have assumed at the time of
 their displacement.
  §   III. The author next remarked that the hypotheses relating                         to
the   origin      the two great groups
                 of                            plutonic rocks—those with
                                                     of
potash and much silica, and those with soda and less silica—are not
satisfactory.

still forming, alkaline carbonates which play a most important part
in the chemistry of the seas.
   § V. The study of the chemistry of mineral waters, in connexion
with that of sedimentary rocks, leads the author to believe that the
result of processes continually going on in nature is to divide the
silico-argillaceous    rocks into two great classes; the one characterized
by an excess of silica, by the predominance of potash, and by the
small amounts of lime, magnesia, and soda, and represented by the
granites    and trachytes; while in the other class silica and potash
are less abundant, and soda, lime, and magnesia prevail, giving rise
(by Imetamorphism) to triclinic felspars and pyroxenes. The me
tamorphism and displacement of sediments may thus, he observed,
enable us to explain the origin of the different varieties of plutonic
rocks without calling to our aid the ejections of a central fire. (See
§ III.
    § %. The most ancient sediments, like those of modern times,
were doubtless composed of sands, clays, and limestones; but, on
the principles laid down in §§ IV. and V., the author shows that the
chemical composition of the sediments in different geologic periods
must have been gradually changing.          Illustrating his views by the
condition of the Canadian rocks, Mr. Hunt observes that, on the
large scale, in the more recent crystalline or metamorphic rocks, we
find a less extensive development of soda-felspar, while orthoclase
and mica, chlorite and epidote, and silicates of alumina, like chias
tolite, kyanite, and staurotide (which contain but little or no alkali,
and are rare in the older rocks), become abundant.         The decomposi
tion, too, of the rocks is more slow now, because soda-silicates are
less abundant, and because the proportion of carbonic acid in the
air (an efficient agent in these changes) has been diminished by
 the formation of limestones and coal.
    § VII. The author accepts the views of Babbage and Herschel as
 to the internal heat of the earth rising through the stratified depo
 sits, on account of the superficial accumulation of sediments, meta
 morphosing the rocks submitted to           its
                                               action, causing earthquakes
 and volcanic   irruptions   by the evolution      gases and vapours from
                                                   of
 chemical    reactions,  and  giving rise    todisturbances    ofequilibrium
 over wide areas      ofelevation and subsidence.

    2. Description of a New Species of Cephalaspis (C. Asterolepis)
 from the Old Red Sandstone of the neighbourhood of Ludlow.              By
John    Harley,  Esq.    Communicated     by Prof.  Huxley,    F.G.S.
    This new form of Cephalaspis (from Hopton Gate) is at least twice
 the size of C. Lyellii, and is further characterized by the position,
 obliquity, and magnitude of the orbits.           The space between the
 orbits is  proportionally   small, and the occipital crest very short. The
outer enamel-layer is ornamented with tubercles, which, though
 somewhat variable, bear so close a resemblance to those covering the
 bony plates of Asterolepis, as to have suggested the specific name.
 The inner layer of the bony plate presents lacunae and canaliculi,
resembling those of human bone; and many of them, in the specimen
described, are naturally injected with a transparent blood-red mate
rial, so distinctly and delicately, that in their minutest details the
structure of canals not more than stºryth of an inch in diameter is
beautifully revealed.
    Mr. Harley also described a more perfect specimen of Cephalaspis
Salweyi than the one on which Sir P. Egerton not long since deter
mined the species. It was found by Mr. Salwey at Hinstone near
Bromyard.       Associated with the C. Salweyi, the author found a
specimen of either a dermal plate or a tooth of a placoid fish, re
sembling some Silurian fossils called Caelolepidae by Pander.

    NEW METHOD OF EXAMINING AND VERIFYING THE SPECIFIC
                GRAVITY OF BODIES.         BY M. A. MEYER.
           methods at present in use for the determination of specific
THE   gravities are very exact, but at the same time very complicated.
As the whole question consists in facilitating the means of measuring
exactly the volume of water equivalent to the volume of the sub
stance experimented upon, the problem may be solved in a very
simple, but at the same time sufficiently exact manner, by operating
as follows:—After having filled a vessel with water, the long leg of
a reversed siphon is inserted; the liquid runs out for a moment,
but comes to a stand in the tube if the apparatus remains tranquil.
The body of which the specific gravity is to be determined is then
immersed, and the water recommences to run out by the siphon.
Collected in a small receiver, this water represents the exact volume
of the body.

                 Intelligence   and Miscellaneous   Articles.           151
    The author states that he has determined by this method a large
number      of specific gravities which had been determined by older
methods, and had found complete agreement.              He thinks that this
process might be applied with advantage to the determination of the
specific gravities of minerals, and in general of bodies whose volume
prevents their being submitted to the hydrostatic balance.—Comptes

       NOTE ON A THEOREM IN SPHERICAI, TRIGONOMETRY.
                                BY A. CAYLEY.
    I am not aware that the following theorem has been noticed: viz.,
in any spherical triangle, if as usual a, b, c are the sides, and A, B, C
the   opposite angles, then
       sin b sin c-H cos b cos c cos A = sin B sin C– cos B cos C cosa,
       sinc sin a + cos c cos a cos B = sin C sin A– cos C cos A cos b,
       sin a sin b + cos a cos b cos C= sin A sin B  – cos A cos B cos c.
    The demonstration is very simple ; in fact we have
       sin b sin c-H cos b cos c cos A
           = sin b sin c (sinº A+ cos” A) + cos b cos c cos A
           = sin b sinc sin” A+ cos A (cos b cos c +sin b sin c cos A)
           = sin B sin C sin” a + cos A cos a
           = sin B sin C (1 — cos” a) + cos A cos a
           = sin B sin C+ cosa (cos A– sin B sin C cosa)
           = sin B sin C– cos B cos C cos a,

      DESCRIPTION       OF  THE METHODS USED       TO ASCERTAIN     THE
         FIGURE    OF OPTICAL SURFACES.        BY M. L. FOUCAULT.
    In this note the author describes three processes which he uses
conjointly to examine the surface of glass mirrors, in order to dis
cover those parts at which the local corrections must be made, and
 which he applies afterwards.
     The first consists in placing in one of the conjugate foci of the
 surface a luminous point, in order to observe with the microscope
 the condition of the pencil reflected about the point of convergence;
 it is then seen to be decomposed into partial images, the considera
 tion of which furnishes sure indications as to the condition of the
 surface itself.
     The second method is founded on the employment of an object
  with parallel sides, such as a small piece of steel wire, which is
  placed in one of the conjugate foci, and whose image is observed at

154              Mr.      J.   P. Harrison on Lunar Influence over
only at Dublin and Greenwich, but at the Cape, Madras, and
Toronto.
   And lastly, maximum or minimum mean temperatures were
found to prevail on certain days of the lunation more than on
others, for example, more maxima than minima on the third
day before new moon, and on the second day after first quarter,
and more minima than maxima on the second day after third
quarter, both at Dublin and Greenwich, for a series of years
embracing more than 400 lunations*.
   These facts were communicated to the British Association in
the years 1857 and 1858, with the object of bringing them as
early as possible before the notice of meteorologists; and they
have since been confirmed by Mr.            C. Bloxam, from an ex    J.
amination of observations extending over sixteen years in the
Isle of Wight. Thus in the years 1841–56 the temperature at
Newport was found to be 0°-8 lower at the third or last quarter
than at the first: and during five days at first quarter (from
the third day before to the second day after that phase), there
was an increment of temperature amounting to 0°226 per diem;
the corresponding days at last quarter showing a decrement of
temperature amounting to 0°-110 per diem. The values for N.
and S. declination in the summer and winter months were also
found to point to the existence of lunar influence in a very
marked mannert.                     I
                          may add that it has now been ascertained
that at Greenwich the mean temperature of the second day after
last quarter          is,      on
                       the average     forty-three years, 0°-9 below

with the remaining mean temperatures.                                   In        consequence,              how
 ever, of the ever-varying position of the moon in her orbit, and
the greater or less speed with which she happens to be travel
ling, there continually occur an unequal number of observations
between    the quarters, equally distributed in a long series of
years over the whole lunation.      For example, in the case of the
first lunation in the present year (1859), new moon falling on the
4th day of January at 5' 25" A.M., the first quarter occurred
on the 12th day at 7h 22m A.M., and full moon at 11h 48m PM.
on the 18th day.     It follows that there would be seven observa
tions of mean temperature between new moon and first quarter,
and five only between first quarter and full moon. In the latter
case it is presumed that the deficiency would be not improperly
made good by repeating the observations of mean temperature
of the third day after first quarter, or the third day before full
moon, so as to complete the full number of observations in                                                     all

158                  Mr. J. P. Harrison          on Lunar Influence over
time of opposition, had there been ground for supposing that
a similar cloud-dispelling power was prevalent, though it had
been overlooked, at other periods of the lunation.                   The link
that was wanting to connect the two phaenomena seemed to be
supplied by results obtained by Mr. M. J. Johnson, the Rad
cliffe Observer at Oxford, who,                        I
                                            found, had not only noticed
that clouds disappeared at other times besides full moon, but
had made special observations connected with the subject in the
years 1844, 1845, and 1846.               During this period the action
was found to commence about the fourth or fifth day of the
moon’s age, and recurred with intervals up to the fourth or fifth
day before the conjunction*,           thus marking at both extremities
of the lunation the    very    points   at which minimum mean tempe
rature had been     observed,    and  rendering     it a matter of the high
est probability that the depressions in the curves of mean tem
perature were connected with the greater serenity of the sky,
and that the periods of high mean temperature would also be
found to depend, on an average of years, in some measure upon
the amount of cloud. Other circumstances which had come
under my own notice, or had been collected from various sources,
seemed to point to the same conclusioni.
    8. Supposing, then, that it were proved that the two phaeno
mena were connected, it is evident that the effects which have
been observed might be attributed to one of two causes, or to
both. High mean temperature, for example, might be due to
heat extricated upon the condensation of vapour into cloud and
                                                                                             in by

 adapted to the present inquiry.    In addition to the blanks caused
 by the cessation of observations on the Sunday, which could not,
 in an investigation into lunar influence, be supplied by means
 subjected to ordinary modes of correction, there were errors to
be allowed for which appeared inseparable from the measurement
of rapidly-passing and ever-changing bodies of vapour.        No  di
stinction, also, could be made in the daily means between the more
dense and rarefied clouds.     Notwithstanding this, the evidence
derived from the above observations is most important.        Fig. 1

in the tables of mean temperature, which have been already de
scribed, excepting that the sums of each vertical column were
divided by the number of observations actually recorded: they
varied from 70 to 76. This cloud-curve will be found to agree
in a remarkable manner with the curve of M. T. for ten years at
Greenwich (fig. 2), with which it accords most nearly in point of
time.
    10. Struck by the apparent regularity and boldness of the
lines of November temperature,       I then formed a curve of the
mean amount of November cloud for the years 1841–48 at
Greenwich.      It was formed in the same manner as the 7-year
curve, with this exception—that the arithmetic means of the
days immediately before and after the blank days in the tables
were from necessity introduced to make up an equal number of
seven observations in each column throughout the lunation. It
was found that the mean of the means of these columns was
the same as the mean amount of cloud for November, as given
in the results of the Greenwich observations, viz. 7-3. The curve
 (fig. 6) which was then formed proved a perfect reflexion of the
mean temperature of November for forty years, as obtained from
the lunar tables.
     11. The results of the Greenwich observations for 1840–47
supplied a further test, or rather index of the serenity of the
sky at different periods in the lunation, and so of the effects on
temperature produced by an absence of cloud. On extracting
the cloudless days, or what might be considered cloudless days,
there enumerated, and arranging them in their proper position
on the lunar curves of mean temperature, in the three first years
of the above-named period, out of twenty-three clear days it was
found that six occurred between new moon and first quarter,
eight before and after full moon, and five from the day of last
quarter to the fourth octant.       Of the four other clear days,
three occurred in a single year (1842) on the second day after
first quarter, in the months of April, July and August.          The
amount of cloud in two of the    exceptional  instances was 0.3.

160        Mr.   J.   P. Harrison on Lunar Influence over
  In  1844, 1845, and 1846 there were twenty-seven clear days;
and of these nearly the same proportion as before occurred at the
three periods of greatest depression in the curve, viz. five between
new moon and the day before first quarter; ten before and after
full moon; and five between the day before last quarter and the
last octant. Two of the remaining clear days occurred on the
day of first quarter, and four (in 1846) on the day before and
day after first quarter*.
  In    1847 there were five clear days, of which two occurred after
new    moon,  and one on the second octant.     In this last year the
observations in January and December were defective.
    On an average of the seven years, the proportion of clear, or
nearly clear, days (those being considered as nearly clear when
the amount of cloud did not exceed 0-5) was 2.2 in each 100
days.     Of these, 42 occurred on nineteen days of the lunation
at the   periods  of low mean temperature, and 13 on eleven days
at the   periods of high mean temperature.     Or, if the years 1842
and 1846 be omitted, the average of clear days being reduced to
1-8 in each 100 days, the proportion in which clear days occurred
in equal periods of low or high temperature is :: 14:04.
    12. Lastly, there are the results of the observations by
Schübler at Augsburg, from 1813 to 1828, which were examined
by M. Arago and admitted to be in accordance with those made
by Flaugergues at Viviers, from 1808 to 1828. From a Table
of the relative number of serene and clouded days at Augsburg
during the above-mentioned sixteen years, M. Schübler found
(1) that clear days were more numerous at last quarter; (2) that
the greatest number of clouded days occurred towards (vers) the
second octantt.       Also in twenty-eight years at three different
stations, namely at Munich from 1781 to 1788, at Stuttgard
from 1809 to 1812, and at Augsburg as above, there were 306
 days of rain on the day of the first octant, 325 on the day of the
 first quarter, 341 (the maximum) on the day of the second octant,
 284 (the minimum) on the day of the last quarter, and 290 on
 the last octant. It will be perceived that these results, though in
   * It should be observed that the occurrence of clear days immediately
after first quarter, though termed exceptional, is to be considered so rela
tively only, in the same way that low temperatures are found to occur at
the same period without affecting the rise in the curves.   Thus out of the
twenty-four highest and lowest maximum and minimum mean tempera
tures for the month at Greenwich, being one highest and one lowest mean
temperature for each of the twelve months, during forty-three years, it
has elsewhere been shown that eleven, viz. seven minima and four maxima,
occurred within three days of the first quarter on each side; and of these,
five minima occurred before the day of the change, and two after          Of
the maxima, there occurred three after, and one upon the day
                                                                     of it.
                                                                        first

            at                            rainy days occurs between

(Annuaire, 1825, p. 167.)
     I may   mention in conclusion, that there appears to be much
in the chapters relating to the subject in this second volume to
countenance           the belief that the moon’s surface radiates heat                      un
equally; so that it is perhaps to the different extent of the ab
sorbing surfaces, and the length of time during which, at the
several phases, they are exposed to the solar rays, that one may
ascribe the difference in the effects which have been noticed.
It   is evident that the influence must vary with the moon’s                            posi
tion; and it may be further subject to other changes, for which
the discoveries of M. Nièpce de St. Victor and—I venture to
add (from the frequency of storms at certain periods of the
moon’s age, and the sudden nature of other phaenomena)—the
experiments of electricians will possibly afford an explanation.

                         By Professor FARADAY.
   [The volume of reprinted ‘Experimental Researches in Che

                                      On Regelation.
      HE    subject of regelation has of late years acquired very
         great interest through the experimental investigations of
Tyndall, J. Thomson, Forbes and others, and in                         its
                                                           present state
will perhaps    justify   few additional remarks

cause.     On the first observation        the effect eight years ago,

I  attributed     it  the greater tendency which
                       to                               particle  afluid          of
water had        to
                  assume the solid state, when                   in
                                                       contact with ice
on two     or more sides, above that      had when
                                              it                  in

side  only.     Since then Mr. Thomson has shown that pressure
lowers the freezing-point          water*, and has pointed out how

                        those places, and         explains the fact

     find no difficulty in thinking it would be easy to arrange
a mixture of water and snow in such a manner that it might
be kept for hours and days without any transition of heat either
to or from it; but I find great difficulty in thinking that the par
ticles of snow, small as they may be made, would remain for the
whole of the time at a lower temperature by 0°3 F. than the
particles of water intermingled with them. Still, admitting for

in favour of the view.                   If
                            hydrated crystals of sulphate of soda,
carbonate of soda, phosphate of soda, &c.”, be carefully pre
pared in clean basins, by spontaneous evaporation of the water,
they will retain their form unbroken, and their hydrated state
undisturbed, through the high temperatures of a whole summer,
though, if broken or scratched even in winter, they will commence
to effloresce at the place where the cohesion, and with it the
balance of force, was disturbed, and will from thence change
progressively     throughout the whole masst.              As regelation con
cerns the condition of       water,  there is     perhaps  no occasion to go
further.      Such facts as the    following,      however, concern the ex
tension of the principle, and illustrate the power of cohesion,
especially in cases where it is coming into activity.                  Camphor
in  bottles,  or iodide of   cyanogen     in  proper   glass  vessels,  produces
crystals sometimes an inch or two in length, which grow by
the deposition of solid matter on them from an atmosphere
unable to deposit like solid matter upon the surrounding glass,
except at a lower temperature.            Crystals in solution grow by the
 deposition of solid matter on them which does not deposit else
where in the solution.         Many suchlike cases may be produced.
    Returning to the particular case of regelation, it is seen that
 water can remain fluid at temperatures below that at which ice
 forms, by virtue of the cohesion of                particles; andits          far              in     so
 the   change      isrendered   independent                             of

 Next, I     rest       on
                        the fact that ice has the same property                                                 as
 camphor, sulphur, phosphorus, metals, &c., which cause the
 deposition        solid particles upon them from the surrounding

  long, would form          the surrounding fluid; and these crystals,

   As to the gravitating force,      do not presume to say that  I                                                             I

being placed at different distances; but       have a strong convic                I
tion, through the influence on my mind of the doctrine of con
servation, that there is a change; and that the phaenomena
resulting from the change will probably appear some day as the
result of careful research.    If it be said that “’t were to con
sider too curiously to consider so,” then I must dissent: to
refrain to consider would be to ignore the principle of the con
servation of force, and to stop the inquiry which it suggests,
whereas to admit the proper logical force of the principle in
our hypotheses and considerations, and to permit            guidance                                     its

The various reactions to which we must have recourse give us
the elements of which rocks are composed, but usually in a state
of combination wholly different from that in which they previ

fectly clear conceptions about the nature of definite mineral
compounds, but by                  its
                          aid alone we could not hope        arrive                                  to                at

 172                 Mr. A. Gages             on a   Method of Observation
 as in some thermal springs. No doubt many of those volcanic
 products have been formed by natural processes similar to that
 which         I
          have described.                                  -
    The opals found in the basaltic district of the North of Ireland,
 and occurring in the cavities of amygdaloidal greenstone at the
 Giant's Causeway, have most probably been derived from the
 gelatinous silica of decomposed zeolites, while some of the spe
 cimens of the same locality described as hydrophane, resemble in
 a remarkable manner certain of the skeletons resulting from the
 action of acids upon some altered trap-rocks”.
    I may, as an illustration, refer to a variety of magnesite de
 rived from the decomposition of basalt, and described by General
 Portlock in his “Geological Report on the Counties of London
 derry, Tyrone, and Fermanagh, pp. 114 and 115. This mineral
 substance presents one of the best illustrations of the peculiar
 metamorphic changes which occur during the decomposition of
 some basalts.     Dr. Apjohn has given an analysis of the mineral
 at page 114 of the “Report' above named, from which it would
 appear to be a hydrous silicate of alumina and magnesia.        This
 mineral substance is of a greyish-white colour, and consists of a
series of parallel laminae.
    A lamina of this mineral, of about 2 centimetres square by
2 millimetres thick, when boiled for some time with hydrochloric
acid and then with sulphuric acid, leaves, after an action of several
days, a skeleton of amorphous silica, blackened by the sulphuric
acid acting upon organic matter derived, doubtless, from the water
of infiltration.    When the acid and organic matter are removed
by washing and ignition, there remains a skeleton of pure amor
phous silica lighter than water, and presenting the perfect form
of the primitive substance, visibly constituted of thin laminae su
perimposed like the leaves of a book.       After immersion in water
for a sufficient length of time, it becomes translucent, and acquires
 allthe characters            of
                       certain varieties   hydrophane. The quan

               applied to the study               of some Metamorphic Rocks.                                       173
 tity of water which it absorbs is more than 115 per cent.        If
 left exposed to the air for some time, the siliceous skeleton loses
 the greater part of the water, but retains a mean quantity of
about 6:40 per cent, which corresponds very nearly with the
formula 3Si, O”, HO given by Beudant for an opake white
opal from Castellamonte.
     Ifit be immersed in a solution of ammoniacal sulphate of
copper, and afterwards exposed to the open air, it retains a por
tion of the copper salt, even though subjected to repeated wash
ings, and in the moist state it presents the appearance of certain
varieties of silicate of copper (copper hydrophane); in sulphuric
acid the substance becomes hyaline, and retains a portion of
the acid with great tenacity even after repeated washings.        A
solution of caustic potash dissolves the skeleton with great faci
lity even after ignition.
   Although it seems difficult to ascribe to this siliceous matter
a capability of forming definite compounds, yet the facts just men
tioned are not less remarkable.      The molecular condition in
which the silica exists in such alumino-magnesian compounds as
I have described, and the action which it exerts on a great
number of substances, would appear to indicate a point of con
nexion between chemical phaenomena, strictly so called, and co
hesive forces”.
   As an illustration of the decomposition and subsequent recon
struction of rocks, I may refer to a pseudomorphite of quartz
rock, in            all
               probability derived from magnesite, and obtained

the mineral substances alluded to are nearly always enclosed;
on immersion in water, this skeleton becomes opalescent, and
exhibits many of the phaenomena of the skeletons already de
scribed.
  This mode of treatment by various solvents enables us at
once to account for the variations which occur in many of the
published analyses of serpentine, as it must be evident that the
nature, quantity, and stage of decomposition    of the enclosed
minerals must greatly vary.     My experiments on this subject
are not as yet sufficiently advanced to offer more than a few
concluding remarks respecting some properties which I have
lately observed in connexion with the skeletons of several speci

176 Remarks on recent Papers by Mr. Cayley and Prof. Challis.
rals leaving siliceous skeletons of amorphous silica, may be
distinguished at once from many other rocks, frequently consi
dered as serpentine.     The latter are often mere altered clay
slate, so nearly resembling true serpentine lithologically, as to
have been frequently confounded     with them,
                                             -  though quite di
stinct in chemical composition.
   The only object I have had in view in the preceding notice,
has been to direct the attention of geologists to the method; as
I am still occupied with the subject, I have thought it better to
reserve fuller details for another occasion.

     I take this opportunity of offering a remark on Professor
Challis’s “Proof that every Equation has as many Roots,” &c.
in your last Number.
    The sentence which commences on page 113 and terminates
on page 114, stands thus:—“Hence after eliminating z from
the above two equations, we may obtain a possible value of y”
from the resulting equation by methods of approximation.”                                     I

worth publishing in the Philosophical Magazine they are at
your service.

   The difference in appearance to an observer of a polished sur
face when at ordinary temperatures and when ignited, is suffi
ciently marked. The self-luminous character of the ignited
body apparently removes the impressions of surrounding objects,
and would lead to the belief that reflexion, at least that of the
character yielded by polished surfaces, was destroyed.          Such
has been the a priori impression of those whose opinions         have                                 I
asked on the subject.     My own belief was, that if polished sur

faces when ignited reflected light, they at       events broke       all                                  or
scattered the reflected rays, and would cease      have the character   to
of a  polished surface; and that        they reflected light
                                                       if                                         at      all   or
notably, they would reflect         paper  it     as         or

 The solar heat which is thus received by the ground may there
 fore be considered as confined almost entirely to a thin super
 ficial stratum. The air in contact with the soil becomes heated,
 expands, and tends to ascend: a circulation thus follows be
 tween the upper and lower strata of the atmosphere situated
 above the heated ground.            During the night a different process
 takes place; for then the radiation of the soil causes                tempera                   its
 ture   to fall below that          the superincumbent air; the coldest

   In the second case, the ocean would acquire much less heat

increase with the temperature of the heat-bearing oceanic cur
rents. A group of islands situated in high latitudes, and sur
rounded by currents possessing a high temperature, while re
ceiving but a small amount of heat from sunshine, should present
a series of closed isothermals, and, while their interiors would be
cold, their coasts might enjoy an extremely genial climate.
   5. If such conditions existed at former geological epochs, we
may fairly expect to find some evidence of their existence by com
paring the characters of the organized beings by which the
interior and the coasts of such islands were inhabited. Such geo
logists as have hitherto studied the diversities in structure of the
fossil remains which have come under their notice, appear to
have attended principally to the climatic influence of the eleva
tion of the interior parts of such islands. Professor Ramsay *, in
his memoir on the denudation of Wales, after pointing out the
great elevation above the sea, which portions of that region had
formerly possessed, calls attention to the resulting varieties of
climate that must have prevailed.       “If,” he says, “the climate
of our latitudes, when the coasts were washed by the new red,
and liassic seas, were tropical, as is generally supposed, still, on
the heights indicated on the vertical sections, we have ample
space for tropical and temperate zones, each probably abound

     6.   I shall
                now attempt to illustrate some of the preceding
general views from the actual condition of the earth’s surface.
The higher mean temperature of the northern compared to the
southern hemisphere is clearly proved and universally acknow
ledged.     This superior warmth is usually ascribed to the greater
amount of land in the former compared with the latter.         It has
been apparently assumed that the surface of the dry land exercises
upon the whole a far more energetic influence, in tending to
elevate the mean temperature of the earth, than the surface of
  thewater; and this action       generally ascribed
                                                 is     the superior                   to
heat-absorbing power                    of
                            land compared with water.      Upon this
assumption       mainly founded the beautiful and elaborate theory

192                   Prof. Hennessy on Terrestrial Climate as
result shows the danger of under-estimating the agency of aque
ous currents in connexion with any theory of the distribution
of land and water that may be proposed in order to explain
vicissitudes of terrestrial climate.
    7. In examining the consequences, resulting from the suppres
 sion of the Gulf-stream, on the climate of western Europe, with
reference to the question of glacial action at former geological
epochs, as has been done by Mr. Hopkins*, we need only direct
our attention to what actually takes place at corresponding lati
tudes in the southern hemisphere.    In these regions, there is not
only an absence of such an active calorific agent, but even an
abstraction of some of the heat due to them from the sunshine
which falls upon a portion of their oceans, which heat we have
 seen is transferred to the northern hemisphere.        Glaciers conse
 quently descend to the sea, not only about the latitude of 54° S.,
 as observed by Captain Cook, but even so close to the equator
 as 48° 30' S., where they were noticed in great abundance on
 the western coast of South America by Mr. Darwint.             He even
observed one instance of a      glacier  reaching  the sea in the lati
 tude of 46°40', which corresponds to that of Napoléon Vendée,
in the west of France. The existence of glacial action in the
 southern latitudes, equivalent to those of the temperate regions
of western Europe, suggests the possibility that, by an inversion
of the operating causes, the southern hemisphere might have
 enjoyed a milder climate at the same geological period that
 glacial phaenomena were most completely developed north of the
equator.
    8. The results of our inquiry may be thus recapitulated:—
    (1) The physical properties of water appear upon the whole
more favourable than those of the land, to the accumulation,
retention, and distribution of solar heat throughout the matter
composing the external coating of the earth.

  9. While fully acknowledging the important influence which
changes in the distribution of land and water may exercise on
terrestrial climate, we are not precluded from studying the action
of other causes, and of giving to them such weight as the evi
dences in their favour may render advisable.              from the                                If,

   There is then in this case a simple coalescing of the two mo
lecules, without the separation of hydrochloric acid.   This liquid
is heavier than water, which decomposes it with extreme slow
ness when cold, but rapidly when hot.      It dissolves readily in
dilute  potash,_chloride  of potassium and acetate of potash being
formed, and aldehyde regenerated, which is converted into a
resin by the action of the alkali when the latter is in excess. . If,

   is a fact of experience, that when rays of
       earth’s atmosphere, or other                                                     its temperature
is increased.  It would seem, therefore, that if we knew exactly
what rays of light are, we should have some clue for determining
the agency by which heat is produced. In the following outline
                                                                 I

of a mathematical theory of heat, adopt the hypothesis that
light-bearing undulations are such as were defined in my com
munication to the Philosophical Magazine for February, and
that, while light is due to the transverse vibrations, heat is the
result of the mechanical action of the direct vibrations.     The
heat-producing undulations are supposed to be compounded, as
       in the same communication, of simple wave-rays, in such
a manner that the transverse vibrations destroy each other.
   The ultimate atoms of material substances are inert, because
the inertia of a mass is the result of the inertia of its constituent
parts; they have magnitude and form, otherwise they are not
within the compass of mathematical reasoning; their form is
that of a sphere, because they are found by experience to have
 individually the same relations to           parts              all
                                                       space; and they             of
are hard and impenetrable, otherwise the spherical form               not                                is
necessarily preserved.       These hypotheses, which, with the ex
ception                 the spherical form, agree with the views ex
                byof
              that             of

to the square of the velocity of the secondary waves, and there
fore to the square of the velocity of the original waves, which
latter velocity varies inversely as the distance from a remote
origin, it follows that the heating effect of a radiating hot body
upon another distant body varies inversely as the square of the
distance between them, as is found by experiment to be the
Case.
      If the investigation
                        had taken account of terms of the second
order in the value of the velocity of the secondary waves propa
gated from the atom A (as terms of that order were taken into
account in the value of the condensation), the effect on the
motion of translation of the atom Al would have been of the
order of the fourth power of the incident velocity, and may
therefore be neglected in comparison with the effect due to
terms of the first order.
   The part of the velocity accompanied by condensation, which
was left out of account in the preceding investigation, has at
the surface          of the atom A the ratio
                                                                  ** to       the part considered,
8 being the radius of the   atom.    This ratio is so small that the
effect of the omitted   part  may   be wholly inappreciable.    It                                                is,
however,         observed that the velocity accompanied

               Note    Poinsot's four new regular Polyhedra (February
        Number,         123) was written without my being acquainted
with    Cauchy’s    first memoir, “Recherches sur les Polyédres”
 (Jour.  Polyt.   vol.            ix.
                           pp. 68–86, 1813), the former part          which                            of
 (pp. 68–76) relates          Poinsot's polyhedra. Cauchy considers

from the ordinary regular polyhedra               producing their sides
faces.     The reciprocal method would                produce the sides        to                                or or
join the vertices; and, adopting this reciprocal method, and pro
jecting the figure                on
                           the sphere,                           we

       For P= 1, we have Euler's equation S +H=A+2; and for
    P=0, we have a theorem relating to the partition of a polygon;
    viz. if the polygon is divided into H polygons, and if S be the
    number of vertices, and A the number of sides, then S-H H = A +1;
from which it is easy to pass to Euler's equation, S-H H = A +2,
for polyhedra. I remark that, in the equation S +H=A+1,
H should, in analogy with Cauchy's notation for polyhedra, be
replaced by P; so that we have for a single polygon,
                                           A=S;
    and for the partitions of a polygon,
                                       A=S+ P—     1   :
corresponding respectively                to Euler's theorem for a single poly
hedron, viz.
                                       S+H=A+2;
and to Cauchy’s theorem for the partitions                    of a polyhedron,           viz.
                                   S+H=A+2+(P–1).
   Cauchy's second memoir (pp. 87–98) contains a very beautiful
demonstration of the theorem implied in the ninth definition of
the eleventh book of Euclid, viz. that two convex polyhedra are
equal when they are bounded by the same number of faces equal
each to each.

              Dr. Debus on the Action of Ammonia on Glyoaal.                                    211,
now contains two organic bases—one in the shape of a crystalline
precipitate, which I propose to call glycosine, and the other in
solution, to which in this paper the name of glyoxaline will be
applied.    Besides these two substances, only a little formic acid and
the excess of ammonia can be recognized in the liquid.
  Glycosine=C, H, N,. The crystals contained in the ammoniacal
liquid are collected on     a filter and washed with cold water.   B
dissolving them in diluted hydrochloric acid, treating with charcoal,
and adding ammonia to the decolorized solution, the glycosine is
obtained as a colourless, crystalline precipitate.    The crystals are
little prisms, tasteless, inodorous, and only soluble in a great quan
tity of boiling water. They become very electric when rubbed in a
mortar.     A little glycosine placed between two watch-glasses and
heated on a sand-bath, sublimes without leaving a residue, and
produces magnificent prismatic needles, sometimes half an inch in
length. It forms salts with acids, which generally crystallize well.
The chloride has a great tendency to form double salts with the
chlorides of copper, mercury, and platinum.
    Chloroplatinate,   C, H, N,+2(HCl PtCl), forms a fine yellow
crystalline powder, soluble with difficulty in water. An excess of
water seems to abstract bichloride of platinum and hydrochloric
acid.    Glycosine is formed from ammonia and glyoxal according to
the equation—

                               occasion,
an aldehyde.   Its behaviour towards ammonia confirms my former
conclusions.  The formation of amarine, from oil of bitter almonds,
of acetonine from acetone and ammonia, takes place in a similar
manner        :-                                             -

   The first experiment failed, from the circumstance that the vapour
 decomposes with       slight explosion, when heated      few degrees                       a

on the walls of the glass balloon as a grey film, and the other
contents consisted of an inflammable gas. Mercuric ethyle appears
therefore to be resolved at this temperature into ethyle gas and
mercury.
   Another experiment was more successful, and gave the number
0.97 for the vapour-density.
   The equivalent weight of mercuric ethyle is 129, which, being
divided by the former figures, gives                             # = 12.94.                If the constituents
of this radicalbe condensed into two volumes of vapour, the                                                    more
accurate number 14-86 should have been obtained.
  The theoretical density of mercuric ethyle, thus calculated, is                                            equal
       129

chloride.

the thermometer soon rises to 200°; but beyond this point the vapour
is very prone to decomposition, with deposit of metallic lead.
   From this tendency to change, there is some difficulty in obtaining
the substance wholly pure from bodies with lower boiling-points.
The larger portion came over between 198° to 202°. Its specific
gravity was found to be 1:55.
   Analysis led to the formula
                             Pb C,     H, or Pb (C, H.),
    It should, however, be noticed that a trifling excess in the per
centage of carbon obtained, showed an increase rather than a decrease
in the number of equivalents of ethyle.
    This radical, for which the provisional name of plumbic bis-ethyle
is suggested, is a colourless fluid, possessing little or no odour.      It
is insoluble in water, but perfectly miscible with ether. It burns
readily with a beautiful orange-coloured flame, edged with blue, and
gives off fumes of oxide of lead.
    The radical appears to be incapable of forming salts without a
partial decomposition.      With weak acids there is no perceptible
action; but when they are concentrated and gently heated, a gas is
  iven off, and crystalline salts are produced.
    The chloride is insoluble in water, but soluble in alcohol and in
ether, from which last liquid it crystallizes in satiny needles, which are
very volatile and provoke sneezing and lachrymation.         It burns with
the characteristic lead flame, and by long digestion with concentrated
hydrochloric acid, is converted into chloride of lead and volatile
products.
    The sulphate also appears as a crystalline mass when plumbic-bis
ethyle is gently warmed with a few drops of concentrated sulphuric
acid.    It is conveniently prepared by agitating the materials in a
stoppered bottle, an exit being made from time to time for the gas
which is liberated.

bable that some molecular change is produced by the action of boil
ing, even if only for a short time; therefore it was necessary to make
a concentrated solution at 120° F., and set in repose for some days
at 62°F., by which precaution the solution experienced only a very
slight discoloration.   When formerly experimenting on 3-quinidine,
the author obtained an iodo-sulphate very different from that which
he has described as indicative of the quinidine of Pasteur: having
pursued this inquiry, he is now enabled to state that his former dis
crepancies arose from the fact that quinidine forms two iodo-sul-
phates, according to the manner in which it is treated.

  optically distinct from those of quinine and quinidine. He has already
  produced three salts from ethyle-quinine, having optical characters
 different from any previously described.
    1st. A deep purple-red salt by transmitted light, in thicker plates
 or aciculae quite impervious to light. This salt occurs as very slender
 acicular prisms; it has a brilliant metallic-green reflected tint, but
 very little double absorption.
    2nd. There is a foliaceous salt, having a plate-like form, a deep
 red or orange-red colour, transmitting an orange-yellow, having only
 slight optical powers.
    3rd. A salt having many of the characters of the new quinidine

   Those who have occupied themselves with the determination of
refractive indices, must have noticed that changes of temperature
influence the amount of refraction; yet few of the observations on
record have affixed to them the temperature at which they were
made, and few, if any, numerical researches have been published on
the subject. To determine, if possible, the amount and character of
this effect of heat was the object of the present inquiry.
   The instrument employed was that described by the Rev. Baden
Powell in the British Association Report for 1839, and was kindly
lent by him for the purpose. The substances more or less fully
examined, were bisulphide of carbon, water, ether, methylic, vinic,
amylic, and caprylic alcohols, the two principal constituents of
creasote—hydrate of phenyle and hydrate of cresyle, phosphorus,                                                          oil
of  cassia, and camphor dissolved     alcohol.                        in

On the Influence                       of Temperature                on the Refraction             of Light.             223
 The following                        are the conclusions arrived                       at:-
  1.       In
          every substance the refractive index diminishes as the tem
perature increases.   This is seen in the first four columns of the
tabulated results, which represent the refractive indices of the fixed
lines of the spectrum A, D, and H respectively at the temperatures
indicated, while the succeeding column shows the amount of differ
ence for each five degrees Centigrade,      This change of refractive
index  by  heat, for which the term sensitiveness is proposed, varies
greatly in amount in different substances, melted phosphorus and
bisulphide of carbon being the most, and water the least sensitive of
the liquids examined.
   2. The length of the spectrum varies as the temperature increases.
The difference between the refractive indices of the lines A and H,
or p, pu, is taken as the measurable length of the spectrum, and is
given in the sixth column.     In the case of highly dispersive sub
stances, as bisulphide of carbon and hydrate of phenyle, it decreases
considerably; in the case of less dispersive bodies, as the alcohols, it
 decreases to a less extent; while with water the change is not
                                                 *
 appreciable.
º
   3. In some substances the dispersive power is diminished, in
 others it is augmented by a rise of temperature; that             such                                       is,   in
 substances    bisulphide ascarbon,                  of
                                         the numerator     the fraction   is                            of
            that          decreases          fastest,      while     in it   such substances             as   water       is
                                                                                                                         it
the denominator.                           The result of this
                                               shown     the last column. is                  in
       The sensitiveness
      4.                           substance     independent
                                                  of   a              specific is                       of    its
                         to or
refractive       dispersive   power.     Thus water and ether are very
similar         as
                 the actual amount                                      of
                                             the refraction and dispersion
exhibited  by   them,   but ether      many   times more sensitive
                                                                is       heat                                       to
than water is.
       The amount
      5.                  sensitivenessof  not directly proportional is   the                                        to

                                                     temperature; yet there          of
 is some relationship between the two phenomena. Thus                   water                                   in
the index        refraction and the density both change much more

  “On the Adaptation of the Human Eye to varying Distances.”
By Charles Archer, Esq., Surgeon, Bengal Army.
   The following is a summary of the author's views on the question:—
   1. The eye is adapted to varying distances principally by an alter
ation in the fibrous arrangement of the lens itself.    Moreover, that
when the lens is removed after an operation for cataract, the power
of adaptation is nearly lost, and can only be exerted within very
confined distances.
    2. That the purpose of focalizing light at short distances is doubt
less assisted, as suggested by Bowman, by the contractions of the
ciliary muscle, in                      its
                         antero-posterior direction, bringing forward the
ciliary processes.
        That
        3.               as
                 the posterior hemisphere      the capsule    firmly united     of                    is
to  the  hyaloid  membrane,   this portion must   always  remain quiescent,
and therefore the     antero-posterior  contractions     the ciliary muscle                    of
must           be
           very limited     regards the lens.  as
                                                                                                                               of its

short axis.
        6.    That the lens itself,    microscopically described
                                                         as                Bowman                              by

the sodium, was next introduced, and the tube hermetically sealed.
So prepared, the apparatus was afterwards placed in cold water, and
left therein for several days, being cautiously shaken up at intervals.
   During this time the following changes were noted in the contents
of the tube. The sodium became coated with zinc, and gradually
disappeared, whilst the total volume of the solid and liquid contents
diminished considerably.     The liquid became also viscid, and some
times separated into two portions non-miscible with each other, be
coming, however, homogeneous as the operation advanced. There
was no evolution of gas.
   After the lapse of some days the apparatus was found to contain
metallic zinc and a clear colourless liquid. The former was weighed
and found to correspond to the sodium dissolved, one equivalent of
zinc being precipitated for each equivalent of sodium dissolved.
   The clear liquid was made the subject of special examination. It
consisted of zinc-ethyle holding in solution a crystalline compound
containing sodium, zinc, and ethyle.     It was inflammable to the last
degree, burning explosively, on exposure to the air, with a yellow
flame, and leaving a very alkaline residue.      Owing to its extreme
tendency to become oxidized, its manipulation presented great diffi
culties.   It was requisite to decant it into bulbs filled with dry hy
drogen or coal-gas; and since heat produced partial decomposition,
the bulbs had to be double, so that the heated bulb might not receive
the liquid.
                                        -
   The clear  liquid deposited large quantities of beautiful crystals
when cooled to zero; and when gently warmed in a stream of dry
hydrogen gas, so long as zinc-ethyle came off it yielded also a mass
of crystals. Some crystals were prepared in the latter manner; they
fused at about 27°C., but once fused they remained fluid at several
degrees below that point.      Numerous analytical determinations
prove that these crystals contain two equivalents of zinc for every
equivalent of sodium, and that their formula is

sodium-ethyle adopted in this paper.

   The following communication was read:—
    “On the mode of formation of Volcanic Cones and Craters.”
 By G. Poulett Scrope, Esq., M.P., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   The author commenced by saying that he should not have referred
 again to this subject, already briefly treated by him in a paper read
 to the Society in April 1856, had it not been that Baron Humboldt,
 in the recently published fourth volume of his “Kosmos,’ applies
the whole weight of his great authority to the support of the theory
 of upheaval in contradistinction to eruption as the vera causa of
volcanic cones and craters,      a theory which the author, with Sir
Charles Lyell, M. Constant Prévost, and many others, believes to
be not merely erroneous, but destructive of all clearness of appre
hension as to the character of the subterranean forces, and the part
which volcanic action has played in the structural arrangement of
the earth's surface.
    He showed, by reference to the works of Spallanzani, Dolomieu,
Breislak, &c., that the early observers of volcanic rocks and phe
nomena, together with the unscientific world, looked upon volcanic
cones and craters, whether large or small, as the result of volcanic
eruptions; but that of late years a new doctrine had been propa
gated by MM. Humboldt, von Buch, Elie de Beaumont,                    and
Dufrénoy, which denies altogether that volcanic mountains have been
formed by the accumulation of erupted matters, and attributes them
solely to a sudden “bubble-shaped swelling-up" of pre-existing
horizontal strata,    the bubble sometimes bursting at top and then
leaving  its broken sides tilted      up
                                    around     hollow (elevation-crater).

green into blue (Pogg. Ann. vol. xxxv, p. 307).   But neither in
this nor in a subsequent paper are the numerical data furnished
by the author. We find stated neither the magnitude of the
deflections of his thermo-multiplier, nor the width of the spectra
upon which he experimented.         In short, in Melloni’s memoir
there are no fixed data whatever from which the curve of thermal
intensity in the solar spectrum might be constructed.
   At first Melloni regarded the rays of heat and light as essen
tially different; subsequently he pronounced his opinion distinctly
as to their being completely identical.
   The latter opinion, that rays of light and heat of the same
refrangibility are absolutely identical, is also advocated by
Masson and Jamin (Comptes Rendus, vol. xxxi. p. 14), who
state that they found that      rays          all             of
                                         heat within the visible
spectrum are equally well transmitted                          by

alum, glass, water, &c., and that the unequal diathermancy                                           of

broken than the red.      There     probably  is  doubt        the cor             as   to
rectness       this result; still the above-mentioned
                of                                          physicists
should not have withheld the experiments which they consider
to   have justified them        coming  in this conclusion; for the
                                                          to
mere enunciation           of
                        the result  obtained,  without the adduction
of   experimental evidence, can have little scientific value.                                        If
Masson and Jamin had published the observations which led
them   to  the above conclusions, we should doubtless have been
thereby provided with ample material                           to

    In order that the reader may be enabled to compare the action
 of my instrument with that of others, I may here describe some
experiments performed  with this aim in view.
   The flame (3 inches in height) of a Bunsen gas-jet, without
the employment of a reflector, at a distance of 3 decimetres
caused a deflection of 32° when radiating upon the quadratic
thermo-battery, and a deflection of 11° when shining upon the
linealone—these deflections being shown by the multiplier before
described.                                  -
     A blackened copper-plate*, heated by a spirit-lamp at                                      a   di
stance of 2.5 decimetres, caused the multiplier to show deflections
of 43° and 14° when radiating upon the quadratic and lineal
thermo-batteries respectively.    The solar rays with which I ex
perimented were reflected into the darkened room, through a
hole in the shutter of the window, from the metallic mirror of
one of Silbermann’s heliostats, which was set up outside.
   Concerning the exactness of the following experiments, I have
only further to add a few remarks.
   The scale of the multiplier is only divided into intervals of
five degrees; so that the readings off are only exact to ; a de
gree at furthest.  A greater exactness in the reading off would,
moreover, be wholly unreal; for, in the first place, the position
of the needle of the multiplier was never a very definite one,
after the source of radiant heat was removed, the variations
being about ; a degree; secondly, the placing of the lineal
thermo-battery in the spectrum was not capable of the same
degree of accuracy as the reading off of the multiplier, because
the spectrum was not pure enough to show Fraunhofer’s lines.
   It seems at present in vain to think of showing the existence
of cold bands in the spectrum corresponding to Fraunhofer's
dark lines; indeed, our knowledge of the thermal properties of
the spectrum       is still far behind that of                its   optical ones         in   respect
to   accuracy.

   After some preliminary experiments,                                           the following arrange
ment     the apparatus was adopted:—
                      of

                         of the Solar   Spectrum.                              241
   The rays reflected from the metallic mirror of a heliostat
entered the dark room through a slit 3 millims. in width. About
3 inches from the slit, a crown-glass prism was so placed that the
transmitted rays underwent about the minimum deflection.           A
piece of tinfoil was glued upon the anterior face (that nearest
the light) of this prism; by removing a strip of this foil 3 millims.
in width, a second slit was produced immediately before the
prism.    Of course the prism was properly cleaned from glue at
the part whence the tinfoil had been removed.
   The lineal thermo-battery was placed at such a distance from
the prism, that the visible spectrum had at that place a width of
18 millims. ; this is the same spectral width as in Franz's ex
periments. The thermo-battery was fastened upon the brass rail
of Melloni’s apparatus, which stood at right angles to the pencil
of rays emergent from the prism. The rail, upon which the
thermo-battery could be easily moved and fixed, was divided into
Paris lines.
   A commutator was introduced in the connexion between the
thermo-battery and the multiplier, and the latter was read off
before, during, and after the thermo-battery was subjected to the
radiation of any especial family of rays from the prism.
     Anexample may render this course of observation more clear.
   The thermo-battery was brought into the red of the spectrum;
the solar rays which penetrated through the first slit were then
received upon a pasteboard screen; that          is,
                                             the thermo-battery
was protected from radiation.   On closing the commutator, the
needle    of
          the multiplier stood     at
                                 +3°-5.
The screen protecting the prism was now withdrawn,                  sothat the
thermo-battery received red rays; the needle                of   the multiplier
stood     at
                                  –7°.
On again intercepting the incident rays,     that the thermo
                                                     so
battery was again protected from radiation, the needle    the             of
multiplier stood again     at
                                 +3°5.
     Now the conclusion hence      to   be   drawn   is,   that the radiation
of  the red rays upon the thermo-battery had                in  this instance
effected   deflection of 10°-5.
           a
   The commutator was now reversed, and the observation re
peated    in
          the same manner:        was now found that the radiation
                                 it
of the red rays     on
                     the thermo-battery caused  deflection

   This prism was an equilateral one, each side being 36 millims.
long.    The prism from end to end was 44 millims. As it was
impossible to stick tinfoil upon this prism without injuring the
incident surface, a sheet of brass was employed instead, in which
a slit 3 millims. wide was cut, and which was placed close before
the incident surface of the rock-salt prism.
   In the following Table the results of two series of experiments
are given, each series having been performed in exactly the same
manner as that described in speaking of the glass prism.

                        of the Solar  Spectrum.                 245
values for w and e, namely those belonging to the Fraunhofer's
line B,                wi-690,        e=1:526;
secondly,   those belonging to the Fraunhofer's line F,
                        w-485,         e=1.536;
and- finally, those belonging to the Fraunhofer's line H,
                        w-396,         e=1:546
 (multiplying the real value of w with 1000000, in order to
avoid the decimal places), we obtain three equations, from which
the following values of a, b, and c are derived:—
                            a= 1391460,
                             = –1796460,
                            c=      580000.
    Substituting these numbers in equation (1), we get
                  wi-1391460–1796460e-H 580000e”.        .    .  (2)
From this equation the undular length of the extreme thermal
rays of the solar spectrum is obtained by substituting for e the
index of refraction 1:506: we get then
                               w-  1770;
or, rather, redividing by 1000000,
                               w-0-00177.

a graphic manner.          In fig. 2, the line R S represents the

scale as fig. 1, p. 242.    From the points H, G, F, D and B,
which correspond to the Fraunhofer's lines occurring at these
points, perpendiculars are drawn whose lengths are propor
tional to the undular lengths. This proportion is such that a
difference of 5 millims. in height corresponds to a difference of
0.0001 millim. in the undular length. The curve a b, drawn
through the extremities of the perpendiculars H, G, F, D and B,
represents, then, the law connecting the undular length with the
refractive index in crown-glass.
    The curve a b is continued beyond b in such a manner that
the course of the continued portion b c joins in as continuous a
manner as possible the portion a b which has been derived from
observations; in other words, the law, according to which the
undular length and refractive index are connected in the visible
portion of the spectrum, is preserved in the graphic continuation
of the curve into the ultra red dark thermal rays.

 racy, still it represents the essential distribution of heat in the
 diffraction-spectrum.        Draper's assertion, that the maximum
 heat falls in the yellow, is certainly thereby supported; but it
 by no means follows thence, that “the distribution of heat corre
 sponds to the distribution of light,” as Draper asserts.          Draper,
 indeed, entirely ignores the dark portion of the thermal spec
 trum, appearing to imagine that the intensity of heat, like that
 of light, diminishes equally towards the violet and red bounda
 ries of the visible spectrum.                                        -
    Because, in the refraction-spectrum, the curve of luminous
 intensity differs so entirely from the course of the thermal
 curve, the two curves cannot coincide in the diffraction-spec
 trum, although in the latter the luminous and thermal maxima
 approach one another incomparably more closely than in the
 refraction-spectrum.                                                     -
    We see from fig. 4, p. 249, that the dark thermal rays in
 the diffraction-spectrum occupy a space which is about 3} times
 as broad as the whole visible spectrum.         In the diffraction image
 formed    by  a  grid*,  the dark  part  of the first thermal spectrum
 extends accordingly on both sides as far as the violet of the
 third light spectrum, that                         is,

course to be understood that the mean value of that magnitude
is the factor to be used in the multiplication; or, what is the
same thing in other words, that the integral of the tendency with
respect to the change is the quantity in question.
   When applied to the mechanics of bodies moving uniformly,
the conservation of the quantity now described means neither
more nor less than the old principle of “virtual velocities.”
   3. Inasmuch as the word “force” has for a long time been
used to denote a tendency of a pair of bodies to change of rela
tive motion, a kind of magnitude to which no law of conserva
tion applies, the use of the phrase “conservation of force’ gives
rise to misapprehensions and groundless disputes, by implying a
different meaning of the word “force; ” and even although that
phrase has been sanctioned and widely spread by Mr. Grove’s
celebrated work, it is much to be desired that a phrase should
be adopted in                its
                   stead about which there         ambiguity, such             is   no

   A BCE represents a glass tube,
with an enlargement at CD, bent                       #R
somewhat in the form of the Wür
temberg siphon, and fixed at R to
the rod of a retort-stand; E F a deep
jar filled with distilled water; A G a
small glass vessel containing the                  li
quid whose specific gravity is to be
determined.     The tubes AB and
DC are graduated into inches and
tenths, the divisions on the former
being measured from the top of the
tube A, and on the latter from the
top of the tube E. The length of
A B or EC may be about 13 inches,                                G
and CD about 3% inches; the dia
meter of the portions A B and ED
may be # an inch, and that of the
portion CD about 1 inch. The jar
EF    should be deep enough to sub
merge the tube EC.         The tops of
the tubes at A and E should be plane
sections at right angles to the axes
of the tubes. The instrument is used
in the following manner:—
   The glass G, being at first, empty, is raised by a thin block
of wood, causing the bent tube A to touch the bottom of the
glass; the      jar
                  EF, nearly filled with distilled water, elevated              is

On a Method             of determining          the Specific        Gravity         of Liquids.                 255
glass.   Now the water will stand exactly at the top of the tube E,
and the liquid exactly at the top of the tube A.; and as the two
columns of liquids are supported by the same atmospheric pres
sure, the specific gravities or densities of the two liquids will be
to each other inversely as the heights of their respective columns.
The heights of the respective columns being read off to inches
and tenths of inches, the quotient arising from the division of
the length of the column of water by the length of the column
of liquid will give the specific gravity of the liquid at the tempe
rature of observation, that of water being unity.       The specific
gravity of the liquid may thus be readily found true to three
places of figures, and, by using a hand vernier, to four places of
figures.  The allowance necessary to be made for the curvature
due to cohesion, as well as the method of reducing the specific
gravities to mean temperature, are too well known to require
any explanation in this place.

   This abstract or theoretical black mica, probably exists only as
an idea or conception in our minds, and may not have a concrete
development in any place; but it must be regarded as an essen
tial constituent of the original granite formed in the astrono
mical epoch by the cooling of our globe. All our researches
tend to prove that there is an original or type-granite, charac
teristic of the azoic epoch of the earth’s history, marked mine
ralogically by the presence of four important minerals,<

been gained by the continued study of the subject, which has
induced the author of the new theory to modify very con
siderably the views which he first published two years ago.
Having been sagacious enough to perceive the true cause of the
phaenomenon in question, he has been led to alter his view as to
the modus operandi: his theory is no longer a merely mechanical
one, in which it is assumed that pressure must have upon the
particles of glacier ice the same effect that it has upon those of
mud; it is now a physical theory, depending upon the known
properties of the particular substance of which glaciers are com
posed, and one capable of being directly brought to the test of
experiment.
   Having frankly admitted so much,                     I
                                                   claim permission to
point out one or two particulars in which the chain of demon
stration framed with so much knowledge and ingenuity seems
to me still incomplete, and to urge that there may be still some
residual phaenomena in glacier structure not accounted for by
Professor Tyndall’s theory, and capable of interpretation through
the action of other physical causes.
   The conclusive argument against the so-called stratification
theory is derived from the remarkable appearances which Pro
fessor Tyndall observed last summer on the Furgge Glacier near
Zermatt. The situation was one which exposed him to con
siderable danger in approaching close to the ice, and the illus
tration exhihited at the Royal Institution did not look very like
the ordinary veined structure; but in the case of so bold an
alpine traveller, and so practised an observer, I have no doubt
whatever of the complete accuracy of the statement, that in that
place the veined structure was seen cutting through the planes
of the stratification of the névé, and, further, that Professor
Tyndall satisfied himself that this veined structure is developed
in a direction perpendicular to that of pressure acting on the
glacier. Further than this,               I
                                     am quite satisfied with the accu
racy of the more general statement, that in the three ordinary
cases in which we are able to detect the veined structure, the
surfaces that compose it are disposed at right angles to the
direction in which pressure is actually at work, or has previously
acted, upon the glacier ice.       Is it therefore necessary to believe
that the veined structure           is,
                                      every case, product
                                          in                a  pressure   of

some force must have been at work in the space between E and
F to effect this change in the direction of the planes of the
veined structure.     Nothing of the kind, however, need take
place.   The compression at E, and the resulting transverse
structure, are merely superficial as compared to the entire thick
ness of the glacier.   In the neutral zone, which has undergone
neither compression nor tension during the passage of the ice
cataract, the structure originally developed at A may well sur
vive, and when superficial waste has cleared away the portion
affected by transverse compression, the old longitudinal structure
comes again to the surface.
       Why we neversee indications of a cross-bar structure in cases
where pressure is applied in a new direction to ice already pos
sessing the veined structure, is a question that seems to me to
deserve further examination. Experiments such as have already                       I
suggested, which should include this inquiry, might probably
give interesting results.

    Before closing these remarks, beg to call the attention of
observers to a point of glacier structure which has obtained but
little notice. At the lower extremity of glaciers, where a stream
issues from a cavern in the ice, there is almost always apparent
a tendency to split in curved surfaces, which, in part at least,
cut perpendicularly the planes of the veined structure.     is to                             It
this tendency that the caverns whence the glacier torrents issue
owe their arched form. .                   It
                                  is clear that this is no merely acci
dental hollowing out of the cavity above the stream; for above

these sparks may be found relevant to the present question.  the                                              If
terminals be connected with a spark-micrometer opened to about
twice the striking distance, when the machine acts, a lucid star
will appear on one or both points. Bringing them gradually
closer, a small brush, exactly like that produced by a point on a
prime conductor, is seen at the positive point: as the distance is
lessened, the filaments of this brush extend, and at last curve
towards the negative with a sputtering sound.     Still nearer, and
 sparks strike across with an intense light and sharp snap, which
 cannot possibly be mistaken for the preceding form of discharge:
they are zigzag; and, when the excitation is powerful, two-thirds
bf their length at the positive end is often red, the rest bluish
white.     If the distance be less, the spark has that strange yel
low envelope which, as Du Moncel has shown, can be blown
aside like a flame, but which is certainly not a second discharge”.
And at very short distances there is sometimes a sheaf of curved
sparks between the points.        If one terminal be connected with
the gas-pipes of the house, and the arm of the micrometer which
had been joined to it be connected with the floor (so that the
circuit includes a very great resistance), we obtain what is
called the static discharge, which is of the same character
as the inductive one discovered by Mr. Gassiot, and, like
                                                                                                                   it,

for about two-thirds of the distance, brightest in the axis:
this is full of strata, thick near the point and curved round it
like spheric shells, thinner below and less curved, till at the lower
termination of the positive light they are nearly plane and only
0.05 or 0.06 thick. In the bright central portion they seem
thicker than their continuations into the surrounding part,
which are also bent back abruptly.                              If

powerful, the curvature of the lower strata is reversed, these
being in that case formed, as Mr. Gassiot has shown, by that
current which passes on closing the primary circuit.             Below the
positive light is a dark space from 0-5 to 2' wide; and lower
still is an atmosphere of bright blue light (which                  call the           I
aigrette).     It is generally conical with a convex base, never
shows strata, but seems to be composed of rays diverging from
the negative point.          From this, however, it is separated by
a thin dark space surrounding it like a wrapper, and within
that by a reddish-violet one. Along the glass tube, below this,
positive light with               its

274            On the Stratification   of Electric Light,
they have a strong resemblance to the explosion-pictures, and
also to the yellow envelope already referred to as surrounding
short sparks; but, as it seems to me, their analogy to the strata
is far from complete.      The transverse divisions scarcely ever go
 entirely across, and have no regularity; the jagged fringes and
 serrated points which form the outline, are in strong contrast
with the smooth and comparatively definite boundary which the
light often shows; but, above all, the markings extend through
 the whole track of the discharge, and there is nothing analogous
to the dark space or the blue negative light.          In fact the two
 sets of phaenomena   seem to    belong  to different categories:    one
is the transfer of matter laterally from the axis of discharge by
a vehement repulsion; the other is a succession, along a certain
portion of that axis, of fits of discontinuity in the light-producing
power of the current. That power, for a certain further distance,
totally ceases, to reappear without any intermission, and with
the development of rays of higher refrangibility.        It is certainly
possible that, in rarefied air, these so-called autographs might
assume a similar character; but unless this prove to be the
case, I think it will be felt that some further step is neces
sary to complete the explanation. As it now stands, any one
who compares a fine set of strata with (for example) the superb
drawings of exploded wire in Wan Marum's Description d'une
très-grande machine Electrique, will scarcely admit them to be
results of the same action, that of mere repulsive force.
   It has been for some time my own opinion that the strata are
caused by these periods of intensity, but in a different way from
that just mentioned,—by the successive zones along the axis
becoming charged up to the point of disruption.                     I
                                                              feel, how
ever, that any exposition of it must be premature till more facts
are collected, and   still more till we have   a mathematical           investi
gation of a current’s motion in an imperfect conductor. While
such labourers as Faraday, Gassiot, and Grove himself are in the
field, we can have little doubt that the harvest will not be long
unreaped; and we may surely expect that some powerful mind
will ere long bring within the domain of analysis the hypothesis
(which every day confirms) that electricity                  is,

they vanished instantaneously, and without leaving a trace; at
others they disappeared more slowly, leaving a fixed residue.

    Simmler, in a paper in Poggendorff’s Annalen”, has put forth
the view that the expansible liquid may in many of the cases have
been liquid carbonic acid.
    Brewster first determined the coefficient of expansion of the
more expansible liquid, and found that between 10° and 26° it
expanded from 1'000 to 1:250, or a quarter of                 bulk    between          its              ;

280      Messrs.        W. H.   Perkim and B.      F. Duppa on the Action of
acid.  Diamond often contains cavities, and, as Brewster has
observed, with accompanying   circumstances which point to a
strong pressure in the interior, although he does not state
whether they contained water.
   Brewster explained his observations of the coloured rings
with the black cross, around the cavities, by ascribing to the dia
mond a gummy consistence and vegetable origin.            Simmler
suggests that it may rather be compared to that of unequally com
pressed glass.
  To confirm this view of the formation of diamonds, it would
be necessary to prove that liquid carbonic acid possessed a sol
vent power for carbon similar to that which bisulphide of carbon
has for sulphur, or liquid sulphide of phosphorus for phosphorus.
Experiments which Simmler made in this direction with a view
of preparing liquid carbonic acid by Faraday's method, gave no
results, as the tubes always exploded.

    From considerations which we shall not discuss here, it ap
 peared  probable that malic and tartaric acids might be produced
 from succinic acid by a process similar to that by which we ob
 tained glycolic and glyoxylic acids from acetic acid, namely, by
 treating   bromine or chlorine replacement acids derived from
 succinic acid with the hydrate of silver or potassium.          Thus
 with monobromo-succinic acid we should expect the following
 reaction:-

    We are now endeavouring to obtain the bromo- or chloro
succinic acids, so that we may fully investigate this matter.
    The late experiments of Wurtz on lactic acid show that when
it is distilled with pentachloride of phosphorus, it yields a sub
stance, C8H40°Cl”, which has since been shown to be the
 chloride of chloropropionyle; for by the action of water it is
 converted into chloropropionic acid, which, when acted upon by
nascent hydrogen, is converted into propionic acid.
    We may here mention that we have made similar experiments
with glycolic acid.      This substance, when distilled with penta
 chloride of   phosphorus,  yielded oxychloride of phosphorus and
 chloride of chloracetyle, which with water decomposed into hy
 drochloric and chloracetic acids; and this chloracetic acid was
 converted into acetic by the action of nascent hydrogen.
    With these results before us, it appeared probable, if malic
 acid stood to succinic acid as lactic and glycolic stand to pro
 pionic and acetic, that by treatment with pentachloride of phos
phorus it would yield a chloride which would represent the
 chloride of chlorosuccinyle, C*(H*Cl)0°, Cl*.
    We have made this experiment, and obtained the following
results:—
    One part of malate of calcium was well mixed with four of
 pentachloride    of phosphorus; this was then placed in a retort
 connected with a receiver and suitable apparatus for absorbing
hydrochloric acid.      On applying heat to the retort for a few
 moments, chemical action set in and continued for some time;
after it had ceased, heat was again -applied until no more liquid
 distilled over.

282       Action      of Pentaehloride of Phosphorus                 on    Malic Acid.
   The distillate was then transferred to a retort and heated.
Large quantities of liquid came over at 110°C., which consisted
of oxychloride of phosphorus: after a time the thermometer
began gradually to rise; when it had reached 160°, the retort
and contents were allowed to cool to 120°; dry air was then
passed, in order to separate as much oxychloride of phosphorus as
possible; heat was again applied, and the product distilled.    It
commenced    distilling  at about 170°, the thermometer gradually
rising; in fact no fixed boiling-point could be obtained, as the
product decomposed with evolution of hydrochloric acid.
   The substance thus obtained is a colourless mobile liquid,
heavier than water; when added to cold water, it sinks as an oil.
   With alcohol it reacts powerfully, producing an etherial body;
with ammonia it forms a white, nearly insoluble substance.
   We have not been able to obtain this body sufficiently pure
for analysis, consequently have had to content ourselves with
the analysis of        its
                     derivatives.

 I     believe   Iam correct           asserting that mathematicians who
                                           in
have treated      of the   hypothetical      medium from which transverse
vibrations have been deduced, have shown that the constitution
 (isotrope) which conducts               transverse vibrations excludes any
                                             to
change     of  density, and therefore excludes any normal vibrations
that can have connexion with the phaenomena                         light.     Henceof
if  experiment proves,                as
                                    above stated, that normal vibrations
have  a   real effect       on
                            phaenomena           light, follows that the hy

Prof. Challis on the Theory               of Elliptically-polarized Light.       287
which   I  have advanced in the Cambridge Philosophical Transac
tions, vol. viii. part 3, and in the Philosophical Magazine for
December 1852.             I
                         have there demonstrated the existence of
axes of rectilinear   transmission,  and of simultaneous normal and
transverse vibrations, on hydrodynamical principles, no other
hypothesis being made respecting the medium than that the
density varies as the pressure.         Suppose a wave-ray of this
theory to be incident on a reflecting surface, and the transverse
vibrations to be resolved in directions perpendicular and parallel
to the plane of reflexion.     Now although we may not yet be able
to determine by mathematical reasoning the precise manner in
which the ray comports itself at the moment of reflexion, from
experimental facts we have reason to say that the reflexion does
not take place strictly at the surface of the medium, but that the
F.     of the axis of the ray penetrates to a certain minute distance
  elow the surface.       Nothing is less unlikely, considering the
geometrical relations of the directions of the vibrations to the
superficies of the medium, than that this distance should be differ
ent for the two sets of vibrations, and that the observed change
of phase is owing to this circumstance.
    There is another question relating to this experiment which
requires an answer. Why is the change of phase not apparent
unless the incident ray be plane-polarized : The theory of po
larization, founded on hydrodynamical principles, which             have     I
proposed in the Cambridge Philosophical Transactions, vol. viii.
part 3, gives the following explanation:—If a ray of common
light be divided into two plane-polarized rays which pursue the
same course with difference of phase, the compound ray is still
equivalent to a ray of common light; but if a plane-polarized
ray be similarly divided, the compound ray is circularly or ellip
tically polarized. The commonly received theory of polarization,
which rests upon the hypothetical medium before referred                         to,
incapable    ofgiving     like explanation, because
                               a                            incapable

making      a distinction between common       light  and elliptically
polarized light.

   The tendency of recent theories of light has been to evade the
difficulty respecting the constitution of the aetherial medium, by
seeking to discover only a representation of the facts of light by
analytical formula.    But the grouping of facts under formulae
is not the same thing as comprehending them in a theory, which
always implies the discovery of a modus operandi. A good theory
of light ought to make known the characteristics                                of the medium
through which the phaenomena are produced.

THE“Note   on Sodium-ethyle and Potassium-ethyle.”                                     By Edward
Frankland,       Ph.D., F.R.S.                              -
  The recent interesting discovery of sodium-ethyle and potassium
ethyle by Mr. Wanklyn, led me to investigate the cause of the non
formation of these bodies by reactions analogous to those success
fully used for the production of zinc-ethyle and similar organo-metallic
compounds.      In my earlier experiments upon the isolation of the
organic radicals, I studied the action of potassium and sodium upon
iodide of ethyle, and found that the latter compound was readily de
composed   by either of the metals at a temperature of from 100° to
130°C. The separated ethyle was, however, transformed almost com
pletely into hydride of ethyle and olefiant gas, whilst not a trace of
potassium-ethyle or sodium-ethyle was produced. Mr. Wanklyn has
since repeated this experiment    with the addition of ether, and has
obtained the same result as regards the non-formation of an organo
metallic compound.
   The temperature at which sodium decomposes iodide of ethyle is
much lower than that at which sodium-ethyle is broken up, conse
quently no explanation of the phenomenon can be obtained from
this source. In his observations on the formation of ethyle”, Brodie
mentions that iodide of ethyle is decomposed at 170°C. by zinc-ethyle;
and it therefore occurred to me that sodium-ethyle, owing to         more                      its
powerful affinities, might effect the decomposition      iodide    ethyle  of             of
     lower temperature than that                  at

   “Experimental Inquiry into the Composition of some of the
Animals fed and slaughtered as Human Food.”            By J. B. Lawes,
Esq., F.R.S., F.C.S., and J. H. Gilbert, Ph.D., F.C.S.
  After alluding to the importance of the chemical statistics of
nutrition in relation to physiology, dietetics, and rural economy, and
explaining that the branch of the subject comprehended in the pre
sent paper is that of Animal Composition, the authors proceed in
the first place to state the general nature of their investigations, and
the manner in which they were conducted.
  To ascertain the quantitative relations, and the tendency of deve
lopment, of the different parts of the system, the weights of the
entire bodies, and of the several internal organs, also of some other
separated parts, were determined in several hundred animals—oxen,
sheep, and pigs.
   To determine the ultimate composition, and in a sense the proxi
mate composition also, of oxen, sheep, and pigs, and to obtain the
results in such manner that they might serve to estimate the pro
bable composition of the Increase whilst fattening, was a labour
obviously too great to be undertaken with a large number of ani
mals. Those selected were—a fat calf, a half-fat ox, a moderately
fat ox, a fat lamb, a store or lean sheep, a half-fat old sheep, a fat
sheep, a very fat sheep, a store pig, and a fat pig.
   It is to the methods and the results of the analysis of these ten
animals, to the information acquired as to the quantitative relation of
the organs or parts in the different descriptions of animal, and their
relative development during the fattening process, and to the appli
cation of the data thus provided, that the authors chiefly confine
themselves in the present paper.
   The analyses of the ten animals were planned to determine the
actual and per-centage amounts—of water, of mineral matter, of
total nitrogenous compounds, of fat, and of total dry substance—in
the entire bodies, and in certain individual and classified parts of
the animals.     The water, and mineral matter, were for the most part
determined in each internal organ, or other separated part.      But, to
confine the labour within reasonable  limits, and to facilitate as far as
                                                               in
possible the perception of the practical and economic application of
the results, the other constituents enumerated are given
   1st. The collective “carcass” parts; that       is,
                                                    the frame with          its
covering  of  flesh add fat, which comprise the most important por
tions sold as human food.
   2nd. The collective “offal” parts; including the whole            of
                                                                      the

internal organs, the head, the feet, and, in the case of oxen and
 sheep, the pelt and hair or wool.
   3rd. The entire animal (fasted live-weight).
   Referring first to the composition of the “collective carcass
parts,” it appeared, comparing one animal with another, that there
is a general disposition to a rise or fall in the per-centage of mineral
matter, with the rise or fall in that of the nitrogenous compounds.
In fact,         all
              the results tended      show      prominent connexion be
                                                                 to              a

                       the mineral matters and that      the nitrogenous                            of
constituents           of
                 the body.
   Comparing the relative proportions         fat, and nitrogenous com      of
pounds,      the respective “carcasses,”
                in                              appeared that,      every        it                                    in
instance excepting that                           of
                              the calf, there was considerably more                                                               of
dry fat than      dry nitrogenous compounds.

                                                the half-fat ox, there was one
fourth more fat than nitrogenous matter; and                      that       the half              in             of

the carcass          the moderately fat pig, there was nearly

On the Composition             of Animals           slaughtered as Human             Food.        293
cent. of water. The bones of the carcasses contained a less propor
tion of water than the collective soft or edible portions.
   It is inferred, that the average of carcasses of well-fattened oxen
will contain 50 per cent., or rather more, of dry substance; that
those of properly fattened sheep will contain more still—say 55 to
60 per cent. ; those of pigs killed for fresh pork rather more than
those of sheep; whilst the sides of pigs fed and slaughtered for
curing will be drier still.        Lamb-carcasses would seem to contain a
smaller proportion of dry substance than those of either moderately
fattened oxen, sheep, or pigs.            Their proportion of bone was also
comparatively high. Weal appeared to be the moistest of all. The
carcass of the calf experimented upon, though the animal was con
sidered to be well fattened, contained only 37; per cent. of dry
substance. Its proportion of bone was also higher than in any of
the other animals.
   Next as to the composition of the collective offal parts (excluding
the contents of stomachs and intestines), the results showed that
in every case the per-centage of nitrogenous substance was greater,
and that of the fat very much less, than in the collective carcass parts.
   In oxen and sheep, the pelt, hair or wool, hoofs, stomachs, and
intestines, taken together, contained a large proportion of the total
nitrogen of the offal parts.          The portions of the nitrogenous offal
parts of these animals generally used for food, are, the head-flesh
with tongue and brains, the heart, the liver, the pancreas, the
spleen, the diaphragm, and sometimes the lungs.                    In the pig, the
proportion of the nitrogenous offal generally eaten, is greater than
in the other animals; but                     its
                                          proportion        fat   ofgenerally also

greater.
   With the higher per-centage                 nitrogenous substance, and the
                                                       of

variably       less per-centage
               a                      total dry substance, and therefore more
                                          of
of  water, than the collective carcass parts.

  and fat lamb contained about 30 per cent, the entire body of the
  fat sheep 35% per cent, that of the very fat sheep 45% per cent, and
  that of the moderately fat pig 424 per cent. of dry fat.
     The average composition of the six animals assumed to be well
  fattened, showed, in round numbers, 3 per cent. of mineral matter,
  12% per cent. of nitrogenous compounds, and 33 per cent. of fat, in
 their standing or fasted live-weight.
     All the experimental evidence conspired to show, that the so
 called “fattening” of the animals, was properly so designated.
 During the feeding or fattening process, the per-centage of the col
 lective dry substance of the body considerably increased; and the
 fatty matter accumulated in much larger proportion than the nitro
 genous compounds.       The increase itself, must therefore show a
  less per-centage of nitrogenous substance (and of mineral matter
  also), and a higher one of both fat and total dry substance, than the
  whole body of the fattened animal.
     The knowledge thus acquired of the composition of animals in
  different conditions of maturity, was next employed as a means of
  estimating the composition of the increase gained in passing from
  one given point of progress to another.
     To this end, the composition of the animals analysed in the lean
 condition, was applied to the known weights of numbers of animals
  of the same description, assumed to be in a similar lean condition;
 and the composition of the fat animals analysed, was in like manner
 applied to the weights of the same series of animals after being
 fattened.       Deducting the amount of the respective constituents in
 the lean    animals,   from that of the corresponding constituents in the
 fat   ones,   the actual amount of each constituent gained was deter
 mined.       The weight of the gross increase being also known,                                                its
 estimated per-centage composition was thus                matter       easy calcu

pretty exactly twice as much of the dry substance of the food, in
volved in the direct production of the increase, as there was of dry
increase itself; hence instead of there being, as before estimated, 82
to 83 parts of the consumed dry matter expired, perspired, or
voided, without as it were being directly involved in the production
of the increase, it is to be inferred that, in the sense implied, only
about 65 parts were so expired, perspired, or voided.
    It having been thus found that by far the larger proportion of
the solid increase of the so-called fattening animals is really fat
itself—as moreover, it is probable that, at least in great part, the
 fat  formed         the body

 the collective requirements of the human organism than an exclu
 sively bread or other vegetable one, the testimony of common ex
 perience may be accepted as sufficient evidence.        Whatever may
 prove to be the exact explanations of the benefits arising from a
 mixed animal and vegetable diet, it is at any rate pretty clear, that,
independently of any difference in the physical, and perhaps even
chemical relations of the nitrogenous compounds, they are essentially
 connected with the amount, the condition, and the distribution o
the fat, in the animal portions of the food.                             -
    Fat is the most concentrated respiratory, and of course fat-storing
material also, which our food-stuffs supply.       It cannot be doubted
that, independently of the mere supply of constituents, the condi
tions of concentration, of digestibility, and of assimilability, of our
different foods, must have their share in determining the relative
values, for the varying exigences of the system, of substances which,
in a more general, or more purely chemical sense, may still justly
be looked upon as mutually replaceable.
    By the aid of Chemistry, it may be established, that, in the admix
ture of animal food with bread, the relation (in respiratory and fat
forming capacity) of the non-flesh-forming to the flesh-forming
substances, will be increased;—and further, that in such a mixed diet,
the proportion of the non-flesh-forming constituents, which will be
in the concentrated form, so to speak, offat itself, will be consider
ably greater than in bread alone. Common experience also testifies
to the fact of advantages so derived.       It remains to Physiology to
lend her aid, to the full explanation     of  that which Chemistry and
common usage have thus determined.
    “Note on the Formation of the Peroxides of the Radicals of the
Organic Acids.”      By B. C. Brodie, F.R.S.
    The researches of Gerhardt showed the close resemblance which
exists between the monobasic organic acids and the metallic protoxides.
We have the chloride of acetyle corresponding to the chloride of the
metal, and the hydrated and anhydrous acetic acid corresponding to
the hydrated and anhydrous oxide. These investigations have been
succeeded by others, which have had their origin in the consistent
development of these ideas. The following discovery extends and
completes these analogies.      I have to add a new term to this series,
of which hitherto no     analogue   has existed. This term is the per
oxide of the   organic radical,—the   body which in the series of acetyle
corresponds to the peroxide of hydrogen or barium in the series of
the metal. Of these remarkable substances I have prepared two,-the
peroxides of benzoyle and of acetyle; but the method by which these
are procured is doubtless of extensive application, and we may con
 sider ourselves as in possession of a class of bodies of a new order,
 the study of which cannot fail greatly to extend our knowledge.
    These peroxides are prepared by the action of the anhydrous acid,
 of the corresponding chloride, upon the peroxide of barium.         It is
 first necessary to prepare  this peroxide in a  pure condition. This is
 effected by precipitation of the solution of the peroxide of barium in

302                                             Royal Society:—
hydrochloric acid by baryta-water, and by drying in vacuo the pre
cipitate thus obtained. The peroxide of barium thus procured is
perfectly pure, with the exception of a trace of carbonate. In ap
pearance it resembles magnesia.
    To prepare the peroxide of benzoyle, the chloride of benzoyle and
the peroxide of barium are taken in equivalent proportions and mixed
in water. A mutual decomposition takes place; and a substance is
formed which, after crystallization from anhydrous ether, gave the
following results to analysis:—

 evolved   by the  decomposition     of the peroxide of barium formed, by
 platina-black, and the acetate of baryta determined as sulphate. The

    Thus for every   16 parts   of oxygen evolved, 2 equivalents of acetate

    It has not yet been in my power to pursue further the study of
these substances.        I may, however, observe, that the peroxide of
acetyle contains the elements of carbonic acid and of the acetate of
methyle, and the peroxide of benzoyle the elements of carbonic acid
and of the benzoate of phenyle. I have ascertained that the peroxide
of benzoyle, when carefully heated, loses exactly one equivalent of car
bonic acid; but the substance formed, although isomeric with the
benzoate of phenyle, has not the properties of that body.            It is a
yellow resin, soluble in ether and alkalies, from which latter solution
it is precipitated by acids,
   The existence of a hydrated peroxide may be anticipated, inter
mediate between the organic peroxide and the peroxide of hydrogen,
in the same sense as the organic acid is intermediate between water
and the anhydrous acid. This substance in the series of benzoyle
would be isomeric with salicylic acid. My efforts, however, to pro
cure these bodies have, as yet, been unsuccessful; and it is to be re
membered that we have no evidence of the existence of a hydrated
peroxide of barium, or of any other metal, corresponding to the
hydrated protoxide.        In the series of ethyle the diatomic alcohol of
Wurtz    (C,  H, O,)  is isomeric with the hydrated peroxide.      But the
true peroxide of ethyle remains yet to be discovered.
   The question naturally arises as to what would be the result of
making similar experiments with the chlorides and the anhydrides
of the bibasic acids. Now carbonic acid may be regarded as the
peroxide of oxalic acid : it is the constant product of the action of
oxidizing agents upon that body; and were we able to procure the
unknown anhydride of oxalic acid, it would not be an unreasonable
anticipation that with the peroxide of barium it would decompose
into oxalate and carbonic acid, thus
                   2C,0,--Ba, O,-C, O, Ba,--2CO,.
   A similar   experiment with anhydrous succinic acid would produce
succinate of baryta and a homologue of carbonic acid, the existence

of which is also indicated by other considerations.                                   It   is   premature
to dwell upon this point;                   but in this direction also                     I have        made
some experiments.
     “Notice of Researches on the Sulphocyanide                                   and Cyanate of

Ph.D., F.R.S. &c.
   The transformation of phenylcarbamide and phenylsulphocarba
mide under the influence of anhydrous phosphoric acid, respectively
into cyanate and sulphocyanide of phenyle, an account of which I
 submitted to the Society several months ago, suggested the proba
 bility that the hitherto unknown cyamates and sulphocyanides of
 radicals similar to phenyle might be obtained by analogous processes.
    To establish this point experimentally, Mr. Vincent Hall has
examined, in my laboratory, the deportment of some of the deriva
tives of naphtylamine under the influence of agents capable of
fixing ammonia and              its
                            analogues.
    Mr. Hall has found that the crude naphtaline, such                  ob                    as   it   is
tained from the gas-works, submitted            once, without sublimation,

acid and metallic iron, furnishes the naphtylamine sufficiently pure
for these experiments.         The crude product thus obtained was
digested with bisulphide              of
                                 carbon      order    in

 boulder-clay or till, yet lias-limestone and shales were observable
 in several spots, in wells, streams, &c., especially at Quarry Gill,
Fisher's Gill Farm, and in Thornbybrook, south-east of Aikton.
Gryphaea incurva and other Gryphaeae, with Oysters and Ammonites,
characterize these beds.    The area occupied by the Lias is known to
extend under the   rising ground lying between Crofton and Orton, on
the south, and the  Solway, on the north, comprising Aikton, Thornby,
Wiggonby, Oughterby, and probably other places on the rising
ground between the Carlisle and Maryport, and Carlisle and Port

—I. Paradoxides and Conocephalus from North America.” By                J.
W. Salter, Esq., F.G.S., of the Geological Survey of Great Britain.
   After briefly noticing the relations of the “Zone Primordiale”       in
stituted by M. Barrande, the author described the remains of a large
Paradorides sent from the vicinity of St. John's, Newfoundland, by
Mr. Bennett. The fossil belongs to a new species of Paradorides,
the largest yet known (9% inches broad), and termed P. novo-re
pertus by Mr. Salter. A new species of Conocephalus, from Georgia,
was also described from a specimen brought to England by Dr.
Feuchtwanger, and placed in the Great Exhibition of 1851; it is
named C. antiquatus by the author.      As these two genera have as
yet been known only in the “Zone Primordiale,” Mr. Salter re
gards the above-mentioned specimens as indicative of the existence
of that geological formation in the countries here mentioned.
   The author also referred to an obscure specimen of Asaphus, from
the “Calciferous sand-rock” of Canada, which he once, but on            in
sufficient grounds, published as a Paradorides.

Colesberg, South Africa.” By Prof. T.           H. Huxley, F.R.S., Sec.
G.S.
  For the original specimen from which Prof. Huxley first obtained
 (in the spring of last year) evidence of the existence of this species,
he was indebted to the Rev. H. M. White, of Andover, who subse
quently put the author in communication with the discoverer of the
fossil, Mr.       J.
               A. Murray; and the latter gentleman having written
to his father, resident in South Africa, obtained for Prof. Huxley a
large quantity of similar fossil remains. One specimen in particular,
having been carefully chiselled out by Mr. Dew, afforded a complete
skull of this peculiar and previously undescribed species of Dicy
                                    -
nodon.   ,
    The author described the distinctive features of this skull in detail.
Dicynodon Murrayi is distinguished from            all

  2. The supratemporal fossae are much longer from within out
wards than from before backwards, owing partly to the shortness of
the parietal region.
   3. The alveoli of the tusks, the transverse section of which is cir
cular, commence immediately under the nasal aperture, and extend
forwards and downwards parallel with the plane of the nasal and
upper part of the premaxillary bones, and do not leave their sockets
until they have passed beyond the level of the posterior end of the
symphysis of the lower jaw.
   4. The nasal apertures are altogether in front of the orbits.        -
   5. The length of the upper jaw in front of the nasal apertures is
certainly equal to one-third, and probably to one-half, the whole length
of the skull, which is between 6 and 7 inches.
   6. The os quadratum is about half as long as the skull.
   These peculiarities are regarded as sufficient to distinguish Dicy
nodon Murrayi from               all
                          others; and the author stated that       should                         he
reserve the description     many other anatomical features, which are
                                   of

    After having fully noticed the progress of our knowledge respecting
 the palaeozoic Chitons, and those of the Magnesian Limestone in
particular, the author described in detail the characters of Chiton
Loftusianus, King, and Chiton Howseanus, Kirkby, and a new species,
 referred with some doubt to Chiton, C. (?) cordatus; also Chiton
 antiquus, Howse, which Mr. Kirkby refers to the subgenus Chito
 nellus, as well as two new species, C. Hancockianus and C. distortus.
The specimens on which all these species have been determined
have been found in the Magnesian Limestone of the neighbourhood
of Sunderland, Durham, and chiefly in that of Tunstall Hill.
    The author particularly alluded to the great similarity that some
 of the plates of these fossil Chitons have at first sight to Patella and
 Calyptraeae, and recommended that especial care should therefore
always be taken in the determination of patelliform fossils.
    4. “On the Vegetable Structures in Coal.” By J. W. Dawson
LL.D., F.G.S., Principal of M'Gill College, Montreal.
    After referring to the labours of others in the elucidation of the
history of coal, the author remarks that in ordinary bituminous coal
we recognize by the unaided eye laminae of a compact and more or
less lustrous appearance, separated by uneven films and layers of
fibrous anthracite or mineral charcoal.        As these two kinds of
material differ to some extent in origin and state of preservation,
and in the methods of study applicable to them, he proceeds to treat
of his subject under two heads:—1st. The structures preserved in
the state of mineral charcoal. This substance consists of fragments
of prosenchymatous and vasiform tissues in a carbonized state,
somewhat flattened by pressure, and more or less impregnated with
bituminous and mineral matters derived from the surrounding mass.
It has resulted from the subaërial decay of vegetable matter; whilst
the compact coal is the product of subaqueous putrefaction, modified
by heat and exposure to air. The author proceeded (after describing
the methods used by him in examining mineral charcoal and coal)
to describe the tissues of Cryptogamous plants in the state of mineral
charcoal. Among these he mentions Lepidodendron and Ulodendron,
also disintegrated vascular bundles from the petioles of Ferns, the
veins of Stigmarian leaves, and from some roots or stipes. He then
describes tissues of Gymnospermous plants in the state of mineral
charcoal; especially wood with discigerous fibres and also with
scalariform tissue, such as that of Stigmaria and Calamodendron;
and the author remarks that probably the so-called cycadeous tissue
hitherto met with in the coal has belonged to Sigillariae.

           Dr. Dawson on the Vegetable Structures in Coal.          809
   The next chief heading of the paper has reference to structures
preserved in the layers of compact coal, which constitutes a far
larger proportion of the mass than the mineral charcoal does.       The
laminae of pitch- or cherry-coal, says Dr. Dawson, when carefully
traced over the surfaces of accumulation, are found to present the
outline of flattened trunks.    This is also true to a certain extent of
the finer varieties of slate-coal; but the coarse coal appears to con
sist of extensive laminae of disintegrated vegetable matter mixed
with mud.       When the coal (especially the more shaly varieties) is
held   obliquely under a strong light, in the manner recommended by
Goeppert, the surfaces of the laminae of coal present the forms of
many well-known coal-plants, as Sigillaria, Stigmaria, Poacites (or
Naeggerathia), Lepidodendron, Ulodendron, and rough bark, perhaps
of Conifers.     When the coal is traced upward into the roof-shales,
we often find the laminae of compact coal represented by flattened
coaly trunks and leaves, now rendered distinct by being separated
by clay.
    Tºdation of erect trees to the mass of the coal, and the state
 of preservation in which the wood and bark of these trees occur,
the microscopic appearances of coal,—the abundance of cortical
tissue in the coal, associated with remains of herbaceous plants,
leaves, &c., are next treated of.
   The author offers the following general conclusions:—
    (1) With respect to the plants which have contributed the vege
table matter of the coal, these are principally the Sigillariae and
 Calamiteae, but especially the former.
    (2) The woody matter of the axes of Sigillariae and Calamited
and of coniferous trunks, as well as the scalariform tissues of the
axes of the Lepidodendreae and Ulodendreae, and the woody and vas
cular bundles of ferns, appear principally in the state of mineral
charcoal. The outer cortical envelope of these plants, together with
such portions of their wood and of herbaceous plants and foliage as
were submerged without subaérial decay, occur as compact coal of
various degrees of purity, the cortical matter, owing to its greater
resistance to aqueous infiltration, affording the purest coal. The
relative amounts of all these substances found in the states of mine
ral charcoal and compact coal depend principally upon the greater
or less prevalence of subaerial decay occasioned by greater or less
dryness of the swampy flats on which the coal accumulated.
    (3) The structure of the coal accords with the view that its
materials were accumulated by growth without any driftage of
materials.     The Sigillariae and Calamitede, tail and branchless, and
clothed only with rigid linear leaves, formed dense groves and jun
gles, in which the stumps and fallen trunks of dead. trees became
resolved by decay into shells of bark and loose fragments of rotten
wood which currents must have swept away, but which the most
gentle inundations, or even heavy rains, could scatter in layers over
 the surface, where they gradually became imbedded in a mass of
 roots, fallen leaves, and herbaceous plants.
     (4) The rate of accumulation of coal was very slow. The         cli

810                Intelligence and Miscellaneous        Articles,    . "
mate of the period, in the northern temperate zone, was of such a
character that the true conifers show rings of growth not larger, or
much less distinct than those of many of their northern congeners”.
The Sigillaria and Calamites were not, as often supposed, succulent
plants.     The former had, it is true, a verythick cellular inner bark;
but their dense woody axes, their thick and nearly imperishable outer
bark, their scanty and rigid foliage would indicate no very rapid
growth. In the case of Sigillariae, the variations in the leaf-scars
in different parts of the trunk, the intercalation of new ridges at the
surface representing that of new woody wedges in the axis, the
transverse marks left by the successive stages of upward growth, all
indicate that at least several years must have been required for the
growth of stems of moderate size. The enormous roots of these
trees, and the conditions of the coal-swamps, must have exempted
them from the danger of being overthrown by violence. They pro
bably fell, in successive generations, from natural decay; and, mak
ing every allowance for other materials, we may safely assert that
every foot of thickness of pure bituminous coal implies the quiet
growth and fall of at least fifty generations of Sigillaria, and there
fore an undisturbed condition of forest-growth enduring through
many centuries.          Further, there is evidence that an immense amount
of loose  parenchymatous          tissue, and even of wood, perished by decay;
and we do not know to what extent even the most durable tissues
may have disappeared in this way; so that in many coal-seams we
may have only a very small part of the vegetable matter produced.
    Lastly. The results stated in this paper refer to coal-beds of the
middle coal-measures.             A few facts which I have observed lead me
to believe that in the thin seams of the lower coal-measures remains
of Noeggerathia and Lepidodendron are more abundant than in those
of the middle coal-measurest.              In the upper coal-measures similar
modifications      may    be  expected.     These differences have been to a
certain extent ascertained by Goeppert for some of the coal-beds of
Silesia, and by Lesquereux for those of Ohio; but the subject is
deserving of further investigation, more especially by the means pro
posed in this paper, and which I hope, should time and opportunity
permit, to apply to the seventy-six successive coal-beds of the-
South Joggins.

         NOTE ON THE POLARIZATION OF THE LIGHT OF COMETS.
                     BY SIR DAVID BREWSTER,
   Although there can be no doubt as to the accuracy of the ob
servations of M. Arago on the indications of polarization disco
vered by him in the light of the comets from 1819 to 1835, there
is nevertheless nothing impossible in the supposition that the light
may have been polarized after arriving in the terrestrial atmosphere.
In fact, when we consider that light is polarized by refraction in
passing through the coats of the eye, that it is polarized by refraction
at the four or six surfaces of the object-glasses of an astronomical
telescope, and also in passing through the surfaces of           eyepiece,                                     a its

 I    am not aware that those who have observed traces        polarization                                 of
    the light            of

    XLIX. On the Semidiurnal Oscillation of the Barometer.
 By W. S. JEvoNs, Assayer, Sydney Branch of the Royal Mintº.
 1.
       To    explain the remarkable double oscillation of the baro
            meter which occurs during each day in most parts of
 the  world,   a theory has been proposed by the eminent meteoro
 logists Dove and Sabine, and has,                             I
                                                  think, been favourably
 received by the scientific world, which I yet venture to call in
 question.      It is concisely stated in Sabine's Notes to “Cosmosf,’
 and is somewhat as follows:—In all countries which are not far
 removed from large surfaces of water, the barometer on an ave
 rage stands highest about 9 A.M. and 9 P.M., and it stands low
 est    the nearly intermediate hours
       at                                                    of
                                                        P.M., and      or                            or
                                                                         of 3
                                                                  2                         4        5
 A.M. (sunrise).       This   phaenomenon,    being      daily occurrence,
 can only depend ultimately                      on
                                        the sun's heat and the rotation
of  the  earth;    the intermediate causes yet admit        debate.   Now       of
as  the  temperature         the air only undergoes
                                 of                      single oscillation a
during the day,           could only, and
                            it                  some parts   in  the world            of

                                                                  of

                                                                                                     of in

fact, that this         always the effect produced
                           is                               the agency          by
temperature.        But the aqueous vapour contained           the air also          in
undergoes        daily variation;
                 a                               its
                                         elastic force    greatest      the is                  in
daytime and least           night, and this varying force must equally
                                at
affect the barometrical column.          Now the two undulations thus
continually produced                 independent manner are superim
                                      in    an

minimum of the barometer at that period of the day, although
the low temperature then existing would have an opposite effect;
it is the great increase of vapour which raises the barometer to
a maximum at 9 A.M.; but the increasing temperature of the
air then becomes predominant in                                 its
                                       effects, and the afternoon

at9       P.M.   is    to     be   ascribed     the subsequent

  Colonel Sabine takes the opportunity, when speaking    this                                           of

it is indeed almost self-evident, that, within a very moderate ele
vation above the surface of the earth, the humidity as well as the
temperature of the air, cease to be affected by the daily variation.
To argue, then, upon the variations of humidity at the surface
of the earth as if they extended equally throughout the atmo
sphere, as is done in the prevalent theory, is certainly erroneous.
   8. But it remains to be considered how far the daily variation
of humidity, such as it really exists, is capable of affecting the
barometer.    This we may easily estimate, not by using such a
complex mode of measurement as the hygrometer, but by simply
observing what weight of water enters or quits the atmosphere
during the various periods of the day. For it is evident that if
a cubic foot of water, instead of resting on the surface of the
earth, evaporate and form a part of the atmosphere, the weight
of the latter will be increased by the precise weight of the cubic
foot of water.    Similarly, if a stratum of water a foot deep eva

820              Mr. W. S. Jevons     on the   Semidiurnal
amount of the elastic force of vapour, as indicated by a hygro
meter at the surface of the earth, from the total pressure of the
atmosphere, and considering the remainder as the gaseous pres
sure.     I have attempted to prove that this practice is erroneous,
and can have no possible use or meaning; so that the theory in
question will thus be without foundation.            But even if we adopt
the true mode of estimating the barometric effects of the varia
tion of humidity,     I have brought some results to show that no
explanation is obtained of the oscillations of the barometer.
     12. It will not have escaped my readers that, as a further
consequence of my arguments, the weight of the atmosphere
 must be diminished by the weight of water falling from it as
rain, and that the barometer must be thereby affected in some
 place or other.     The precipitation of a foot depth of rain over
 the whole surface of the earth must cause a uniform fall of the
 barometer to the extent of -088 inch.         But the varied conditions
 under which evaporation and the fall of rain take place, as well
 as the many great and complex effects which the removal of in
 comprehensibly vast bodies of water from place to place must
occasion, form part of the general mechanical problem of the atmo
sphere in which meteorology really consists.               I will only notice
that, in a previous paper “On the Forms of Clouds” (Phil. Mag.
April 1858), I have shown this same motive force, viz. the dimi
 mution of weight and pressure produced by the separation of
 cloud-particles and rain, to be the probable cause of those mo
 tions between masses of air which constitute the cirrus, the
                                           -
 cumulostratus, and even the thunder-cloud.
     13. Probable eaglanation of the semidiurnal oscillation of the
barometer*.—The doubly-pointed curve which the barometer de
scribes during the day, simply indicates a double undulation occa
 sioned in the atmosphere by the disturbance of the sun’s rays.
This may be explained as follows:—Let fig. 1 represent an atmo
sphere reposing on a horizontal
 surface, divided into imaginary                       Fig. l.
columns.      If the centre column         .  .. . .   . .   .   .   Tº
A be subjected to the action of              Pi c'   s   : A   a   c in
the sun's rays for any given
period, say six hours, the air          i<U+017F>           +  \-/ +
will increase in volume and will
overflow upon the adjoining co
lumns B and B'. The baro- 3–GN-Z TN-2TN-ZT
metric pressure will therefore
diminish at the base of A and increase at the bases of                  B and
B', so that undulations will exist as shown by the line               1%; and
    * Being without means of reference, I am unaware whether this theory
is entirely new ; I have not myself seen it anywhere stated.

like other undulations, such as waves on the surface of water,
will spread to an indefinite distance on each side. But suppose
that, before they have passed beyond B and B, the action of the
sun upon A ceases, and terrestrial radiation produces a counter
action. The column A contracts; and the columns B and B',
possessing superior height and weight, will force back a portion
of air upon A, while other portions overflow upon C and C'.
There will soon be a minimum of pressure at the bases of B and
B', and a maximum at the bases of A, C, and               shown
                                                                                                 C',    as                 by

it do not again interfere, the undulatory motion will proceed,
and     the next step we shall have the condition
       at                                             things shown                               of

   18. On this theory, then, the semidiurnal oscillations are
supposed to be occasioned by two vast waves perpetually moving
round the earth, almost like the tides of the ocean.      Air of
of course would not be carried round    by  these  waves, but a
general swaying to and fro of the upper parts of the atmosphere
would be the only actual motion occasioned.     The waves origi
nate in the sun throwing the air on each side of him; hence
there must be a constant tendency to an easterly wind before
noon, and a westerly wind in the afternoon.
   These daily barometric waves are of greatest height and regu
larity in the equatorial regions, and are not appreciable in the
polar regions*, The varied shape of oceans, continents, and even
mountain-chains must produce irregularities, and the change of
seasons must occasion modifications of the wave-curve, to dis
cover and explain which will afford employment to numberless
students of meteorological    science for many years to come.
Eventually we may hope that an endless variety of facts, only
apparently capricious, will be made to harmonize together under
a simple mechanico-mathematical     theory, and the science of the
atmosphere will be raised to a new position.

   2. The houppes or coloured sectors have a different appear
 ance to different persons.      The Abbé Moigno describes them,
 and M. Haidinger has drawn them, as resembling a bundle of
pale-yellow twigs bound tightly together at their middle, and
having on each side of the narrowest part of the bundle two
small masses of violet or blue light*.         Afterwards, however, the
Abbé made a most       important     observation,  described and drawn
by M. Haidingert. He observed the blue masses or sectors cross
ing the middle part of the yellow bundle now represented by this
separation, as consisting of two yellow circular spaces.

explanation, we must mention that M. Zokalski, an oculist in
 Paris, found four persons from whose eyes the crystalline lens
had been extracted, and who nevertheless saw the phaenomenon
of the coloured sectors. Hence it follows that, as the inner sur
face of the cornea has very little refraction, from          being                                      its            in

3    28                   Archdeacon Pratt on the Thickness                  of
P=50".          1.        Hence the above formula gives
                                 :=#–8,         or    e   less than $e.
Hence, because the ellipticity decreases in descending, the thick
ness must be greater than would correspond with an ellipticity
of the inner surface of the shell =# ellipticity of the outer
surface.
     If
     solidification took place solely from pressure, the surfaces
of equal density would be surfaces of equal solidity.   From the
                                          *
ordinary theory of the figure of the earth, considered as consist
ing of strata (whether fluid or not) which follow the fluid law
and the law           of density                     Mr. Hopkins shows that if                   the
ratio of the mean density to the superficial density = 2:4225,
the thickness of the crust must be one-fourth of the radius, if
the ellipticity of the inner surface = , e, if the ratio of densi
ties is a little larger than 3, the thickness is one-fifth of the
radius.    But the ratio of densities is generally regarded as less
than the smaller of the above ratios.       Hence we shall not be
over the mark in stating that the crust, under the hypothesis
that the solidification is produced by pressure alone, cannot be
less than one-fifth or one-fourth of the radius in thickness.
   But solidification depends upon temperature as well as pres
sure, and Mr. Hopkins shows (Phil. Trans. 1842) that the iso
thermal surfaces increase in ellipticity in passing downwards.
Now the ellipticities of the surfaces of equal degrees of solidity
must, under the double action of temperature and pressure,                                       lie
between those                  of
                    temperature and pressure considered alone.
Hence the surface      equal solidity passing through any point
                                     of
will   more elliptic than the surface

 do not prove anything whatever regarding the proportion of the

   5. Mr. Hopkins's conclusion stands therefore unaffected, and,
as it appears to me, is the only physical investigation of the
subject upon which any reliance can be placed. . The only
assumption is that the earth was once fluid, or sufficiently so to
have the arrangement of                         its
                                parts regulated according    fluid                                  to

of the earth deduced upon this hypothesis and with the law                                                     of
density                    (in   itself    a    priori     a   very probable law), and the
mean ellipticity deduced from the geodetic measurement      the                                       of

886      Mr.   J. N.   Hearder on a New Form      of    Telegraph Cable
 length from a conductor, or by discharges from a unit-jar, be
 assumed to be ten measures.        Take now a jar or plate exposing
 precisely the same surface but whose glass is only half as thick,
 and it will be found that twenty measures will now be required
 to produce a discharge of the same length, or in other words, to
 produce the same amount of tension. Now the tension is the
 same in both cases, but the quantities are as 2 to 1.
     Again, unite these two plates or jars so as to form a battery
 of double surface. Thirty measures will now be required to
 produce the same tension or discharge, but the relative quanti
 ties on the two plates respectively will still be as 2 to 1. We
 thus have an analogue of one-half of the cable; the thick glass
 representing the outer half, and the thin glass corresponding to
 the portion of dielectric between the two conductors.
     It will thus be seen that one common conductor in connexion
 with two surfaces of dielectrics of different charging capacities
 will exhibit one uniform degree of tension, whilst the surfaces
 with which it is in contact may be taking up widely different
 quantities of electricity.     In a double-wire cable, then, the ne
 cessary diminution of thickness between the two conductors will
 give rise to a correspondingly increased charging capacity of one
 half of the entire charging surface.
    But the mischief does not end here. It is a well-established
                                       I
law in electricity, and one which have had abundant opportu
 nities of verifying, that the effects of Leyden discharges are as
 the squares of the accumulated quantities irrespective of ten
 sions; therefore whatever tends to increase the charging capacity
 of the surface of the dielectric, augments the mischievous effects
 in the ratio of the square of that accumulation: hence               I
                                                                   cannot
 imagine that placing two wires in the same sheath can be any

I   shall here enter more into detail upon that subject.

 proving the character       of the earth discharge.         I here avoid
 the term     earth-circuit,  because  I   do not believe    that, except
 under very peculiar circumstances and within very limited
 bounds, any appreciable return current takes place through the

earth. We must indeed look upon the earth as a great reser
voir, capable, with proper arrangements, of affording any supply,
or of disposing of any discharge.            If the Atlantic Cable were
a tube carrying water instead of electricity, receiving it at
one end and discharging it at the other, it would never be as
sumed that the portions discharged in America would flow by a
return current back through the ocean to supply the other end;
and the cases are precisely similar: the earth acts the part of a
reservoir with regard to electricity as much as the ocean does
with regard to water; and the circumstances under which return
currents either of water or electricity could be produced, would
bear the same analogy to each other.              The only benefit, then,
which the    present    wire could    confer,    would be by improving
to a certain extent the conducting character of the earth, or
in other words, by increasing              capacity        receive the dis

          and would now therefore direct attention to a new
 form of  cable,  intended to reduce not only the amount of static
 inductive action on the dielectric, but the degree of disturbance
 produced by the residual static discharge. In order fully to
 appreciate the value of this arrangement, it is necessary first to
 consider certain electrical phaenomena resulting from peculiar
 modifications in the arrangement of conductors and dielectrics,
 which influence very materially the effects of inductive action;
 I mean statical inductive action, commonly known as the charge
 of the coating, in contradistinction to the dynamic inductive
 action resulting from the influence of a current upon an adja
 cent wire.
    In all cases of the coated dielectrics, whether in the form of
 Leyden jars, coated glass or other plates, or coated wires, there
 are certain conditions which determine not only the amount of
 charge which can be taken up by a given coated surface, but the
 effect which the discharge of that quantity can produce.       A few
 well-determined     axioms, verified nearly thirty years  since, will
 serve as a  guide  in these considerations.
    1st. With any insulated charged conductor the statical         in
 tensity or power of attraction exhibited by it will be as the
 square of the quantity constituting the charge, and this holds
 good whether the conductor be simply insulated in the atmo
 sphere, or form one of the coatings of a Leyden jar.
    2nd. The thermometric effect of an electric charge, as ascer
tained by a wire passing through the bulb of the thermo-electro
 meter, either as originally invented by Sir W. S. Harris, or as
 subsequently modified by myself (see Phil. Mag, Nov. 1856),
is as the square of the quantity transmitted, other things being
the same.
    3rd. With a conducting or coated surface of a given area, the
length of spark or tension will be in the direct ratio of the
charge.    Thus, quantities of charge bearing the relations to
each other of 1, 2, 3, 4, will give tensions or length of spark,
as 1, 2, 3, 4; but the statical intensities as evidenced by attrac
tion or inductive action, will be respectively in the proportions of
1, 4, 9, 16, &c., corresponding precisely to the thermometric
effect.
    4th. The relation of the quantity to the intensity will depend
upon the surface upon which the electricity is distributed; for
instance, a double surface charged to the same degree of tension,
that is to say, to give the same length of spark, will contain a
double quantity; but the statical intensity and inductive or
attractive action will remain the same, whilst the thermometric
effect will be as the square of the surface or quantity, the thick
ness of glass being equal.

         intended to reduce the effects                            of   Inductive Action.                    84]
    5th.    Ifa given charge be distributed over conducting sur
 faces  bearing   the several relations of 1, 2, 3, 4, the thermome
 tric effect will be unaltered, but the respective tensions or length
 of spark will be in the simple inverse ratio of the surfaces, viz.
 1, #, #, #, whilst the intensities or attractive power will be                                                  in
versely as the squares of the surfaces, viz. 1, #, #, Iº.
    6th. The attractive or inductive influence acting between any
two electrified surfaces,                 is,
                                  with the same charge, inversely                                                as

 the discharging   interval was retained the same.

 844.      Mr.   J.   N. Hearder             on a New Form         of   Telegraph Cable.
    Since, however, according to the experiments with the glass
 plates, the porous material was equally effective on the outside,
 or between two plates, it would appear that the most eligible
 situation for the fibrous layer in the cable, would be either.
 between the coatings of gutta percha or externally to them; and
 I doubt not that in either of these situations it would act with
 the cable, as with the glass plates, in materially reducing the
 effectsof the discharge.
    There are also other considerations of a mechanical character
 which render these modifications of the arrangement preferable.
 I venture then to recommend, with considerable confidence, the
 adoption of this plan as a simple and efficient mode of greatly
 reducing—I will not go so far as to say entirely obviating—
 the embarrassing influences of the residual discharge.
    In a word, a cable constructed upon the principles here laid
 down will possess the following electrical qualifications, viz.-
   Its conductor will be of ample dimensions, thereby reducing
 the tendency to produce static induction.
    The dielectric or insulating coating will also, by               increased its
 thickness, not only improve the insulation, but have diminished               a
 capacity for taking           up
                            inductive charge; and, lastly, the insertion
                                                   of go  obviate the mis
 of  the fibrous substance will             very far               to

                          of               charge that may          taken up,  be

 since     analogous    arrangements      we find that from 80          90 per       to

                                      intercepted.

because the phaenomena by means of which it has to be measured
are of such a kind that their magnitudes have to be multiplied
and added in order to complete the measurement required,—just
as the volume of a body is a simple magnitude, although                                               to
ascertain it we have to measure the three dimensions of each                                          of
several parts into which we divide that volume, multiply them
together, and add the products.
   Momentum and angular momentum possess, like energy, the
property of conservation; but they do not possess the property of
completeness, inasmuch as they take into account actual motions
only, and not tendencies to move.     Attraction takes into account
tendencies to move only, and not actual motions.      Energy alone
takes all those relations into account.                  -
  The attempt to measure the “force,” “energy,” or “power”
of a system of gravitating bodies (by what term soever the
quantity to which the law of conservation of energy applies is
designated) by taking into account only the attractions, or ten
dencies to mutual approach of the bodies, would be analogous to
the attempt to measure the volume of a body by means of one
dimension of one of     parts.      its

their planes, and then covered as uniformly as possible with a
coating of stearine. A hot wire, exactly fitting the bore, was                            in
troduced into the latter and continually turned round during the
experiment.    By this means the coating of stearine around the
orifice was melted; but, as we should expect, not in concentric
circles, but in elliptic zones, whose major axes invariably coin
cided with the direction of the grain. The great difference in
the behaviour of different kinds of wood (about eighty sorts were
examined)   under these circumstances is at once apparent. With
some the ellipses are tolerably circular, by others more elongated,
while by others, again, the major axes are so extended as to be
nearly twice the length of the minor ones. The excentricity of
these ellipses, which furnished a graphical expression for the
conductive power of the wood in the directions between which
the structural difference was greatest, made it possible to divide
the different kinds of wood into four distinct groups. In the
first, the ratio of the minor to the major axis of the ellipse is on
the average as 1 to 125. To this group, Acacia, Box, Cypress,
King-wood, &c. belong. In the second, and by far the most nu
merous group, containing Elder, Nut, Ebony, Apple, several
dye-woods, &c., the mean value of this ratio is 1 to 1:45.         In
the third group, to which Apricot, Siberian Acacia, Brazil
wood, Yellow wood from Puerto Caballo, &c. belong, the ratio
is as 1 to 1-60. In the fourth group it is as 1 to 1-80, and to
this division belong Lime, Tamarind, Iron-wood, Poplar, Sava
nilla (yellow), &c. Hence the conducting power of          woods               all         in

        EEPING still in    view the investigation of a mathematical
         theory of physical forces on the hypothesis of the dyna
mical action of a continuous elastic fluid pervading space,             pro                   I
pose, as a preliminary step, to give reasons for assuming the
existence of such a medium, and to endeavour to obtain as di
stinct an idea as possible of                    its
                                      nature and properties. As this

existence and    qualities           of

the  planets   are not perceptibly acted upon              any other force    by
than  gravitation,   we must show that the luminiferous medium
offers no sensible resistance        their motions. To reconcile this

sophical   Magazine for December 1853 (p. 404), Mr. Rankine         -
makes the following statement:-
   “It has hitherto been always assumed that the kind of motion
which constitutes light is a vibration from side to side, transmitted
from particle to particle of the luminiferous medium, by means
of forces acting between the particles. In order to account for
the transmission of such transverse vibrations, the luminiferous
medium has been supposed to possess a kind of elasticity which
resists distortion of              its
                            parts, like that           elastic solid; and  of    an

hypothesis of oscillations now proposed.”—(P. 407.)             This
theory is accordingly distinguished from that commonly main
tained, by the substitution of oscillations of the individual atoms
 about axes for their vibrations in space.     Here I take occasion
to  remark,  for the sake of    preventing  misapprehension,    that
where in my former communications I have spoken of the oscil
latory theory of light (which ought rather to have been called
                                         I
the vibratory theory), made no reference to the particular views
adduced above, intending only to signify by those terms a theory
which takes account of the motions of the discrete atoms of the
aether, and is in this respect opposed to the hydrodynamical
theory. In referring now to this modification of the usual
theory, my object is the same that I had in view when referring
in my last communication to the theory of elliptically-polarized
light, namely, to exhibit the actual state of the theory of light
maintained by the mathematicians of the present day, and to
show by their own admissions that it requires hypothesis to be
added to hypothesis to support           have     doubtit. my own

 Magazine for December 1852, Prop. X.),             follows that this

 356           Mr.  J.  Cockle on the Theory     of Equations
 impressed    motion is rectilinearly propagated from the moving
 centre.    Hence if 6 be the angle which any radius makes with
 the direction of the motion, the above expressions for V and S
 are applicable to this case if the right-hand side of the equations
 be multiplied by cos 6. Hence it may be inferred, as above,
 that in proportion as the motion of the small sphere tends to be
 uniform, the value of a”S becomes insensible. If the analysis
 had embraced the square of the velocity, no resistance would
 have been found, because the velocities impressed by the pre
 ceding and following halves of the sphere are equal with oppo
 site signs, and consequently the pressures on the opposite hemi
 spheres, so far as they depend on the square of the velocity,
 destroy each other.
    These considerations seem to justify the inference, that a
 planet composed of discrete atoms of the kind assumed above,
 might pass through the aether and put it in motion without suf
fering sensible retardation. Any sensible resistance of the aether
would first become apparent in the case of a comet moving in an
 excentric orbit with a rapidly varying velocity. As the above
explanation of the non-resistance of the luminiferous medium to
the motions of the planets essentially depends on the supposed
spherical form of the atoms, it is so far a confirmation of the
truth of the supposition.       It may also be remarked that, accord
ing to the principle of the coexistence of small vibrations, the
motions impressed by the atoms disturb in no respect the trans
mission of light-undulations in the neighbourhood of a planet or
comet.

vibrations continued when the whole was immersed partly or
wholly in water, and even when flooded by a powerful continued
stream of cold water from a 3-inch pipe under considerable
pressure.    From this experiment                          I
                                      conclude that the effect of
the heat developed by the electrical current in the thin upright
plates may be fairly considered to be reduced so low as to be
incapable of producing a sensible result       such were ever the         (if
case).    Indeed, allowing for the resistance and friction    the                                         of
water tending      diminish the vibration, there

thinking that the action was less energetic      the one case than         in
in      the other.       It           consequently
                                  reasonable      conclude that the            to

                            the repulsive action

    The new compound possesses the characters of a well-defined base.
 Quite insoluble in water, it dissolves in the most dilute acids, form
 ing with some of them, such as hydrochloric and hydrobromic acid,
 beautifully crystallized saline compounds.   From these salts the base
 may be separated again by cautiously adding either potassa or am
 monia.    The hydrochloric solution of the base yields with dichloride
of platinum a yellow crystalline precipitate, sparingly soluble in
water, insoluble in alcohol and ether.
   Analysis of the yellow crystals, dried over sulphuric acid, led to
the formula

mother-liquor yields on evaporation oily drops of sulphocyanide of
phenyle.
    The deportment of triethylphosphine with sulphocyanide of
phenyle induced me to investigate the action of this body upon several
other sulphocyanides.    The substance which at once suggested itself
for examination was sulphocyanide of allyle, mustard-oil.   This com
pound reacts most powerfully with the phosphorus-base. On mixing
the two bodies, a powerful evolution of heat takes place, and the
mixture assumes a deep brown colour, but does not solidify either on
cooling or on agitation. After several days' standing, however, very
large well-defined crystals are deposited which unfortunately are con
taminated with the brown colouring matter of the solution.       have                  I
not yet succeeded in getting them perfectly white, and have there
fore not analysed them. Their formation, however, and their general
 characters leave no doubt that they are the corresponding allyle
 compound,

  Triethylphosphine has remained in contact with sulphocyanide of
ethyle for more than a month without depositing any crystals.
A priori, however, the formation of an urea under these circumstances
was doubtful, since sulphocyanide of ethyle differs from the corre

of last summer are under the press. They comprehend about thirty

Thomas, Esq.
    Since the year 1797, when Count Rumford made his experiments
for ascertaining the initial force of fired gunpowder, an account of
which appears in the Philosophical Transactions of that year, very
little light has been thrown on the subject. Count Rumford's ex
periments, valuable in many respects, afforded indeed nothing con
clusive respecting                   it.

      “On New Nitrogenous Derivatives of the Phenyle- and Benzoyle

      Piria's important discovery that the action of nitrous acid upon
  asparagine gives rise to the formation of malic acid, has led to a very
  general application of this agent in the study of nitrogenous sub
  stances.    The results obtained have been almost always analogous
  to those produced by Piria; the reaction may be illustrated by the
  following examples:—

     The plan hitherto adopted consisted in submitting the            aqueous
 solution of the nitrogenous body directly to the action of nitrous
 acid, or in dissolving the body in mitric acid, and passing into the
 solution a current of binoxide of nitrogen.          By employing alcoholic
 and ethereal    solutions, I have arrived at different results, establishing
 a new mode of reaction; of the facts which          I have  observed the fol
 lowing may be quoted as illustrations.

the red liquid assumes at once a yellow colour, and furnishes rapidly
a copious deposit of yellow crystals.         No gas is evolved during the

alcohol, are found to contain

    The new    body,   for which  I propose the provisional name diazodi
nitrophenol, is soluble in alcohol and ether, and crystallizes from the
former solvent in magnificent golden-yellow plates, which detonate
on heating.      Acids have no action upon this substance; on ebulli
tion with water it appears to undergo decomposition; alkalies induce
at once a copious evolution of gas, and give rise to the formation of
dinitrophenol.       This metamorphosis appears to indicate that the
new body still belongs directly to the phenol-group; the constitu

 without decomposition by the alkalies in the cold, giving rise to the
 formation of soluble crystalline salts, which produce precipitates

  The following communications were read:—
   1. “On some Amphibian and Reptilian Remains from South
Africa and Australia.” By Thomas H. Huxley, F.R.S., Sec. G.S.,
Prof. of Natural History, Government School of Mines.
  The author described in the first place the remains of a small
Labyrinthodont Amphibian, which he proposed to call Micropholis
Stowii. The fossil was discovered by Mr. Stow, and accompanied
that gentleman's paper “On some Fossils from South Africa,” read
before the Society on the 17th of November last, on which occasion
Prof. Huxley expressed the opinion that it would prove to be an
Amphibian, and probably a Labyrinthodont.
   It had been found impossible to work out the back part of the                         º|
skull, so as to exhibit the occipital condyles; but the characters of
the few cranial bones which remain, of the teeth, and of the lower
jaw, and the traces of a largely developed hyoidean apparatus,
afforded sufficiently convincing evidence of the affinities of Micro
                                                                -
  holis.
   The generic appellation is based on the occurrence of numerous
minute polygonal bony scutes on the integument of the under sur
face of the head; in which character Micropholis has a remote re
semblance to Archegosaurus.      The scutes, however, are very dif
ferent in their aspect from those of the last-named genus.
   Micropholis has little resemblance with any European Labyrintho
donts, except Metopias, and the singular so-called “Labyrinthodon
Bucklandi,” from the Trias of Warwickshire, to the peculiarities
of which the author alluded, proposing to consider it as the type of
a new genus, which might be termed “Dasyceps.”
   On the other hand, there are two southern forms of Labyrintho
dont, which exhibit many similarities to Micropholis.      These are
the Brachyops laticeps of Prof. Owen, from Central India, and a
new form allied to Brachyops, but distinct from           it,
                                                     from Australia.
 This last was described and named Bothriceps australis.
    The author stated that        he

 to the Carboniferous Formation inclusive; and Micropholis          unlike

 any   of the Labyrinthodonts    whose  precise  age is known.
    The fragmentary remains        of  young reptile, which were found
                                       a
 associated with Micropholis, were stated by Prof. Huxley
                                                                                  a be

 undoubtedly those       of   aDicynodon.    Of this, however, and            of
 small  Dicynodont    skull from the same   locality, he promised    speak
                                                                    to

Murrayi) from near Colesberg, which was characterized at a previous
 meeting of the Society (February 23).       Particular attention was
 directed to the unusually complete ossification of the cranio-facial
 axis, and to the striking resemblance in the structure of the bony
 walls of the olfactory apparatus to that which obtains in Birds.
 Prof. Huxley, in conclusion, gave a sketch of the general proportions
of the Dicynodon, so far as the evidence as yet obtained allows a
judgment to be formed, and particularly alluded to the existence of
a long series of caudal vertebrae.     Specimens of the fossil wood
 found with the remains of D.    Murrayi  had been submitted to  -  Dr.
 Hooker, and declared by him to be coniferous.
     2. “On Rhamphorhynchus Bucklandi, a Pterosaurian from the
 Stonesfield Slate.” By Thomas H. Huxley, F.R.S., Sec. G.S., Prof.
 of Natural History, Government School of Mines.
     The author based his account of this Pterosaurian upon a fine
}.
 fragment of a lower jaw, discovered by the Earl of Ducie in the
             of Sarsden, near Chipping Norton, on a coracoid bone
  rom the Stonesfield slate, in the collection of the Museum of Prac
 tical Geology,+on a large fragment of a lower jaw in the Mu
 seum of the Society, and a very fine specimen of a lower jaw in the
 Museum of the College of Surgeons.             The ascription of the cora
 coid to the same     species   as that to which the jaws belong was ad
 mitted to be     hypothetical;    but their proportions agree sufficiently
 well to   give  probability  to the supposition.    Furthermore, the author
 did not   suppose   it to be   absolutely  demonstrable that the jaws and
 coracoid in    question,   supposing   them to be of one species, were of
 the same     species  as those Pterosaurian remains discovered by Dr.
 Buckland in the Stonesfield slate many years ago, and (though never
 described) named after him Pterodactylus Bucklandi; but, as a spe
 cific name unaccompanied by a description is of no authority, and as
 there is no evidence of the existence of more than one species of
 Pterosaurian in the Stonesfield slate, it seemed that the adoption of
 the specific name Bucklandi would have the least tendency to create
 confusion.
     These remains prove that the Stonesfield Pterosaurian belonged
 to the genus Rhamphorhynchus of Von Meyer, and that it had nearly
 twice the size of the liassic Dimorphodon macronya. The mandible
                                                                          a its
 of R. Bucklandi is remarkable for its stoutness and the depth of
 rami towards the symphysis, which         is   short and produced into
 stout, curved, median, edentulous rostrum.           The teeth are similar
in    form, flattened and sharp-pointed, distinct, and not more than
 seven in number on each side       :     the last tooth
                                                       is     situated rather
 behind the     junctionof     the middle with the     posterior     of
                                                                  third   the
jaw. The author took occasion        to    refer incidentallyto    some unde
scribed peculiarities  in    the structureof   the coracoid of   Dimorphodon
macronya.
                                                                        -

   3. “On a Fossil Bird and a Fossil Cetacean from New Zealand.”
By Thomas H. Huxley, F.R.S., Sec. G.S.,- Prof. of Natural History,
Government School of Mines.
   These remains were, the right tarso-metatarsal bone of a member
of the Penguin family, allied to Eudyptes, but indicating a bird of
much larger size than any living species of that genus, larger indeed
than even the largest Aptenodytes, and to which the name of Palae
udyptes antarcticus was given,   and the left humerus of a small ceta
cean, more nearly resembling that of the common Porpoise than that
of any other member of the order (Balaena, Balaenoptera, Monodon,
Delphinus, Orca, Hyperoodon) with which the author had been able
to compare        Nevertheless,
                it.                there are very marked differences
                                               as

named the  species  Phocaenopsis Mantelli. Mr. W. Mantell, F.G.S.,
to whom the author was indebted for the opportunity        examining                    of
these bones, stated that the beds whence they were obtained were
certainly   Tertiary age, and
           of                     much earlier date than the epoch

Phocaenopsis.
   Prof. Huxley drew attention                  to
                                      the remarkable fact that   genus                        a

 376                    • Geological    Society:-
       April 6, 1859.—Prof. J. Phillips, President, in the Chair.
    The following communication was read:—
    “On    the Subdivisions of the Inferior Oolite in the South of
 England, compared with the Equivalent beds of the same formation
 on the Yorkshire Coast.” By Thomas Wright, M.D., F.R.S.E.
 (Communicated by T. H. Huxley, Esq., Sec. G.S.) With a Note
 on Dundry Hill, by R. Etheridge, Esq., F.G.S.
    The author first remarked that, since the publication of his me
 moir “On the so-called Sands of the Inferior Oolite” in the
 Society's Journal (vol. xii. p. 292), some geologists, both in England
 and on the Continent, had taken the Liassic character of these sands
 into consideration, and that Oppel, Hébert, Marcou, and Dewalque
had agreed with the author on palaeontological grounds, whilst in
 England Mr. E. Hull (of the Geological Survey) had also adopted
 his views. On the other hand, in recent memoirs, Mr. Lycett re
 gards them as forming a distinct stage, and Prof. Buckman still re
 tains them in the Inferior Oolite.
    Dr. Wright then described the beds at Bluewick, on the Yorkshire
 coast, which he regards as the equivalents of the “Cephalopoda
bed” or “Jurensis-bed:” namely some shales and sandstones un
 derlying the rock which he considers to be the basement-bed of the
 “Dogger” or Inferior Oolite.
    These are—1. (uppermost) Shales with Terebratula trilineata,
 Belemnites compressus, B. irregularis, and Trigonia Ramsayi. 2. Sand
 stone, yellow, with Turritella, Trigonia, Astarte, Ammonites con
cavus, A. variabilis, &c.       3. Yellow Sandstone or Serpula-bed.
4. Grey Sandstone or Lingula-bed, with Lingula Beanii, Orbicula,
Belemnites compressus, B. irregularis, Ammonites Moorei, &c.
    The author then observed that the Inferior Oolite in the South
 of England admits of a palaeontological subdivision into three zones,
having the Fuller's Earth with Ostrea acuminata above, and the
Cephalopoda-bed with Ammonites opalinus beneath :—1st (upper
most), the zone of Ammonites Parkinsoni; 2nd, zone of Am. Hum
phriesianus; and 3rd, zone of Am. Murchisonae. He then described
the lowest of these zones, that of Am. Murchisonae, giving as syn
onyms “ Dogger” (part), Young and Bird, and Phillips; “the
Central and lower division of the Inferior Oolite,” Murchison ;
“Fimbria-stage of the Inferior Oolite,” Lycett; “Brauner Jura B,”
Quenstedt; “Calcaire lacdonien” (part), Marcou : “Calcaire à en
troques,” Cotteau; “die Schichten des Am. Murchisonae,” Oppel.
The Leckhampton section was then described, as illustrating this
zone, which was also described in its details as seen at Crickley
Hill, near Cheltenham, and at Beacon Hill; also at Frocester Hill
and Wootton-under-Edge.
   The preceding sections exhibit the lithological character and
stratigraphical relations of the Pea-grit and Freestones, which, how
ever, undergo great and very important modifications when examined
over even a limited area, the Pea-grit as regards its structure;
and the Freestone, its thickness.     In the Southern Cotteswolds the

 Subdivisions            of the Inferior Oolite in the South of England.                                             877
Pea-grit loses                its
                    pisolitic character; and    the eastern part     the   in                                    of
hill-district the Freestones thin out and finally disappear; the In
ferior Oolite being represented         Stow-on-the-Wold and   at   Bur                                         at

ragstones, filled with        abundance     Clypeus Plotii, Klein, and
                                            an                       of

                          of                         the Oolite-marl                   of                             or
Fimbria-bed, were then enumerated. The Oolite-marl was described
 as having been probably derived from the debris        Coral-reef: its                    of
                                                                                            a
 Nerinaean limestone was particularly alluded to.

the Indian Gavial).         This genus and species is founded on the
rostral end of the      upper  and lower jaws of a Crocodilian Reptile,
with a    single  terminal  nostril, situated and shaped as in Teleosaurus,
and    indicating   similarly long   and slender jaws.     Only the incisive
and canine     parts  of the dentition are    preserved;   but these closely
correspond with the same parts in Galesaurus, the incisors being
equal and close-set, of simple conical form, and the canines suddenly
contrasted by their large size.         In shape they resemble closely the
completely formed canines in Carnivorous Mammals.               There is no
trace of successional teeth.          Original transmitted to the British

    Fam. Dicy NoDoNTIA.         Subgenus Ptychognathus, Ow. (TrvXös,
ridge, yyá00s, jaw). --This subgenus is founded on four more or
less entire skulls, two retaining the lower jaw, referable to two
species.
    Ptychognathus declivis, Ow.—Plane of occiput meeting the upper
(fronto-parietal) plane at an acute angle, rising from below upward
and backward, as in the feline mammals; fronto-parietal plane
bounded by an anterior ridge, extending from one superorbital
process to the other; from this ridge the facial part of the skull
slopes downward in a straight line, slightly diverging from the
parallel of the occipital plane; superoccipital ridge much pro
duced and notched in the middle; the occipital plane, owing to
the outward expansion of the mastoid plates, is the broadest
part of the skull, which quickly contracts forward to the ridged
beginnings of the alveoli of the canine tusks; orbits oblong,
reniform, suggestive of the reptile having the power of turning the
 eyeball, so as to look upward and backward as well as outward.
Remains of sclerotic plates. Nostrils divided by a broad, flat, upward
production of premaxillary,          situated nearer the orbit than the
muzzle, smaller than in type Dicynodon ; temporal fossae broader
 than long, and with the outer border longest; palate with single
 large oval vacuity, bounded by palato-pterygoid ridges; occipital
hypapophyses proportionally thicker than in Dicynodon tigriceps ;
no trace of median suture in parietal, which is perforated by a “fora
 men parietale;’ frontals divided by a median suture and supporting a
 transverse pair of small tuberosities; anterior boundary-ridge of
 vertex formed by the nasals and prefrontals, the outer surface of
 both being divided into a horizontal and sloping facet; lacrymal
 bone extending from fore-part of orbit half an inch upon the face to
 the nostril; premaxillary long and single,        its  median facial tract
 flat, witha    low median longitudinal ridge; maxillaries forming the
 lower boundary       of  the nostrils, and uniting above with the pre
 frontal, lacrymal, and nasal bones, their outer surface divided      by  the
 strong ridge suggesting the subgeneric name        ;    teeth of  the upper
jaw restricted   to   the two canine tusks, the sockets   of  which descend
 much below the edentulous alveolar border; lower jaw edentulous,
 deep, and broad, with the fore-part      of   the symphysis produced and
 bent   upto   meet the    seemingly   truncate endof  the premaxillary,   a

generic distinction.                                                    -
   Ptychognathus verticalis.-The skull of this species, repeating the
subgeneric characteristics of the foregoing, has the facial contour
descending almost vertically from, and at almost a right angle with,
the fronto-parietal plane. Orbits proportionally larger and more
fully oval. Ridged sockets of the canine tusks descending more
vertically from below the orbits.             Originals transmitted to the
British Museum       by Governor Sir    George    Grey, K.C.B., from Rhen
osterberg, South Africa.
    Subgenus Oudenodon, Bain (ovcets, none, Öºods, tooth).-The
 skull in this subgenus presents the divided nostrils, the structure
and the rounded contours of that of the true Dicynodons; also the
 same form, relative size, and position of the orbits and nostrils;
but the zygomatic arches are more slender, straight, and long; and,
although there be an indication of an alveolar process of the supe
rior maxillary, the lower part of which projects slightly beyond the
rest of the edentulous border of the jaw, it does not contain any
trace of a tooth, so that both jaws are edentulous,-a character which
had attracted the attention of their discoverer, Mr. Bain, who, in
indicating   it,proposed the name Oudenodon.
  It   ispermissible       speculate
                             to                 on

   It was shown that the Lower Permian beds are scarcely repre
sented in Lancashire and North Cheshire, but that they attain their
greatest development (1800 feet) along a band of country stretching
west and east from Salop to Warwickshire, and the author traced
the margin of the basin in which they were formed, along the west,
north, and east. The local origin of these Permian beds, as having
been derived from the Old Red and Silurian lands by which they
were surrounded, was insisted upon, and especially as agreeing with
the observations of Murchison, Ramsay, and other authors.
   As contrasted with this local origin of the Lower Permian Rocks
of Central England, it was shown that the sedimentary materials of
which the Triassic Rocks are formed must have been drifted by an
ancient oceanic current from a continent or large tract of land
occupying the position of the North Atlantic, and that the sediment
was spread over the plains of England as long as it was mecha
nically suspended. The increasing distance towards the south-east
from the source of supply, accounted for the tailing-out of the se
diment.     During the Bunter Sandstone period, this sediment was
drifted through the channel formed by the great headlands of West
moreland and North Wales; but, as the whole area was gradually
sinking (with occasional interruptions) during the periods of the
Upper Trias and succeeding formations, the Welsh and Cumbrian
mountains must have been nearly covered by sea at the close of the
Liassic period.
   The author adduced the following reasons for considering that the
Bunter Sandstone of England formed dry land during the deposi
tion of the Muschelkalk of Germany:—
    1st. That the Lower Keuper Sandstone rests on an eroded surface
of the Bunter; 2nd, that the basement-bed of the Keuper is fre
quently a breccia or shingle-beach ; and 3rd, that there is a local
unconformity    observable in Stafford, Leicester, and Lancashire
between these formations.
   The author described the distribution of the quartzose conglo
merates which form the middle division of the Bunter, and con
siders it probable that they are the reconstructed materials of the
 Old Red Conglomerate of Scotland.
   The probable extension of coal-measures from the coal-fields of
 England to those of Belgium and France was considered, as also
the bearing of the whole subject on Mr. Godwin-Austen's theory
of the extension of coal-measures under the chalk of the Thames
Valley; and it was inferred that coal-measures might possibly be
found at not unapproachable depths under parts of Oxford and
Northamptonshire.      It was also shown that, from indications pre
sented by the coal-formation at the southern borders of the Stafford
shire and Warwickshire coal-field, there was reason to suspect that
the formation becomes attenuated and less productive of valuable
coal-beds in its extension towards the south-eastern districts.

 ON   THE PHOSPHORESCENCE OF GASES BY THE ACTION OF ELEC
                      TRICITY.      BY E. BECQUEREL.
       the Memoirs presented by me to the Academy on the 16th of
IN   November, 1857, and 24th of May, 1858, relative to the lumi
nous effects presented by bodies after having received the influence
of light, I made use of tubes containing rarefied air, and in which
were placed phosphorescent substances which became luminous
after the passage of electrical discharges.         Some time afterwards,
M. Ruhmkorff, who arranged these apparatus in accordance with
my directions, called my attention to the fact that in certain tubes
containing only rarefied gases, which had been sent to him by M.
Geissler, there were to be seen, after the passage of discharges,
luminous traces persisting only for a few seconds, and analogous to
those diffused by the phosphorescent substances employed in my
investigations.
    I have since studied the passage of electrical discharges through
rarefied gases and vapours, which gives rise, as is well known, to
effects of colour depending on their nature, with the view of ascer
taining what are the gases which present the effect of persistence of
light, and whether the phaenomenon be analogous to the phaeno
menon of phosphorescence observed with solid bodies.               In most
tubes containing such gases as hydrogen, sulphuretted hydrogen,
protoxide of nitrogen and chlorine, we observe faint gleams persist
ing after the passage of induction electricity, or even of a simple
discharge of an electric battery, but the action appears to be limited
to the internal surface of the glass tube.       It is not due to phospho
rescence of the    glass;   for tubes  exposed to the action of a brilliant
light, and then carried again into the dark, give rise to no action of
this kind, and the phosphoroscope must be employed to observe the
 effects of persistence upon the glass, the duration of which is shorter
 than that which follows the action of electricity; the effect presented
by tubes containing these gases would therefore appear to be
the result of an electrization of the glass, or of the adherent gaseous
 stratum.
    With oxygen a different effect is observed; when the discharges
 of a strongly excited induction apparatus are passed through a tube
 containing this gas in a rarefied state, and the passage of the elec
 tricity is suddenly stopped, the tube appears to be illuminated
 with a yellow tint, which persists for several seconds after the inter
 ruption, and decreases more or less rapidly according to conditions
 which I have not yet been able to ascertain.            In order that the
 effect may be very manifest, the electricity transmitted into the gas
 must have a certain tension; it is therefore preferable to inter
 pose a condenser in the circuit, and to excite sparks at a distance
 in the air between one of the conductors of the induction apparatus,
 and one of the platinum-wires penetrating into the tube. A simple
 discharge of an electrical battery of several jars produces the same
 effect.  In order to observe the persistent luminous action, the oper
 ations must be carried on in the dark; care must also be taken to

 384            Intelligence  and Miscellaneous     Articles.
 keep the eyes shut whilst the discharges are going on, and only to
 open them immediately afterwards, so that the retina may not be
 impressed at the moment of the passage of the electricity. The part
 of the tube in which the discharge takes place must be at least 15
 to 20 centims. in length.
    The peculiar action which illuminates the tube takes place between
 the actual molecules of the oxygen gas, and does not pass along the
 walls of the tube; for by making use of spheres of a capacity of
 200 to 300 centims., the entire mass of the gas becomes opaline.
 By prolonging the tubes beyond the platinum-wires, it also appears
 that the rarefied oxygen beyond the part which directly receives the
 discharge, gives rise to an emission of light.        On the other hand,
 this  opalescence  of the   gas indicates that the effect does not result
 from electrical discharges due to the electrization of the glass, and
which would traverse the space illuminated after the cessation of
the inductive discharge, as it may be produced by friction of the
outside of the tube.
    When a tube is to give rise to an effect of persistent luminosity,
there is produced, at the moment of the passage of the electricity,
a yellow tint, which illuminates the mass of gas in the tube, and that
independently of the different tints of the electric rays due to the
intermixed gases; when this yellow tint disappears, the effect of per
sistence entirely ceases to be appreciable.       It is even possible that
gases mixed with oxygen may augment the duration of the per
sistence; for tubes, prepared apparently in similar conditions, fur
nished variable results as to intensity and duration.
    If we operate with a small tube containing rarefied oxygen, after
the electricity has passed for some time, the effect of persistence
ceases to be appreciable; this result appears to show that the pecu
liar property in question disappears in the gas at the end of some
time.     Is it connected with the formation of ozone, which, in a
determinate volume, cannot exceed a certain limit              This I have
been unable to ascertain.
    Sulphurous-acid gas sometimes presents an action analogous to
that of oxygen; but the effect not being always exhibited, I have
thought that it might depend on a partial decomposition of the gas
and on a mixture of oxygen; the same is the case with rarefied air
in the presence of phosphorus. However, I am at present follow
ing out these researches, and hope to ascertain, by means of an
arrangement analogous to that which I have employed in the phos
phoroscope, whether other gases and vapours besides oxygen would
not give rise to effects of luminous persistence of shorter duration
than that observed with the latter.
    The phaenomenon presented by oxygen, and perhaps in different
degrees by other gases, probably depends on a peculiar action pro
duced by electricity; for solar light, and even electric light itself does
not give rise to any phosphorescence of this kind.         Is it the result
of vibrations impressed upon the molecules of the gases, or of a
peculiar state of electrical molecular tension persisting for a few
moments, or of some other physical or chemical cause 2–Comptes

    LXII.    On   the   Periods and Colours of Luminous Meteors.
               By   J.  H. GLADstoNE, Ph.D., F.R.S.*
 Rºº.                 on looking over the records of luminous me
        teors, several thoughts occurred to me which     I
new ; and some of them may be not unworthy of being brought
                                                           believe are
under the notice of those interested in the subject.
   PERIODICITY.-It is well known that showers of falling stars
and meteors occur at certain annual periods, and that the two
most remarkable of these are about August 10 and November 13.
They have been observed on these two dates, not only in our
own country, but on the continent of Europe, in America, and
in India; and Humboldt has brought evidence to show that
August 10 has had a reputation for meteoric displays for several
centuries.    It is not, however, every year that they are seen on
the dates in question, even though the sky be clear; and they
are sometimes reported as occurring a day or two earlier or later.
This slight irregularity as to time may be one cause of their not
being observed during some years, for it is only when the star
showers occur at night that they can be seen. A comparison of
more ancient observations throws additional light on the nature
of this periodicity. M. Chaslest has drawn up a catalogue of
forty-six remarkable meteoric showers—or what are believed to
have been such—between A.D. 538 and A.D. 1123; and here also
we find recurrent periods, but different from those at present
observed.    Not one instance is noted of a shower occurring any
where about the middle of either August or November.             From
the end of the sixth to the middle of the tenth         century,   but

388                Dr. Gladstone on the Periods and Colours
dered the more probable when it is borne in mind that among
terrestrial phaenomena a red colour without any shade of yellow
is rarely seen, and a yellow absolutely free from orange rays
scarcely ever.   A still clearer case of difference of expression
occurs in respect to blue; there can be no reasonable doubt that
we have generally called by that name meteors which, had they
appeared in China or at Paris, would have been designated bluish
or whitish blue. A possible reason for this will presently be given.
Another point of apparent dissimilarity in the three lists, is in
the much greater proportion of white meteors observed in Eng
land; but this also is susceptible of explanation.   The fact                                                 is,

 390            Dr. Gladstone on         the   Periods and Colours
    Colours of train.—Many meteors in their flight leave a train
 behind them, which seems generally to be a faint luminosity, the
 colour of which observers have not usually noted.       M. Coulvier
 Gravier finds the trains usually of the same colour as the meteor
 itself, but he mentions several cases of red trains left by meteors
 that became bluish as they approached the horizon. The con
 verse of this has been observed both in China and England,
 namely a red star leaving a bluish vapour.     Greenish trains are
 also not uncommon in the Paris catalogue.          Red sparks pro
 ceeding from green meteors are recorded as seen both in England
  and in India, and the Chinese speak on one occasion of a score
  of little red stars jumping from a globe of fire. Where a meteor
  breaks up into smaller pieces, these not unfrequently present a
  different colour to the primary: thus an orange-red ball observed
  by Mr. Lowe, July 4, 1851, gave out many small separate balls
  which were bright blue, becoming purple; and the little balls
  shot from the meteor of November 13, 1803, are described as
  tinged with orange, yellow, and purple+. Yellow fragments
  have also been observed from a blue meteor; and the splendid
  vari-coloured fire-ball which flew across the north of England on
  April 27, 1851, left a train of yellow light.
      The colour of the train sometimes changes; thus M. Coulvier
  Gravier relates instances of trains that became greenish after
  having been bluish or reddish, or both reddish and bluish, and
  another instance of a clear yellow train becoming deep red.
      It not unfrequently happens that a meteor is followed a few
  seconds afterwards by a smaller one pursuing the same path.                            I
 and others have observed these to be of the same colour, but
 they do not appear to be invariably              so.
     Radiance different from apparent colour.—In descriptions                        of
 fire-balls,it  not unfrequently happens that the narrator describes
 the luminous body         as   one colour, while

 different colour     on  surrounding    objects.     Instances   might
 quoted from the Chinese records, the most remarkable perhaps
 being that “a blue star spread         reddish glare which lighted the
                                          a
 earth.”     Thus,  too,   inour own   country      lady describes
                                                        a                bril   a
 liant meteor    that, passing  over  Hampstead,       “broke into        in    an
 tensely radiant cloud,” which threw               on
                                                  the walls      the housesof

of   this apparent paradox will          be

                                at

 has been already adverted to; and indeed it is a matter of daily
 observation, that two parties, both perfect in their perception of
 colour, will differ in their mode of explaining the tint even of
 stationary objects; how much more may we expect them to differ
 when a coloured light is suddenly presented up in the sky, and
 as suddenly disappears l Cases in point are not wanting.             A
 meteor which Mr. Lowe designated as yellow, appeared “ of a
 beautiful clear blue colour?” to Mr. T. W. Webb%.           But a more
 curious instance occurred last autumn. The meteor of Septem
 ber 12, 1858, was described in the Times newspaper by several
 eye-witnesses, of whom F. A. B. states it to have been “green
 at first;” N. R. “green surrounded by white;” W. Rowlett,
 “white;” and T. W. “vivid whitish blue;” while B. H. declares
it was “primrose.” Such opposite statements would overthrow
entirely our confidence in the recorded observations, were it not
that the greatness of the discrepancy leads us to the belief that
the meteor in question must have been one that changed in
colour, and thus actually presented a different appearance in this
respect to observers in different places.
    It is also quite possible that a meteor may emit rays which in
the aggregate would produce one colour, and yet may affect the
observer with a sensation of a different colour.         This may arise
from   absorption,   intensity,  or contrast.
    Absorption.—Thin mists and long reaches of air have a ten
dency to absorb or disperse the more refrangible rays emitted
from a luminous body, while they suffer the less refrangible to
pass.    Thus everyone has noticed how red the sun, and how
orange the moon appear under certain circumstances, especially
when near the horizon. This effect must frequently be produced
on the light of meteors during their passage through our atmo
sphere.
    A  row of street lamps in misty weather exhibits the same
phaenomenon      on a smaller scale; and it may be observed even
in clear weather by looking, not at the jets of flame themselves,
but at the streamers which appear to issue from them when we
nearly close our eyelids.       The streamers from the nearer gas
lamps appear yellowish white, from those further removed green
ish or orange, and from the most distant almost red. A candle
seen through a mixture of a little milk with a large quantity of
water, also exhibits in a striking manner the non-transmission of
the more refrangible rays.
   This suggests a simple explanation of the fact, that those
meteors which appear to change colour during their passage
through the misty skies of England almost invariably terminate
in red.     It may not, however, be the sole reason.

392              Dr. Gladstone on               the        Periods and Colours
   Intensity.—Helmholtz has shown that light of almost any
degree  of refrangibility, if very intense, gives a sensation of
whiteness; and perhaps of                      all
                                rays, the blue exhibits this   the                                   in
most striking manner.
   This will account most satisfactorily for two separate facts
already adverted                to.

nating colour of a great shower of falling stars is very rarely
given; and on consulting M. Poey's monthly tables, little can
be observed beyond the fact that the blue meteors are more nu
merous in comparison with the orange during the months of
August, September, October, and November, than during the
rest of the year. M. Poey also makes the singular observation,
that the Chinese meteors “show a remarkable constancy of tints
during a long period of years; when an equally constant but
different scale of colour prevails, and this for several successive
periods.”
   On turning to the monthly tables of the English observations,
we at once remark a great difference in the relative proportions
of the different colours. Thus, to confine our attention simply
to the months of August and November, when the great showers
usually occur, we find a difference that cannot be attributed to
mere accident.     In the following Table, the first two columns
give the actual number of observations in each month according
to the colour; the second two, the same numbers reckoned to a
hundred parts; and the fifth column, the average proportion of
the colours for the whole year as given in the Table on a prece
ding page. There happens to be no observation of green or
purple during either of these months; and for the sake of con
densation    Ihave added together the red and white-red, yellow
 and  white-yellow,  blue and white-blue.

discovered, do not exist.     My mode of operation consisted in
decomposing the fluid, in a V-shaped tube, under circumstances
which permitted me to recognize the direction in which the ions
move towards the electrodes.        In this way it was found that
chloric, iodic, chromic, and manganesic acids and salts are decom
posed exactly in the manner which Daniell proved regarding
nitric and sulphuric acid.
   Of pure specimens of the higher degrees of combination we
have unfortunately but a limited choice.     Many of them are too
refractory, or suffer decomposition at high temperatures; others,
which are easily obtained in a liquid state, are not conductors.
Nevertheless some sufficiently fused Cu°Cl was found to con
duct well, and according to the results of several analyses, split
itself into Cuº and Cl. In like manner, basic protonitrate of
mercury contains for 2Hg one O. The alcoholic solution of sub
limate, when free of hydrochloric acid, conducts very badly, but
is decomposed into Hg.” Cl and Cl; in which case, however,                               I
will not venture to decide whether or not the Hg.” Cl be formed
by secondary combination, or by the action of Hg upon the sur
rounding HgCl.     In           all
                          these cases, whether       simple     com
                                                                  a               or
pound atom was liberated, the amount                       of
                                              decomposition agreed
very well with the indications             of
                                   the voltameter.    As voltametric
medium,                      precipitate               of
                                                                                        to of
          I soon chose the                   silver from nitrate
silver. The latter serves best when only feeble currents are
be obtained.                                            -
   Anhydrous chloride       aluminium, easily fusible, and good
                                 of                                               a
conductor, was decomposed into chlorine and pure aluminium.
Molybdenic acid and vanadic acid were decomposed,            that for        so
one atom of MO% or WO? we had one of O.         Not trace of metal  a
was obtained        at   the same time.
   Acid chromate          of
                        potash    known
                                      is              to
                                            contain the second atom
of acid free from water. Fused,     conducts very well.
                                           it                this case,      In
according      to
                several  analyses  conducted with   care, the current
divides itself between the free acid and the salt. The first was
decomposed into Crº              O*
                           and O”, and the last into      and CrO".      K
The sum       of
             both  decompositions agrees               in
                                            the most exact manner
with the electrolytic law, when             we
                                   assume that       the decomposiin
tions and compositions proceeding     different directions,

of K.    When Crº O* was still further electrolysed, as is the case
with Al” Cl*, then in this new decomposition Crº, or two atoms of
chromium, would have the same signification as three atoms of K.
Unfortunately          I
                    could not examine oxide of chromium in a fused
condition.         I
                 believe, however, that the deportment of chloride of
aluminium is sufficiently convincing. The electrolysis of higher
degrees of combination is as equally reconcileable with the fun
damental law of electrolysis as in the case of chemical combina
tion the multiple proportions are with the law of equivalent .
    Several of the bodies examined, as protochloride of copper,
chromate of potash, or chloride of lead, I found to be sufficiently
good conductors at ordinary temperatures, to be able to measure
this capacity by a precipitate of silver, which undoubtedly was
very small.     By heating without fusion, the conductivity quickly
augmented, and certainly without any real decomposition taking
place.    When a platinum wire surrounded by several layers of
solid and fused chloride of lead was dipped into a liquid chloride
of lead, which was not much or not at all heated above the point
of fusion, a new layer of the chloride naturally deposited itself
round the wire.                If,
                            however,                 by

differences, which certainly occur, and which were also observed
in   your electrolyses, stand              in   no
                                           relation whatever, and may                            be

LXIV.   On the Thickness of the Earth's Crust.      By the Rev.
  SAMUEL   HAUGHToN,   F.R.S., Professor of Geology  in the Uni
  versity of Dublin.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
        your May Number, the Archdeacon of Calcutta has pub
IN   lished an interesting Paper “On the Thickness of the Crust
of the Earth,” on which I would wish to offer a few observations.
   In noticing my own investigations on this subject, he has
accused me of a fallacy in reasoning, and adds that consequently
“my conclusions do not prove anything whatever regarding the
proportion of the solid to the fluid parts.”
   My object, in the paper commented on, was to show that no
investigations on this subject were of any value, inasmuch as
they    allrested    arbitrary hypotheses, among which
                          on                              include                                 I
the law       of    density
                                 (**)              and all guesses                   as     to   the ratio           of
the specific weights      the solid crust and liquid nucleus, and
                                 of
                                       of of At
                                                             have given
                                                                  to of
friction between them.          the close     my paper,                                     I

                 the mode     calculation         employed,      we had   be                          if
the requisite knowledge        the specific gravities and law       den
sity  of the crust and nucleus.     As my object was merely          give                              to of
 an  example,     have chosen
                   I              sufficiently absurd hypothesis: viz.
                                              a
 specific gravity    outer shell 2-75, and
                          of                    whole earth 5:50, andof
the whole composed         two homogeneous parts; required
                                  of                                 find                                  to
the thickness            of
                    the shell. The answer         this problem comes      to

              mathematicians respecting the interior             the globe                       of

miles; and              I
                regret extremely that should have expressed my     I
self so  carelessly, as to leave the impression on the mind of
so good a mathematician as Archdeacon Pratt, that I had seriously
attempted to calculate the thickness of the earth’s crust, if it
has a crust at all : I would rather that he should class me with
those mathematicians who periodically square the circle and dis
cover perpetual motion.
   To show how little is known of the simplest elements of this
problem, which Archdeacon Pratt thinks Mr. Hopkins has solved,
I  may quote the following passage, with which he introduces his
own theorem respecting the crust, derived from the consideration
of the Himalaya Mountains:—
     “Ithas been suggested that the crust may project downwards
into the lava so as to be supported by buoyancy. But this will
not produce the desired effect; for the crust being formed from
the liquid, will have pretty nearly the same density as the parts
of the lava from which it was formed;         anything, it will be            if
somewhat more dense.”
     I
    have never before                        met a student                   of nature who held this
opinion—which                 is highly improbable when we consider that                                      all
metals float     their respective liquids
                        in                    the melting-point, and     at
that lava will float     liquid    on
                                 lava.
   How can the Archdeacon suppose there            any value      Mr.              is                    in
Hopkins's determination         the thickness  ofthe earth’s crust—            of

402       Prof. Challis's Theoretical Considerations respecting
second term     of the value of W, gives rise to   a repulsive   action     of
each atom on neighbouring atoms varying inversely as the fourth
power of the distance, and that the velocity expressed by the
first term, and accompanied by the condensation a, also causes
a repulsion between neighbouring atoms, but of incomparably
less magnitude than the repulsion of the first kind.    Since, how
ever, this part of the velocity, as well as the condensation, varies
simply as the inverse of the distance, it appeared that the                 dy
namic effect of an aggregation of atoms on any single atom
might be of sensible magnitude, and be either repulsive or
attractive according to the distribution of the condensation of
the incident waves about the surface of the atom.
   Now quite apart from the above theory of molecular action, a
general expression for the resultant of the action of surrounding
atoms on a given atom may be obtained as follows, on the hypo
theses that each atom is insulated, and that the forces urging it are
sensible only at insensible distances. Suppose the collective atoms
to constitute a medium, either solid, liquid, or acriform, and
conceive a surface of equal pressure and density of the medium
to pass through the position A of a given atom. Then the result
ant of the molecular action on the atom is plainly in the direc
tion of a normal to this surface, and tends from the denser to
the rarer part of the medium, or from the rarer to the denser,
according as the component action is repulsive or attractive.
Within the sphere of molecular activity the change of density
Ap corresponding to a given change A2 of the distance from
the tangent-plane at A may be considered constant: or D being
the density at A, the density p at any distance 2 from the tan
gent plane is D+Q2, Q being constant.          Hence if r be drawn
from the atom in any direction making an angle 6 with the
normal, and k(r) express the law of the aggregate action of the
atoms included in the small space                             …    ". *

fers less from that on the opposite hemisphere.        Hence the
constant H, which in the above analysis was supposed to be in
dependent of p, must, in order to take into account the effect of
this distribution of pressure, be regarded as an unknown function
of p. The law of Mariotte requires that this function should be
of the form                       that the repulsive action from the individual
                        º, and
atoms should not be                of sensible magnitude.
                                            The small amount
of this repulsion in aériform bodies may well be attributed to
the comparatively large mutual distances of the atoms.    It is
clear that a repulsion varying inversely as the fourth power of
the distance, if sensible between neighbouring atoms in a
gaseous substance, would be enormously great if the same
substance were reduced to a liquid or solid state.
   This law of the increase of the repulsion of aggregation with
diminution of density, seems to account for a phaenomenon
otherwise very difficult to explain, viz. the great development
of repulsive action in the attenuated tails of comets, the effects
of which were so signally- - exhibited

You.     sical properties of ice, of which        have read the report in    I
the Philosophical Magazine, No. 108, remind me of some re
marks on the same subject which occurred to me during my
travels in Siberia.      It seems that at present these remarks may
become useful; for some of them agree perfectly with the results
which you have already obtained, and therefore confirm them,
and some others, like                 all
                                 phaenomena that are still waiting for

406                Prof. Erman on the Structure, the Melting,
immediately the passage over it to Cadilosaja. The crumbling of
the ice into upright flakes extends for about a verst from the
bank; and then begins the level glossy surface. We made a
magnetic observation on the lake, when we had reached a distance
of about ten versts from the shore at Posolskoi. The ice afforded
our instruments a perfectly firm foundation, and was at the same
time more free than any rock can be, from the suspicion of mag
netic attraction.  It is perfectly transparent, but traversed by
perpendicular cracks, by means of which we were enabled to dis
cern where the fluid and dark-green water began, and to esti
mate the thickness of the ice at 4 feet.     These cracks were all
extremely narrow, and filled only with air.         Many of them
reached from the surface  only  to a certain  depth, which was the
same for all, and seemed to be a third of the entire thickness of
the ice. The other cracks then began at this depth and reached
down to the water.                           I
                          remarked, moreover, that the planes
                                                                      *...*.*.

which these cracks affect, intersect one another at an angle of
120°; so that both the upper and                                 di
vided into prisms, which have  nearly  the same kind of  regularity
as basaltic columns, but with a much greater             . . It was
evident that this separation must have taken place during the
congelation of the ice, and that this again took place at two dif
ferent times, and instantaneously in each of the two strata alluded
 to. .    may
         It               be

Par. feet (2749 English) above the sea.—I had begun immedi
ately after noon          to   measure       solar altitudes, when                      a        number      of
light clouds began             to
                       form and then        driven fast    the        to   be                           by

and snow fell for sixteen minutes; then the clouds' dissolved
again, the evening became clear, and the cold increased    the                                          in

                       have never seen snow in more perfect and
more  variously-formed  crystals than during this short and sudden
shower. Each grain fell single, and among the few which set:
tled on the glass or on the metal of my instruments,          could                                 I
distinguish six different forms. Doubtless many more remained
unobserved, for my attention was drawn in the mean time to a
more wonderful and quite novel phaenomenon.           Many of the
crystals began to melt the instant they touched a solid body,
and some, as it seemed to me, melted while still falling through,
the air; but in the next moment this was followed always by a
new congelation, the grain of snow assuming, not           previous                           its
form, but another more complex. Thus,           instance, the most        for
simple crystals which       observed today, consisted                                         of    six

suppose either that these observations were still too rare to
present some one of those neglected and apparently trifling cir
cumstances that are requisite for the phaenomenon in question,
or that this depended also on the spot where         made my first              I
observation having been at a considerable elevation, and conse
quently not far from the atmospheric stratum where the snow
was first formed.     But them, as to the explanation of the ob
served metamorphosis of snow, I think it might have some con
nexion with the equally obscure property of some chemical
precipitates, which, like carbonate of lime, according to M. Ehren
berg, consist, when first consolidated, of regularly arranged solid
globules, and which are then changed, “all of a sudden and quite
wonderfully,” to aggregates of true crystals of microscopic size.

which appear placed like type, a prism-stereoscope may, once          º
for all, be added to a stereoscope of the above description.       If
it be required to test the identity of two sentences consisting of
the same words set up in type, or of two copper-plates before
printing, the stereoscope above described is applied at once to
the plates, which are laid side by side. In applying the mirror
stereoscope, it is advisable to add two magnifying glasses.      As,
in this manner, means are afforded to the physicist of testing the
equality of the distances between lines, so also the circumstance
that in a well-forged bank note the most striking differences
immediately show themselves may be cited to justify the appli
cation of the stereoscope to the detection of false paper money.
It will then be advisable for the Government, if such a note be         s
discovered to be forged, to publish the result of the stereoscopic
analysis as an infallible means of detection.     If  several plates
are  employed    in the  preparation   of the genuine   paper, these
must of course be treated as distinct originals. A copy which
only presents the slight difference which results from the un
equal expansion of the paper, can by the above method be di
stinguished from one absolutely identical.
      LXX.     On Vibrations produced by an Electric Current.
                    By John TYNDALL, F.R.S.
          last Number of the    Philosophical Magazine contains an
THEinteresting       note from   Prof. Forbes on certain Vibrations
produced by Electricity. Without knowing that Prof. Forbes
had written anything upon the subject, I had in a former Num
ber of the Philosophical Magazine appended a short note to a
                                 I
paper by Mr. Gore, in which had referred the rotation observed
in his experiment to the heat produced by the electricity. Prof.
            I
Forbes, if understand him aright, considers the action due to
a repulsive power possessed by the electric current itself, and
considers that a similar repulsive power, on the part of a current
of heat, explains the Trevelyan experiment.
   Were this the case, I think it will be agreed that a point
altogether new, and of very great importance regarding both
heat and electricity, would be established.      But, as far as my
experiments go, they do not countenance this notion.           Many
years ago, Page excited Trevelyan's sounds by electricity; and it
is now,  I  think, nearly six years since   I made the experiment
myself before the audience of the Royal Institution. I then
found that, by continuing the action with the voltaic current for
a sufficient time, the vibrations were continued even after the

heat which the current had excited.

   The manner in which conceive the current to act                                      will be
best understood                    if   we suppose a              flat rocker to rest upon two
pointed wires, coming alternately into contact with them as it
oscillates.   Starting the rocker by the hand,       the current                    let                         be
established;      passes between the rocker and the wire
                       it                                     which                                  on
it chances     restto              at
                       the moment the circuit    made; encounters             is
resistance, heats the wire, and expands it;        also produces                   it                           a
nipple        on
            the rocker   itself, which   tilted up     consequence, is                  in
and comes into contact with the other point.           The current
passes through the new channel thus opened                heats and                     to   it,
expands      before, the rocker being again tilted.
                  as                                     Every time
the rocker comes into contact with the wire, the heating agent
is   there, ready       lift  to              it;
                                 and thus the vibrations are rendered
permanent.
    With regard               to
                        the method         cooling adopted of     Professor                    by
Forbes,      should not conclude that would suspend the phaeno

menon. The interposition              water does not materially alter the
                                                      of
resistance, and cannot abstract the heat with sufficient speed                                                  to
prevent the expansion.         Everybody knows that the electric light
 byis
can       produced under water.         The experiment with the carbon
   no   more than      should
                            I  expect;   for not only     the carbon lifted        is
its be
         own expansion, due          the intense heat developed
                                                     to                  this                              in

                  electricity, but the pores       the substance are alsoof
charged with air and gases, which must expand under the cir
cumstances with almost explosive force.           But think the experi         I
ment with the      bismuth,    where Prof. Forbes finds that         current                        a
fifteen times the strength                           of
                                    that used with the carbon         unable                       to is

pothesis that the effect          due                      to a

       “quelling power” possessed

may succeed,          itnecessary that the flame

stance from the wire-gauze disc.            This sound also only lasts
fora   short time.            nearly
                                  It   is                 an

note    ofthe  tube,   and from time          time      seems       to
                                                                    have           it               to             a
tendency        to   rise.
   We found      experimenting with the carbonic oxide flame,
                       in
that when the sound was        the loudest, the flame detached
                                                    at
itself from the tube from which the gas issued, and formed                                                         a
luminous cloud below the disc, the borders          which were                             of

    between this cloud, and the extremity of the slender tube whence
    the gas was disengaged, might be increased to 10 millims.
       13. It is evident that in the experiment of M. Bosscha, the
    production of the sound must be attributed to the cooling and
    consequent contraction of the heated gas, by the wire-gauze
    disc through which it passes.      This experiment may be con
    sidered the inverse of those that precede.

          IMPRICHT+               made     the observation       that carbonic     acid
            passed over metallic copper at a dull red heat, was par
    tially reduced to carbonic oxide, and that hence the usual me
    thods of analysing nitrogenous substances in which the use of
    metallic copper was involved, were liable to error." This obser
    vation led to some experiments by Lautemannt, who confirms
    the statement as far as concerns the use of the porous spongy
    copper obtained by reducing granulated oxide of copper.           In
    one case he found that when carbonic acid was passed over a
    layer of granulated oxide of copper 30 centims, long, about 14
    per cent, was reduced to carbonic oxide.      But the use of freshly
    reduced   copper turnings  is not liable to this error. In a special
    case, with a layer the same in length as in the previous case, the
    amount of carbonic oxide formed was only 0.05 per cent of the
    carbonic acid passed over—an amount which may safely be
     neglected.   The error may also be obviated by placing a layer
     of oxide of copper in front of the metallic copper.
|      In connexion with this subject, Perrotf found that pure cop
    per turnings  do not decompose carbonic acid; but if the copper
    be not quite pure, and contains iron or zinc, part of the car
    bonic acid is reduced with formation of carbonic oxide.

 in their properties, although they are formed under similar cir
 cumstances from hydrochinone and saligenine, which correspond
 to each other.
    Under the influence of various reagents—oxygen, chlorine,
 nitric acid—arbutine undergoes a series of very interesting
 changes, with the investigation of which Strecker is still en
 gaged, and the results of which will doubtless throw great light
 on the constitution of this substance.
   Zwenger* has published a preliminary notice of an investiga
tion of solanine, which has already yielded some very interesting
results.
   Solanine, a peculiar alkaloid found in many species of solanum,
is a feeble base, with scarcely any alkaline reaction, and the salts
of which are readily decomposed.     In this respect it resembles
narcotine. When solanine is boiled with dilute hydrochloric or
sulphuric acid, the liquid becomes turbid, and crystals separate,
the quantity of which gradually increases.     This crystalline pre
cipitate is a compound of the acid used with a newly-formed
base, which Zwenger calls solanidine.       Its salts are not very
soluble in water; by recrystallization from absolute alcohol they
may be obtained in good crystals.       The alcoholic solutions of
salts of the base give with ammonia a gelatinous precipitate
of the base, which is not soluble in water, but is readily so in
alcohol and ether, from which it may easily be crystallized. The
crystals may be sublimed without decomposition.          It has a
strongly alkaline reaction, neutralizes acids, and gives a crystal
line double salt with bichloride of platinum.     It imparts to sul
phuric acid an intense red colour.      The most unexpected part
of the reaction        is,
                     that the product formed                  at
                                                   the same time                  is

baryta filtered off. The filtrate contained grape-sugar with                      a
trace   ofsolanidine, which imparted           bitter taste; but by

a base thus copulated, although probably investigations under
taken in this direction will reveal the existence of others.
    According to Geuther+, when sodium-alcohol is heated to the
temperature of boiling water in dry carbonic oxide gas, an ab
sorption takes place, and the sodium-alcohol is converted into a
white, solid, crystalline mass. The experiment was undertaken
in the expectation that it would lead to the formation of pro
pionic acid,

                  Sodium-alcohol.         Propiomate of soda.
An    acid was indeed formed; but it was formic, and not propionic
acid. From this Geuther concludes that sodium-alcohol is changed
by carbonic oxide into olefiant gas, C*H*, and hydrate of soda,
NaOHO ; and that the formic acid arose from the action of the
carbonic oxide on the latter. Geuther was not able to detect
the olefiant gas formed.
    Wanklynt also examined this reaction. He found, when pure
sodium-alcohol was heated in closed vessels in carbonic oxide
and afterwards opened over mercury, that only about one-fifth
of the gas was absorbed.          This contraction arose partly from
the difference between the temperature of the flask at the time
it was sealed, and that at which the contraction was observed,
and partly from the absorption of the carbonic oxide by the hy
 drate of soda always contained in sodium-alcohol.            By a careful
analysis of the residual gas, Wanklyn found that it contained no
 trace of olefiant gas, and hence he concludes that the formic acid
produced in Geuther's experiment must have arisen from the hy
 drate of soda contained in the sodium-alcohol used.
    In   continuing his researches on glycol, Wurtz has obtained a
 body which he considers to be the true ether of glycol. When
 glycol, saturated with hydrochloric acid gas, is heated for some
 time in a closed vessel, combination takes place with the elimi
 nation of water, and formation of a neutral chlorinated body
 which is a kind of ether,

                   Glycol.           New body.
 This Wurtz names monohydrochloric glycol. It is a colourless,
 neutral, soluble liquid, boiling at 128°C. When this substance
 is treated with potash, it is decomposed with formation of chlo
 ride of potassium, and a gas, or rather vapour, which is inflam
 mable and burns like olefiant gas.          This is the owide of ethylene,

     Harnitzki's examined the action of phosgene gas on aldehyde.
When vapours of aldehyde are brought in contact with phosgene
gas, a brisk action is set up, with disengagement of hydrochloric
acid, and formation of a volatile product whose vapours condense
to a liquid, which can be obtained in crystalline lamellae, melts
 at 0°, and boils at about 45°. The analytical results, confirmed
by a vapour-density determination, lead to the formula C*H*Cl.
 Its formation would be thus expressed:—                          -

 cular, his researches (printed in the Philosophical Transactions,

 have been of the highest order, and have contributed very greatly to
 the extension of the science.       He has now condescended to the task
  of  writing an  elementary   treatise on his favourite subject; but, as

might have been expected from such an author, this “Elementary "
work abounds in matter which could only have been produced by a
mathematician of the highest rank. The nature of the book is clearly
stated in the Preface:—“I have endeavoured, in the following
Treatise, to convey as complete an account of the present state of
knowledge on the subject of differential equations as was consistent
with the idea of a work intended primarily for elementary instruc
tion. It was my object, first of all, to meet the wants of those who
had no previous acquaintance with the subject; but I also desired
not quite to disappoint others who might seek for more advanced
information.      These distinct, but not inconsistent aims determined
the  plan  of composition.    The earlier sections of each chapter con
tain that kind of matter which has usually been thought suitable for
the beginner, while the latter ones are devoted either to an account
of recent discovery, or to the discussion of such deeper questions of
principle as are likely to present themselves to the reflective student
in connexion with the methods and processes of his previous course.”
    We should have been glad if Professor Boole had entered more
fully into the difficulties which occur in the application of what are
called “Symbolical” methods, and especially in Partial Differential
 Equations.     Considering the very important place held by equations
 of this class in physical inquiries (those of sound and light, for                 in
stance); considering, moreover, that in the application of symbolical
 methods to the solution of these equations we meet with some of
 the most interesting and instructive views of the real nature of these
 methods,--we cannot but regret that more space has not been devoted
 to this part of the subject by one who is so well qualified to handle
it.  We would suggest          the author the publication
                              to                                    supple

                                    to
 going fully into the difficulties connected with their application;
 not that we expect      complete solution

 from Professor   Boole,  but because we feel certain that their collec
 tion and comparison would bring into notice their mutual depend
 ence, and diminish the apparent number             of

   “On the Stratifications in Electrical Discharges, as observed in
Torricellian and other Vacua.”—Second Communication.        By J. P.
Gassiot, Esq., W.P.R.S.
   The author of this Paper states that he procured several vacuum
tubes from M. Geissler of Bonn, and alludes to the experiments
made in similarly constructed tubes by M. Plücker (Phil. Mag.
August 1858), but finding it impracticable to ascertain with accu
racy the nature of the residual gas, he reluctantly laid them aside.
All   the vacuum-tubes in which his experiments were made, were
prepared by himself or in his presence; as each was exhausted and
hermetically sealed, it was marked with a consecutive number; up
wards of 100 were thus prepared; many were broken or otherwise
destroyed, but the remainder he retains with the original numbers
for future reference.      The author uses several terms, which he ex
plains: air, hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen (mercurial) denote that
the vacuum-tube contains vapour of mercury plus the                                             to air

Mr.       J. P.    Gassiot on Stratifications in Electrical Discharges.                                               433
hours in the experiment, and in this manner the preceding results
were obtained.
   In the best Torricellian vacua the author has been able to obtain,
the stratifications always assumed a long cloud-like appearance; by
using ten cells, he on one occasion observed distinct sets of stratifi
cations, one from each terminal, in opposite directions.
   From a variety of experiments made in the laboratory of the
Royal Institution in temperatures varying from –102° to upwards of
 +600°Fahr., he obtained the following results:—
   When the flame of a spirit-lamp is applied to the discharge in a
vacuum-tube, the stratifications, if they are narrow, will become clearer
and divided, attaching themselves to the warmer portion of the tube;
if a section of the tube is heated, the stratifications in that section
will be more separated, becoming closer in the cooler portion.
     If
      heat is applied to a tube which shows the cloud-like stratifica
tions, they will lose their clear distinctness; the deposit from the
negative wire appears to be more free, and distinct sparks or dis
                                                                                 -
charges are apparent, but none from the positive.
   In a Torricellian vacuum from which the mercury was withdrawn,
which gave clear cloud-like stratifications, no change could be ob
served when the temperature was lowered to +32°Fahr. ; at a tempe
rature of –102°,          trace  allthe stratified discharge was destroyed,
                                                or of

disappeared, the discharge filling the entire vacuum with                  white                                 a
luminous glow;               on
                        the temperature being raised the stratifications
reappear. When the mercury                  Torricellian vacuum
                                                         in   a          boiled,                                is
indicating    aheat      upwards

                            in                           condenses carries the   as   it

form, and lastly, the clear cloud-like character of the best Torricel
lian vacua. Under certain conditions the stratifications disappear, the
whole length of the tube being filled with luminosity; when in this
 state, if the outside of the tube is touched, pungent sparks can be
perceived 4th of an inch in length, and the peculiar blue phos
phorescent light, that in the ordinary state is perceptible at the
negative, is perceptible at both terminals, and a galvanometer shows
that the discharge is no longer conductive.
     After noticing the difficulty of obtaining in carbonic acid vacuum
tubes precisely the same results, the author describes one experiment
in which moisture was purposely introduced; in this tube the strati
 fied discharge was very clear and distinct.      He states (and describes
 the illustrative experiment) that under certain conditions the stratifi
 cations entirely disappear, the vacuum insulating the discharge.
 Carbonic acid vacuum-tubes were prepared, into which arsenious
 acid, iodine, bromine, pentachloride of antimony, bichloride and
 bisulphide of carbon were severally introduced, and the results ob
 tained are described.
      In Torricellian vacua the author was necessarily limited in the
 size of the glass vessels employed, but with carbonic acid this diffi
 culty mo longer exists; in one vessel of 7 inches internal diameter,
 the stratified discharge was observed to fill the entire space; in
  another, the discharges were made to pass in the middle of the vessel
  through a small hole in the centre of a glass diaphragm.
      After many trials, the author ascertained that if the negative ter
  minal is covered with glass tubing (open at each end) to about ºth
  of an inch beyond the terminal of the wire, the stratifications are
  destroyed.        In this state the negative discharge appears to issue
  with considerable force through the orifice; this discharge can be
  deflected by the magnet, and wherever it impinges, a brilliant blue
  phosphorescent spot is perceivable, which spot is in a short time
  sensibly heated. The author remarks that in this experiment there
  is the appearance of a direction of a force emanating from the
  negative.
       In some of the vacuum-tubes beyond the clear cloud-like stratifica
   tions, but nearer the negative terminal, several faint striae can be
   obtained: on repeating Mr. Grove’s experiment (Phil. Mag. July
   1858), of allowing the discharge to pass between two metallic points
   attached to the coil, the author observed that these faint striae in
   variably disappeared.
       Stratifications remarkably sensitive to induction on the approach
   of the hand were obtained in a glass cylinder of about 4% inches dia
   meter, in which the wires were hermetically sealed 21 inches apart.
        From the absorption of carbonic acid by caustic potassa, not only
    were vacua obtained far more perfect than by the Torricellian method,
   but the process can be made so gradual as to occupy several
    weeks, or even months, thus enabling the experimenter to examine
   the phenomena of the stratified discharge under a variety of con
    ditions, several of which the author describes; in this manner the
    non-transferring condition for the electrical discharge in a vacuum

 this confirms the    opinion  he ventured to offer in his previous
 paper; for if the pulsations or vibrations of an electrical discharge are
 greatest in the bright bands and least in the obscure, this system of
interference or of pulsations would also account for the entire absence
of stratifications when the air or gas is not sufficiently rarefied, as
 well as when the vacuum becomes nearly perfect, while the gradual
change of narrow to cloud-like stratifications is thus satisfactorily
explained.
   In an additional note to his Paper, the author describes some
further experiments, particularly one of moving the vacuum-tube to
and fro in a rapid manner, or rotating it in a plane, while the dis
charges are made, either singly or continuously: in the latter case the
stratified discharges are separated, giving the appearance of an illumi
nated fan or wheel; in the former, only a single discharge is per
ceptible, taking place in whatever direction the tube may at the
instant be placed. The author considers this experiment as con
firmatory of his former opinion, that the stratifications are entirely
due to a single disruption of the primary circuit.

  “Second Note on Ozone.” By Thomas Andrews, M.D., F.R.S.,
and P. G. Tait, M.A., F.C.P.S.
  Since the publication of their “Note on the Density of Ozone”
(Philosophical Magazine for Feb. 1858, p. 146), the authors have
been    occupied with an extended investigation into the mature and
properties of that body. The inquiry having proved more protracted
than they anticipated, they have thought it proper to send to the
Royal Society a brief notice of some of the more important facts
which they have already observed, reserving a description of the
methods employed, and of the details of the experiments, for a
future communication.
   The commonly received statement, that the whole of a given
volume of dry oxygen gas contained alone in an hermetically sealed
tube can be converted into ozone by the passage of electrical sparks,
is erroneous. In repeated trials, with tubes of every form and size,
the authors found that not more than rim part of the oxygen
could thus be changed into ozone. A greater effect was, it is true,
produced by the silent discharge between fine platina points; but
this also had         its
                     limit.       order  In

dry oxygen, the ozone was gradually absorbed. The experiment is
not yet finished, but already one-fourth of the gas in a tube of the
capacity of 10 cubic centimetres has disappeared.               To produce this
effect, the discharge from a machine in excellent order has been
passed through the tube for twenty-four hours.
    When oxygen is thus converted into ozone, a diminution of volume
takes place. The greatest contraction occurs with the silent discharge,
and amounts to about ºr of the volume of the gas. The passage
of sparks has less effect than the silent discharge, and will even
destroy a part of the contraction obtained by means of the latter.
If   the apparatus be exposed for a short time to the temperature of
250°C., so as to destroy the ozone, it will be found that the gas on
cooling has recovered exactly                    its
                                          original volume. This observation

determined by several sets of experiments. Four of these, consisting
of eight experiments, were made upon four gentlemen, on the author,
Professor Frankland, F.R.S., Dr. Murie, and Mr. Moul, during the
eighteen hours of the working day.            In two of them, the whole of
the carbonic acid was       collected, and in two others the experiment
was made     during    ten minutes at the commencement of each hour,
and of each hour after the meals. The quantity of carbonic acid
varied from an average of 24-274 oz. in the author to 16:43 oz. in
Professor Frankland. The quantity evolved in light sleep was 4-88
and 4.99 grains per minute, and when scarcely awake 5:7, 5.94, and
6:1 grains at different times of the night.        The author estimates the
amount in profound sleep at 4.5 grains per minute; and the whole
evolved in the six hours of the night at 1950 grains. Hence the total
quantity of carbon evolved in the twenty-four hours, at rest, was, in
the author, 7.144 oz. The effect of walking at various speeds is then
given, with an estimate of the amount of exertion made by different
classes of the community, and of the carbon which would be evolved
with that exertion.
   The author then states the quantity of air inspired in the working
day, which varied from 583 cub. in. per minute in himself to 365
cub. in. per minute in Professor Frankland; the rate of respiration,
which varied in different seasons as well as in different persons; the

remains       Elephas antiquus, Hippopotamus Pentlandi, H. siculus,

of Rhinoceros, nor     Elephas primigenius.

previously ascertained fauna of the Cave-period in Sicily may aid in
putting it in relation with the Newer Tertiary deposits of Italy.
   The author then proceeds to describe the Grotta di Maccagnone,
a  previously undescribed ossiferous cave, in the Hippurite-limestone,
westward of the Bay of Carini (between Palermo and Trapani).
In the breccia below its entrance he met with remains of Hippopo
tamus in abundance, and remains of Elephas antiquus in the upper
deposit of humus within the cave.         But some other fossils were
discovered under very interesting and somewhat anomalous condi
tions in this cave.   The interior of the cavern is lined with stalag
mite; and at a spot on the roof, where this is denuded, Dr. Fal
coner found a large patch of bone-breccia containing teeth of
Ruminants, bits of carbon, shells of several species of Helia, and a
vast abundance of flint and agate knives of human manufacture.
At other places, and wherever the author had the calcareous coating
broken by hammers, he found similar remains.          At one spot, on
breaking the stalagmite, he found against the roof of the cave a thick
calcareo-ochreous layer containing abundance of the coprolites of a
large Hyaena.
    Dr. Falconer draws the following inferences from the study of
these facts:—1. That the Maccagnone Cave was filled up to the
roof within the human period, so that a thick layer of bone-splinters,
 teeth, land-shells, and human objects was agglutinated to the roof
by the infiltration of water holding lime in solution.     2. That the
 coprolites of a large Hyaena were similarly cemented to the roof at
 the same period.      3. That subsequently, and within the human
period, such a great amount of change took place in the physical
 configuration of the district as to have caused the cave to be washed
 out and emptied of             its
                          contents, excepting the patches       material  of
 cemented      the roof and since coated with additional stalagmite.

particularly requests that search should be made in the Oolites of
Yorkshire for specimens of Pachypteris with pinnules having a
single midrib.    Sig. de Zigno supports Sternberg and Bronn in the
suggestion that under the term Equisetites columnaris authors have
confounded two distinct forms; one from Brora and Yorkshire, with
thick joints, and illustrated by König ; the other being found in the
Lias and Trias. Some remarks on the probable relations of Glos
sopteris and Sagenopteris follow.
   The remains of Ferns in Jurassic beds of the Venetian Alps are
numerous, though the species are few.       The fructification is often
evident; and the epidermis of the fronds can be sometimes separated
for microscopical examination.      The Cycadea have more species;
and the Conifera (especially the Brachyphylla) are numerous.

across) in a mass of oolitic rock.    These oval bodies being equally
rounded at the ends, and in this differing from birds' eggs, the
author thinks that they must have been the eggs of a reptile.      The
egg-shells were very thin, have been here and there puckered by
pressure, and are more or less occupied with calc-spar.
   4.  “On    some Sections of the Strata near Oxford.” No. I.       By
Professor Phillips, Pres. G.S.
   In this communication Professor Phillips gave the details of    sec
tions showing the base and the top of the Great Oolite in           the
Valley of the Cherwell. This oolite, with sandy layers below       and
variable argillaceous beds above (capped by the Cornbrash),         has
been entirely referred to the Great Oolite formation by the Geolo
gical Survey, and has been traced through Northamptonshire to the
cuttings in the Great Northern Railway near Stamford and Grant
ham; and continues through Lincolnshire to the Humber.          On the
north of that river this series is continued by the Oolite of Brough
and Cave, and is recognized again in the Millepore-rock at the
base of the Gristhorpe Cliffs. Hence it appears that the calca
reous shelly beds of Gristhorpe on the Yorkshire coast are still to
be assigned, as they were in earlier works, to the Great Oolite
group, notwithstanding the fact that they contain a few fossils
which in the South of England are prevalent in the Inferior Oolite,
together with many the distribution of which is not there limited
to one member of the Great or Bath Oolite series.

    Sir P. Egerton on the Fishes of      the  Old Red Sandstone.     445
May 18, 1859.-Major-Gen. Portlock, Vice-President, in the Chair.
   The following communications were read:—
    1. “Palichthyologic Notes, No. 12. Remarks on the Nomencla
ture of the Fishes of the Old Red Sandstone.”          By Sir P. Egerton,
Bart., M.P., F.R.S., F.G.S. &c.
   Premising with some remarks on the in many respects unsatis
factory condition of the nomenclature of the fishes of the Old Red
Sandstone, the author refers to the late revival, by Dr. Pander, of
the discussion as to the priority of Eichwald's name “Asterolepis”
over the “Pterichthys” of Agassiz; and, after a detail of the circum
stances of the case, Sir Philip states that there is every reason for
the retention of the name Pterichthys for the “winged fish” dis
covered at Cromartie by Miller in 1831, introduced by him to the
scientific world in 1839, and named Pterichthys by Agassiz in
 1840.
    The author then proceeded to offer some critical remarks on several
 of the genera and species which Prof. M'Coy has described from the
Old Red Sandstone. Chirolepis velow, M'Coy, is regarded by him as
a good species; but C. curtus as identical with C. Cummingia, and
 C. macrocephalus with C. Traillii. Chiracanthus grandispinus and C.
pulverulentus are regarded as good species; but C. lateralis is referred
 to C. minor. Diplacanthus gibbus and D. perarmatus are accepted.
 The substitution of Diplopteraw for Diplopterus is not considered ne
 cessary. Diplopterus gracilis appears to be a variety of D. Agassizii.
The occurrence of D. macrolepidotus in Caithness, and the restriction
 of D. macrocephalus to Lethen-bar and Russia, are regarded as a
reason for not accepting Prof. M'Coy's view as to the identity of
 these two forms.
    Osteolepis arenatus, stated by Prof. M'Coy to occur at Orkney, has
 been met with only in the Gamrie by Sir Philip. O. brevis is regarded
 as a good species, though the apparent breadth of the head has pro
bably been misunderstood.         Hugh Miller has well figured and de
 scribed the cranial    anatomy    of this species in the ‘Footprints.”
 Triplopterus Polleafeni is also considered to be well established ge
 merically and specifically.    Sir Philip coincides with Prof. M'Coy in
 classing Dipterus with the Colacanthi, but observes that it is distinct
from Glyptolepis.      Dipterus has but one anal fin.     Dipterus brachy
pygopterus and D. macropygopterus          are, in the author's opinion,
 synonyms; but D. Valenciennesi is regarded by him as distinct.
    Conchodus is esteemed by the author only a provisional genus.
    Sir Philip agrees with M'Coy in separating from the Holoptychius
 the large fishes of the Coal-measures which have received the name
 Rhizodus from Prof. Owen.        The latter have an ossified vertebral
 column.     Holoptychius   has  decidedly   two dorsal fins. Some good
 specimens lately obtained at Dura Den prove that H. Andersoni
 and H. Flemingii are specifically the same.        The determination of
 H. princeps by scales alone is not regarded as satisfactory; but H.
 Sedgwickii is a good species.       Gyroptychius angustus and G. diplo
pteroides are considered as good species of a new and important genus;

but Sir Philip refers them to the Saurodipteridae, not to
canthi.   Platygnathus Jamiesoni, Ag., is well-founded, as 
recent discoveries in Dura Den; but the specimen of j
P. paucidens by Agassiz is assigned to Asterolepis by Hug
   With regard to the Placodermata of M'Coy, Pterichthys
costeus are the types, and Chelyophorus is probably a mem
family; but it is still doubtful whether Asterolepis and H

      NOTE ON THE STRATIFICATION OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT.
                      BY MM. QUET AND SEGUIN.
As     all electric light arises from an effect of tension, we must
       regard it as certain that the brilliant and obscure bands of
striated discharges correspond with different tensions diffused alter
nately along the gaseous column.        The question        know what               is,   to

  act upon light and moveable conductors, perceptibly obeying the
 known laws of electrical influences.
     A plate of glass, 2 centims. in breadth and 15 centims. in length,
 was sprinkled with powdered coke, and the two ends of the induced
 wire were caused to act upon the two extremities.             Under the con
 ditions indicated, the powder is seen to arrange itself all along the
 plate in transverse lines distinctly separated from each other by in
 tervals of 2 to 3 millims. The appearance of these lines varies, like
 that of the stratifications, by the influence of an armature applied
 against the glass, and according as the discharges take place by con
 tact or by sparks. We obtain similar bands with ordinary electricity;
 and account for the formation by the propagation of the electricity
 through the conducting powder, and by the mutual repulsion of the
 particles.
     The induction spark is much elongated, and appears perfectly
 striated by brilliant and obscure points arranged like a necklace,
 when it is caused to shoot into the air after having shaken the pow
 dered coke.
     Transverse stratifications of the same kind occur in the discharge
 across a smoky flame. At the apex of a flame of turpentine, the
 brilliant points are sometimes replaced by so many little distinct
 flames.
     2. With the view of understanding the effects of external con
 ductors, we placed flames between the two plates of a condenser,
 setting the lateral conductors in action likewise.          The plates were
 charged by the electrical machine; the flame sank, became widened
 and sometimes bifurcate, the lateral conductors attracted it; it was
 also seen to elongate itself in a dart in two opposite directions.
These circumstances agree with the effect produced by the hand
 º
brought near a vacuum-tube in which a flood of continuous light is
made to pass; a portion of this flood is attracted by the hand against
the wall, and another portion becomes concentrated towards the
axis and stratified.
     We have reproduced, with the electrical machine, a result
that we had already observed with the induction apparatus.                 A
cylindrical vacuum-tube being occupied by a flood of continuous light,
                   We have found that they may even suppress the bands.
Thus    by isolating  one of the electrodes, and placing the other in contact
with one end of the induced wire, by the intermediation of a column of
water, we may obtain at pleasure bands and a continuous flood of light;
by placing one of the electrodes in contact with one end of the wire and
drawing the sparks from the other side, with the intervention of a greater
or less resistance, we may substitute the continuous flood for the bands of
the negative side, of the positive side, or of the whole length of the tube.
The changes of tension may account for these effects.

if it             with two fingers, the flood is seen to divide in two
         be touched
near the   point touched;   the portion emanating from the positive
electrode terminates in a  slightly convex surface, distinctly marked
by a zone more brilliant than the rest. One would say that there
was an accumulation of electrical matter at the spot where the ex
ternal influence has caused a solution of continuity.   This zone is a
band in course of formation; it may be rendered more or less
distinct, and, instead of a single zone, two or more neighbouring
bands may be produced.
   3. By means of condensers formed by glass walls, furnished with
metallic armatures on the outside, and containing between them a
stratum of confined air connected with a manometer, we are at pre
sent endeavouring to analyse the movements caused in this gaseous
stratum by electrical actions; although no spark passes, a movement
is perceptible in               it,

is discharged upon the other externally.

electrical attractions and repulsions, that more
