I. On  the Influence of the Dew-point on Vegetables, considered
  especially with reference to their Temperature.     By D. P.
  GARDNER, M.D., Professor of the Physical Sciences, &c. in
  Hampden Sidney College, &c., Corresponding Member of the
  New York Lyceum of Natural History”.
THE   object of this paper is to establish the mutual relation
  existing between the temperature of plantsi, their eva
poration, and the amount of vapour existing in the atmosphere.
The subject will be examined under four heads, which have
been suggested by the results of the experiments instituted,
and are therefore gradual developments of the proofs by which
the connexion between the dew-point and temperature of
plants is sought to be established.
   1st. Certain vegetables are without any specific heat.
   2ndly. The variations plus or minus the atmospheric tem
perature observable in plants are owing chiefly to the state of
the dew-point,           its
                     elevation causing        increase          an

2       Professor Gardner on the Influence of the Dew-point
tion of the soil and surrounding air: to this we add, chemical
 action increases with atmospheric temperature, &c. &c., and
 consequently the amount of heat resulting therefrom.
    4thly. A review of the foregoing doctrine, with some re
 marks on apparent anomalies.
    § 1.  That certain Vegetables are without any specific heat.
    A    number of insulated measures of the temperature of
 flowers has hitherto been admitted into the books on vege
 table physiology as the whole of our information on the sub
ject of vegetable heat; and these measures have been re
 ceived with distrust or altogether denied.       M. de Lamarck
 observed an increase of temperature in the spadix of Arum
 vulgare, which M. Sennebier afterwards measured and found
 equal to 7°C. above the atmosphere.         The German natu
 ralist Schultz found a flower of Calladium pinnatifidum at 19°
 to 20°C. when the surrounding air was only 15° C. Messrs.
 Hubert and Bory measured the temperature of the spadir of
 Arum cordifolium in the Isle of France, and found it at sun
 rise 44° to 49°C.; the atmospheric temperature being only
  19° C.    M. de Saussure carried his experiments further, and
 with the differential thermometer ascertained an increase of}*C.
 in the male flowers of the melon and other Cucurbitaceae.
    Hypotheses have not been wanting to explain the reason
 why flowers should enjoy a more elevated temperature than
 the other parts of the plant.      Mr. Murray imagined it was
 due to their colour.     Brongniart ascribed it to the increased
 action of the molecules interested in the process of fecunda
 tion. Others have adopted the more plausible idea, that it de
 pended upon increased chemical action, as the absorption of
 oxygen by the petals, &c. of the flower.
    But Messrs. Treviranus, Goppert and Schübler, altogether
 deny that flowers give any indications of an increase of tem
 perature. M. Aug. de Candolle ascribes this denial to the
 erroneous conclusions at which these botanists arrived from
                i.
 experimenting on imperfect plants; since his experience at
 Montpellier
 and others.
                     led him to the same opinion as Saussure
    Placed in so embarrassing a situation, our only resource
 was to undertake a new series of experiments upon the sub
ject; for although the mass of evidence appears to be in fa
 vour of the existence of a specific temperature in flowers, yet
the measures given are too dissimilar to prove satisfactory,
and the experiments appear to have been performed in too          .
loose a manner to silence opposition.     The mere introduction
of a thermometer into a flower is a process undeserving any       º

          on Vegetables, with reference to their Temperature.                                       3
serious attention: the state of the atmosphere has been omitted,
 and in other respects the data are so imperfect, as to exclude
 the possibility of our repeating any of the experiments given
 under similar circumstances.
    The instrument with which their measures have been made
is altogether too bulky in such delicate researches; for                                         al
though the bulb of a thermometer may be thrust into a pump
kin flower or tulip with tolerable facility, yet the contact of
the circumambient air is not completely cut off by the shape
of the flower; and if the fingers or any other contrivance
be used as a means of closing the corolla upon the thermo
meter, the temperature of the new body complicates the
result.    Even when introduced with all care, a bulk of mer
cury or air of as many cubic lines as the flower has super
ficial measure, in either case an imperfect conductor, can only
give a doubtful result.      It is too large in most cases, and must
be confined to experiments upon a few scattered flowers; nor
can it in any instance be made use of to obtain a set of mea
sures over the whole plant; most stems would be crushed in
attempting to introduce              it;
                                    and even       we succeeded if    far,               so
the measure obtained must              imperfect, from the injury
                                              be                                                 in
flicted upon the plant and the small amount               mercury        of
                                                                       air                  or
in absolute contact.

Surement.
     The thermo-electric pair and galvanometer can be made
an extremely delicate differential thermometer; and from ex
periments already made by Drs. Forbes, Ritchie, Draper, &c.,
 we are justified in stating that the degree of variation of the
astatic needles is very uniform for             increments of heat,
in cases where the total amount of variation is as limited as
in the following.
    In obtaining the numbers of the tables, or the measures of
temperature, the pointed extremity of the pair was thrust into
the parts of the plant specified, care being taken to avoid
 contact by the fingers with either the plant or thermoscope;
 the numbers given are the mean of at least five measures made
by forming and breaking the electric circle. The same pair
and galvanometer were used throughout, and the value of a
degree of the index equals two elevenths of a degree of Fahr
 enheit, or 1°F. = 5°-5 galvanometer. It is well to observe here
 that the whole of the junction of the thermo-electric pair must
be introduced into the plant, otherwise the current of electri
city does not circulate freely through the length of the wires,
but passes round from the warm to the cold parts of the junc
tion, forming a circle that does not include the galvanometer,
and therefore producing no deflection of the needles.
    The dew-point marked in the tables was taken immediately
before and after each series of measures, and if any difference
existed, the mean adopted.
   The height of the thermometer is marked both at the time
of the deposit of dew upon the exterior of a glass of iced water
and    its
         vanishing. The drying power, which              Dr. Dalton's

mospheric temperature,        also marked

                                                       in                   it   is
well   to remark, that that great philosopher has ascertained
that the amount   of  evaporation      the same for
                                        is                       all

blish  a complete series     ofmeasures upon.       The plants were
dug from the marsh     in  which they grew, with several pounds

        on Vegetables, with reference to their Temperature.                                       5
of native soil around their bulbs, shortly after sun-rise, placed
in a wooden box and carried at once to the place of destina
tion about 200 yards distant; after having been left a suffi
cient time to allow the soil to radiate any excess of heat, or
about two hours under any circumstances, the measures were
commenced, and recorded at the time.                  Other examinations
of the same group of plants took place however at different
periods in the day, the plants being uninjured and vigorous.
    It is necessary I should observe here, that attempts made            all

a  vigorous plant removed under the foregoing circumstances
are fully    as trustworthy; and when the great deviations               the               of

                             be

     Lest the deviation of the needle of the galvanometer should
be due to any other cause than a current produced by the
temperature of the plants, several experiments were made to
decide this point. The magnetic influence of the tinned iron,
the action of vegetable acids, friction, radiation from the per
son or surrounding objects, were              examined, and      was       all                               it        -

     Inthis table we are presented with an unusually high
amount of drying power, the effect of which is to produce so
rapid an evaporation, that the heat generated in the most ac
tive parts of the plant is neutralized. This group of plants,
although very vigorous when examined, was drooping in six
hours after from excessive evaporation.

    10     Professor Gardner on the Influence of the Dew-point
        The   tables G and A and D of section the first are of a dif
    ferent   class;  in these the drying power varies from 10° to 120
    and 130; being about half of the power in the above tables,
    and representing the air more saturated with watery vapour,
    and therefore less conducive to evaporation.       In these tables
    we remark an uniform elevation of temperature in all the
    highly organized parts of the plant; notwithstanding the minus
    measures of the root from contact with a moist and therefore
    evaporating soil; a good illustration, en passant, of the non
    conducting nature of living vegetable tissues.
       Not to become diffuse, we perceive in these results,
       1st. An uniformity which recommends them to our reason.
       2ndly. They are in conformity with the experience of man
   kind. The effects of moist air on vegetation is known to all,
   the rapid growth, the vigour of plants, or to speak more scien
   tifically, the activity of the chemical and organic actions which
   maintain life are fully manifest.      The result is an increment
   of temperature in exact proportion to the varying activity of
   each organ, whether in the respiration of the leaf or the ge
   nerative functions of the parts appointed to the reproduction
  of the    species.
       The effects of a drought are no less apparent; the leaves
  hang down; there is an air of listlessness about plants very
  analogous to the effects of heat upon the human frame, and
  due to the undue evaporation.
       How firm and succulent is the state of a leaf during moist
  weather; how exsiccated and flabby during a dry season 1 of
  this the tobacco planters in Virginia are so well aware, that
  they esteem moist foggy weather favourable when gathering
  their crop.       It is somewhat curious that these remarks apply
  to the human family; the natives of moist countries, as the
  Netherlands, England, &c., being of fuller habit than those who
  live in arid regions; this similitude does not however extend
 so far as in plants, from the effects of the diseases prevalent in
 swampy countries. It gives me great pleasure here to recom
 mend the paper of Mr. Hopkins in the London and Edin
 burgh Philosophical Magazine for February 1839, on Malaria,
 in which he examines the influence of the hygrometrical state
 of the air upon animal life.
      At this stage of the investigation it is necessary to meet an
objection already urged against the foregoing doctrine, that
it levels the principle of life in vegetables to mere chemical
action. We do not hold any such view. We simply claim
that the sensible caloric generated by plants is the result of
internal action; the amount of caloric is also more or less, ac
cording to the activity of the evaporation, the influence of high

       on Vegetables, with reference to their Temperature,                                                11
temperature radiation, and conduction of the soil. The or
  anic molecule of plants is not a mere compound atom, for it
is beyond the art of the chemist to create it synthetically.
    But, further, to meet objections of this kind, and convince
ourselves of the influence exercised by evaporation upon the
temperature of vegetable substances, we resolved to have re
course to experimental proof of a direct nature.       For this
purpose an experiment made by Dr. Hales (Statical Essays,
exp. 30) upwards of a century ago, was repeated with such
modifications as to suit our purpose.
    A green apple, about 1% inch in diameter with a cluster
of leaves; was plucked from the
tree; and the stem introduced
through a cork into a glass tube
filled with water, to the lower
end of which a smaller tube was
cemented, the extremity, passing
downwards into a cistern of de
coction of logwood; the appa
ratus being supported in the ver
tical position by a retort-stand,
as represented   in the sketch;
and being found air-tight, the fol
lowing experiments were made.
The temperature of the apple
was estimated at given intervals
with the thermo-electric pair, at
the same time the drying power
and elevation of the coloured
fluid in the smaller tube was ex
amined, and the measures tabulated for the purpose of ex
amining the connexion of these phaenomena at a coup d'acil.
A further experiment was then made by covering the apple
and     its
         leaves with   delicate caoutchouc bag,
                                   a                      arrest                         so   as   to
evaporation, and after given interval examining the tempe
                                       a
rature of the fruit and elevation of the coloured fluid. These

     Bromide of anisal (Bromanisal).-Bromine acts violently on
 the solid oil, hydrobromic acid is evolved; on allowing the
 fluid mass to stand for some time it partly solidifies; small
 portions of aether extract an oil which contains bromine, and
 the solid substance may be purified by solution in boiling aether
 and pressing between bibulous paper. It is colourless, forms
 voluminous crystals, insoluble in water, somewhat soluble in
 alcohol, and more so in aether. It is decomposed at a tempera
 ture above 100°. Formula is C* H!" Brº O*.
    The action of chlorine is more complex; according to the
 length of time the chlorine has acted different products are
 formed, none of which crystallize, and whose purity therefore
 cannot be relied on.        Once a substance was obtained with the
 formula C* His C1, O’. The next product is                     CI” O’. C*H*

constant. The salt is at first flocculent, it afterwards becomes
crystalline, and must be washed out with water.

III.  Further Remarks on Fernel's Measure of a Degree, in
   Reply to Professor De Morgan's Letter in the Number for
   May. By Thomas GALLowAY, A.M., F.R.S.

        GENTLEMEN,
    long   as the argument relative to the length of Fernel's
SOdegree
           of the meridian turned upon a standard of measure
derived from the human body, or the length of a man's walking
pace, I saw little reason for adding any thing to my former
communication, being satisfied that a result expressed in terms
of  such a standard would bear any interpretation (at least
within wider limits than would include the differences under
discussion) that any one might choose to give       but the new                             it;
evidence which has been produced       Prof. De Morgan     your      by                                 in
Number for May, changes entirely the state       the question.                         of
   The conclusion       which Mr. De Morgan has ultimately
                                      on at
arrived    founded
              is       two assumptions: first, that the diagram

                                      scale; and secondly, that

 *According      Mr. De Morgan's hypothesis Fernel's 68.096
                     to
Italian miles contained 3,404,800 English inches, and conse
quently   single mile was equivalent

which is 278 yards shorter than the Italian mile of Dr. Ber
nard, and 225 yards shorter than the old Roman mile, with
which Mr. De Morgan states (I think on good grounds) that
the Italian mile was commonly though vaguely supposed iden
tical. The difference is so great, and the result so much at
variance with all the other authorities which have been pro
duced, and which concur in giving the Italian mile longer than
the Roman mile, that if we admit the hypothesis we are driven
to the improbable conclusion that Fernel, without intimation,
laid down an arbitrary foot for himself, thereby rendering his
statements unintelligible or deceptive.
   There is another statement of Fernel's, which though of no
value towards giving the exact length of his degree, may
perhaps go for something when the question turns upon a
difference of 16 miles in 70.        He states that the northern
extremity of his arc was reckoned by the country-people to
be 25 leagues distant from Paris.         Now it is not here ma
terial to inquire what the length of the league was.            We
know from the difference of latitudes that the distance in a
straight line was somewhere about 70 English miles, and it
cannot be supposed that the vulgar estimate was in error to the
extent of anything like 16 miles.         But as Fernel manifestly
supposes his own determination was not at variance with the
vulgar estimate, it is difficult to believe that he gave his re
sult in terms of a scale by which the reputed distance must
have been reduced nearly a fourth part.        Amiens, from which
it has  generally been supposed     he  measured,  is 75 miles from
Paris by the road.
     Imay also add, that if the hypothesis be correct, Fernel's
notions of a degree, before he attempted to measure            must                  it,
have been very extraordinary.          the same workIn    which the            in

 Fernel respecting the length of the geometrical pace.           His
 words are, “Neque audiendus est Fernelius, qui lib. i. Cos

     On the grounds above stated,—the total absence of direct
 testimony that the line figured in the Monalosphaerium is a
 copy of the foot used by Fernel, and the improbability of the
 consequences     resulting from the supposition,--I think we
 must conclude either that the diagram was intended for nothing
 more than to illustrate the description of the measuring rod,
 or else that it was reduced by the printer; and that the ques
 tion as to the true length of Fernel's degree remains as doubt
 ful as ever. At the same time, considering the great uncer
 tainty in which every thing connected with Fernel's operation
 is involved, and seeing that we have nothing better than con
                            I

diffidence I give my opinion in opposition to that of Professor
De Morgan, who has evidently bestowed much attention on
 the subject.

 IV.  Supplementary    Notes on the true Position in the “Devonian
    System” of the Cornish Killas. By the Rev. D. WILLIAMs.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
       one of the earliest communications I had the honour of
 INsubmitting     to the public through the medium of your va
luable Journal,     I pointed out both by text and section, that
the Cornish killas was the last or newest formation in “the
Devonian System.”         I entertained such entire confidence in
the Chudleigh Sections, as much from their own evidences
as from the crowd of contradictions and apparent anomalies
elsewhere which they reconciled, that        I felt no hesitation in
committing myself absolutely to them, from the conviction
that (as Nature could not deny herself) I should meet with
nothing but additional confirmations in the large portion of
country which I had not then surveyed. A recent excursion
into Devon and Cornwall having furnished me with some im
portant structural facts in addition to those       I communicated
in your Number for February last, I request permission to
detail them to your readers, some of whom, in whose conver
       I
sion am more particularly interested, however silent, may
not yet be satisfied.

30            Professor Kelland's Note on Fluid Motion.
under which the equations of fluid motion can be solved.
 Whilst interest is awakened on the subject, it may not be
deemed utterly unimportant to offer a few remarks on the
general question, especially as any peculiarity in the mode of
proceeding, however valueless in itself, may serve as a hint
to guide or incite others to the most important investigations.
   The question before us appears to me to be this—What
new conditions must we introduce, or what transformations
must we effect, in order that the four equations of fluid mo
tion may be reduced to four other equations, each containing
the differential coefficients of only one quantity?  Before this
question can be answered, at least before we can set about
introducing any new conditions, it appears requisite to an
swer another question—Are there any necessary conditions?
Of course the answer is in the affirmative. The equation of
continuity is one.    But it is not the only one; for unless the
pressure and velocities are discontinuous quantities, the equa
tions deduced by the application of D'Alembert's principle
must be statical equations, depending on the time only in as
far as the velocities depend on the time.    Hence the relations
which would exist amongst the differential coefficients of p,
were the fluid at rest, must exist when it is in motion; that                           is,
                                 dip      —      d”   p.

    These, then, are equations           condition; the bearing

what new hypotheses are admissible, and,                all,   detect    in   to
those which are not.

on the authority of Barker and Gergèr, neither of whom was
really the author of the analysis, which is a very old one by
Braamcamp and Siquiera Oliva, as Dr. Pereira in his excel
lent work very properly states.
    Another much more modern, and better analysis, by Dr.
 Phillipsº, is quoted in Turner's Chemistry, and also by Dr.
Christison; the formula deduced from it is 3. SO3 +8 Hg O.
This analysis is very nearly correct, yet the slighterror which
it contains has the effect of giving to the formula a complexity
which it does not properly possess.
    In Berzelius's System, and in Gay-Lussac's Chimie des Sels,
the formula given is SO,4-3 Hg O. This have found to be                    I
the true composition of the salt, and it is adopted by Graham
in his Elements; yet I have never been able to find in the
Journals the analyses on which it is founded; hence I consider

    This process is cheaper than that of heating chlorate of
potash; for two parts of bichromate of potash will produce as
much oxygen as one of chlorate of potash, while the latter is
nearly three times the price of the former; and besides this,
the residue of the first is valuable, and may be reconverted
into bichromate of potash. It is likewise a more convenient
process than any at present known, since it may be conducted
at so low a temperature that an ordinary retort and lamp may
be used for the production of a considerable quantity of oxygen.

     [Note.—I have tried this process and find that it answers
very well, the gas being given off,        I think, with greater readi
ness than when       sulphuric    acid and binoxide of manganese are
employed.       Occasions     I   have no doubt will occur in which
 this method may be advantageously substituted for            others.-

X.      On Sir D. Brewster's Deductions from the Hourly Ob
    servations   at Leith in 1824–25.         By S. M. DRAch, Esq.,
    F.R.A.S.

        GENTLEMEN,
THEdetailed deductions alluded to in the title of this article, as
                   in the Edinburgh Philosophical Transactions,
vol. x., flow from any expression of the temperature in func
 tions of the time. Let v = the temperature, t = the time;
  –T     = a fixed instant; then to be real v = function of
           Ti, (4T),
    {+                      log (t + T),
                                          ...i (t + T), constant }.
which is developable into the series
      w = A + B (t + T) + C (t + T)* + D (t + T)” + &c.
A, B, C, &c. are functions independent of the time, and com
prehending the latitude, declination, radiation, &c.
    When t = — T, v = A.
    First. If A = the daily mean temperature, t =           –T  = time
of morning mean, and 0= B+ C(t +T) + D(t+T)*, + &c.
gives the other times of mean daily temperature. .
    There being only one (evening) mean, this series must be
very convergent, and
       =  —  T – B. C or more
                                   correctly, t = — T   –      B_

thus    B D is very much       less than C*.

 XI.    On the Motion of Luminous Waves in an Elastic Me
   dium, consisting of a system of detached particles, separated
   by finite intervals. By S. EARNsh Aw, M.A. of St. John's
   College, Cambridge.
            equations                      my last communi
 THEcation on thisobtained at the close of
                    subject (vol. xx. p. 373)  involve six co
efficients, A, B, C, D, E, F.   From the peculiar manner in
which they enter those equations it is known, that if the co
ordinate axes be turned through proper angles, their directions
still remaining rectangular, the equations will assume the
forms
       d”     = — ki” #,    d” =    -    k,” ".    d”   &   = — kº &
  These show that vibrations of m parallel to any one of the
axes   of dynamical symmetry cannot be affected by vibrations
 which are parallel to the other axes.      Simple as these equa
 tions are, they have  precisely the same degree of generality as
 the original ones, for the motion of the particle m. It might
 not happen that the axes of dynamical symmetry for every
 particle would be parallel to those for m, and that the same
 position of the coordinate axes would reduce the equations of
 motion for the other particles of the medium to the same form,
 and cause them to have the same coefficients as for m. A
 condition equivalent to mechanical homogeneity of the me
 dium must be fulfilled that this may be the case. It is neces
 sary therefore to appeal to experiment for license in this
 matter. By experimental means we learn that the positions
 of the axes of elasticity for waves of a given length are fixed,
 and that the velocity of transmission of such waves is uniform,
and that both these properties are independent of the thick
ness of the medium: hence we may assume that k, k, k, have
constant values through the whole interior of a medium, and
that the equations in the simple forms above given are appli
licable to, and fully represent    all

rection, and that the vibrations have no necessary reference
to the direction of transmission. And it is to be kept in
mind that we have found our equations without the aid of
any hypothesis respecting arrangement; and therefore it
is impossible by means of arrangement to affect our results.
And, again, we have assumed no particular law as the law
of molecular action. I have elsewhere shown that there
 are laws under which the motion of the aethereal particles
 would not be a vibratory but a translatory motion: we have
 rejected these laws in assuming that ki ka ks are                     possi                               all

 the                    out    the
the late Dr. Wollaston.         He describes the mode          obtaining the
protoxide        palladium, and enters into the analysis
                    of                                          the hydrated                         of
oxide, the black suboxide, and the true basic carbonate           that metal;                                of
detailing their properties and the formulae which express their mode
of  composition. The chlorides          palladium form the next subject
                                                               of                                                                of
inquiry; and the author concludes from his experiments that the loss
of  chlorine which the protochloride undergoes, when kept for some

time in a state of fusion at a red heat, is perfectly definite; and also
that the loss represents one half of the chlorine which the salt con
tains.   But in the double salts formed by the protochloride of pal
ladium with the chlorides of the alkaline metals, he finds that the
similarity of constitution usually occurring between the compounds
of ammonium and potassium is violated. From his analysis of the
oxychloride of palladium the author concludes that it is quite ana
logous to the ordinary oxychloride of copper. He then examines a
variety of products derived from the action of a solution of caustic
potash on solutions of ammonia-chlorides of potassium.             Their
properties he finds to indicate analogies between palladium and
other metals, whose laws of combination are better known.           The
sulphate, the ammonia-sulphates, the nitrates, and the ammonia-ni
trates of palladium, and lastly, the double oxalate of palladium and
ammonium, are, in like manner, subjected to examination in a de
tailed series of experiments.
    The second section of the paper relates to the compounds of pla
tinum, and comprehends researches on the composition of the proto
chloride of platinum; on the action of ammonia on biniodide of pla
tinum; and on the action of ammonia on the perchloride of plati
 num; in which the properties of these substances are detailed and
the formulae expressing their composition deduced.

    After reciting the various opinions which have prevailed among
anatomists regarding the manner in which the bronchial tubes ter
minate, whether, as some suppose, by cells having free communica
tion with one another, or, as others maintain, by distinct and sepa
rate cells having no such intercommunication, the author states that
having been engaged in investigating, with the aid of the micro
scope, the seat and nature of pulmonary tubercles, he could never
discover, in the course of his inquiry, any tubes ending in a cul-de
sac; but, on the contrary, always saw, in every section that he made,
air-cells communicating with each other. He concludes from his
experiments and observations, that the bronchial tubes, after dividing
dichotomously into a multitude of minute branches, which pursue
their course in the cellular interstices of the lobules, terminate, in
their interior, in branched air-passages, and in air-cells which freely
 communicate with one another, and have a closed termination at the
boundary of the lobule. The apertures by which these air-cells open
into one another are termed by the author lobular passages: but he
 states that the air-cells have not an indiscriminate or general inter
 communication throughout the interior of a lobule, and that no ana
 stomoses occur between the interlobular ramifications of the bron
 chiae themselves; each branch pursuing          own independent course

  structure of the Corallidae.” By J. S. Bowerbank, Esq., F.G.S., com
  municated by Thomas Bell, Esq. F.R.S., was resumed and concluded.
      The author submitted small portions of nearly seventy species of
  bony corals to the action of diluted nitric acid, and thus obtained
  their animal tissue, freed from calcareous matter, and floating on
  the surface of the fluid in the form of a delicate flocculent mass.
  By the aid of the microscope, this mass was found to be pervaded
  by a complex reticulated vascular tissue, presenting numerous rami
  fications and anastomoses, with lateral branches terminating in
  closed extremities. There were also found, interspersed among
  these, another set of tubes, of larger diameter than the former, and
  provided, in many places, with valves; the branches from these
  larger vessels occasionally terminate in ovoid bodies, having the
  appearance of gemmules or incipient polypes. In other cases,
  masses of still larger size, of a more spherical shape, and of a

nected with each other by a beautiful network of moniliform fibres,
Numerous siliceous spicula, pointed at both extremities and exceed
ingly minute, were discovered in the membranous structure of se
veral corals; and also other spicula of larger size, terminated at
one extremity in a point, and at the other in a spherical head; a
form bearing a striking resemblance to that of a common brass pin.
    Besides these spicula, the author noticed in these membranous tis
sues a vast number of minute bodies, which he regards as identical
with the nuclei of Mr. Robert Brown, or the cytoblasts of Schleiden.

   Nov. 12, 1841.-The following communications were read:—
   I. On the Longitude of Dr. Lee's Observatory at Hartwell.
   The longitude of this observatory was assumed from various au
thorities to be 3" 20-6 west from the Royal Observatory at Green
wich, by the late Mr. Epps, for some time after his arrival at Hart
well. These authorities appear to have been as follows:                                   in  8
   Capt. Smyth, by means of two trips with a chronometer                                   3 20:2

   The mean of these determinations was naturally supposed by Mr.
Epps to be very near the truth.                  In October 1838 this mean result
was found, however, to differ considerably from the difference of                                  º*
meridians as determined by twelve chronometers, taken by Mr. Dent
from the Royal Observatory (which was 3" 24*46).                                      It was evi
dent, therefore, that there was either an error of nearly four seconds
of time in the longitude of Hartwell, as previously assumed, or in
the observations made there on this occasion to determine the error
of the clock with which the chronometers were compared.                                   A care
ful recomputation of         the observations, as recorded in the Hartwell
transit books, was therefore made, and the result (as far as the re
ductions were concerned) was found to be correct.
   A reference was then had to Aylesbury church spire, the position
of which had been determined by the Trigonometrical Survey. This
was done by means of an estimated distance of the spire from the
Hartwell Observatory, taken from a county survey, and the observed
azimuth of the former from the observatory. This gave a result
(3" 23*07) differing 2*5 of time from Mr. Epps's former determi
nation, and 1"5 from that obtained from Messrs. Arnold and Dent's
chronometers, and was therefore far from being satisfactory.
   In the following January another series of results was obtained
by means of ten chronometers, which were taken by Mr. Dent as
before, from the Royal Observatory to Hartwell, on the 6th of that
month, and the comparisons made with the transit clock at the latter
place on the same day. The chronometers were brought back to the
Royal Observatory on the 9th following.                           The difference of meri
dians by these observations was 3" 24°06.
   Other results were also obtained by means of chronometers taken
from the Royal Hospital Schools at Greenwich to Hartwell Obser
vatory; and, in reference to these results, as well as to those before
obtained, Mr. Epps observes, in a letter to Mr. Fisher, “The results
agreeing so well with the former, I think we may conclude that
3" 24*2 (as you have already noticed) is extremely near the truth.
This may be called the mean result of thirty chronometrical deter
minations.     I may remark to you, that my observations for time are
made with as much attention as possible to the state of the transit

instrument; viz. that it works with no apparent error in collimation,
nor level error, but correcting as occasion may require for azimuthal
deviation. With the exception, therefore, of minute differences in the
right ascensions of the stars by which the clock-errors were deter
mined, and some trifling optical defects, I conclude that nothing of
importance can be urged against the mean of                  the results.                  all                       In
deed, all the observations respecting the chronometrical comparisons
are plain and straightforward matters           fact    conjunction with the
                                                                  of              in

                                           the observation books.”

                    in
firmed by      many chronometrical results,

      III. Observation of the Lunar Occultation of Venus on September
  11, 1841, at Mr. Bishop's Observatory, in the Regent's Park.
      The occultation of Venus by the moon was observed here, but
  not under favourable circumstances. The morning was clear, but
  the wind easterly. The equatoreal telescope was charged with a
 power of 105. Venus was badly defined in general, the air being
 in a very disturbed state. The enlightened edge of the moon com
 pletely hid the planet at about 18" 31* 21*, Greenwich mean astro
 nomical time. The time was not accurately noted, the observer's
 attention being principally directed to the phaenomena of the occul
 tation.     No projection on the moon's limb, nor any distortion of the
 form of Venus, was perceivable.                      The edge of the moon was well
 seen, and sharply defined on the planet's disc.
     The commencement of the reappearance at the unenlightened edge
 was not well caught, the planet becoming visible at some distance
 from the centre of the field. This being instantly rectified, the dark
 edge was well seen on the planet, which did not appear in the least
 distorted. The reappearance was complete at about 19° 41" 54°,
 Greenwich mean time, and was observed with the power 105. The
                                                                                               :
 air had become very smoky, and vision was extremely bad,

   VI. Introduction to a Catalogue of 1677 Stars included between
the Equator and 10° of North Declination, observed at the Royal
Observatory of Padua.               By M. Santini.       Communicated by Sir        -
J.  F. W. Herschel, Bart.                                                          s
   The observations of the stars in this catalogue were made with
a meridian circle constructed by Starke, a description of which is
to be found in the fifth volume of the Transactions of the Academy
of Padua. The object of M. Santini has been so to arrange his new
catalogue that, at every eight or ten minutes of right ascension,
there should be found in each parallel of declination a well-deter
mined star, with the view of facilitating the comparisons of planets
and comets with neighbouring stars, by means of micrometrical
measurements.
    The brightest stars that could be found were chosen for this pur
pose, very few being admitted which are below the eighth magnitude.
They were observed for convenience of reduction in contiguous
 groups, in such a manner that the corrections necessary for reducing
them to the mean equinox of 1840 might be applied to the mean of
 the apparent positions observed, for the mean instant of the series;
 and the greater number of the stars were observed three times in
 both elements.      It is the author's intention to proceed immediately
 with similar observations of stars in the zone extending from the
 equator to 20° of south declination; and he invites astronomers to
 participate in his labours by observing some other zones.
    The observed right ascensions of Bessel's fundamental stars were
 compared with their right ascensions given in the Berlin Ephemeris,
 for obtaining the clock-correction; and the azimuthal deviation of
 the instrument was obtained by the superior and inferior transits of
 Polaris.
    The polar point of the circle was obtained by observed zenith
 distances of Polaris and the same fundamental stars, using Carlini's
 Refraction Tables, and the apparent declinations of the Berlin Ephe
 meris. The agreement of the individual results both for clock errors
 and for polar point was in general highly satisfactory. To obtain the
mean places for 1840, small special tables were used similar to those

                       The papers read were, 1st, “On the Electrical
relation between Plants and Vapours.” By Mr. Pine. The author, still
pursuing the same path as that traced out in his former communica
                                                                          61
tions, makes copious extracts, from various quarters, both of natural
and experimental facts, in support of his views of the relation be
tween the subtle fluid—electricity, and the functions of vegetable
life.    His opinions and reasonings are worthy of examination.
    2nd, “Further Observations on Electrotype Manipulation—Depo
siting on Plumbago—Electro-lace.”             By Charles V. Walker, Esq.,
 Hon. Sec. The      difficulty  attendant on the reduction of copper upon
the   parts  of  plumbagoed      surfaces most remote from the connect
ing wire, is obviated by a very simple process.          One or more fine
leading wires are twisted round the main wire, and made to abut
 upon any part of the surface where the reduction has not occurred.
The value of this apparently trivial piece of information can be ap
 preciated by experimentalists alone. The material, to which the
 term “electro-lace” has been given (and of which specimens were
before the Society), is obtained by depositing copper upon net or
lace, previously prepared with wax and black-lead.           It was first fa
 bricated   by Mr.  Phillips  of  Cornwall, in lieu of the copper gauze re
 quired in the construction of Prof. Grove's modification of Smee's
 battery.    But it will be readily seen that such fabrics as gauze and
 lace, when covered with copper, and plated or gilded, may be intro
 duced, in a multitude of ways, into the construction of ornamental
 work, where at present embossed and perforated cards are employed.
     3rd. “Nitrate of Soda compared with other Salts employed for
  Constant Batteries.” By Geo. Mackrell, Esq., Mem. Elec. Soc. Cells
  were excited with solutions of sulphate of copper, bichromate of
  potash, nitrate of potash, and nitrate of soda. The palm of supe
  riority, for constancy of action, is awarded to the latter: in addition
  to this, when employed for electrotype purposes, it throws down
  more copper in proportion to the zinc consumed, than either of the
  other three : the zinc plates (no slight advantage) are clean when
  removed from the battery.
     Mr. Weekes's Register for January was next read. At the sug
  gestion of several scientific correspondents, with a view to promote
  the objects of coincident observation, Mr. Weekes begins the Register
  of 1842 by giving the readings of the barometer and thermometer at
  9 A.M. instead of 2 P.M.
      March 15.-The papers read were, 1st, “Details of an experi
   ment, in which certain insects, known as the Acarus Crossii, appeared,
  incident to the long-continued operation of a voltaic current upon
  Silicate of Potash within a close atmosphere over mercury.”              By
  W. H. Weekes, Esq.

62                       London Electrical Society.
     After alluding to  the original experiment of Mr. Crosse, and to
 the   objections made that the insects might have sprung from ova
 in the   atmosphere,  Mr. Weekes states that he had resolved to pro
 vide  against  such  contingencies.   This he effected by placing the
 solution, which was prepared with the utmost caution, beneath a
 bell-glass, which has not been disturbed from Dec. 3rd, 1840. Late
in October 1841 the first insect was detected; on Nov. 27th several
 were seen : since then they are constantly to be seen, sometimes
 solitary, at other times in pairs, and occasionally three or four to
gether. The operation was conducted in the dark, light being only
admitted at those times when the progress was under examination.
The voltaic current was from a short series of Daniell's battery,
These creatures appear to love darkness; for on the admission of a
ray of light they hasten away and seek hiding-places in the recesses
of the apparatus. Simultaneously with this another arrangement
was made, in which the current from a water battery was made to
pass through a solution contained in a bell-glass of oxygen. Insects
appeared in this on the 20th Feb. 1842, and eight or ten fine vigo
rous Acari were visible. This is but a brief summary from a very
long and carefully written communication. The author assumes
nothing; he does not venture to theorise, but gives a plain and ex
plicit account of his experiments and of their results. The operation
is still going on, as there is every reason to expect a further deve
lopment of insect life.     More completely to preclude objections, he
is preparing another apparatus in which nothing but glass, metal,
and mercury (distilled from its sulphuret) will enter.
   2nd. “ Note on Electro-tint, and on etching Daguerreotype
Plates.” By W. G. Lettsom, Esq., M.E.S.
   This note was illustrated by specimens of tints produced by Prof.
Von Kobell of Munich, and Dr. Berres of Vienna. The former
has improved upon his original process of electro-tint by a method
of retouching the plates and then reobtaining others.
   3rd. Extracts of a letter from John Samo, Esq., of Surinam,
M.E.S., containing “Information respecting the Gymnotus Electri.

   Among the specimens possessed by Mr. Samo were two in one
tub, whose relative lengths were 30 and 15%              in.

    6th. Mr. Weekes's Electro-Meteorological Register for February
1842 was then submitted to the Society".
    May 17,-A note from Mr. Weekes was read, stating that, when
he commenced those experiments, during which insects had been
developed, he made similar arrangements, and placed them in va
rious parts of his house, without allowing the voltaic current to pass
through them; and in no case, by the strictest examination, could
he detect any appearance of the insect.
    A paper “On Lightning Conductors, and on the Lightning-Flash
which struck Brixton Church,” by Charles V.Walker, Esq., Hon.Sec.,
was next read. Having examined the steeple of this church, which was
struck by lightning on Sunday, April 24th, the author of the paper saw
in the damage done so good an illustration of the opinions delivered by
Dr. Faraday a few days previously at the Royal Institution, that he
was induced to survey more carefully the path, and report it to the
 Society. We cannot, without drawings, enter into detail on the sub
ject, but will condense the general conclusions which result from the
 investigation. The steeple was surmounted by a copper cross, which
 formed the first good conductor: the second was twenty feet from
 this, and in passing along the interval the masonry about the cross
 was shivered to pieces, and the cross itself was forced out of                                   its
 place: the third conducting series was twelve feet from the second                               :
 here       second explosion occurred, and the base                column threeof

 feet       diameter was shattered and the column rent.             How strange
                                       these are not better guarded against

ployed in the electrotype process.        Several mineralogical specimens
were submitted to the Society.        A long and highly interesting paper
was then read, “On the Transfer of Mineral Substances, through
 various Fluids, by Electric Agency,” by Andrew Crosse, Esq.,
Mem. Elec. Soc. The first experiment related in this paper was as
follows:--Mr. Crosse kneaded some pipeclay into the consistency
of putty, and imbedded in it a piece of limestone and a shell; this
was in a basin: he then made a mixture of powdered sand and sul
phate of iron which he placed above the pipeclay, and having filled
the vessel with water he allowed the whole to stand for many months.
This arrangement was made in imitation of a natural arrangement
of like character which had fallen under his notice, and in which the
shells and carbonate of lime had become coated with sulphate of
lime. In hopes of attaining the same result artificially, this experi
ment was instituted ; and to the great satisfaction of the author
when he examined the results, the shell and the limestone had lost
in weight, and around each were crystals of sulphate of lime. It is
Mr. Crosse's strong conviction, that though many mineral produc
tions may result from the direct action of electric currents, yet far
the largest portion proceed from operations analogous to this,
from the direct electrical affinity or attraction between particles of
matter coming into contact by this slow and constant action. The
only point in which this experiment differed from nature                  that                         is,
the vessel    which the operation was carried
              in                                        was not porous. On       on
this point Mr. Crosse stated         fact which will not

electrotypists, that voltaic deposits are more abundant when the
vessel employed       porous,      that the sulphate

   II. Let the axis of the surface, perpendicular to the plane of the
conic, be considered analogous to the conjugate axis; then, since
the square of the distance from focus to centre, in a conic, is equal
to the difference between the squares of the transverse and conju
gate semi-axis, we may consider, as analogous to the transverse
semi-axis, the line drawn to the extremity of the perpendicular axis
from the point analogous to the focus.
   III. Since the square of the semiconjugate diameter is equal to
the sum of squares of semiaxes minus the square of central radius
vector, let the same be supposed true of the line analogous; i.e.
if A be the line analogous to the transverse, and B to the conjugate
semi-axis, let
Assuming these definitions, we shall have the following theorems
analogous to those in plano.
   1. The sum or difference (according as the focal conic is perpen
dicular to a real or imaginary axis) of the distances from the points
analogous to the foci, to the corresponding point on the surface, is
equal to 2 A.
   2. The rectangle under them = B'º.
   3. The sine of the angle, made by either with the tangent plane,
is
     #.
  4. The rectangle under the perpendiculars from these points on
tangent plane = B".    "
  5. The sine of the angle between the central radius vector and
tangent plane             =       #     (A' being the central radius vector).
     6. The portion of the normal intercepted between                                      the surface
and the plane of the focal conic is                   *     .   B'.
     7.   If    a plane be drawn perpendicular to the line                            joining points
analogous to the foci, and at a distance from the centre equal to
                                                                                                     #

  May 24.—Mr. Robert Mallet read a paper “On the Physical Pro
perties and Electro-Chemical and other Relations of the Alloys of
Copper with Tin and Zinc.”
   These experiments are collateral to the researches on the action
of air and water on iron, upon which the author has been engaged
at the desire of the British Association.             In the progress of these
inquiries, it became necessary to determine the action of solvents on
iron in presence of various definite alloys of copper and tin and of
copper and zinc.       Hence it was requisite to form many such alloys
in  rigidly   assigned   proportions as to their constituents, a matter
known to     experimenters     to be one of difficulty, especially in the case
of so oxidable and volatile a metal as zinc. The difficulties were
overcome by a peculiar arrangement of apparatus, permitting the
metals to be fused and combined in close vessels.              The results were
verified by assay.      Having these alloys which belong to the classes
of brass or gun-metal, of which most of our instruments of precision
are made, and their constitution being atomic and certain, it seemed
useful to determine some of their properties for practical purposes.
The results are given in the two tables prefixed, pp. 66, 67.
   The author has also determined the numerical conditions govern
ing the rate of solution, or amount of loss sustained in a given time                                                        C
by equal surfaces of iron in solvent menstrua, when in presence of
 allthese alloys, and        the alloys themselves.

  A   Cycle  of  Eighteen   Years  in the Seasons of Britain; deduced from
     Meteorological Observations made at Ackworth in the West Riding
     of Yorkshire, from 1824 to 1841; compared with others before
     made for a like period (ending with 1823) in the vicinity of London.
     By Luke HowARD, Esq., F.R.S.              With Five Plates. London,
     Leeds, and Pontefract, 1842, pp. 22, 8vo.
  WE        are happy to find from the little work now before us, that this
            veteran meteorologist is still prosecuting his labours with his
 pristine ardour; and we congratulate him on the result, now, as he
 truly states, ascertained beyond controversy, that a periodical revo
 lution takes place, bringing alternate warmth and coldness through
  successive trains of seasons in our variable climate.        We do this
 with the greater satisfaction, because we think that between the
 torrents of shameless empiricism on the subject of predicting the
 changes of the weather, on the one hand, and the profound and ex
 tensive systems of meteorological observations on the other, which
 have been brought forward and pursued within the last few years,
 Mr. Howard's       researches, more humble perhaps than the latter,-yet
 admirably adapted for mathematical investigation,-and which ought
 to have been a sufficient antidote to the former, have been in great
 measure forgotten, and when not forgotten still not duly regarded.
     In his account of the climate of London, first printed 1818–1820,
 and reproduced with many additions and improvements in 1833, Mr.
 Howard gave a view of the series of changes embraced by the cycle
 which it is his present object to illustrate, on the basis which his
 observations then seemed to present, of alternate periods of seven
 and ten years, the former ascending, the latter descending in the scale
 of heat. He then admitted, from appearances, the probability of
 spaces between these successive periods not agreeing with this rule,
 and answering to the “intercalations” of an imperfect calendar.
 Having since pursued the subject further, he finds “these spaces or
 interposed years to be necessary parts of the scheme at large, which
 now resolves itself into a cycle of eighteen years, in which our sea
 sons appear to pass through their extreme changes in respect of
warmth and cold, of wet and dryness.”
    In the Proceedings of the Royal Society for March 11 and April
 29, 1841 (or Phil. Mag., Third Series, vol. xviii. p. 552–559), are
given abstracts of papers containing the author's views on this sub
ject, as regards the seasons near London, then read before the So
ciety; and one of those papers, relating to the periodical variations
of the barometer from year to year in this neighbourhood, has since
been published in the Philosophical Transactions*.
    * In the paper last mentioned, “On a Cycle of Eighteen Years in the
 Mean Annual Height of the Barometer in the Climate of London, and on
a Constant Variation of the Barometrical mean according to the Moon's
Declination,” the author showed that the barometrical mean in this cli
mate is depressed (on an average of years) by the moon's position in south

70                                 Notices respecting New Books.
   Mr. Howard's present object is to bring in confirmation of the
views enunciated in his former work and in the papers already
alluded to, “the fact of a new period, observed in a new locality,
and that differing so considerably in latitude from the former, as to
justify the inference that the periods are not confined to any part
of our island, but will be found, variously modified, in all.”
   Referring to the papers above mentioned, Mr. Howard continues,
“For   a variety of facts relating to atmospheric periodicity, stated in
a more elaborate way, I shall here briefly analyse the results of the
Ackworth Register, and apply them to my object; saying little
about the barometer, however, because the present observations on
this instrument, however constantly made from day to day, have not
the comprehensive character of those insisted on in my former pa
     ; which were taken from the face of a registering clock.       The
#.
 ables  annexed to this paper, then, comprise the results of a daily
meteorological Register, kept at my instance, and with instruments
furnished by myself, at the Friends' Public School in Ackworth.    I
have observations, not so continuous, made at my own residence
there; by collation with which in many parts I have satisfied myself
that I can depend on these, for the purpose to which they are here
applied, of deducing the differences of seasons from previous and
subsequent    ones of like denomination, by comparison with each
other.”
   We cannot follow the author through the particulars which con
stitute his memoir, nor describe in detail the plates,        consisting                                 all

 that obtained by the same means from the yellow lead of Bleyberg.
 When tried by the blow-pipe no difference is found between the two
 oxides.
      It results from the preceding   researches, that far from being
 composed   entirely of chromic acid and oxide of lead, as Professor
 Johnston has stated, the red variety of yellow lead consists princi
 pally of molybdate of lead; it may however contain a little chromic
 acid. The presence of this acid is readily explained by the ana
 logous composition of chromic and molybdic acids.--Annales des

METHOD OF DISTINGUISHING              BETWEEN WEAK SOLUTIONS OF
         NITRATES AND CHLORATES.              By M. vogFL, JUN.
    When a few drops of tincture of litmus are added to a solution of
 nitrate of potash so as to render it blue, and afterwards concentrated
sulphuric acid, the tincture is merely reddened by the sulphuric acid,
and by the nitric acid set free, but it is not at all decolorated.       A
solution of chlorate of potash, on the contrary, which has been ren
dered blue by tincture of litmus, is entirely decolorated           by the
addition of concentrated     sulphuric  acid, a result  by  which the chlo
rate is effectually distinguished from the nitrate.
    This effect is produced with the chlorate when one part is dis
solved in sixty-four parts of water, but it ceases with eighty parts of
water; but a solution of indigo is decolorated when water contains
only one-500th of           its
                         weight         of

  ter-cresses, Lepidium sativum, L., are among those which especially
  contain much sulphur.
:
     As soils distant from volcanos do not contain perceptible traces of
  sulphur, it appears to M. Vogel not impossible that plants, which
  are much disposed to assimilate sulphur, may have the property of
  deriving it from the decomposition of the sulphuric acid of sulphates.
  M. Vogel, however, found that seeds placed in a soil perfectly free
  from sulphur and sulphates, yielded plants which contained a notable
  quantity of sulphur.
     The soil employed for this experiment consisted of coarsely pow
  dered white glass; it was first strongly heated, but not fused, in a
  crucible, and being afterwards washed with boiling water, not the
  slightest trace of any sulphate could be detected.
     Seeds of water-cresses kept in a moist state were placed in this,
  and when the plants were several inches in height, they were re
  moved with their roots; after having washed the plants, the white
  fibrous roots were cut off, and these as well as the plants were dried,
  and on heating them in a retort, it was found that both of them
  yielded considerably more sulphur than the seeds contained; the
  expressed juice of the young plants cultivated in the powdered glass
  also contained soluble sulphates. The seeds of water-cresses, sown
  in coarsely powdered quartz, flint-glass, and very fine silica obtained
  from silicated hydrofluoric acid, yielded similar results with respect to
  sulphur and sulphates, though the plants did not flourish so well in
  the last as in the two former substances.
     To obtain approximative results as to the quantity of sulphur in
  the water-cress seeds and the plants which they yielded, the follow
  ing experiments were made :-The seed [100 grains 2) was heated to
  redness in a retort, and the gases disengaged were received into a
  solution of potash; acetate of lead was added to the alkaline liquor as
  long as precipitation occurred. The precipitate was of a brownish
  colour, and consisted of hydrate, carbonate and sulphuret of lead; the
  two former were dissolved by dilute nitric acid, and the sulphuret of
  lead remained, which after washing and drying weighed 0.95 gr.,
  which indicated 0-129 gr. of sulphur. According to this experiment,
   100 grs. of the seed contained 0-129 gr. of sulphur.
     The young plants obtained from the growth of 100 grains of the
  seed were similarly treated; their weight was 2040 grs.; they yielded
  by the above-described processes 15°l grs. of sulphuret of lead, equi
  valent to 2-03 grs. of sulphur; consequently the dried plants con
  tained nearly fifteen times as much sulphur as the 100 grs. of seed
  which produced them.
     Another experiment was made by projecting into a red-hot pla
  tina crucible small successive portions of a mixture of powdered
  cress-leaves   with nitrate and carbonate of potash. The residue,
  heated in the crucible and treated with nitric acid, gave a con
  siderable precipitate with chloride of barium, but, on account of the
  sulphate of potash which the plant contains, the quantity of sul
  phur cannot be accurately determined by this process, although in
  general it is preferable to that above described ; 100 grs. of the

 76               Intelligence and Miscellaneous            Articles.
 leaves yielded in this way 4-6 grs. of sulphate of barytes, equiva
 lent to 0.624 gr. of sulphur; but the quantity of sulphate of potash
 is to be deducted from this,
    As the growth of the young plants of water-cresses took place in
 a soil devoid of sulphur and sulphates, and in a room which con
 tained no sulphurous vapours, the origin of the sulphur, M. Vogel
 remarks, is to him a perfect enigma, and at present he confesses that
 he is unable to give a satisfactory explanation of it.—Journ. de Pharm.
 et de Chim., Mai 1842.
                  ACTION OF SALTS ON LIVING PLANTS.
    From the various experiments which M. Vogel, Sen. has made
 on the action of salts on living plants, he has arrived at the following
 conclusions:—
    1st. That plants with their roots when immersed into a solution
 of sulphate of copper, totally absorb the salt, convert it into proto
 sulphate, and die quickly.
    2nd. That acetate of copper produces the same effects, the salt
 absorbed becoming proto-acetate of copper.
    3rd. That plants absorb sulphate of magnesia, nitrate of potash,
 and iodide of potassium, and die more or less quickly.
    4th. That the sulphates of zinc and manganese are absorbed by
 plants without suffering decomposition, and the plants die.
    5th. That plants absorb nitrate of cobalt and nickel, without
 being able to absorb the whole of them from solution; but they die,
 and the same effect is produced by emetic tartar.
    6th. That the oxalate and tartrate of oxide of chromium and
 potash are slowly absorbed by plants, and the bichromate of potash
much more quickly.       The Datura Stramonium and Galega officinalis
absorb the salt of chromium with the greatest rapidity; they become
of a yellow colour and die.
    7th. That plants absorb nitrate of silver; but they decompose              it,
and the oxide of silver      reduced
                            is          the metallic state.
                                            to
    8th. That plants absorb also, and totally, the protonitrate       mer of
cury from solution, but the salt      decomposed.
                                       is

decompose  it into calomel, and others absorb        without decomposi
tion.

Grenier in Zillerthal, and from Rourès near Salzbourg.     They were
treated with sulphuric acid in a platina crucible; the excess of acid
was expelled and the residue treated with hydrochloric acid; the
iron and alumina were precipitated with carbonate of barytes, and
the alkalies were sought for but not found.

cooling.    On heating this glass in the reducing flame, the reaction
indicating titanic acid (a red colour) is not perceptible; most fre

bubbles, and is transparent even after cooling; strong hydrochloric

this mineral occurs in schistose talc,               and consequently in a silicate.
A    series of experiments proved that silica is entirely wanting in na
tive aluminates, such as the corundum of China and Bengal, Oriental
sapphire, the spinel of Ceylon and Norway, the gahnite of Ekeberg;
and that the silica found by other chemists comes from the agate
mortar in which the mineral is pulverized.
     Though the bisulphate of potash is very advantageously employed
in the analysis of aluminates, it is not applicable to that of those                    si
licates which are not decomposable by acids.                      Felspar is only par
tially decomposable by this salt: it is therefore evident that silica is
 a much stronger acid than alumina when it acts the part of an acid;
 for if the bisulphate of potash so readily effects the decomposition of
 aluminates, it is entirely because alumina always acts as a base with
 sulphuric acid.—Ann, der Chem. und Pharm., and Journ. de Pharm. et

             is perhaps no one here present who does not
     reckon  amongst  the fairest enjoyments of thought those
moments which from time to time he is able to devote to the
remembrance of men of genius who have bequeathed to us
important truths. And when I proceed to show that the veil
which obscures the memory of one of these has yet to be
torn away,+that the labours of twenty years employed in ren
dering a truth evident to the eyes of the most incredulous, are
not yet appreciated,—you will then,                        I
                                        cannot doubt, grant me
a moment of the attention which      your   kindness would not
have refused to a cause less disinterested.
   In  the exact sciences, as in all other cases, nature does not
allow us to proceed per saltum; it is necessary that every thing
should be unfolded gradually.        It is the most simple phaeno

    If in general,  gentlemen, it is a duty to render justice to
merit, in the present case it is at the same time a right; for
J. B. Richter, almost unknown by the rest of Europe, was
elected a correspondent of this Academy on the 14th of May
1800. Let us examine his title to our esteem.            It is the best
homage we can render to his memory.
    Richter published in 1792 and 1793, a work in three vo
lumes under the title of Anfangsgründe der Stöchiometrie,
oder Messkunst chemischer Elemente, in which he sets forth
his ideas in the form of a systematic treatise.        But this form,
you know, is little suited for spreading new ideas. How can
a reader be expected to gather five hundred known ideas in
order to discover one that is original | Has not each professor
his treatise, and would it not be a punishment to have to study
nearly the greater part of it? This mode of publication does
not promise success to any but authors who have already ac
quired great celebrity, and with whose works we are obliged to
become acquainted. So Richter, beginning by a work in three
volumes, was not read. Seeing that the great truth which he had
in view was not appreciated, that he was exposed to unjust cri
ticisms, whilst his work was not read, he resolved to publish
his researches separately, which he did under this title, Ueber
die neueren Gegenstände der Chemie, in eleven small volumes
of from 100 to 250 pages each. They appeared from 1793
until 1802.       “I should (says Richter in 1799) certainly not
 have followed up these two first volumes (Stücke) by seven
others, if too severe a criticism of the antiphlogistic school
did not endeavour to put under the bann of sound reason                                all
 those who think differently from        and  it,  this was not added
                                                     if   to
 the annoying circumstance that my Stöchiometrie, although
 endowed with     a sound constitution,        nevertheless consigned
                                                    is
to  the shelf   ofthe shop-keeper.”
     In  the introduction       the first part, Richter tells
                                    to                                            us    he

             is
 set out;—weigh even the form              his expressions, and you

just made, having the same aim             view (says Richter, vol.
                                               in                                      i.

      The third volume (1793) is wholly devoted to a critical ex
   amination of Lavoisier's antiphlogistic system.                  Up to that
   time Richter had     only   known it    by   very     insufficient extracts.
   But in 1792 appeared a German translation of Lavoisier's
   treatise on chemistry, by Girtanner.             Richter obtained and
   read it,  and was convinced          the truths of        the new system.  of

      Do not suppose however that Richter, upon embracing the
  new system openly, abandons himself                                  to

     Éore Richter, and in his time also, it was supposed that
the affinity of a substance was in the direct ratio of the quan

the    quantities  of tartaric and of acetic acid         necessary    to satu
rate the same quantity of lime. He finds that more tartaric

selects carbonate      lime. His choice could not then fall better.

He finds that 1000 parts                      of
                                   carbonic acid are saturated                                               by
1373 parts           of   lime, which gives for 100 parts Ca 57.86 and

C 42:14; according to Berzelius, Ca 56-29 + C 43-71. Not
only does Richter not choose the carbonate of alumina, but
he examines the question to discover why the carbonate of this
base treated by an acid disengages less carbonic acid than
another base.     You see then the ambiguity that there is in
this substance   by  no means escapes him, and he continually
returns to it as an enigma. Richter, armed with so powerful
a principle as that which he had discovered, could not limit
the application of it to his own labours; he also applies it to
those of others, and rectifies or confirms them; for he was, so
to say, endowed with a sense more than his contemporaries.
    Berthollet had found, as Lavoisier says in his treatise on
chemistry, that 69 parts of sulphur absorb 31 parts of oxygen
to become transformed into sulphuric acid.        Richter repeats
the experiment and comes to a very different result.           He
oxidates  sulphur  by  nitric acid; then converts it into sulphate
of lime and obtains 947 parts of this latter for 222 of sul
phur, which makes 856 parts for 201 of sulphur, whilst we
admit at present 857-1. He then greatly approaches the truth,
but to deduce the composition of sulphuric acid, that of the
sulphate must be known exactly. This not being sufficiently
well known to him, he finds that 201 parts of sulphur absorb
227 instead of 300 of oxygen to be converted into sulphuric
acid (vol. v. p. 124), which compared to Berthollet's result,
is still a very beautiful approximation, since this latter had
only found 90 parts instead of 300. Then he is reproached
with Bergmann's researches on the sulphates of potash and
barytes. They are not just, he says, for if we suppose the
salts compound, as Bergmann points out, and if one of them
is mixed with a neutral salt, by which it may be mutually de
composed, there will be an excess of acid or of base, which
cannot happen; every one knows that the solutions remain
neutral (vol. vii. p. 94 and 95): therefore his analyses are false.
    Klaproth had discovered strontianº; he describes and ana
 lyses several of      its
                       salts, without attention     Richter's prin
                                                     to
ciples. The latter applies them and finds that the analyses
of   Klaproth agree with the principle, and consequently that
 they are exact.
  It   isthis very important discovery which has been attri
 buted  to Wenzel. This question therefore demands               at an
 tentive examination; for, take this title from Richter, and you
 make him fall back into the category      ordinary philosophers.

  the nitrates, taking for starting-point 1000 parts of nitric acid.
  His numbers therefore varied continually, which must have
  kept many relations concealed from his sight.
     Nevertheless these tables constructed by Richter have an
  other peculiarity which merits our attention. The names of
  metals are not found in them in writing, but the signs then used
  are substituted for them, as d manganese, 3 iron, 5 zinc,
 )   silver. But here signs fail him, for several metals had just
  been newly discovered; these Richter expresses by the two
 initial letters of the name, for example, xg for chrome, Ti for
 titanium, Te for tellurium. Here then is the first idea of the
 notation so happily completed by M. Berzelius.
    We see Richter continually occupied with the phaenomenon
 of neutrality. What then is the neutrality of a solution? This
 is a thorny question, and one to which, even at the present
 time, many authors answer only in an obscure and evasive
 manner.        Neutrality, says Richter, is absolute or relative: it
 is absolute when the solution does not exert any reaction on
 test papers; it is relative when the neutral salt nevertheless
exerts an acid or alkaline action. But in this case, he says,
however decided may be the reaction exerted by a metallic
solution (for example the nitrate of silver), you recognize,
nevertheless, that it is neutral, because the least addition of an
alkali causes a precipitate which will not dissolve again with
out adding an acid.
    Although Richter had recognised the fact that different
 metals required the same quantity of oxygen in order to be
dissolved in the same quantity of acid; notwithstanding, he
 says, when metals become charged with oxygen without the
intervention of an acid, that by no means prevents them
 from taking very different quantities. Richter, as we see, was
not ignorant that there were different degrees of oxidation,
and he employed himself in determining several of them.
As, however, the works of Richter which relate to the oxides
of metals are far from being very exact,          let   us
                                                         examine  an
example     in    order   to discover    what the inaccuracies met
     in                              toto
with        his determinations are       be attributed.
    He    knew,    for  example,   that arsenic formed two combi
nations with oxygen, arsenious acid and arsenic acid. He
determines       by   a direct experiment the quantity       of
                                                             oxygen
which arsenious acid takes to become converted into arsenic
acid, and finds that 100 parts       of acid absorb 17.2    oxygen,

which  is    not far distant from the real number, 16-17. He after
wards seeks      to  determine the quantity of    oxygen which me
tallic arsenic absorbs     to  become converted into arsenious acid,
and  he    finds for 100 parts  of  metal 15:1 parts    oxygen, de

      viating greatly from the true number, which is 319. Having
      a false idea of the composition of arsenious acid, he neces
      sarily deduces a false composition for arsenic acid.   Now
     this is the way he obtains a number so far from the truth:
     he converts a given weight of regulus of arsenic into arsenic
     acid, and then into arseniate of lead.            But instead of drawing
º    a conclusion from the         weight   of this    latter,   he first tries to
     determine the quantity of arsenic acid which the precipitate
     should contain, and for that purpose sets out from the arseniate
     of magnesia, which must necessarily compromise                         the re                     all

depression of temperature observed is equivalent to that which
would have been produced by the fusion of 457.4 parts of ice
at 0°. But as he finds that the 1440 parts of salt employed con
tain, not 457 parts of solidified water, but 803 parts, he con
cludes thence that this water had not lost as much heat as the
water should necessarily have lost in order to freeze, and that
consequently it is not correct to say ice of crystallization.
   Notwithstanding the depth of his views, Richter was not
the less exposed to critical attacks which were often unjust.
His replies were always not only moderate, but in general
as calm as if he had discussed an uncontested subject. When
                                                       I
M * * * makes me such a reproach, says he, bear it without
thinking myself injured; I merely believe that irony does not
suit the end which criticism ought to have in view and which
should be to convince. Besides, every one cannot follow an
author step by step in order to judge with knowledge of the
subject, for it is not sufficient, for this purpose, to turn over
the leaves of a work.     Several times in his prefaces Richter
complains of not being read with attention. Thus to give an
idea of the manner in which his views were treated, I will
mention another critic (M. Fries) who thought, for example,
that it was impossible to explain why the elements followed a
fixed law in their relations of neutrality. To that Richter re
plies, that nature would be very poor if she were limited only
to what was intelligible for him and for his criticism.
   Another critic asked him with more reason to give a sum
mary of his doctrine which might be comprehended by every
one. Richter's fault was that he did not express himself clearly;
if circumstances had caused him to undergo the severe disci
pline of the French language, if Richter, like Lavoisier, had
drawn his logic from the school of Condillac, the truths which
he published would have spread with more facility, and he
would have produced the same results with less labour.
    In the sciences, gentlemen, labour is divided into two very
 distinct categories; some from their novelty and the generality
 of their results open a new field to investigation, and spread
 great truths which astonish the generation which sees them
 originate.    These works, gentlemen, make an epoch in the
 history of the development of intelligence, and man is hardly
 ever ungrateful for this benefit.     Others, sometimes as diffi
 cult as the preceding ones, are but a tribute of our love for
 science,—a right to the esteem of our contemporaries. They
 pursue and extend paths already opened.           They cause us
 to be esteemed while we     live; a certain deference surrounds
 us: but   let   usnot deceive ourselves;   it   but the homage
                                                  is
 which   politeness imposes   by the fact ofour presence, for after

 to cause these titles not to be remembered; the facts are
 quoted, the authors are forgotten.
    The works of Richter, as we have seen, belong to these two
 distinct classes, and if it is true that a few words should suffice
 to sum up the entire life of a celebrated man, that of Richter
 is altogether summed up in these words (taken from the Wis

 The number of reciprocal transformations necessary to effect
 the separations of the roots, will of course                              ºmi,        depend
 upon the number of figures in them which are identical; but
 there are certain points in the scale between 0 and 1, from
 which, if the roots differ, in however small a degree, the one

in excess and the other in defect, the first reciprocal equation
suffices to show their inequality. These points are, evidently,
the reciprocals of the integers above unity, that is

It would at first sight appear that the least favourable case
for the separation of the roots is that in which they differ
least from unity, since this gives    maximum value       the     its                              to

XVIII.    Contributions to the Minute Anatomy of Animals. By
          GEoRGE GULLiver, F.R.S., &c. &c.—No. II.”
     On the Nuclei of the Blood-Corpuscles of the Vertebrata.
        subjecting the blood of adult mammals to the slow ac
 BY   tion of a very minute quantity of dilute acetic acid, Dr.
 Martin Barry states that he has observed nuclei in the cor
 puscles, which he has depicted in his recent and elaborate
 researches on the blood (Phil. Trans., 1841, part 2). Yet it
 seems fair to conclude that there is an essential difference
 between the blood-corpuscles of mammals and those of the
 lower vertebrata, since the very same treatment which never
 fails to show the nuclei in the latter will not exhibit them in
 the former.    This, as         I
                             have elsewhere stated (Appendix to
 Gerber's   Anatomy,    pp. 13 and 30), does not prove that the
 corpuscles of mammals include no central matter, although
 it induced me to believe that these corpuscles have no nucleus
 like that contained in the corpuscles of the lower vertebrate
 animals.
     When the corpuscles of the oviparous vertebrata are mixed
  with water, or with dilute or strong acetic acid, the nuclei are
  instantly exposed in the clearest manner, appearing thick,
  oval or spherical, and much smaller, than their envelopes.
  Several other vegetable acids, and sulphurous acid, may be
  used with the same effect; and the nuclei may also be readily
  shown by gently moistening with the breath some dry blood,
  which may be again quickly dried so as to preserve the nuclei
  on the slip of glass for future demonstration.      But when the
  blood-corpuscles of Man and of other mammals, not excepting
   the oval discs of the Camelidae (Med.-Chir. Trans., vol.xxiii.,

108                        Mr. Gulliver’s             Contributions to

                               have noticed that the blood-discs of
 mammalia become smaller after the removal of their colouring
 matter by repeated additions of water. Thus some human
 corpuscles having an average diameter of sºnth of an inch,
 measured only rººmth after the whole of their colouring mat
 ter had been separated in this manner, when they appeared
 flat and pellucid, very faint, and obviously differing in size and
 general characters from the particles usually described as the
 nuclei of the blood-corpuscles. No nuclei can be discerned in
 these washed corpuscles, either by the aid of acids, of cor
 rosive sublimate, or of iodine.
     The first part of the preceding observation agrees in some
 essential points with the results obtained by Sir E. Home
 (Phil. Trans., 1818, pl. viii. figs. 1, 2, and 3), Schultz (Lan
 cet, 1838–39, vol.
                i.

                                              the lower vertebrata, both
 the nuclei and envelopes will remain, the latter becoming
 quickly circular, and the former also after few hours.              a Sub
 sequently the envelopes are scarcely visible, and the colourless
matter     ofthe corpuscles, which subsides            the water, appears
                                                                 in

                    the envelopes may                      be
                                               seen; and these are more

weather. Corrosive sublimate affects them very feebly, although
it  instantly increases the opacity                    of
                                              the washed corpuscles                           of
mammalia. When the former             corpuscles     have been kept some
days  in   water, the envelopes become very irregular, and hardly
perceptible          by
                    any means; the size         the nuclei of  diminished,    is

picted organic germs, or objects resembling nucleated nuclei,
in clots of fibrine. Those drawings were made from clots
which were either pale and opake, or as transparent and co
lourless as the serum of the blood.       I have lately examined
the red portions often found towards the edges of such clots,
and observed in these coloured parts a multitude of objects
like the organic germs above mentioned, but tinged with the
colouring matter of the blood.     These ruddy bodies appeared
to be  merely  blood-discs entangled  in the fibrinous clot and al
tered in their characters; and hence the pale germs formerly de
lineated may likewise have been blood-discs still more changed,
especially as the corpuscles of the blood are regarded as cells
 by Schwann, and cell-nuclei by Valentin, while Dr. Barry, as
the result of his interesting observations, asks how     ºny    tis
sues are there which the blood-corpuscles may not form
    The corpuscles, of a yellowish or ruddy hue when highly
magnified, were contained abundantly in the coloured fibrine:
they were rather more irregular in shape than the free cor
puscles of the same blood, and differed especially from the
latter in exhibiting nuclei when washed either with dilute
or strong acetic acid, and even occasionally without the aid
of any reagent. The nuclei often appeared as if flattened and
with a central point, and sometimes like mere granules; they
were commonly grouped together in the centre of the cor
puscle, frequently separated, and sometimes scattered about
its circumference.
    The following figure was made from a minute red part,
magnified 800 diameters, of a large, white and very firm clot
of fibrine from the heart of a woman, aged 20, who died of
puerperal peritonitis and acute pleurisy.

a variation: these were       platina,  lead,    zinc,  glass,  ivory, and
hollow brass, varying from 14 inch to 2% inches in diameter.
The mode of suspension was also diversified, with a similar
view: iron, copper, brass, and silk were successively used,
not only single, but also double, similar to the bifilar mode
suggested by Gauss” for certain magnetical experiments. The

I I  have also    frequently  tried the same      experiment,      when dif.
  ferent visitors were present, since the apparatus has been com

  but also designedly, made          regular series       experiments for

shaken to its centre.   But in no instance have I ever seen
the least disturbance in the lateral motion of the torsion-rod,
nor any difference produced in the results of the experiments.
I have thought       it proper to make these remarks and thus to
 place them on record, because some persons at first ha
 zarded an opinion that the place which                      I
                                                      had selected might
 not be   quite  adapted    for  experiments     of so delicate a nature.
 But a moment's consideration will convince a person conver
 sant with the subject, that no dancing motion of the suspension
 line (even if it did exist) would tend to produce an irregular
 lateral or angular motion in the torsion-rod; and this is the
 only anomalous motion we need guard against.
    “There is also another remarkable circumstance connected
 with this subject, which I think it requisite likewise here to
 place on record. When the torsion-rod has been in a state
 of repose, I have frequently shaken the torsion-box, by rapidly
 moving the ends backward and forward from side to side fifty
 or sixty times, and even more: but I could never discover
 that this disturbance of the box caused the least motion in
 the torsion-rod, which still retained                stationary position.

so likely to be disturbed: and, having closed up the door, he
adopted Cavendish's plan of observing the motions of the tor
sion-rod, on the outside. But, even in a situation like this,
we must not expect a constant uniformity of temperature for
                                                                                                 *
a long period.       Neither of these authors, however, has given
any information on this subject; both of them, however, met
with anomalies for which they could not satisfactorily account:
and, although Cavendish suspected the cause of some of those
anomalies, yet he does not appear to have applied any remedy
for the evil, in any of his subsequent experiments.
     Mr. Baily remarks, that his first experiments were tolerably
regular, although the results were generally greater than those
 obtained either by Cavendish or Reich; but that he soon ob
 served discrepancies which convinced him that some disturb
ing force was in operation, which he had not yet contem
 plated, and which he could not discover. One of the most
 striking evidences of such anomaly was the remarkable circum
 stance, that the arc of vibration, during one and the same ex
 periment, would seldom decrease in the regular manner which
 it ought to pursue, if the torsion-rod were guided by an uni
 form influence; and moreover, that in fact it would frequently
 increase, contrary to       all
                              the known laws          bodies      circum

 considered   it  proper      continue the experiments, for some

                                                            Reich (for the

 each other), whilst many more were conducted                     plan es   on   a

  powerful lamps were occasionally applied near the torsion
  box, with   a view   to raise         an

  createa    powerful influence; and,          the other hand, masses

            jor determining             the Mean Density    of the Earth.           117
     of ice have been employed for   a similar purpose.  The man
     ner likewise of putting the masses in motion was frequently
     diversified, under the hope of being enabled thereby to obtain
     a clue to the object of research.   But the author has consi
     dered it needless to proceed with a detail of these fruitless
      operations, which were carried on, without much interruption,
      for upwards of eighteen months, and amounted in number to
     nearly 1300 experiments. Many of these were of a mere spe
      culative nature, with a view to discover the cause of the ano
      malies here alluded to; but a thousand of them, at least, were
      more especially made for the purpose of determining the den
      sity of the earth, and were eventually reduced.         But the re
      sults, although in many cases very consistent amongst them
      selves, were upon the whole so discordant and unsatisfactory,
      that no confidence could be placed on the general result, as a
     correct value of the true object of inquiry.        And, as he had
     pre-determined not to select merely those experiments which
     might appear to be the most favourable specimens, or sup
º    porting any particular theory, and to keep out of view and
     reject the rest, he consequently abandoned the whole.
         During these investigations the author was frequently visited
     by several scientific persons who took a lively interest in the
     pursuit in which he was engaged, and who kindly offered him
     their opinion and advice on several occasions.           But he re
     marks, that he was principally indebted to Professor Forbes
     of Edinburgh, for the most satisfactory removal of the prin
     cipal anomalies that he had met with. This gentleman's in
     timate acquaintance with the theory of heat, and                  its

                                                           the anomalies
     might arise from the radiation             of
                                           heat from the masses, when
     they were brought         up   to
                                   the sides          of
                                                  the torsion-box: and
     that this might even still operate notwithstanding the inter
     position  of  the sides   ofthe box, and the precautions already
    taken.      As remedy for this influence

    venting the effect    of radiation, from whatever source       might   it
    arise.    Acting upon this advice, Mr. Baily not only caused                    a
    gilt case  to   be made      the manner here proposed, but also
                                   in

that the results soon convinced him that the proper mode had
been taken for the removal of the principal source of discord
ance. For although, in some cases, slight discrepancies may
still appear to exist, as might be expected in any inquiry that
involves so delicate a system of operations, yet where the dis
cordances are of greater magnitude they seem to be confined
to one class of experiments, and to depend principally on the
 nature and construction of the material of which the suspen
 sion-line or torsion-rod is composed, and do not materially
 affect the general result of the whole.      In fact, Mr. Baily states
 that he has since met with very few experiments, made in the
 regular mode of proceeding, that are objectionable, or that
 need be rejected.       Every experiment therefore that has been
 made, under this new arrangement of the apparatus (whether
 good, bad, or indifferent), has been recorded and preserved;
 and they are               all
                     given without any reserve whatever;           being                            it

     After these introductory remarks, the author proceeds                                                          to

a sensible and material error is likely to occur: but this sel
dom   happens if due precaution  has been taken to screen the
torsion-box effectually. Yet the author is still of opinion that
discordances sometimes arise which cannot wholly be attri
buted to change of temperature, but to some other occult                                            in
fluence with which we are at present unacquainted. The re
gular march of the resting-point of the torsion-rod is one of
the most important objects of attention; since any considerable
deviation therefrom is the source of great discordance, and
therefore requires to be watched with care.
   The torsion force comes next under consideration. Mr.
Baily justly remarks that the torsion force of a wire is that

they are never accompanied with any doubt                      difficulty.            or
There   is  however another        subject  that    required  also  is                          to   be
accurately ascertained           every experiment; namely, the ex

                  the centre               of

balls. This has been effected            means   by  plumb-lines, which
                                                                    of

scopical apparatus, carefully adjusted.
   From the results         the several experiments that the author
                                 of
 has made,   itwould appear that single wires,            different dia       of

120          Mr. Baily's Experiments with                              the Torsion-rod
meters, give slight differences in the results. But, he states
that the most discordant results occur where the double sus
pension-lines are formed of silk; and he apprehends that these
anomalies have arisen from the circumstance that all the fibres,
of which the skein is composed, are not equally stretched by the
different balls as they are successively attached to the torsion
rod; and that they are thus severally operated on by different
forces, which consequently produces a discordancy in the re
sults.    These discordances, however, appear to be generally
confined within certain limits.
   The author then gives a detailed account of the various ex
periments that he has made, under the improved form of ap
paratus, which amount in the whole to 2153; and which were
pursued and conducted in different ways,               the purpose                  for                          of

ments, prosecuted in such a variety of ways and with such
different materials, that the several mean results, obtained
from the individual classifications, can be of equal weight.
In fact, the author himself has, in his investigations of the
subject, clearly shown that some of them are entitled to more
confidence than others; and moreover that, in a few instances,
there may be a fair cause for rejection.    On these points how
ever there is no room for explanation in this place: and it
may be sufficient here to state, that, assuming every experi
ment to be of equal weight, the mean result of the whole
2004 experiments is 5'67. Nor is there much probability that
the result of this immense number of experiments will be ma
terially altered, even if those few experiments, which may
appear to be affected with some source of error or discord
ance, should be wholly omitted.
   The author remarks that it cannot escape observation that
the general mean result, obtained from these experiments, is
much greater (equal to ºrth part) than that deduced either by
Cavendish or Reich, who both agreed in the very same quan
tity, namely, 5:44: but he does not assign any probable cause
for this discordance. It is evident, however, from the detail
which he has given of his own experiments, that perceptible
differences not only arose according to the mode in which the
torsion-rod was suspended, but also depended on the materials
of which the suspension-lines were formed: but it is somewhat
singular that none of the mean results, in any of these classi
fications, are so low as that obtained by the two experiment
alists above mentioned.
    In these remarks, no notice has yet been taken of the re
 maining 149 experiments that have been made with the brass
 .
 torsion-rod; a class of experiments that were undertaken for
 the express purpose of ascertaining the effect of such a mea
 sure on the general result. This torsion-rod was nearly of the
 same weight as the two 2-inch lead balls, and about half the
 weight of the two 24-inch lead balls. The experiments were
        not only with each of these balls successively attached to
 the rod, but also with the rod alone, without anything attached
 thereto. The results show that the attraction of the masses
 on the rod should be diminished about ºth part, in order to
 render these three several results consistent with each other,
 and also accordant with the same balls and the same mode of
 suspension, attached to the lighter wooden torsion-rods.

form and exact method derived from a formula similar indeed
to that referred to by Mr. Earnshaw, but in which the very
imperfections pointed out by him are expressly corrected.
   As to the discrepancies between observation and theory in
the higher cases of dispersion,                       I
                                     do not consider them as
        so serious as Mr. Earnshaw appears to do; and this
mainly from the experience                     I
                                have had in ascertaining the
experimental numbers, and the degree of accuracy to which
they can be relied on, for which I would refer to my Report
presented to the British Association on refractive indices.
   Thus much however is clear: the formula even in the ex
treme cases agrees as well as I think can be expected with
observation, provided one of the constants receive a certain em
pirical change in its value, constant for each medium.
   It will therefore be the next step for theory to investigate
whether such a change can be justified; but                      this have      all      I
stated   at large      my work,

XXI.     Reply to some Olyections against the Theory of Molecu
    lar Action according to Newton's Law. By the Rev. P.
    KELLAND, M.A., F.R.S.S. L. & E., F.C.P.S., &c., Professor
    of Mathematics in the University of Edinburgh, late Fellow
    and Tutor of Queen's College, Cambridge*.
WHEN I           wrote my reply to an anonymous correspondent
        in the Phil. Mag. (S. 3. vol. xx. January 1842, p. 8),                                                     I
 did not contemplate extending my remarks beyond the limits
 of the objections before me. But finding, as well from the                                                  pri
 vate communications of my friends, as from what has ap
 peared in your Journal, that silence is construed into an ad
 mission of the indefensibility of the Newtonian law as applied
 to molecular actions, I am induced most reluctantly to enter
 on the defence of the hypothesis. The following remarks are
 the substance of a paper which read before the PhilosophicalI
 Society of Cambridge in 1840, but which, from my extreme
 dislike to controversy, I never printed.          Nor should have                                      I
 now done so, but for the expressed opinion of two of the first
 mathematicians in Europe, whom I am proud to number
 amongst my friends, both of whom have united in urging me
 either to remove the difficulties which attend the theory, or to
 point out in what way they may be regarded as not subversive
 of   its
       truth.     shall   Itmy endeavour    be what follows       argue        in                   to
 with perfect candour, not against the objections              much                           so                 as
jor the theory.         hope nothing

 the production of sound; we are certain that the particles of

 repulsive forces produce normal vibrations, attractive forces
  must act to produce the transverse ones which constitute light.
  There are, however, two things connected with the mutual
 action of the particles of air, which are here left out of the
 account; the one arises from the repulsion of their sur

forces which depend on the excess of the action due to the
right-hand direction above that due to the left can produce
any sensible effect.    Let me repeat that it is not geometrical
symmetry which we assumed; a cubical arrangement which
we sometimes speak of by way of illustration is not an arrange

medium of mechanical     symmetry;     an arrangement of such a
nature that            all

   The two great distinctions which exist                                      in   malleable wrought
iron, are known      the names       by
                                     “red short” and “cold      of
short” qualities. The former       these comprises the tough   of
fibrous iron, which generally possesses considerable strength
when cold; the latter shows      bright crystallized fracture,

  The importance which                          attaches             to   this subject           at   the   pre

tion    byactual experiment.
   The principal causes which produce this change, are per
cussion, heat, and magnetism: and                  doubtful whether       it   is
either      of
           these means per      will produce this effect; and there

   The most common exemplification              the effect     heat      of a                       of         in

iron: and           by
                 heating and  rapidly   cooling,     quenching with                 by

   In these cases we have        least two of the above causes

Manby has mentioned             circumstance which fully bears
                           me       In to          a
out this statement.      the machine used for blowing air                                                          at
the Beaufort Iron   Works,  the piston-rod      the blowing cy                  of
linder, for    considerable time, had
                   a                        very disagreeable jara                                             in
its motion, the cause                of
                             which could not be discovered. At
last the piston-rod broke off quite short, and close                the                                  to

                       it
perly fastened the piston and the rod together. The rod
the fracture presented        very crystallized texture; and
                                         a                                                                     it at

cited considerable surprise. The rod was then cut                short                             at   a
distance from the fracture, and         was found         tough and
                                                          it                         to    be
fibrous        very
              in   a high  degree;   showing   what have already                     I
pointed out, that the effects          percussion generally extend
                                                   In of
only very short distance.
        a                             fact, we might naturally ex
pect, that         as
                the effect               of
                               vibration diminishes       proportion

                                 this means, would also diminish
in  the same proportion.      The effect      magnetism alone may    of
also be estimated from this circumstance. The rod would of
course        magnetic throughout
              be                           whole length; this being

circumstances; but the necessary force             vibration among              of
  itsparticles only extended for         short distance, and
                                                          a        that                                  to
extent only did the crystallization proceed.           The effect                    ..                            of

 the operation must be extremely slow.
    Another circumstance which occurred under Mr. Manby's
 observation, confirms generally the preceding opinions.                A
 small bar of good tough iron was suspended and struck con
 tinuously with small hand-hammers, to keep up a constant
 vibration,     The bar, after the experiment had been continued
 for some considerable time, became so extremely brittle, that
 it entirely fell to pieces under the light blows of the hand
 hammers, presenting throughout                       its
                                              structure      highly cry   a

                                             magnetism they receive

question.
    With railway axles, however, the case               very different.

     Dr. Wollaston first pointed out that the forms                  which                       in

   The general conclusion              which these remarks lead us,

not necessarily dependent upon time for                development, but     its
is determined solely                   by

Monday the 4th instant, the disturbing forces were found to
be still in activity.   At 2 and 4 a.m. the instruments showed
a very considerable decrease of declination, accompanied by a
great decrease of horizontal intensity. At 6 a.m. the declina
tion exceeded the mean of the hour by a still greater amount;
and the horizontal intensity had also increased, though still be
low   its mean value.      All the magnets were then vibrating
through very large arcs. The series            observations     shortof                          at

terruption) for ten hours.

 with the other two instruments; but the observations are un
 reduced, and I am therefore unprepared as yet to offer any
 remark respecting the changes of inclination or total intensity.
 It is manifest, however, even from this imperfect sketch, that
this disturbance presents many features of prominent interest:
    1. In the great magnitude, and marked and abrupt cha
racter of the principal changes.   In both these respects the
changes at 6 a.m. and 12 p.m. on the 2nd instant, afford per
haps the most interesting points of comparison of any that the
system of simultaneous observation has yet furnished; and
much light may be expected to be thrown on the phaenomena
by a comparison of the results which may certainly be ex
pected to arrive from the colonial observatories, as well as of
those which have been probably obtained at Port Louis, in
the moveable observations of the Antarctic expedition.

Nov. 3,        MEMOIR entitled “Supplement to a “Synopsis of the
  1841.        English Series of Stratified Rocks inferior to the Old
Red Sandstone,’ with Additional Remarks on the Relations of the
Carboniferous Series and Old Red Sandstone of the British Isles,”
by the Rev. Adam Sedgwick, F.G.S., Woodwardian Professor in the
University of Cambridge, was begun.
   Nov.17.-Professor Sedgwick's paper, commenced at the preceding
meeting, was concluded.
   The author states that his former synopsis” is now modified; 1st,
by the new classification of the stratified rocks of Devon and Corn
wall (Devonian system); 2ndly, by a larger knowledge of fossils de
rived from some of the groups described; 3rdly, by new observations
made during the past summer in the south of Ireland, the south
western parts of Scotland, and in the north of England.
   New RED SANDstone.—1. England.—It is shown, by sections de
rived from Warwickshire, that the upper part of the new red sandstone
is sometimes unconformable to the lower part, which represents the
magnesian limestone and lowest division of the new red sandston<U+017F>e
group. It is also shown that the coal-measures pass into the overlying
new red sandstone series through the intervention of bands of red marl
alternating with two bands of freshwater limestone, the whole beds
of passage being loaded with common coal-plants. The author then
discusses the sections near Whitehaven.        They show no passage
from the lower new red sandstone (rotheliegende) to the coal-mea
sures; but they show that the flora of the coal-field existed appa
rently in full perfection during the period of the lower new red sand
stone : of this flora he has obtained many new specimens.      He states
that the additional facts lend support to the suggestion thrown out
by Mr. Murchison and himself respecting the age of the coal-field
on the flanks of the Hartz.
   2. Scotland.—The new red sandstone of Dumfries-shire is continu
ous with that of the plains of Carlisle, and is seen overlying the coal
measures from the valley of the Esk, near Canobie, to the neighbour
hood of Dumfries.      Near the latter place it is in mineral structure
the same with the red sandstone of Corncockle-moor, and, at both
places, the red flags contain impressions of footsteps. The author
therefore asserts that the red sandstone near Loch Maben (visited by
Mr. Murchison and himself in 1827) was rightly placed in the new
red group.   The lower divisions of the new red sandstone series do
not appear to range into this part of Scotland.
   To the north of the Galloway chain (the great southern greywacke
chain of Scotland), the new red series almost dies away, and is seen
in very few parts of Scotland.     The author found no traces of it
between Girvan and the mouth of the Clyde.         Coupling this fact

142                      Geological Society:                 Prof. Sedgwick on the
with the great development of red sandstones in many parts of the
true carboniferous series of Scotland, he concludes that the highest
stratified beds of Arran do not represent the new red sandstone, but
(more probably) a portion of the carboniferous group. To the upper
conglomerates of Arran there is however no counterpart in England;
and the exact place of the red beds which overlie them is still left in
some doubt; but these upper conglomerates may perhaps be compared
with  some great trappean conglomerates which are subordinate to
the Scotch coal-fields.
   CARBONIFERous series.—The author briefly notices the changes in
this series during              its
                           range from the northern counties               England                  of
into the basin       the Tweed, where
                          of                 coal-field occurs developed after

the Scotch type, and far below the great coal-field              Newcastle. He           of
then discusses shortly the carboniferous deposits               Scotland, which      of
are divided       follows,
                     as          descending order:—

subordinate beds         shale,ofironstone,  fire-clay,  and  fossils, presenting
the closest analogies          the great English coal-fields. Their exact

place     in general scale cannot however

           the old red sandstone; and the thickest beds

country bordering      the north shores    the Solway Firth, the new
                                                                  of

   OLD RED SANdstone.-The author, after briefly noticing the ex
traordinary irregularity     the development in  this formation               of                             in    the

English Stratifted Rocks below the Old Red Sandstone, &c. 148
British Isles, compares the old red conglomerates of Cumberland
with those on both sides of the Galloway chain. In these localities
they often form unconnected masses resting on the edges of the
greywacke; but in Galloway they are not only more largely de
veloped than in the north of England, but show, as above stated,
many passages into the overlying carboniferous groups.
    Ireland.—He then briefly notices the sections which, in the south
of Ireland, connect the old red sandstone with the overlying car
boniferous deposits, and form a good passage from one formation to
the other. The sequence is complete, and there is nothing to mark
any interruption of the deposits.     He adopts Mr. Griffith's classifi
cation, as most agreeable to the physical character of the groups and
to their suites of fossils.
    In the south of Ireland the lower carboniferous      shales  (of Mr.
Griffith) pass into the state of roofing-slates with a  transverse clea
vage, resembling the black slates at the base of the culm measures of
Devonshire. The great coal-field in the west of the island overlies
the mountain limestone; but it puts on the form of the culm mea
sures of Devon, and was formerly considered as a great transition
group. These facts appear to remove a difficulty in classification
which was presented by the mineral structure of the Devon culm
Series.
    The author, by way of conclusion, affirms that the Scotch and
Irish sections enable us to show that no new formations can be in
terpolated between the old red sandstone and carboniferous series,
inasmuch as the sequence is complete. In like manner, the sections
in the Silurian country show that no member is wanting between
the old red sandstone and the Ludlow rock.          Hence he concludes
that, from the lower divisions of the new red sandstone down to the
Llandeilo flagstone, there is one continuous unbroken sequence in
which no term is wanting.       Hence also the argument for the true
place of the Devonian system is complete.      For any formation, with
fossils intermediate between the carboniferous and Silurian systems,
must have an intermediate position,-must therefore be on the par
allel of some part of the old red sandstone, which fills that whole
intermediate position. But allowing the above sequence to be com
plete, there may still be great difficulties in fixing the lines of de
marcation by which it is to be finally subdivided. For example, the
lower carboniferous limestone, and the carboniferous slates of Ire
land, appear to overlap and descend below the base line of the car
boniferous series of England: and the same remark appears to be
applicable to the lowest beds of the carboniferous series of Scotland.
And there are similar difficulties in determining the best base line
for the old red sandstone, as appears from subsequent details.
    Sections of North Wales, &c.—The author next discusses two
 sections illustrating the structure of North Wales.       One is drawn
from the Menai Straits, in a direction about E.S.E., so as to cross
the Berwyn chain and end in the carboniferous series near Oswestry.
 The other is drawn from the Berwyn chain to the carboniferous
 limestone range on the north side of Denbighshire.         The greater

144              Geological Society:            Prof. Sedgwick on the
portion of the first section crosses the older beds (the Cambrian
system) which strike towards the N.E. The other section intersects
the upper series (Silurian system) which strike towards the N.W.,
passing (in some places unconformably) round the beds of the older
system. From a consideration of the whole evidence the rocks are
grouped in the ascending order, as follows:—
   1. Chlorite slate, quartz rock, and mica slate of Anglesea and
Caernarvonshire.      These are placed at the base of the section, and
form a distinct   class;  and nothing is discovered in this part of the
section which is   perfectly  analogous with the Skiddaw slate, or first
Cumbrian    group,   to be after described.
   2. The old slate series of Caernarvonshire and Merionethshire,
alternating indefinitely with bands of porphyry and felspar rock:
the group is of enormous but unknown thickness, and is bent into
great undulations, the anticlinal and synclinal lines of which are
parallel to the strike of the chain. Through wide tracts of country
it is without fossils; but at Moel Hebog, Snowdon, and Glider Fawr,
encrinites, corals, and a few species of bivalves have been discovered
in   it.    ends with the calcareous beds which range from Bala

                                          South Wales which are below
the Silurian system. Its slate beds are less crystalline, and                                  its
general structure       more mechanical, than the preceding group, and

146           Geological Society: Prof. Sedgwick on the
bution of fossils even in some of the more fossiliferous divisions, add
greatly to the difficulties of establishing true definite groups even
within the limits of our island. The difficulties are indefinitely     in
creased in comparing the formations of remote continents.           But
these circumstances are compensated by the magnificent scale of
development of the successive groups, and their wide geographical
distribution. Taken together, they have a great unity of character;
and even in remote continents they seem to form a common base,
from which we may hope to compute the whole series of secondary
 and tertiary deposits that surmount them.”
    Cumbrian groups, exhibited, in ascending order, in a section from
 Keswick through Kendal to Kirkby Lonsdale:—
     1. The group of Skiddaw Forest, &c., the lower part of which
 rests on the granite, and passes into a system of crystalline strata
 resembling the rocks of the first class in North Wales; the upper
 part abounds in a fine dark glossy clay slate, interrupted here and
 there by beds of more mechanical structure.      The whole is of great
 thickness, almost without calcareous matter, and without any trace
 of organic remains, and forms the mineral axis of the Cumbrian
 mountains.
     2. A group essentially composed of quartzose and chloritic roof
 ing slates alternating with mechanical beds of coarser structure,
 and also with innumerable igneous rocks (compact felspar, felspar
 porphyry, brecciated porphyries, &c. &c.) which partake of all the
 accidents of the slates.    It is of enormous thickness, and rises into
 the highest mountains of the country; and though chiefly developed
  on the south side of the preceding group (No. 1), it also appears
 extensively on the north side of the lower group, which thus forms
  a mineral axis—a fact not yet noticed in any of the published geo
  logical maps.    Though abounding in calcareous matter, it has no
  organic remains. This group is bounded by calcareous slates, which
  extend from the south end of Cumberland to the neighbourhood of
  Shap Wells, and have been described by the author in a former
  paper.   (See Transactions of Geological Society.)
     3. The next group extends from the calcareous slates (above
  noticed) to the carboniferous rocks, &c. which surround and cut off
  the older series*.     The highest part of the ascending section is
  shown on a line which descends to the Lune near Kirkby Lonsdale.
  The other sections are much less perfect. The whole group is sepa
  rated, provisionally, into two divisions.
     The Lower division commences with the calcareous slates above

 sions of the whole group.      As he considered the whole to represent the
 Silurian system he wished to represent the surface by three colours; but
 he found it impossible, even approximately, to represent their boundaries.
 And even with a simpler system of two divisions, he is unable, at present,
 to define correctly their line of demarcation; nearlyallthe middle portions
 of the sections being devoid of    fossils.

lower division is Lower Silurian, and that the upper division ends at
the very top of the Silurian system, and includes beds which have
been classed with the old red sandstone—an arrangement which is
natural in South Wales, but is not sanctioned by the Westmoreland
sections.
   The want of good mineral or fossil groups to distinguish the mid
dle portion of the section, makes the real difficulty of representing the
divisions on a map.
   The author then briefly noticed two other sections; one from the
Shap granite, through the fossiliferous slates, &c., to Howgill Fells.
These, in their range southwards through Middleton Fells, &c., are
placed in the upper division, though not in the highest part of                                                     it,

                            masses
 a hard arenaceous     greywacke,     sometimes of a very coarse structure,
  sometimes finer, and occasionally passing into a good roofing slate,
 —generally it is without fossils; but the Graptolites foliaceus (first
 noticed by Mr. Carrick Moore) occurs, though rarely, among the
 finer slates. In these respects the chain is analogous to that in
 Pembrokeshire, where the same fossil occurs in the slates below the
 Lower Silurian rocks of Mr. Murchison.
    He then notices a ridge of rocks visited by Mr. Carrick Moore
 and himself, which breaks out from under the carboniferous basin of
 Girvan-water in Ayrshire.         It contains many fossils, among which
 Mr. Sowerby finds three or four new species of Orthis, Tentaculites,
 Atrypa, and one or two species of Terebratula. Near             and probably                             it,

   January 21, 1842.—Dr.Hare made an oral communication respect
ing a new aethereal liquid which he had succeeded in obtaining.
   He mentioned that he had procured, by means of hyponitrite of
soda, diluted sulphuric acid and pyroxylic spirit, an aethereal liquid,
in which methyl (C, H,) might be inferred to perform the same part
as acthyl(C, H,) in hyponitrous aether. In fact, by substituting py
roxylic spirit for alcohol, this new aether was elaborated by the pro
cess for hyponitrous aether, of which he had published an account in
the Society's Transactions, vol. vii. part 2.
   The compound which was the subject of his communication had a
 great resemblance to alcoholic hyponitrous aether, similarly evolved,
 in colour, smell and taste, although there was still a difference suffi
cient to prevent the one from being mistaken for the other.
    Pyroxylic spirit appeared to have a greater disposition than alcohol
to combine with the aether generated from           probably     it,
                                                                consequence in
        having less affinity for water. The boiling point appeared

European chemists; and, even after              had been noticed
                                                            it          him,      by
seemed            to   be

                                         Kane, and others,      their subse in
quent publications.
   Dr. Hare attached the more importance           his success    producing
                                                                 to          in

 the aether which was the subject of his communication, since, agree
ably to Liebig, no such compound exists, and it is to be inferred
that efforts to produce it had hitherto failed.       It was presumed that
this would excite no surprise, when the difference was considered
between     the consequences of the reaction of nitric acid with py
roxylic spirit and with alcohol.
   The liquid last mentioned is now viewed as a hydrated oxide of
athyl, while pyroxylic spirit is viewed as a hydrated oxide of methyl.
When alcohol is presented to nitric acid, a reciprocal decomposition
ensues.      The acid loses two atoms of oxygen, which, by taking two
atoms of hydrogen from a portion of the alcohol, transforms it into
aldehyd; while the hyponitrous acid, resulting inevitably from the
partial deoxidizement of the nitric acid, unites with the base of the
remaining part of the alcohol.          But when pyroxylic spirit is pre
sented to nitric acid, this acid, without decomposition, combines with
methyl the base of this hydrate; so that, as no hyponitrous acid can
be evolved, no hyponitrite can be produced.          Thus, in the case of
the one, there can be no aethereal hyponitrite; in that of the other,
no aethereal nitrate.
   Dr. Hare regretted that Liebig should not have been informed of
the improved process for hyponitrous aether, to which he had referred
in commencing his communication.            Instead of recommending a re
sort to that   process,  it was advised that the fumes, resulting from
the reaction of nitric acid with fecula, should be passed into alcohol,
and the resulting vapour condensed by means   -
                                                     of a tube surrounded
by a freezing mixture.
   This process Dr. Hare had repeated, and found the product very
inferior in quantity and purity to that resulting from the employment
of a hyponitrite.     In this process, nascent hyponitrous acid, as libe
rated from a base, is brought into contact with the hydrated oxide.
In the process recommended by Liebig, evidently this contact could
not take place; since it was well known that hyponitrous acid could
not be obtained by subjecting fecula and nitric acid to distillation,
and condensing the aëriform products *.
   March 4th.--Dr. Goddard presented specimens of Daguerreotype
on a surface of gilded silver, and stated that the surface of iodide of
gold was more susceptible to the Daguerreotype action of light than
that of the iodide of silver, that the surface of the plate might be
polished without injury before the action of the iodine, and that the
lights came out better than on the silver surface.
   April 1.—Dr. Hare related some experiments, showing that the
vapour of nascent steam, generated by the hydro-oxygen flame, was
not productive of electricity.
   He observed that, before his late voyage to Europe, he had made
some experiments in order to ascertain whether any electricity was
   * The  process alluded to is as follows:—Seven parts of acid, eight parts
of alcohol,  fourteen parts of water, and fourteen of hyponitrite being pre
pared, add seven parts of water to the salt and seven to the acid, and allow
the mixture to cool. The saline solution and alcohol are introduced into
a tubulated retort, of which the recurved and tapering beak enters a tube,
which occupies the axis, and descends through the neck of an inverted bell

152                           American Philosophical Society.
given out by the flame of the hydro-oxygen blowpipe, or by the ele
ments of water during their conversion into steam.
   The unexpected electrical results, previously ascertained respect
ing high steam", naturally gave importance to this inquiry, the re
sult of which he had no previous opportunity of communicating to
the Society.
   Even the flame produced by means of a very powerful hydro
oxygen blowpipe was not found to be productive of electrical indica
tion, when allowed to act upon a metallic mass supported upon the
canopy of an extremely delicate electroscope. As it was suggested
that, the flame being a conductor, the electricity evolved might retro
cede by it to the metallic pipe, the experiment was modified in the
following way:-
   The mixture of one part of oxygen and two of hydrogen being, as
in the first instance, condensed within a mercury bottle, was made, by
means of a valve cock and safety tube, to communicate, through a
glass tube, with a jet pipe of platinum, a foot in length and in bore.
   The apparatus being thus arranged, and the cock so adjusted as
to allow the gaseous mixture to escape through the jet pipe with
sufficient celerity, a flame of hydrogen was applied to the outside of
this pipe about the middle.     By these means, the temperature being
raised so as to cause the elements of water to combine, the flame was
 removed, the heat being sufficiently kept up by the internal com
 bustion.    Thus that which entered at one end of the tube as gas,
came out at the other as steam. Under these circumstances, a single
 leaf electrometer, more susceptible than a condensing electrometer,
was not indicative of any electrical excitement, either in the insulated
jet tube, or in any body on which the steam was allowed to condense.
    Dr.    J.
            K. Mitchell having expressed a wish to see these experi
ments, they were repeated, with his assistance, with the same results.
    Dr. Hare also mentioned that he had observed an aethereal liquid
to subside on the addition of pure pyroxylic spirit to an aqueous
 solution of hypochlorous acid, obtained by passing chlorine into
 water in contact with bioxide of mercury.
    Having separated the aether thus produced, he found it to have an
agreeable and peculiar fragrance.     Like       wine,      oil   of

boiling water-bath.    When a naked flame was applied, the aether,
previously colourless, acquired a yellowish wine colour, and, by the
crackling evolution of vapour, indicated decomposition.
   When the liquid hypochlorous acid was subjected to the process
of distillation, before the addition of the spirit, an aether resulted
which floated on the solution, and which appeared to differ from that
obtained as first mentioned.
   Dr. Hare made these observations, and those previously communi
cated respecting the hyponitrite of methyl, by the aid of a small
 uantity of pure pyroxylic spirit, supplied to him by his friend Dr.
  re, and regretted that both ill-health and the exhaustion of his
stock of spirit had prevented him from making further observations
and experiments, tending to decide whether the aethers obtained, as
he had described, were either or both hypochlorites, or whether mer
cury entered into the composition of the heavier aether. This there
was some reason for believing; since, when boiled to dryness at a
high temperature, a reddish residuum was apparent, which being re
dissolved, and a small strip of copper immersed in the resulting so
lution, a minute deposition, apparently metallic, was observable.

  It appears that the analyses of Varrentrapp only, give iron as pre
sent in these substances, and which is essential to the production
of the blue colour of ultramarine        : lapis lazuli is well known to con
tain iron pyrites.
    M. Elsner has analysed the blue and green varieties of ultramarine
from Nuremberg, and he found them to be composed as follows:—
                 Blue Ultramarine.                 Green Ultramarine.

These contained traces of chlorine, potash, lime and magnesia. These
 analyses show that there is much more sulphur present than is re
 quired for the production of a simple sulphuret of iron; this excess
 of sulphur can be combined only with the sodium; and it results
 also from the analysis, as is also shown by synthetical researches,
 that sulphuret of sodium is not less necessary than sulphuret of iron
 to the production of ultramarine.—Journal                de Pharm. et de Chim.,

  PREPARATION OF OXICHLORIC ACID. B.Y. M. A.D. NATIVELLE.
   Oxichloric acid, which is so useful as a reagent, M. Nativelle re
marks, is seldom to be found in laboratories; and he supposes this
to be owing to the small quantity of it which is obtained by em
ploying the proportion of sulphuric acid usually recommended in
chemical works: he gives the following process as separating the
whole of the acid from the oxichlorate of potash :—
   Put into a glass retort 500 parts of oxichlorate of potash reduced
to powder, deprived as much as possible of chlorate; add 1000
parts of sulphuric acid of specific gravity 1-845, and 100 parts of
distilled water; this small quantity of water is not indispensable, for
it will be shown that, by omitting        it,
                                            oxichloric acid       obtained
                                                                     is                 in
                                                                        is
the crystalline state.       An adopter with    along tube           topassed be
into   a tabulated   retort,  surrounded with cold    water;   the  apparatus
must not         luted with any organic substance, for the oxichloric

                                                                   amianthus
answer the purpose. The oxichlorate             is   to carefully heated;
                                                          be                            it

                                                                    as   to
oxichloric acid from      carrying  over with   ittoo much    sulphuric  acid.
The best method       of   regulating the operation        is
                                                           tokeep below the
boiling point; but little sulphuric acid goes over, for oxichloric acid
volatilizes     at284°, which    is much lower than the temperature                     at
which     sulphuric   acid distils.  The operation       complete when the

sufficient  to  volatilize sulphuric acid; the weight        the product de

 pends upon the quantity of sulphuric acid carried over; for by a
 carefully conducted operation the ingredients mentioned give about
 300 parts of crude acid of the density of about 1.455; when the
 operation has been too quickly conducted the density and weight of
the product is greater.
    In order to separate the sulphuric acid and the small quantity of
chlorine which the product contains, it is to be shaken with a slight
excess of a saturated solution of sulphate of silver, and the chloride
of silver formed is separated by filtration; the acid is then to be put
into a capacious capsule, and artificial carbonate of barytes added
till all the sulphuric acid is precipitated, and even till a little oxi
chlorate of barytes is formed. The liquor now contains only oxi
chloric acid, with a little oxichlorate of barytes and of silver, and is
to be distilled, in the apparatus already described, with the addition
of ice, separating the first product, which is only water, and ascer
taining that the acid is coming over by test paper. The distillation
is to be carried on to dryness, but taking care not to decompose the
oxichlorates of barytes and silver, for then the rectified oxichloric
acid might contain traces of chlorine.    The oxichloric acid thus ob
tained is perfectly pure, colourless and transparent;        specific gra              its

           OTWITHSTANDING          the numerous investigations to
        which the grains of this plant have been submitted, much
  doubt still remains respecting the constitution, and even with
  regard to the existence of some of the many interesting bodies
  said to occur in them.
     Boullayt, to whom we are indebted for the first exami
  nation, found in them a fatty oil, stearine, yellow extractive
  colouring matter, picrotoxine,—to          which he ascribed the
  properties of an alkaloid, menispermic acid, vegetable fibre,
  albumen, and several of the inorganic salts usually contained
 in plants. They were subsequently investigated by Casasecat,
  principally with regard to the menispermic acid; he showed
  that no such acid existed in them, a fact which has been con
  firmed by         all
                 later researches.      The same chemist,        con                         in
 junction with Lecanus, made the fatty bodies which occur                                          in

of water, which is replaced in the salts by one equivalent of
base.
   Stearophanate of Soda.-This salt was prepared by digesting
the pure acid with an excess of carbonate of soda.        On expo
sing it to a gentle heat the carbonic acid is expelled with vio
lent ebullition, and a perfectly clear solution formed, which
was evaporated to dryness in the water-bath.            The finel
powdered mixture was then digested with absolute alcohol,
which leaves the excess of carbonate of soda undissolved: a
perfectly clear solution is obtained, which however soon so
lidifies into a gelatinous mass, which, transferred to a filter and
dried by exposure to the air orbetween folds of bibulous paper,
leaves behind a crystalline tissue consisting of long prisms,
with a strong nacreous lustre.
   This compound, when treated with a small quantity of water,
forms a stiff jelly; it is decomposed on the addition of much
water into an acid crystalline salt, which settles slowly, and im
parts to the liquid an opake appearance.
   Several stearophanates may be prepared from this salt by
double decomposition.
   Stearophanate of Silver.—This compound was prepared by
decomposing a weak alcoholic solution of the
by a perfectly neutral solution of the nitrate of silver.

lour which it at first possesses is only of momentary duration;
it acquires a slight tint of brown. Well washed and dried, it
can be exposed to light without undergoing apparently any
further decomposition.       It dissolves easily in a solution of
caustic ammonia.

     In some of my earlier observations these two varieties of
globules were doubtless confounded; and their similarity is
often so close, that it may well be questioned whether there
 is any essential difference between them in many cases,         al
 though it is difficult to avoid attributing to the effects of dis
 ease the unusual abundance of pus-like globules in the blood of
 patients labouring under numerous inflammatory distempers.
     But it often happens that the pale globules appearing in
 diseased blood are manifestly different from those found in the
 blood during health. The former are generally rather larger,
 more irregular in size and form, and not uncommonly more
opake than the latter. The globules occurring in disease too
often appear to be tinged, especially when examined by lamp
light, of a red colour, like the blood-corpuscles described by
Dr. Barry as in progress of change into pus-globules.
     Case 1.-A mare, aged 19, was lame of the hind-leg, which
in three days became prodigiously swoln; there were many
purulent deposits beneath the integuments, and she had much
fever.     Some blood, from the facial vein, was now examined,
and found to contain an unusual number of pus-like globules,
 (fig. 1. A.) the average diameter of which was about grºwth of
an English inch.       They occurred for the most part singly,
 and   occasionally in clumps. When treated with dilute acetic
acid the globules exhibited nuclei, generally central but some
times attached to the circumference; and the smaller particles
or molecules (the disc-like objects of Dr. Barry), of which the
nuclei were composed were either closely connected together
or separated by minutely granular matter (fig. 1. B.). On the
 fifth day, when the disease had increased, some blood from a
cutaneous vein of the affected limb contained about half as
 many pus-like globules as red discs; the former were most
 commonly in clusters, and darker-coloured than they were
 two days before.
     The pale globules in the blood of a healthy mare, examined
 at the same time for comparison, were by no means so nu
 merous; they were more regular in size and shape, almost all
 between sºuth and 2 mºnth of an inch in diameter; when sub
jected to the action of dilute acetic acid they presented anucleus,
 the molecules of which were closely aggregated together; the
 globules appeared rather paler than those of the diseased
 blood, and were rarely to be seen in clumps (fig. 1. C.).
      Case 2. —A gelding, aged 8, had the disease termed by
 veterinarians laminitis, that is to say, inflammation of the vas
 cular laminae of the corion beneath the crust of the hoof.
 The disease was violent; relief was attempted by abstracting
 blood from the brachial vein, which became inflamed, and
 the animal soon afterwards died. In the blood there was a

      B.) appeared to be composed of very delicate pale enve
  lopes including from one to four blood-discs, rarely five or
  six, some of which were altered in shape, while others pre
  sented nearly their usual size and contour.       They were not
  spherical, as some of them appear to be in the figure.       The
 envelopes, which seemed at first like shadows, were distinct
 enough in different lights, even after the addition of water and
 dilute acetic acid, and were rendered very obvious by the ac
 tion of tincture of iodine.

seen on their flat surfaces and touching merely at the mar
gins, another has four slightly overlapping at the edges, and
the remaining one incloses a pile of similar discs seen on their
edges and with their flat surfaces together.       Compare these

                    Structure   of Fibrine.
   In the section on this subject in the last Number of the   Phi
losophical Magazine, p. 109–111, it should have been stated
that in many fibrinous exudations or false membranes, result
ing from inflammation, the structure is the same as that of
fibrine, coagulated either after removal from the body or
within the circulating channels simply from death.         In false
membranes the fibrils are often very distinct: they form a de
licate net-work, which incloses exudation corpuscles, much
resembling the organic germs before described in pale clots of
fibrine formed without inflammatory action. As these fibrils
in both instances appear to be formed in the act of coagula
tion, it would require some modification of or departure from
the theory of M. Schwann to explain their origin.
                              Tubercle.
    It has long been a question whether tubercular matter in
the lungs be situated in the cellular (filamentous) tissue out
side the air-cells, or at the surface of the mucous membrane
within these cells.    It may be merely mentioned that I have
clearly detected tubercular deposit in the latter situation; and
 that Dr. Willis, in his forthcoming English version of Prof.
 Wagner's Physiology, will give an engraving of tubercular
 matter within the air-cells.     This of course will not decide
 what is always  the case in tubercular consumption; but it seems
 to be a fact of interest in regard to the precise seat of tubercle
 of the lungs.
XXVIII.      On the Preparation of Quina and Cinchonia.
   By M. F. C. CALVERT, Préparateur du Cours de Chimie
   appliquée au Jardin des Plantes d Paris.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
     GENTLEMEN,
             me, through the medium of your widely-circulated
ALLOWJournal, to make public a new chemical fact discovered
by me relating to the extraction of quina and cinchonia from
cinchona bark, by the knowledge of which,      I
                                               believe, the pro
cess usually followed by the manufacturers of these alkaloids
may be considerably improved.
   In order to obviate some of the difficulties which have        hi
therto been experienced in extracting the alkaline bases of
cinchonia, it appeared to me desirable to discover a process
by which, from a certain quantity of cinchona bark,         all
                                                             the
quina and cinchonia contained        might
                                    in   it        be
                                                extracted.        In

the French manufactories, and probably also in the English,
the same quantity of these bases has never been extracted with
any regularity from equal weights of cinchona even of similar
quality: this irregularity will, I think, admit of easy explana
tion from the fact which I have ascertained, that quina is very
soluble in lime water and in the solution of chloride of calcium;
hence, when lime is employed to precipitate those bases from
their solution in the hydrochloric acid, which is used to extract
them from cinchona bark, a part of the quina is re-dissolved,
especially should the lime be added in excess even in the
smallest quantity.    It is true that the re-solution of the quina
depends in great measure on an excess of lime being added;
but at the same time it must be admitted, that even should
the greatest care be taken by the manufacturer to guard against
adding an excess of lime, it would be impossible wholly to
prevent the solution of some of the quina, as chloride of cal
cium will inevitably be formed, and consequently a part of the
quina will be dissolved in               it.
   Considering that such must                    be
                                      the unavoidable result    the                             of

insurmountable obstacle which the re-solution offers            the
economical manufacture         those important
                                         of      articles,  was led                    I
to inquire         by
               experiments whether some other and less objec
tionable means could                be
                            discovered                  of

I     first experimented with solutions                      of of

potash, and soon found that the use              these alkalies was lia

as  this alkali, even when added             excess, dissolves neither
                                                      in

the application          the six following reagents, and especially
the chloride of lime.
 I    saturated two portions           cold water, one with very pure

 sulphate    of quina, and the other with very pure sulphate of
 cinchonia;    I found that 10 grammes of water contained 0-033
  of  sulphate  of quina, and that the same quantity of water
  contained 0-165 of the sulphate of cinchonia, or five times the
  proportion of sulphate of quina; therefore, in order to act on
  the same quantities of each salt dissolved in the same quantity
  of water, I took 10 grammes of the solution of sulphate of
  quina, or 0-033, and only 2 grammes of the saturated solu
  tion of sulphate of cinchonia, and to this latter solution I
  added 8 grammes of water, and thus in both cases I acted on
  0.033 of solid salt in 10 grammes of water.
     1st. The solution of the sulphate of quina gave a preci
  pitate with chloride of lime, which was immediately re-dis
  solved by the addition of an excess of the reagent.
•    The solution of the sulphate of cinchonia, on the contrary,
gave a precipitate which was not re-dissolved on the addition
of even a large excess of the reagent.
      I
      afterwards mixed the solutions of the sulphates of quina
 and cinchonia in equal quantities, and poured into the mix
 ture chloride of lime; a precipitate was formed, of which one
half was re-dissolved on the reagent being added in excess;
 the precipitate which was re-dissolved was quina: hence it
appears, that sulphate of quina, mixed with an equal quantity
of sulphate of cinchonia, could be separated from                   and the  it,
quantity       of
              cinchonia ascertained.

    The following experiment will demonstrate in a manner
perhaps still more evident, the non-formation of the sulphate
of lime, and will besides show how very sensible a test the
chloride of lime is to detect the presence of cinchonia.
   I  took 2 grammes of the solution of sulphate of cinchonia,
containing 0-033, and diluted it with 48 grammes of water,
and had therefore 33 parts of this substance diffused in
50,000 parts of water; to this solution                          I
                                                   added a little chlo
ride of   lime,  and obtained a    precipitate  of cinchonia, whereby
 the   sensibility  of the chloride of   lime,  as a test of cinchonia,
 as well as the non-precipitation of sulphate of lime, was de
 monstrated; for the sulphate of lime formed in the experi
 ment must have dissolved in the very dilute solution of cin
 chonia which was employed, and consequently the precipitate
 which appeared could not be attributed to                            it.
                                                                                                     to of
     The experiment was tried with even double the quantity
  water, that         is,

  100,000 parts         of
                        water; but      this case- the precipitate was
                                                 in

“qu'on sert peut-être plus encore la science en simplifiant, de

   Extending this remark to the simplification of the methods
of establishing theorems already known, and remarkable for
their difficulty, I am induced to give an exceedingly simple
demonstration of a theorem, which may be found at p. 342 of
Dupin's Développements de Géométrie, where the accomplished
author bestows more than four quarto pages of analytical cal
culation of extreme complexity on this theorem, and yet leaves
its solution incomplete.

XXX.         Notes on the Effects produced by the Ancient Glaciers
  of   Caernarvonshire,    and on the Boulders transported by
  Floating Ice.           By CHARLEs DARw1N, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.
  and   F.G.S.
     UIDED     and taught by the abstract of Dr. Buckland's
     memoir “On Diluvio-Glacial Phaenomena in Snowdonia
and the adjacent parts of North Wales”,” I visited several of
the localities there noticed, and having familiarized myself
with some of the appearances described, I have been enabled
to make a few additional observations.
   Dr. Buckland    has stated that a mile east of Lake Ogwyn
there occurs a series of mounds, covered with hundreds of
large blocks of stone, which approach nearer to the condition
of an undisturbed moraine, than any other mounds of detritus
noticed by him in North Wales.          By ascending these mounds
it is indeed easy to imagine that they formed the north-west
ern lateral moraine of a glacier, descending in a north-east line
from the Great Glyder mountain.            But at the southern end
of Lake Idwell the phaenomena of moraines are presented,
though on a much smaller scale, with perfect distinctness.
On entering the wild amphitheatre in which Lake Idwell lies,
some small conical, irregular little mounds, which might easily
escape attention, may be seen at the further end.             The best
preserved mounds               lie   on
                             the west side     the great black per

pendicular face      of
                     rock, forming the southern boundary             the                   of

     On the summit of some of the bosses on this barrier there
 are perched boulders: but this phaenomenon         seen far more            is
strikingly close    Capel-Curig, where almost every dome

rude form      theseof
                     blocks,  and the smooth mammillated domes
 on  which they rest, struck me      one           as

   Proceeding down the great straight valley  Nant-Francon,                  of

Lakes Idwell and Ogwyn, we continue          meet with boss            to

is interesting from the boulders being deeply scored, like the
rocks     insitu over which glacier has passed. The scores are
                                     a

those of     Shropshire   and   Staffordshire,   in which are found (as
I   have myself observed in very many places) fragments of sea
shells, and which every one, I believe, since the publication
of Mr. Murchison's chapters on the drift of these counties,
admits are of submarine origin. It may therefore be con
cluded that the layers of coarse and argillaceous sand, and of
gravel, with far-transported pebbles and boulders, do not owe
their origin to an inundation, but were deposited when the
summit of Moel Tryfan stood submerged beneath the surface
of the sea. As there are no marks of the passage of glaciers
over this mountain (which indeed from                     position could        its
hardly have happened), we must suppose that the boulders
were transported                on
                            floating ice; and this accords with the

186   Mr. Darwin         on the Ancient Glaciers               of Caernarvonshire,
sea never freezes; and 3rd, by these two agencies united.                                 I
have further remarked that the condition and kind of the stones
transported, would generally be influenced by the manner of
production of the floating ice. In accordance with these views,
I  may remark that it does not seem probable from the low
level of the Chalk-formation in Great Britain, that rounded
chalk-flints could often have fallen on the surface of glaciers,
even in the coldest times.               I
                                infer therefore that such pebbles
were probably inclosed by the freezing of the water on the
ancient sea-coasts.    We have, however, the clearest proofs of
the existence of  glaciers in this country; and it appears, that
when the land stood at a lower level, some of the glaciers,
as in Nant-Francon, reached the sea, where icebergs charged
with fragments would occasionally be formed.       By this means
we may suppose that the great angular blocks of Welch rocks,
scattered over the central counties of England, were trans
ported *. I looked carefully in the valleys near Capel-Curig
and in Nant-Francon for beds of pebbles, or other marks of
marine erosion, but could not discover any : when, however,
Moel Tryfan and Faban stood beneath the level of the sea,
inland creeks of salt-water must have stretched far up or quite
through these valleys, and where they were deep, the glaciers
 (as at present in Spitzbergent) would have extended, floating
on the surface of the water, ready to become detached in large
portions.     From the presence of boss-formed rocks low down
in the  valley of Nant-Francon, and on the shores of the Lakes
   * On the summit of Ashley Heath in Staffordshire, there is an angular
block of syenitic greenstone, four feet and a half by four feet square, and
two feet in thickness. This point is 803 feet above the level of the sea.
From this fact, together with those relating to Moel Tryfan and Faban, we
must, I think, conclude that the whole of this part of England was, at the
period of the floating ice, deeply submerged.    From the reasons given in
my paper (Phil. Trans., 1839 [Phil. Mag. S. 3, vol. xiv. p. 363.]), I do not
doubt that at this same period the central parts of Scotland stood at least
1300 feet beneath the present level, and that            its
                                                    emergence has since been
very slow. The boulder         on
                              Ashley Heath probably has been exposed        at      to
mospheric disintegration for    longer period than any other
                                    a                              this part

England.    I  was therefore interested     comparing the state
                                               in                        of

                Colour   in   the    Biniodide of Mercury.                         193
   If this precipitated biniodide, in the dry state, be subjected
to the action of heat, it becomes of a bright pale yellow colour,
fuses into a deep amber-coloured fluid, and gives off a vapour
which condenses in the form of rhombic plates of the same
bright yellow; these crystals, by any mechanical disturbance,
arising from the unequal contraction of their molecules in cool
ing, from varying thickness in different parts of the same cry
stal, or from partial disintegration, return again to the origi
nal scarlet colour of the precipitate, the change commencing,
in the latter case, from the point ruptured, and spreading over
the whole of the crystalline mass; they may however be fre
quently preserved in the yellow state for a great length of time,
if sublimed slowly and not exposed to the contact of other sub
stances, which is readily effected by conducting the sublima
tion in closed vessels, and allowing the crystals to remain in
them undisturbed.
     The resumption of the scarlet colour has been attributed to
 an alteration in the molecular arrangement of the crystals, and
 it was with the view of clearly ascertaining this point that the
 following microscopic investigations were undertaken.
     When a quantity of the precipitated biniodide is sublimed,
 the resulting crystals are very complicated in their structure,
 consisting of a number of rhombic plates, of varying size, su
 perposed, sometimes overlapping each other and causing con
 siderable variableness in their thickness, but generally leaving
 the extreme angle and the two lateral edges clear and well
 defined; the annexed sketch, taken by the camera lucida from
 the field of view of the microscope, will give a better idea of
 their character. The length of these crystals was about 0.15
 of an inch in length. On cooling, the first change that is ob
  served is usually a scarlet marking, commencing at the ex
  treme angle and extending gradually inwards, always retain
  ing a perfectly well-defined line in                   its
                                                 progress; when this

and extended slowly downwards; by the strong transmitted
light these minute crystals appeared colourless; but when
viewed by reflected light, the pale yellow colour was readily
apparent. After a short interval a very extraordinary change
commenced; the crystals, which had been perfectly sharp and
well-defined, became ragged at their edges, as though some
dissolving action were going on, gradually decreased in size,
and at last disappeared altogether; but as this act of solution
progressed, numbers of red crystals made their appearance,
forming across the field and following at a regular distance
 the yellow crystals as they disappeared, and occupying their
place. These red crystals, which appear to be formed by the
 disintegration through the medium of solution, if may be I

form of the octohedron with the square base, exactly similar
to those procured by careful sublimation at a low heat, only

crystallize any better by spontaneous evaporation than out of
a very concentrated solution; it seems however to form more
regularly in warm air, as in summer. The best crystals are
generally formed on the surface of the solutions: they are very
minute, in the form of triangular plates; when the crystals
form a mass at the bottom of the liquid the plates are thicker,
but their form is indistinguishable.    The salt is of a deep red
colour   by reflected as well as by transmitted light; the solu
tion is green, or even black (when concentrated) by reflected
and red by transmitted light.         The solution when at a
boiling temperature remains red, as is seen best by candle
light: the same is the case with the solution of the black salt,
 which shows that the purple oxide of chromium contained in
these salts is not converted by a boiling heat into                  green            its

     Mr. Croft      on a new     Oralate of Chromium and Potash, 199
form, but become of a bright dark green colour: as soon as
the decomposition of the oxalates commences they fall into a
light green powder, which when stronger heated becomes
brown.    In closed vessels carbonate of potash is formed; in
open ones, when the heat is continued for a length of time,
chromate is produced. This chromate must be extracted by
water, reduced, and the oxide of chromium precipitated by
ammonia: in this operation, however, it is better to evaporate
the ammoniacal solution to dryness, as the ammonia always
dissolves a small quantity of the oxide. This method is pre
ferable to that usually employed (Heinrich Rose's Analytical
Chemistry): the ammoniacal and potash salts must be dis
solved out, evaporated, the ammonia driven off, and the potash
determined either as chloride or by means of platinum.
   The oxalic acid may be determined by boiling the salt with
sulphuric acid, as proposed by Prof. Graham.
   The salt being excessively difficult to crystallize, it seldom
happens that a perfectly homogeneous substance can be ob
tained for analysis: the method of analysis is moreover some
what complicated, and consequently the analyses do not agree
so perfectly as could be desired.

     This differs from      the black salt      in containing one atom of
basic oxalate instead of three. It may be said to be related
to the black salt in the same way as metaphosphates      are to
phosphates. It is evident, therefore, that if we add two atoms
of oxalate of potash to one atom of the red salt, we ought
to obtain the black salt, which is indeed the case.              gr,

202        Prof. Kelland's Reply to                some     Objections against the
  These crystals, submitted to measurement by Professor
Miller,     were obtained by slow spontaneous evaporation:      the
difficulty of procuring this salt in crystals of any size has been
fully pointed out by Mr. Croft.
     Ihave only one observation which does not coincide with Mr.
Croft's statements, but which, however, confirms in a great
measure the results of his analysis; I allude to the statement
that these double salts of chromium cannot be formed by the
direct combination of their ingredients. The process which                                        I
have followed has been to digest the hydrated oxide of chro
mium in a mixed solution of oxalic acid and oxalate of potash
in the proportions indicated by analysis, and when it ceases to
dissolve the oxide, to decant the clear solution and allow it to
crystallize.    By the same means the analogous salts of soda
and ammonia have been obtained, but not in crystals suffi
ciently large for measurement, as also other double salts of
chromium.        To prepare the hydrated oxide of chromium,
 the best and most occonomical process that          have found, is       I
 to take 150 grs. of the bichromate of potash and 200 grs. of
 liquid sulphuric acid,           vitriol, these proportions being
                                       oil   of

Earnshawin his memoir, Art. 15. The argument                   follows.            is   as
The force due           displacement parallel

as Mr. Earnshaw had previously pointed out (Art. 8), “the
displacements of particles would not bring into action any
forces of restitution.” Another part of the objection relates
to the boundaries of the medium, or rather of space. “If the
particles of aether exert a repulsive action on each other, they
will naturally endeavour to disperse themselves throughout
of all
    space, and form           medium coextensive with the boundaries

206       Prof. Kelland's Reply to             some Objections            against the
   So far, then, as we have proceeded, we have obtained, as
our result, that V is constant. We have thus strengthened
the argument, if any exists, based on the neutrality of the
equilibrium.       But what is the argument?     Mr. Earnshaw
says (Art. 8), “the displacements of particles placed in such
positions as those here considered would not bring into action
any forces of restoration;       on which account the particles
would not vibrate.” Mr. O'Brien says, too,          have shown        “I
 . . . . . . that if such be the case the whole universe is in a
state of neuter equilibrium.” [Phil. Mag. June, p. 487.] The
only shadow of an argument contained in these quotations
exists in the words “on which account the particles would
not vibrate.”       What would they do then? and why? It
really is hard that I should be obliged to make the objections
and answer them too. I hope Mr. Earnshaw will point out,
in a future communication, whereon he supposes the                                                 in
ference to hang. So far as is stated nothing more appears
than this: a particle is moved, no instantaneous force is put
in play by the motion; therefore the particle cannot vibrate.
Now to this argument we reply,–1st, that the statement em
bodies a proposition which is very difficult of proof: for
although the particle receives no instantaneous force, it cer
tainly communicates one to the adjacent molecules. On those
in advance it acts more powerfully, on those behind less so,
than when in             its
                    position             of
                                 rest. Motion will therefore ensue.
Whether the      particles  will vibrate       not we or    not affirm;   do
the onus       of
               proving that they will not, rests with those who
make the assertion. But 2nd, suppose                 could       proved

of saying a few words relative to the argument actually insisted
on by Mr. Earnshaw, we propose to examine briefly the con
trary case.

further conceive (which by no means necessarily follows) that

SINCE
      loured media began to be studied with attention, various
philosophers have regarded them as inexplicable by the
theory of the colours of thin plates, and have consequently
regarded Sir Isaac Newton's theory of the colours of natural
bodies as either defective in generality, or altogether un
founded.     Mr. Delavalt was the first person who brought an
extensive series of experiments to bear upon this subject. Dr.
Thomas Young f considered it “impossible to suppose the
production of natural colours perfectly identical with those
of thin plates,” unless the refractive density of the particles of
colouring bodies was at least twenty or thirty times as great
as that of glass or water, which he considered as “difficult to
believe with respect to any of their arrangements constituting
the diversities of material substances.” Sir John Herschel
has expressed a still more decided opinion upon this subject.
 He regards, “the speculations of Newton on the colours of
natural bodies” as only “a premature generalization,” and
“limited to a comparatively narrow range; while the phae
nomena of absorption, to which he considers the great ma
jority of natural colours as referable, have always appeared to
            i.

                  Absorption and the Colours                      of Thin Plates.                      209
    In arriving    at these conclusions, however, and drawing a
distinct line between the phaenomena of absorption and those
of thin plates, two classes of facts are compared under very
different circumstances.           In the one case philosophers have
studied in cumulo the result of the successive actions of an
infinite number of the colorific particles upon the intromitted
light, whereas in the other case they have observed only the
colour of a single particle, whose thickness is equal to that of
the films of air, water, glass and mica submitted to experi
ment.     The impracticability of combining a number of such
films, and studying their united action upon light, was doubt
less the reason which prevented natural philosophers from
bringing the two series of facts under the same conditions.
Sir Isaac Newton, indeed, had spoken so confidently of the
result of such a combination, as to discourage any attempts
to effect      it;
                 and          itsingular fact that his successors have
                                   is   a
never called         question
                         in      his bold though ingenious assump
tion.      “If    thinned
                    a           plated body,” says he, “which being

  gives the predominating colour of the tint mixed with the rays

of   the transmitted    one;   and     the twoif spectra  were superposed
 they would form          perfect spectrum, whose rays when united
                               a

                                              each other.

I   observed in the space C D above mentioned hundreds of
the most minute lines almost as sharp and black as those in

    In the phaenomena of periodical colours which we have
now described, there are three peculiarities which demand
our attention. 1. The dark lines change their place by                                                             in
clining the plate which produces them.                 2. Two or more
lines never coalesce into one, and one line of the series is never
 seen without           all
                    the rest being equally visible.          The colours                   3.
of    the luminous bands        the complementary spectra are the
                                              in

212             Sir D. Brewster on the Connerion between
tionof the colouring matter of the green leaves of vegetables.
The spectrum which it forms consists of sir luminous bands,
separated by five dark ones”, and the phaenomena                                               have the
same character as those of the blue glass.
  When the spectrum is viewed through nitrous acid gas the
phaenomena are still more remarkable. While the gas exerts
a general absorbent action over the violet extremity of the
spectrum, it attacks it when in a diluted state in definite lines
as sharp and distinct as those in the solar spectrum; and what
is still more important, it acts upon the same parts of light as
the cause which produces the fixed lines in the sun's spec
                                                                            of its
trum. In other respects the character of            action   similar                       is
to  that    the blue glass and the green sap
           of                                       plants.
     Inthus comparing the phaenomena         absorption with thoseof
of  thin plates,      findwe   connecting no
                                           link but that      giving                       of

fact has not the same character         both.    In coloured media

 tremity during the inclination of the plate. In a third specimen
 the phaenomena were still more varied, and what was a new
 feature in the results, the colour of the tints was changed exactly
 as in the phaenomena of absorption.           It is very obvious that
 these results are not  produced   by   the same action which causes
 the orange colour of the substance, for this action could not
 vary by the inclination excepting in producing a greater ab
 sorption of the more refrangible rays; but in order to place
 this beyond a doubt,              I
                            detached a film which had none of the
 colours of thin plates, and which, as             expected, producedI
none of the bands above described.               In these experiments
 the nacreous   plate  was  placed   in Canada balsam to remove
 the imperfect smoothness of                     its
                                        surface, but the phaenomena
 were   essentially the same with      plates  surrounded        air.               by            I
 now divided the first       the plates above mentioned into two,
                                   of
and having viewed the spectrum through both,                  found the            I
principal black band considerably widened,                happens with        as

striking, the colours           of

muths to the plane of primitive polarization, we obtain ex
tremely singular spectra, in which the bands approximate to
those of absorbing media.
   But there is another result of this class of experiments to
which        I
          would especially call the attention of philosophers.
The colours of the bands thus produced have no resemblance
to those of the original spectrum, so that the spectrum has
actually been analysed by dissection.     This effect is so de
cided, that even by a single subdivision of a banded spectrum
I  have succeeded in insulating a band nearly white, and of
course incapable of being decomposed by the prism.
   Hence we deduce from the phaenomena of thin plates, and
polarized tints, the existence of a new property of light, in
virtue of which the reflecting force selects, as it were, out of
differently coloured rays of the same refrangibility rays of a
particular colour, allowing the others to pass into the trans
mitted beam; or to use the language of the undulatory theory,
the colour produced by the interference of homogeneous pen
cils reflected from the first and second surfaces of thin plates,
is different from the colour produced by the interference of
the transmitted light with that which has suffered two inter
mal reflexions within the plate.         for example, we use the          If,

   1st. That Sir W. R. Hamilton has taken the trouble                                             of
simplifying the mode        calculation, circumstance which im

plies his approval      the general principle.
                             of
   2ndly. That that “pre-eminently gifted mathematician
M. Cauchy” has considered his own investigations               suffi                     a
cient basis for calculation; and,
   3rdly, That the method                    of
                                   calculation used       computing                in
the tables “is surely,            events,
                                    at   all  direct deduction from

that mode      of argument than for fair philosophical discussion.
I  am willing to pay my humble tribute to the merits of the
two eminent philosophers quoted; but the matter in dispute
between Professor Powell and myselflying entirely within the
limits of my own reading and understanding, it is not likely
that    I
        shall be convinced by any other than a fair appeal to
philosophical argument.
   With respect to the Professor's third argument, it appears
to me to assume too much.       It ought to have been shown
that theory has done more for the series (upon which the cal
culations are founded) than merely to indicate that it must
proceed according to inverse powers of a ; for if it has not
done more than this, it has in effect done nothing.   But even
granting that there is something meritorious in the form of
the suggested series,                 I
                          would beg the Professor's attention
to two of my objections which still remain in force;—1st,
that the mode of applying it to calculation disconnects it from
theory, by rendering the method one of ordinary interpola
tion; and 2ndly, that the results obtained do not coincide
sufficiently with experiment to warrant us in concluding from
them that the form of the series furnished by theory is the
correct one.                                                 -
  Before      I
           conclude it is necessary to advert to two other
matters: the Professor seems to consider that I have used
him unfairly in not distinguishing between “certain earlier
researches” and those contained in his “published volume.”
                                                                           (p.
If  the Professor will turn again to my letter             309)    will                he
there read that the errors        which    ofhad been speaking, are

published volume” could be set aside by the Professor's aban
donment of his earliest researches, I think in having produced
a distinct public declaration of this fact it has done service to
science, and therefore to that extent my desire has been ac
complished, for it cannot be said that there is in the published
volume any statement to the effect that those researches were
to be considered as superseded by the book; so far otherwise
indeed, that we are told in the introduction that it is sent forth
“partly as a résumé of previous researches which have from
time to time appeared, and partly as supplying what was
wanting to complete them,” and more than once the early re
searches are referred to in terms of approval.         It is clear
therefore that without a distinct  declaration, such as my letter
has drawn    forth, neither I nor  any other  person  would have
been justified in treating as discarded the researches in which
the author has stated it to be his opinion that “the refractive
indices are related to the lengths of waves, as nearly as pos
sible according - to the formula deduced from M. Cauchy's
theory.”

former solutions in symmetry and conciseness, it is much at

great use of the simple equation to the tangent, which I have
used, and because the method employed brings out the result
in a most direct manner.

and thus conceived that the blood-discs are of subordinate import
ance, and are not concerned in the evolution of fibrin.
   To render the filament distinctly visible, Dr. Barry adds a chemi
cal reagent capable of removing a portion of the red colouring
matter, without altogether dissolving the filament.       He employs for
this purpose chiefly a solution of one part of nitrate of silver in 120
parts of distilled water; and sometimes also the chromic acid.        He
admits that the use of these reagents would, on account of their
destructive tendency when concentrated, be objectionable as proofs
of the absence of any visible structure; but as the point to be
proved is that a certain specific structure does exist, he contends
that the same appearance would not equally result from the chemi
cal actions of reagents so different as are those of chrome and the
salts of mercury and of silver.        After the appearance of the fila
ment, thus brought to light, has become familiar to the eye, it may
be discerned in the blood-discs, when coagulation has commenced,
without any addition whatever.           Those blood-discs of the newt,
which contain filaments, often assume the form of flask-like vesicles,
the membranes of which exhibit folds, converging towards the neck,
where, on careful examination, a minute body may be seen pro
truding.     This body is the extremity of the filament in question,                               its
protrusion being occasionally such          admit                    of

vations of Remak on the blood-corpuscles of the foetal chick fully
accord.     Whether the author's further speculation, namely, that
the parent-cells are altered red blood-discs, is correct, still remains
to be seen.
   The phaenomenon of the “breaking off short," or notching of the
fasciculus of a voluntary muscle in a transverse cleavage of the
fibre, is regarded by Dr. Barry as a natural consequence of the       in
terlacing of the larger spirals, which he has described in a former
paper; the fracture, in proceeding directly across the fasciculus,
taking the direction in which there is least resistance.
   The position of the filament in the blood-corpuscle is represented
as bearing a striking resemblance to that of the young in the ovum
of certain intestinal worms, the filaments of which are reproduced
by spontaneous division.     The author subjoins the following quaere,

   “Barometrical Observations, showing the effect of the Direc
tion of the Wind on the Difference between distant Barometers.”
By Lieut.-Colonel Philip Yorke, S. F. Guards. Communicated by
Lieut.-Colonel Sabine, R.A., F.R.S., &c.
    The author institutes a comparison between the barometric heights
as observed at the Apartments of the Royal Society, and at his house
in Herefordshire, in the neighbourhood of Ross, with a view to as
certain the influence of prevailing winds on the atmospheric pressure.
The barometers thus compared together were of the same construc
tion, and by the same maker; and the times of observation, namely
nine o'clock A.M. and three o'clock P.M., were the same at both places,
the distance between which is 110 miles in longitude, and about 20 in
latitude.   The degree of accordance in the march of the two barome
ters is exhibited by that of curves traced on three sheets accom
panying the paper. The results are given in eight tables.       The au
thor agrees with Schubler in ascribing the currents prevailing in the
atmosphere to the variable relations of heating and cooling which
obtains between the Atlantic Ocean and the continent of Europe at
different seasons; the facts ascertained by the series of observations
here presented being in accordance with that hypothesis.          If the
northerly and westerly winds in England be partly the effect of the
expansion of the air on the continent, then the barometer which is
nearest to the continent, or in this instance that at London, ought
to be relatively more depressed than the one more distant; or if
the southerly and easterly winds be regarded as proceeding to the
ocean, thren, for a similar reason, the barometer nearest to the ocean
ought to be relatively depressed; and that both these effects are
produced, is shown by the tables.       This view of the subject also,
the author    remarks,  is corroborated by Raymond's observations,
detailed in his memoir on the determination of the height of Cler
mont Ferrand, from which it appears that with the north winds, the
southern barometer was most depressed; while the reverse occurred
with the southerly winds,

  1.   “On the Action of  the Rays of the Solar Spectrum on Vegetable
Colours.”    By  Sir John F. William Herschel, Bart., K.H., F.R.S.
   The   author, having prosecuted the inquiry, the first steps of which
he communicated in a paper read to the Royal Society in February
 1840t, relating to the effects of the solar spectrum on the colouring
matter of the Viola tricolor, and on the resin of guaiacum, re
lates, in the present paper, the results of an extensive series of simi
lar experiments, both on those substances, and also on a great number
of vegetable colours, derived from the petals of flowers, and the leaves
of various plants. In the case of the destruction of colour of the pre
parations of guaiacum, which takes place by the action of heat, as
well as by the less refrangible rays of light, he ascertained that
although the non-luminous thermic rays produce an effect, in as far
as they communicate heat, they are yet incapable of effecting that
peculiar chemical change which other rays, much less copiously en
dowed with heating power, produce in the same experiment.             He
also found that the discoloration produced by the less refrangible
rays is much accelerated by the application of artificial terrestrial
heat, whether communicated by conduction or by radiation; while,
on the other hand, it is scarcely or not at     promoted     all

with a further Account of the Nervous Structures of that Organ.”
By Robert Lee, M.D., F.R.S.
   After premising a short history of the opinions of Galen, Dr.
William Hunter, Mr. John Hunter, Professor Tiedemann, Professor
Lobstein, and Professor Osiander, relative to the existence, course,
and enlargement of the nerves of the uterus, the author adverts to
his own researches on this subject, which commenced with his dis
covery, in April 1838, of the trunk of a large nerve accompanying
the uterine vein, and of the great nervous plexus with which it was
continuous.     Of this discovery he gave an account to the Royal
Society in a paper read on the 12th of December of the same year.
In a subsequent paper, he described some large nervous ganglia.”
situated at the neck of the uterus; and in the present appendix he
describes other nervous structures of still greater size which pre
sented themselves to him, on a still more complete dissection which
he made of a gravid uterus at the full period of gestation.        It ap
pears from the results of these dissections that the human uterus
possesses a great and extensive system of nerves, which enlarge du
ring pregnancy, along with the coats, blood-vessels, and absorbents
of that organ, and which after parturition resume their original con
dition. It is chiefly through the influence conveyed by these nerves
that the uterus is rendered capable of performing         various func its
tions, and      by
               which sympathies are established between        and other     it
parts    the system.

which both the laws of dispersion, and those of the elliptic polariza

the powder, which has become of a deep brown colour, is to be
washed and dried and treated with boiling aether, which dissolves
the curcumine and leaves the sulphuret of lead.
   By evaporating the aether slowly, the curcumine is deposited in thin
laminae, which are transparent and inodorous; when reduced to a
fine powder, curcumine is of a beautiful yellow colour, which is more
intense as the powder is finer; in small laminae it is of cinnamon
colour, but when held up to the light it is of a deep red colour.

INSOLUBLE SALTS OF THE ALKALINE EARTHS DISSOLVED BY
  HYDROCHLORATE OF AMMONIA AND CHLORIDE OF SODIUM.
   M. H. Wackenroder states that sulphate of barytes is quite inso
luble, but that the sulphates of lime and strontia are soluble in so
lution of chloride of sodium ; the latter, though 'slowly, yet com
pletely, and it is entirely precipitable from solution by dilute
sulphuric acid.   Sulphate of lime dissolves very readily in solution
of chloride of sodium,  and cannot be precipitated by dilute sulphuric
acid.—Ibid.
      PRODUCTION              OF FORMIC ACID                     IN OIL OF TURPENTINE.
   The acid reaction of the oil of turpentine of commerce is derived
from formic acid, the presence of which is readily detected in the
water employed in its rectification.
   According to M. Weppen, the formation of this acid can be ex
plained only by the oxidation of the         by contact with the air. oil

evaporation, a small quantity of oxide of lead may escape conversion
into sulphuret by hydrosulphuric acid; and this circumstance may
lead to considerable errors.
   If sulphuret of ammonium be added to a dilute solution of lead,
sulphuret of lead is formed, which completely and readily redissolves
in moderately strong nitric acid and in hydrochloric acid : a current
of hydrosulphuric-acid gas may be passed for a long time in these
solutions, especially in that of hydrochloric acid, without any effect;
but when the solution is diluted with water black sulphuret of lead
is precipitated, and after the addition of a sufficient quantity of wa
ter the precipitation is complete.

          SOLUBILITY OF SALTS IN PERNITRATE OF MERCURY.
    M. Wackenroder finds that the chloride, bromide, iodide, cyanide,
and sulpho-cyanide of silver are soluble in pernitrate of mercury,
and that the ferrocyanide, sulphuret, and seleniuret of silver are in
soluble in the mercurial salt. These solutions are of a peculiar and
uncommon nature.        For example, neither nitric acid nor nitrate of
silver precipitates anything from the solution of cyanide of silver in
pernitrate of mercury; but a sufficient quantity of hydrocyanic or
hydrochloric acid, or metallic chlorides, precipitate from it cyanide
or chloride of silver. On the contrary, hydrochloric acid, chloride
of sodium or hydrochlorate of ammonia, readily precipitate chloride
of silver from this solution; an excess of nitrate of silver also pre
cipitates this salt completely, which nitric acid does not precipitate.
The chloride, bromide and iodide of mercury also dissolve readily in
pernitrate of mercury.     Chloride of mercury can be separated from
these solutions  by a great excess only of chloride of sodium.—Ibid.
                  ON LAUROSTEARINE.               B.Y.   M. MARSSON.
     M. Bonastre found bay-berries to contain volatile oil, resin, gum,
a fluid fatty matter and a solid fatty matter, which last he called stea
rine, and a peculiar crystallizable substance which he named laurine.
As the characters assigned to this last substance resemble those of
the stearoptens,       its

   The properties of laurostearine are, that when purified by alcohol
it is in the form of small white brilliant silky light needles, which
are frequently grouped in the form of stars.          It is very difficultly
soluble in cold   alcohol, but readily soluble in  strong  boiling alcohol,
and is deposited almost entirely in crystals as the solution cools.
It is very soluble in aether, and by spontaneous evaporation cry
stallizes, as it does from the alcoholic solution.       It fuses at about
112°Fahr., and on cooling becomes a mass resembling stearine, pre
senting no traces of a crystalline texture, and is brittle and friable.
Solution of potash saponifies it pretty readily, and forms a perfectly
bright soapy solution: the soap separated by chloride of sodium is
hard, and yields by decomposition with acids a fatty acid, the lauro
stearic acid. By dry distillation it yields acroleine, and a solid
fatty body, crystallizable from aether.    It is formed of

dissolves this impure arsenious acid, and yields a solution from
which water throws down a white precipitate, sulphuretted hy
drogen an orange one of sulphuret of antimony, and then a yellow
one of sulphuret of arsenic.   Nitric acid, when heated, dissolves the
mixture, leaving a residue of oxide of antimony containing arsenic
acid, which is readily dissolved by hydrochloric acid and by tartaric
acid; and it forms solutions with these acids, which possess all the
reactions of oxide of antimony.     M. Wiggers found oxide of anti

On the Structure     of Fibrinous Erudations or False Membranes.
     S mentioned in the last Number of the Philosophical
        Magazine, p. 171, in false membranes, resulting from
inflammation, the structure is frequently identical with that of
fibrine which has coagulated within or out of the body simply
from rest. In friable exudations, as I have noticed in Ger
ber's Anatomy, p. 29–30, fig. 234, the corpuscles approach
pretty nearly in number and appearance to those of pus, ex
cept that the former are commonly more loose in texture than
the latter.     In these exudations too the fibrils are now and
then not   visible, though they may often be seen clearly enough,
and the minute molecules are generally very abundant, yet
occasionally scanty, and sometimes altogether absent, or at
least not recognizable.
    The figures in Gerber's Anatomy (244–251) are tolerably
good representations of the fibrils and corpuscles which may
be commonly seen in clots of fibrine.         The fault of some of
those drawings is that the fibrils are depicted too forcibly, and
without that softness which they present when viewed in a
clear transmitted light. Indeed, these fibrils often form a
network so extremely delicate that it must be a matter of
some difficulty to get it struck off satisfactorily, even if the
drawings are made with accuracy; and the same remark is
applicable to the more straight and parallel arrangement
which these fibrils often assume.
    The structure of false membranes will now be illustrated

    Case 1.—A soldier, aged 22, 72nd Regiment, was admitted
into hospital with pulmonary consumption,              the 25th                  on                      of

     It  would be interesting to examine the organic germs in
 the fibrine of animals with blood-discs differing widely from
 those of man; and, as remarked by Dr. Carpenter in his
 valuable work on Human Physiology, p. 471, observations of
 this kind should be multiplied, in order to test the accuracy
  of Dr. Barry's views respecting the origin of the tissues and
  of pus-globules from the blood-discs.
     The fibrine obtained by washing from the blood of birds
  contains a multitude of particles, which are figured in the
  Philosophical
  the blood-discs. MºrI had
                               for August 1842, like the nuclei of
                             recently an opportunity of examining
  some large amber-coloured and nearly transparent clots of
  fibrine from the peritoneum of a silver pheasant.

  mentioned. . The connecting fibrine is very minutely granu

  present a very faint appearance of fibrils; but some of these
  seemed to be quite smooth, and they are somewhat too         di
  stinctly represented in the engraving.        B, filaments about

most abundant when putrefaction is just commenced, may be
infusory productions.    They occur in fibrine from the healthy
blood of man and other animals, as well as in fibrinous ex
udations resulting from inflammation.      In my first observa
tions, some of the filaments seemed as if jointed, but this
appearance was not seen afterwards.       Mr. Dalrymple, who
examined them at    my   request, remarked that they appeared
like fine tubes containing round particles, and that the fila
ments were similar in form to some of the Vibrionia of Ehren
berg.    But we could never see any motion in the filaments.
    As     I
           propose on a future occasion to give a short historical
notice of the observations of authors on the structure of fibrine,
I shall merely allude here to this branch of the subject. The
fibrinous products of inflammation have commonly been de
scribed as exudations from the blood.           Thus        Hunter, who      J.
mentions the toughness and elasticity of coagulating lymph,
as well as       its
                 fibrous and laminated appearance, says that the
swelling       inflammation
               in               owing is    the extravasation
                                                        to              this                of
lymph and some serum.          Blumenbach's views are            the same          of
kind.      Dr. Hodgkin speaks         the products
                                              of           inflammation      of

with the views now generally entertained concerning the ori
gin of fibres.
   “All the organic tissues,” says Dr. Schwann, “however
different they may be, have one common principle of develop
ment as their basis, viz. the formation of cells; that is to say,
nature never unites molecules immediately intó a fibre, a tube,
and so forth, but she always in the first instance forms a round
cell, or changes, when it is requisite, the cells into various
primary tissues as they present themselves in the adult state.”
 (Wagner's Physiology by Willis, p. 222.)
    How is the origin of the fibrils which I have depicted in so
 many varieties of fibrine to be reconciled with this doctrine 2
 And what is the proof that these fibrils may not be the pri
 mordial fibres of animal textures?            I  Jºã       never see any
satisfactory evidence that the fibrils of fibrine are changed
cells; and indeed in many cases the fibrils are formed so
quickly after coagulation, that their production, according to
the views of the eminent physiologist just quoted, would hardly
seem possible.       Nor have I been able to see that these fibrils
arise from the interior of the blood-discs, like certain fibres
delineated in the last interesting researches of Dr. Barry.
   I have to express my acknowledgements to Dr. Dumbreck,
Surgeon 72nd Regiment, and to Dr. Boyd, Resident Physi
cian to the Marylebone Infirmary, for their kindness in afford
ing me opportunities of examining the cases just mentioned;
and to Mr. Siddall for calling my attention to the state of the
blood in the cases noticed in the last Number of the Philoso
phical Magazine.

                                Greenough,       Esq., is a titaniate of
manganese, and except crichtonite, which is a titaniate of iron,
is the only one hitherto described.          It was discovered by M.
Bertrand-de-Lom in the         manganese      deposit of Saint Marcel,
in  Piedmont;     it occurs in small rose-coloured veins which
run irregularly in the mass, and is accompanied by quartz,
epidote and manganesian garnets.          It was supposed originally

gently at the top, so that the two fluids do not mix to any
great extent, and a copper wire be then placed throughout
 the whole length of the tube, it will speedily show signs of
action.    The copper in the acid will rapidly dissolve, whilst
copper will be as freely deposited at the lower part of the
vessel.   Now copper will undergo no action alone, either in
muriatic acid or sulphate of copper.     This experiment may
be varied   by the use of different acids or even some salts at
the upper part of the vessel, for although muriatic acid shows

the intermediate part between the combination of the first
element and the removal of the second, is only the atom of

garded as nothing but a series of little local batteries, or atomic
circles, having nothing to do with the great battery which we
make available for our purposes.

260    Mr.      Smee's New Definition                   of the Voltaic Circuit,
voltaic circle, might possibly vary in some new manner, for
which further experiments are wanted. In that case it would be
        'A  –    -
wº-la<U+017F><U+017F>            the old English R standing for the new
resistance afforded to the whole current. The tunnel might be
cut away at any other part besides (R), thus it might be de
ficient at (F), (a), (c), (r), or (e); but the student will readily                                   --
perceive the expressions for these cases.
   The algebraic formula for (W) is replete with interest, for it
accurately defines the value of (W) in determining the so-called
power of any battery.       The power of a battery is the inten
sity multiplied by the quantity, in other words, I'x A; but our
equations show that W is not equal to I A but to IA—R A,
                                                   I
and from that we deduce that A = W H R A ; therefore it is
impossible by Faraday's voltameter to ascertain the value of
I' A at once, and it is necessary first to find the value of A.
The immense mass of experiments in which the voltameter
has been assumed to be equal to I' A, must now be discarded
 as inaccurate, and no deductions drawn from them; but all
future experimenters, by attending to these equations, may
make the results obtained by the voltameter absolutely
COrrect.
   The symbol (A) I have before noticed stands for the value
of atoms of the compound fluid exposed to the action of a body
                                                                                   an

subject here. It has already been amply dealt with at the
commencement of my reply: I will only add, when it is con
cluded from the hypothesis of a cubical arrangement of the
particles, acting by forces which vary according to the New
tonian law, that the direction of one side of the cube is stable
and of one unstable (Earnshaw on the Nature of Molecular
Forces, Art. 15), ought we not to ask, Is it the hypothesis, or
the reasoning based on it which is erroneous 2 Must it not of
necessity be the             latter?
    We   have now done with the objections to the statical pos
sibility of the law. It remains to reply to the two objections
to    its

is of necessity devoted to other objects and my means very

able to ascertain before the working chemists of the day through
the medium of the Philosophical Magazine.
   Silica and boracic acid undergo no change when heated
in ammoniacal gas by means of the oxyhydrogen flame nearly
to the point at which platina melts, but when heated to that
temperature with cyanide of potassium instead of ammonia,
apparent action ensues.         Boracic acid and cyanide of potas
sium, in the proportion of two atoms of the former to three
of the latter, were placed in a covered porcelain crucible, that
inclosed in a larger Hessian crucible, and the space between
being filled with small pieces of charcoal, the whole was heated
to whiteness in a wind furnace. The result was a white porous
substance, which was found not only at the bottom of the cru
cible, but also lining the sides and the top, having been carried
there by spurious sublimation.           The relative quantities given
above were used in order that the carbon of the cyanide might
beexactly in the right proportion for taking             the oxygen from      all
the boracic acid and      forming     carbonic oxide only, and when
it by

    accident      excess                 of

 272      Mr. W. H.            Balmain on the Formation                of Compounds of
phuric acid (strong and diluted), nitric acid, and solution of
chlorine; it is not altered upon exposure to air, nor does it
affect the most delicate turmeric paper when left upon it in a
moist state.   Passing over for the present the remarkable sta
bility of this compound, these characters are important as
proving the absence of boracic acid and cyanide of potassium
(with some results it was found necessary to wash away the
excess of cyanide of potassium; but this does not interfere
with the nature of the white solid, and was not necessary
when the boracic acid and cyanide                           of potassium were quite
pure and free from water, and their proportions very carefully
adjusted).    Heated with hydrate of potass or soda it yields
ammonia abundantly; in the deoxidizing flame of the blow
pipe it is not altered, nor does it communicate any colour to
the flame, but in the oxidizing flame it gives a strong green
colour, and gradually fuses, yielding a perfect bead, which is
transparent, hot and cold, and when placed with a drop
of water upon test papers, turned tumeric brown, and red
litmus blue.       When the outside flame impinges upon a
large surface of the substance in powder, as when a glass tube
soiled with it is held at the extreme point of the flame, it pre
sents a beautiful green phosphorescence, owing no doubt to
the gradual formation of boracic acid at the surface, and if
it be removed to the inner flame, the centre will incandesce,
while the outer edges, where it meets with the oxygen of the
air, will still yield the elegant green. When thrown upon
fused chlorate of potass it deflagrates with a soft green
light, and it will also deflagrate with nitrate of potass.
It is not altered by being gently heated with potassium or
sodium, nor when heated before the blowpipe on charcoal,
with lead, zinc, &c. Chlorine has no action upon it at a low
red heat, and iodine, sulphur and corrosive sublimate may be
sublimed from it without decomposing                     not decom

   My inability to obtain a better balance than such as I could

                                           conclude that compounds

their chemical relations are similar to those of cyanogen;
and I have no doubt that analogous compounds of alumi
nium, glucinium, &c. may also be formed; moreover, I have
hopes that the fundamental principles of the science of che
mistry may be further elucidated by some of these compounds
proving to be, if not some of our “elements,” at least of a
nature closely analogous.         We are not to suppose that the
affinity of nitrogen for the other elements is weak because                                                   it.

          Atomic Weight of Chlorine.—Hyposulphites.              279
          On the Atomic Weight of Chlorine, Zinc, &c.
    Laurent has made some experiments on the atomic weight
of chlorine; the assumption of Berzelius's number agrees
completely with the analyses, while considerable differences
are visible if the atom be considered as a multiple of that of
hydrogen.      Marignac determines the atomic weight by pass
ing hydrochloric acid gas over heated oxide of copper; he
finds 225'013, or thirty-six times that of hydrogen.            From
this he reckons the atomic        weight  of silver 1374-0,   and of
potassium 498'5.       Jacquelain finds the atomic weight of zinc
to be 414.—(Comples Rendus, Mar. 1842, p. 456; Ibid.
Avril 1842, p. 570; Ibid. Mai 1842, p. 636.)
                        On the Hyposulphites.
    Rammelsberg has published an examination         of this class of
salts: the deliquescent potash salt has the formula 3 KS-H H.
The soda salt contains 5 atoms of water, that with ammonia
has the same composition as the potash salt. The baryta salt
contains 1 atom of water, that with strontia 5 atoms, with
lime and magnesia 6 atoms. A deliquescent double salt of
 magnesia and potassa has the formula K S + Mg S + 6 aq.
 Hyposulphite of manganese decomposes on evaporation into
 sulphur and sulphate, the zinc salt the same; a compound of
 the zinc salt may be obtained by adding ammonia in excess
 to a solution of the hyposulphite and precipitating the salt by
 alcohol; it is Zn S+ NH3.        The nickel and cobalt    salts have
 the same constitution as the magnesia compound;          the nickel
 salt combines with ammonia, and gives (NiS--6 H) +2 NH".
    Hyposulphite of lead dissolves in solutions of alkaline and
 earthy hyposulphites, and forms double salts which are easily
 decomposed. Their solutions must not be heated, for then
 sulphuret of lead is formed; they are partly decomposed by
 water.   The    potassa salt is Pb S.+2  K s +2 aq,  the ammonia
 salt  PbS   + 2  NH'O     S+3 aq.     The soda salt has    been  de
 scribed by Lenz (vide the last Report).    Salts may also be form
 ed with baryta and strontia; the lime salt is PbS42Ca$4.4 aq.
  Hyposulphite of oxide of mercury cannot be obtained; but by
 digesting the oxide with solutions of hyposulphites double salts
 are formed; the ammonia and potassa salts crystallize, the
 former is  Hg§ +4 NH"OS.+2aq;           the formula of the potassa

280        Notices   of the Labours of Continental Chemists.
salt is rather uncertain; the soda salt does not crystallize, nor
do the compounds of the earthy hyposulphites.
    A solution of the potassa double salt added to sulphate of
copper causes a brownish-red precipitate, which has the same
formula as the potassa salt, viz. 3    Hg S +5 Cu S.
    On adding hyposulphite of potassa to sulphate of copper a
yellow precipitate      is produced, the formula   of which is  KS
 + Cu S+ 2 aq; it dissolves in excess of alkaline hyposulphite
and alcohol precipitates from this solution another         crystalli
zable salt, 3 K S + Cu S + 3 aq.
    A soda salt similar to the first of these has been described
by Lenz, it dissolves in excess of Na S, and gives 3 Na S
 +   Cu S + 2 aq.
    Rammelsberg has also examined the products of the de
structive distillation of the hyposulphites; he finds that sul
 phurets, sulphates, and sometimes sulphites are formed.—
 (Poggendorff’s Annalen, vol. xlvi. p. 295.)
                         On the Sulphocyanurets.
    Meitzendorff has made an extensive series of experiments
 on these salts, under the direction of Rammelsberg.            The
 acid was obtained by distilling the potassium salt with tar
 taric acid.      We will here only mention the chief peculiarities
 of the   salts,  and refer the reader for fuller information to the
 long paper itself. The ammonium and sodium salts are an
 hydrous, Na, Cy Sº and NH', Cy S*. The barium, stron
 tium, magnesium and calcium salts are crystallized and deli
 quescent, Ba, Cy S*4-2 aq, Sr, Cy S*H-3 aq, Ca, Cy S*4-3aq,
 and Mg, Cy S*4-4 aq. The solution of the aluminum salt is
 decomposed by evaporation into an insoluble basic and a so
 luble neutral salt. The crystallized manganese salt contains
 3 atoms of water; the zinc salt is anhydrous, it combines with
 ammonia, forming a salt which crystallizes in beautiful cry
 stals, it is Zn, Cy S*-i-NH'. Cobalt salt does not crystallize,
 it is 2 Co, Cy S*-H H ; it forms two compounds with ammonia.
 The nickel salt has the      same composition, and the anhydrous
 salt forms with two atoms of ammonia a crystallizable salt.
 The crystallized cadmium salt is anhydrous, combines with
 one atom        of ammonia.     There   are two salts of bismuth,
 Bi, Cy Sº and Bi, Cy S*4-4       Bi-2 aq.     The disulphocyanuret
 of copper is anhydrous, but retains a little moisture with great

obstinacy.   The sulphocyanuret may be obtained by using
very concentrated solutions of the sulphate of copper and the
sulphocyanuret of potassium; it is precipitated as a black pow
der, and is anhydrous.     Its decomposition with water, which
has been studied by Claus,   is very curious; it changes in water
into the white disulphocyanuret; it appears that at the same
time hydrosulphocyanic, hydrocyanic and sulphuric acids are
formed (the iron salt appears to be similar in properties). The
sulphocyanuret of copper forms a crystallizable salt with one
atom of ammonia.-(Poggendorff’s Annalen, vol. xlvi. p. 63.)

  In   the 45th volume of Poggendorff’s Annals, page 99,
Hertwig published a paper on the proportions in which alumino
sulphate of potassa (alum) can combine with water; he found
that when large crystals of common alum are allowed to                                                         lie

chloric, sulphuric and nitric acids; it is not altered by am
monia, but it is decomposed by boiling with caustic potassa;

evident therefore that the chrome alum can exist in three dif
ferent isomeric modifications. When chrome alum is heated at
200° C. as long as water is driven off, a “difficultly soluble”

water; decomposition is also effected by boiling ammonia.

    Sulphuret of barium crystallizes with six atoms of water;
water acts upon this salt in the same manner as upon the re
duced sulphate of baryta.          The sulphuret can hardly be ob
tained free from hydrate of baryta. The solid hydrosulphuret
of barium was not analysed,as it cannot be obtained free from
supersulphurets, sulphuret and hydrate of baryta.
    It appears therefore that sulphuret of barium is decom
posed by water and forms hydrosulphuric acid and baryta;
the affinity which the H S has for the sulphuret causes the
separation of baryta, which crystallizes, sometimes as hydrate,
and at other times in combination with the sulphuret.
    Sulphuret of strontium, as formed from sulphate and char
coal, is decomposed in the same manner as that of barium; the
more difficult solubility of the hydrate of strontia causes it to
be separated from the other salts with great ease.                H. Rose
 could obtain neither sulphuret of strontium nor                      com          its
                                                                              of by

 into the earth and the hydrosulphuret.              Hydrate       strontia
 contains     10atoms        water,
                                 of which   agrees   with the statements
of   Phillips and Noad.*; the baryta compound also contains                              10
 atoms.

    In   a    second paper               H.    Rose takes into consideration                                the

decompose water when dissolved.            Judging from analogy

water into   hydrosulphuret      and caustic    potassa;    the solution
of                                                                 solu                     by       its

possible that             on
                     dissolving fluoride        potassium         water,
                                                                    of                       in
potassa and hydrofluoride are formed. Rose could not ob
tain them separate, but,           well known, the solution reacts
                                              as   is
alkaline and also attacks glass. The fluoride               ammonium                of
gives ammonia and hydrofluoride.
    Chlorides      potassium, sodium and ammonium produce
                        of
   considerable degree                    of                water, and
                                                                                    of in
a                              cold when dissolved
hence we    may   conclude,   that     the solution     on  these salts
water      not
          is    decomposed.     Chloride                          of
                                               calcium evolves heat
when dissolved, and Thenard and Gay-Lussac adduced this
to  prove the decomposition         water, but     of   simply     com    it   is                    a
bination       of
              the salt with water     crystallization.  of  Chloride                                            of
sodium produces less cold than chloride              ammonium, but            of
we know that under certain circumstances the former can
combine with four atoms of water. The same                the case with            is
several oxysalts.
   Rose has found that chlorides         antimony and bismuth  of

XLIX.    On the Occurrence of Shells and Corals in a Conglo
  merate Bed, adherent to the face of the Trap Rocks of the
  Malvern Hills, and full of rounded and angular fragments
  of those rocks. By John PHILLIPs, Esq., F.R.S., &c.
                of Sir H. T. De la Beche        during
THEofresearches                                the autumn
      1841 into the nature, antiquity and organic contents
of the   trappaean ash-beds of North Pembroke, coupled with
other parallel inquiries, have excited in the minds of those
persons who are attached to the Ordnance Geological Survey
a lively interest in the study of the relations between trap
rocks and the strata amongst which they appear. A very com
mon result of this study in South Wales is a conviction of
the rarity of irruptive trap and the frequency of interstratified
(and, in ordinary language, contemporaneous) beds of plu
tonic rocks and felspatho-hornblendic sediments, which are
not always clearly distinguished from the fused rocks.            On
these  points   in the same or    neighbouring  districts, Professor
Sedgwick and Mr. Murchison deliver nearly the same judg
ment.
   The great obligations which geology owes to Mr. Leonard
Horner and to Mr. Murchison for their descriptions of the
fused and sedimentary rocks in this chain, and of the grand
movements in the crust of the earth, of which it is a noble
monument, are universally admitted, but demand a glad ac
knowledgement from one who, following in their steps and
profiting by their experience, desires to join to theirs the
additional information which he may be so fortunate as to
gather.
    After finishing the colouring of a great part of the Ord
nance map of this district, I turned to examine with care and
interest the great problem which the Malvern hills present,
viz. the determination of the circumstances under which the plu
tomic rocks were elevated.       For this purpose the appearance
of the fused and sedimentary rocks in every part of the Mal
vern chain and the surrounding country has been considered,
separately and in combination; and the general result        is, that
the elevation    of  these hills isa  part of  that grand series   of
associated movements, which the Director and other mem
bers  of  the Geological Survey have been tracing between St.
Bride's Bay and the Severn, between the Teivy and the Bris
tol Channel.
    Viewed  in   this association, the geological epoch when the
great movement        ofthe Malvern rocks occurred, becomes de
 terminable, and has       in
                            fact been determined     by  the eminent
geologists already named.          No one can witness the many

anticlinal and synclinal curvatures which on the western flank
of the Malverns affect equally the Silurian and old red forma
tions, and then survey the comparatively horizontal and un
moved strata of new red marls and sandstones, which on the
east and south touch indiscriminately the sienites, Caradoc
sandstones, Wenlock limestone, and old red sandstone, with
out being satisfied that the great upward movement of the
Malvern rocks happened in the interval between the old and
the new red sandstones.
   But in what state were these plutonic masses raised? as
fused and liquid matter, or solidified rock? To determine this
question, the observed positions of the strata which adjoin the
trap range are important, but their condition and contents are
still more essential.    My first expectation, on looking gene
rally at the narrow continuous range of the Malverns, was,
that here might be found an example of a gigantic sinuous
mass, emitted in a liquid state along a portion of that great
irregular fracture which is the western boundary of the new
red sandstone, from the Severn to the Dee. The complicated
nature of the trap,             its
                          innumerable vein-like segregations,                                  its
included gneissic beds, gave                    an
                                     additional interest       the ex               to

        the deep cutting at the Wych, sandstones and shales of
           In
  the Caradoc formation are placed in a singular manner between
  masses of trap, but are entirely unchanged in aspect, and re
  tain the usual organic remains. On the summit ridge near
  Swinyard hill, the upper beds of the Caradoc series, with the
  usual limestone bands and shales of that part of the Silurian
  strata, rest against solid felspathic trap on the south side and
  cover it as with a saddle. The corals and shells here gathered
  were in their usual state, and the strata appear unaltered.
     Contrasting these cases with others in the midst of the
  Malvern hills, where stratified rocks are irregularly mixed
  with the fused rocks, and have the character of gneiss, and with
  others on the western flanks where dykes and bosses of trap
  appear amongst peculiar sandstones and black shales, it ap
  peared probable that some parts at least of the Malvern ridge
  were of higher antiquity than any of the exterior strata; that
  amongst the lowest of these strata, local and limited irruptions
  of a different sort of trap had occurred; but that the greater
        of the Silurian strata visible in the northern parts of the
  #.
   ills had been subject to no peculiar heat emanating from the
  Malvern ridge.
     In this condition of the argument Mr. Murchison and
  Count Keyserling passed through Malvern and inspected the
section of the Wych, as well as the north end of the Malverns,
and Professor Sedgwick accompanied me on a leisurely survey
of this and other points further south. On the day (Au

#".         shale, abundance of shells, and smaller chips and
 ragments of stone, more or less stained brown, in the same
manner as commonly happens in shelly cavities in other con
glomerates and sandstones far removed from the trap.                                Ex
terior to this very pebbly mass, the shells were equally nume
rous, but the rock fragments amongst which they lay were
generally angular, appearing just as if they had fallen from a
cliff upon a pebbly beach, and received into their interstices
abundance of shells and sand drifted by the water.
   The degree offirmness of the shelly masses thus examined
in situ, is less on an average than that of the loose pieces on
the hill slopes which were first observed; these latter being
the hardest portions which best withstood destroying agencies.
   The shells, corals and encrinites, are commonly represented
by casts and moulds, but a few specimens have occurred of
Turbinolopsis, with the calcareous substance entirely pre
served.
     The pebbles and fragments of      stone mixed with the shells
are of the same nature as the rocks immediately adjacent and
composing the neighbouring hills; that is to say, characteristic
compounds and segregations of hornblende, felspar, quartz,
and mica, in great variety. The whole mass is stained by fer
ruginous admixtures, and at a small distance looks like some
of the dark trap of the hills with which it is in contact. What

But to state such a speculation without the data which have

that of Fresnel, respecting the mechanical signification of the
axes of elasticity.    The existence of three rectangular axes
possessing peculiar properties is not a principle, but a result,
of theory; their directions are determined by conditions per
fectly analogous to those which determine the principal axes
of an ellipsoid from                  its
                           general equation; and these directions
are functions          of
                    certain quantities which are constant when
differentials     the second and subsequent orders are neg
                      of
lected, but which vary when these are taken into account. The
differentials         of
                  higher orders introduce terms depending                                                 on
the  wave-length;   and thus the directions,    well    the lengths,     as          as
 of the principal lines depend      the colour        on

the whole investigation depends on quantities of the order Pp.
Now, not only in the case where u da + v dy + w d 2 is an
exact differential, but also in the case where it is integrable
by a factor, there exists a surface of displacement passing
through P, and the above statement will be true for an ele
ment of this surface. But it will not generally be true for an
element of three dimensions; for, let p be taken in the line of
direction passing through P; then, if w be the radius of ab

          GENTLEMEN,
   a paper printed in the Transactions of the Royal Society
IN(1838, part ii.") I have investigated certain properties of
the spiral curves traced upon the surfaces of shells (concho
spiralst) common to them and to the well-known logarithmic
spiral.
 Pº. results deduced from      my admeasurements have since
been confirmed by those of Professor Naumann of Freiberg
(Poggendorff's Journal, 1840), who has developed, by an                                           in
dependent investigation, several new properties of these curves,
and determined with his accustomed accuracy, in respect to
an extensive series of Conchylia, the particular value of the
constant angle according to which each traces           concho                        its
spiral.

  1841.             dated Boston the 15th of October, 1841, was read.
  Mr. Lyell’s attention, between the period of his arrival in the
United States and     the date of his letter, had been principally devoted
to the   grand   succession of Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous
strata in the state of New York and on the borders of Pennsylvania,
having been accompanied during a portion of his tour by the States'
Geologist, Mr.           J.
                      Hall; but he had also visited, in company with that
gentleman, the Falls of Niagara and the adjacent district, and he states,
that he purposes to communicate a paper on the phaenomena of the
recession, drawn from new arguments, founded on the position of a
fluviatile deposit below the Cataract.         He expresses his intention of
also  communicating     a notice of five localities of Mastodon bones which
he had visited, digging up some remains himself, and collecting the
accompanying shells, which he says, seem to have been neglected.
He had likewise examined, accompanied by Prof. Silliman and his son,
the new red, with intrusive trap, in Connecticut; and, assisted by
Mr. Conrad, he had collected fossils in every member of the cretaceous
system in New Jersey*. The principal object, however, of the present

tification, only one being in an oblique position.         Every stratum
underlying a coal-seam examined by Mr. Lyell, presented the same
phaenomena, except one, and in that case the bed was so sandy that
it could not be considered as a fire-clay. The thickness of these
 Stigmaria deposits varied from one foot to six feet. The roof of the
Blossberg coal-seams consists usually of bituminous slates, but occa
sionally of very micaceous grit, and it contains great varieties of
ferns, as well as other plants, agreeing, generically at least, with
those common in the British coal-measures.
    Mr. Lyell next examined the anthracitic coal-district at Pottsville,
on the Schuylkill, in the southern part of the Alleghanies.          This
district had been examined and described, as well as modelled, by
Mr. R. C. Taylor, and the model had been inspected by Mr. Lyell
previously to his visit. The whole of Pennsylvania has been mapped
by Prof. H. D. Rogers, by direction of the State Legislature.         Mr.
Lyell refers to this survey, and he states that, by consulting Prof.
Rogers's map, it will be found that the Alleghanies, or more properly
the Appalachians, which, viewed geologically, are 120 miles broad,
consist of twelve or more great parallel ridges, or anticlinal and syn
clinal flexures, having a general north-north-east and south-south
west strike, but in Pennsylvania a nearly east and west strike prevails.
The strata are most tilted on the southern border of the chain, where
their position is often inverted, and the folds become less and less
towards the central ridges and troughs, which again increase in
breadth the more northward their position, till at last the beds are
almost horizontal.     The oldest formations also are chiefly exposed
in the most southern or disturbed regions, where syenite and other
plutonic rocks are intruded into the lower part of the Silurian series.
It has long been observed, that the anthracitic coal is confined to the
southern or Atlantic side of this assemblage of small parallel chains,
and that the bituminous occurs in the more inland or less disturbed
region; the conclusion, therefore, Mr. Lyell states, seems inevitable,
that the change in the condition of the coal was a concomitant of the
folding and upheaval of the rocks. The conversion, moreover, is
most complete where the beds have been most disturbed; and there
are tracts in Pennsylvania and Virginia, near the centre of the chain,
where the coal is in a semi-bituminous state.         Chemical analysis,
likewise, has shown that a gradation from the most bituminous to
the most anthracitic coal may be found in crossing the chain from
north to south*.     The associated shales, &c., of the disturbed regions
exhibit no alterations.
    It has also been supposed that the anthracite belonged to the trans
ition, and the bituminous coal to the secondary period; but this be
lief, Mr. Lyell says, has been gradually abandoned, as the knowledge
of the geological position and the fossil plants of the coal-districts
have become better known.        Both the anthracitic and the bituminous
coal overlie the old red sandstone, and contain the same ferns,       Si
gillariae, Stigmariae, Asterophyllites,   &c.; and they are  as abundant
and perfect    in the anthracite as in the bituminous coal.

308              Geological Society:—Mr. Lyell on the
    At the first point where Mr. Lyell, accompanied by Prof. Rogers,
examined the Pottsville coal-measures, the strata are nearly vertical,
being cut off by a great fault from the less inclined beds which
form the northern prolongation of the measures.         They present
thirteen beds of anthracite, the lowest of which alternate with
the uppermost strata of the coarse underlying conglomerate. The
southern wall of an excavation from which the coal had been re
moved, and which wall occupied the place of the underclay, pre
sented impressions of the stems and leaves of Stigmaria; and on
the more solid and slaty beds of the opposite wall, or original roof,
there were leaves of Pecopteris, reed-like impressions, and Calamites.
In the slightly inclined northern continuation of the coal-measures,
 Mr. Lyell observed in the Peachmount vein, three miles north-east
 of Pottsville, a bed of anthracite eight feet thick, overlaid by the
 usual roof of grey grit, and underlaid by blue clay or shale with
 Stigmariae.    Impressions of ferns were likewise noticed in the coal
 itself. Only one instance was met with in the Pottsville coal-district,
 by Mr. Lyell and Prof. Rogers, of a Stigmaria, placed at right angles
to   the plane of stratification.                                      -
   The Pottsville, or southern anthracitic coal-field of Pennsylvania
was illustrated by a section resulting from the former labours of
Prof. Rogers, under whose guidance Mr. Lyell examined the coun
try. The following remarks may explain the general structure of
the country; the names applied to the formations are not, however,
those previously employed by the American geologists, but those
suggested by Mr. Lyell, in conformity with the conclusions at which
he arrived after his tour in New York, and a comparison of the strata of
that state with their British equivalents. The contrast between the
relative importance of most of the Silurian and Devonian groups in
Pennsylvania and in New York, Mr. Lyell states, is very great, arising
from a larger portion of sandstones and grits in the Pennsylvanian
rocks.    The section extends from north of Pottsville to the country
ranging immediately south of Orwigsburg.            To the south of the
vertical coal-measures and the subjacent conglomerate there are
displayed successively—lst, a vast series, composed of red shales
3000 feet thick, of grey sandstone 2400 feet thick, and of red sand
stone 6000 feet thick, the whole being considered by Mr. Lyell as
portions of the old red sandstone; and 2nd, of olive-coloured shale
containing Devonian fossils. The dip of the strata is either nearly
vertical or inverted. Still further south, and a short distance north
 of Orwigsburg, the olive-coloured shales are succeeded by very highly
inclined or inverted beds of upper Silurian rocks flanking a protruded
 band of lower Silurian strata; and lastly, on the southern confines
 of the section is a trough of the Devonian olive-coloured shales
 resting on the upper Silurian strata.
    Beautiful exhibitions of the underclay with      itsassociated plant,
 and   ofthe overlying  roof with        its
                                      distinct remains, were observed      by
 Mr. Lyell and Prof. Rogers        Tamaqua,

district; and Mr. Lyell    says, the decrease in the thickness of the                             in
tervening strata prepares the observer for the union of several of the
seams still farther east, and for the enormous thickness of the anthra
cite at various places near the village of Mauch Chunk, or Bear
Mount, particularly at the well-known Lehigh-Summit Mines. At
this point a mass of anthracite forty feet thick, deducting three                                 in
tercalated fire-clays and a fine thin vein of impure coal, is quarried
in open day, a covering of forty feet of sandstone being entirely re
moved. In the south mine, where there is a sharp anticlinal fold in
the coal, the Stigmaria-clay, <U+017F>our feet thick, was well seen, with
nearly forty feet of coal above it and four below. In the Great mine
Mr. Lyell observed the following section —
Top, yellow quartzose grit.
Coal, two or three inches of the uppermost part of the
  bed being in the state of dust, as if they had been
   crushed or rubbed by the yellow quartzose                      grit......               5 feet.

Coal, with an intervening layer of hard, bituminous slate                             8 feet.
   The anthracite,   as in other parts of these coal-measures, often
exhibits a texture  exactly  like that of charcoal; and frequently im
pressions of striated leaves, exactly resembling, as pointed out by
Prof. Rogers, those of liliaceous plants, particularly the iris.
   Mr. Lyell, accompanied by Prof. Rogers, afterwards examined the
Room Run mines, on the Nesquahoning, where he saw a splendid
exhibition of Stigmariae in a bottom clay, one stem, about three
inches in diameter, being no less than thirty-five feet in length.        In
the roof of slaty sandstone were impressions of Pecopteris, Glos
sopteris, and other ferns.
   At Beaver Meadow, or the middle coal-field, a bed of anthracite is
overlaid as well as underlaid by Stigmaria blue clay; the upper fire
clay, however, soon thins out, and is replaced by sandstone.        No coal
rested upon          it,
                  but Mr. Lyell observes that the carpeting             coal                 of
may not       always large enough
                be                      cover the flooring     fire-clay,        of                  or
                                              or to
some change           of
                   circumstances        denudation may have interfered
with the usual mode          deposition.

says, the accumulation          mud and Stigmariae was,

  his reasons for excluding Leyden jars from this inquiry, and glanced
  at the importance of establishing such a position, he proceeds to
  throw sparks from the machine into wires arranged to represent
  lightning rods, and makes his observations upon the effects produced
  by these wires. Some of them pass perpendicularly between the con
  ductor and the earth, others are led off horizontally: all give rises to
  the said “lateral spark.” The next point was to show that these wires
  did resemble lightning-rods; and for this purpose an arrangement
  was made, as closely resembling nature as possible: a brass rod,
  terminating in a ball, was erected beneath a similar ball proceeding
  from the prime conductor of the machine, and sparks were passed
  between the two: beside the rod was held a smaller and shorter
  one, also terminating in a ball; the larger rod was screwed into a
  brass disc, the smaller rested on the floor; each was separately con
  nected with a good discharging train.             All things being in order,
  sparks were thrown from the prime conductor, and “lateral sparks”
  passed in abundance between the rods: and if this represented a
 lightning rod, it appeared lawful to infer that in every other arrange
 ment when sparks were obtained, they proceeded from the wires
 being a representation of a lightning rod. Without entering into
 the various experiments,           tending      develope the same truth, we
                                                   all                 to

Esq., Memb.
    Aug. 16.—A Letter from Walter Hawkins, Esq., F.S.A., F.Z.S.,

312                   London Electrical Society.
Memb. Elect. Soc., was read, in which allusion was made to the recent
serious accidents occasioned by lightning, and which suggested the
propriety of the Society's taking the matter into consideration, and
publishing some general directions as to the best methods of pro
tecting churches and other elevated buildings.
    A paper from a member, Mr. Mackrell, was then read, detailing
the plan by which he had succeeded in obtaining ferric acid by
electrolysis.
    A paper by Henry Letheby, Esq., A.L.S., was read, detailing the
particulars of the dissection of a Gymnotus Electricus, and containing
reasons for believing that the electric energy originates in the brain
and spinal cord.         In reference to the anatomy of the fish, the author
shows that the electrical organs are not super-additions of a peculiar
structure, but are the result of an increased development of the
aponeurotic termuscular septa, which become so arranged as to form
long tubes, running diagonally from within outwards, so that the
juxtaposition of these tubes produces laminae which run longitudinal
to the animal. The number of tubes in the entire organs is estimated
 at upwards of half a million. The organ is supplied largely by the
 spinal nerves; the peculiar nerve of Hunter, called by Mr. Letheby
 the posterior or dorsal branch of the fifth, is distributed entirely to
 the muscles. The author then alludes to the well-known researches of
 Williamson, Humboldt, Faraday, Walsh, Todd, Davy, Matteucci
 and others, which have proved the analogy between the effects pro
 duced by electrical fishes, and those developed by our artificial com
 binations.      He then goes on to trace the connexion between these
 two divisions of the subject, and directs attention to two important
 facts:—1st, that the organs are made up of aponeurotic septa con
 taining an albuminous gelatinous fluid ; and 2ndly, that these are
 furnished with a supply of nerves far exceeding the wants of the
 parts for the purposes of life.        Bearing in mind this latter fact, and
 then    alluding   to the  voluntary nature of the shock, to  itsannihilation
 when the nerves are severed,       to     its increase when the nerves are
 irritated, he    concludes that the electric force originates       in
                                                                     the brain
 and   spinal   cord,   and      concentrated or    made tense  in  the organ
 itself.                  a is
             He then gives series  of     deductions to  show that electricity
 and vital    energy      in
                        are    a  manner identical.
     This paper was illustrated by   an                   of
                                            elaborate series   drawings, and
 also  by     anatomical     preparationsof    the  organ  and the supplying
 nerves.
     Mr. Weekes's Electro-Meteorological Report for July was then
 read, from which we gather that while the metropolis has been              so
 seriously visited  by      lightning, the neighbourhood  of   Sandwich has
 been    comparatively      tranquil.

generation: he has observed the devolopment and departure of suc
cessive families, and perceives that the defunct are devoured by
their survivors.    On the 20th of July, 1842, he terminated the ex
periment with the sulphate battery, and was so unfortunate as not
to secure a single specimen of the insect. With respect to the
spongy aggregations around the positive electrode, he has found
they are not, as he anticipated, pure silicon, but apparently an                          in
ferior oxide of that element.   He quotes Dr. Brown's opinion, that
“it  may  throw  light on the doubtful question of the atomic weight
of silicon.”
  2nd. “Observations by W. Snow Harris, Esq., F.R.S., on a paper
by Charles V. Walker, Esq., Hon. Sec. L.E.S., entitled “On the
Action of Lightning Conductors.’”
  The author of this paper does not agree with Mr. Walker in
fearing danger from the passage of a spark from the lightning-rod
to a vicinal conducting body; and he thinks, contrary to Mr.
Walker, that the discharge of a Leyden jar does resemble a flash
of lightning.   He says, that “the lightning-rod, so far from send
ing out sparks to neighbouring bodies, directs the passing charge
from them altogether.”      He states, that “when a great variety
of circuits are open to a passing discharge of electricity or light
ning, the charge will be likely to divide on them all;” and that
this is by no means a new fact: this he alludes to as the divi
sion of charge. He adds, that it will not go off to semi-insulated
bodies; and this he appears to consider “lateral discharge.”       He
then proceeds to analyse Mr. Walker's experiments, which had in
duced the latter gentleman to doubt the analogy between Leyden
and lightning discharges, and allows the distinction between the two
cases, but not the difference.   He conceives that the difference in
                                                                            of its

                               of                                                              to

of Aggregation of the Molecules of Bodies,” by Warren De la Rue,
  sq.
  The subject of this short notice is the practical application of the
action which takes place in masses, composed of palpable particles,
 when raised to a temperature insufficient even for their partial          fu
 Slon.
    In illustration of the particular action alluded to, may be quoted
 the following familiar facts —Precipitated gold, when heated to a low
 red heat, contracts in volume, becomes more coherent and yellow in
 colour; clay contracts in volume when heated, and generally in pro
 portion to the intensity of the heat; the carbonaceous deposit in the
 inside of gas retorts, by the continued action of heat, acquires suffi
 cient hardness to scratch glass; ordinary coke and charcoal become
 harder the longer the action of heat is continued on them; these and
 many other analogous facts are examples of a new molecular arrange
 ment being produced in various substances, by subjecting them to an
 increase of temperature, not however sufficient for their fusion.
    To cause the foregoing changes a red heat is employed; we shall
 however presently see that a temperature but little above that of
 boiling water is quite sufficient to materially alter the cohesion of
 some substances.
    It may be as well here to premise, that the particles should be
 brought as closely as possible together; to effect this, if the sub
 stance be in powder, it must be made into a paste with water to
displace the air, and the paste so prepared submitted to a pressure of
four tons or upwards on the square inch; air being so exceedingly
compressible it cannot be got rid of without the use of some liquid.
The manner of pressing need not here be entered on, the operation
being purely mechanical.
    White lead precipitated by carbonic acid gas from a hot solution
of the sub-nitrate always falls as an exceedingly light deposit; if it
be pressed as before described, and the pressed cake dried at the or
dinary temperature of the atmosphere, it coheres but imperfectly, but
on being subjected to a heat of between 200° and 300°Fahrenheit,
it becomes exceedingly hard and compact; and if the cake be ground
up with water and redried, it will be found far more dense and opake
than the original precipitate, showing the change to be permanent.
    The following fact was communicated to me by Messrs. Nasmyth
and Co. of Patricroft:—Common chalk cannot readily be sawn into
thin slips, as it crumbles under the operation; if however it be baked
at the temperature before named it becomes far more tenacious, and
may be then cut into any form we choose, still being sufficiently soft
for drawing or writing, to which purposes it is far more applicable
than before baking.
    Almost  all  precipitates dry much more crisp    at    high than
                                                                   of at low
temperatures, the agency    of    heat  facilitating  the attraction    such
particles as   may happen  to   be   incontact.
  In   conclusion,I    may remark that    it         by
                                               appears    no   means impro
bable that the    long-continued    action of     temperatures, but slightly
elevated above the       ordinary  temperature  of     the atmosphere,  may

from materials originally but slightly coherent.
    “Notice of the Decomposition of Oxalic Methylic AEther (Oxa
late of Oxide of Methyl) by Alcohol,” by Henry Croft, Esq.
    While in Berlin I was led to examine the action of potassa on
oxalate of methyl, by a statement of Weidmann and Schweitzer in
their first treatise on Wood-spirit; namely, that the compounds of
the oxide of methyl with acids are decomposed by alkalies, not into
their constituent acid and wood-spirit, as Dumas and Peligot have
stated, but into the acid and a peculiar          which they called methol.    oil
 From this Löwig drew some conclusions unfavourable                  the accu                      of to

true oxalomethylate of potash, and which I am now about examining.

    “On a new Oxalate of Chromium and Potash,” by Henry Croft,
Esq. For this paper also see pres. vol. p. 197.
    “Some Observations on Brewing,” by Septimus Piesse, Esq.
    The author's attention was directed to the subject by the follow
ing inquiry:—“Is it possible to obtain a greater quantity of ertract
from malt by any other process than that usually followed 2 Is any
thing left in the grains which ought to be in the wort?”
    Now from an examination of several samples of the malt taken
when supposed to be completely exhausted, and from the circum
stance of the grains affording such a large quantity of nourishment
to cattle, I was led to suspect that it was possible to increase the
weight of extract; in fact, the grains were found to contain a nota
ble quantity of starch.
    The non-conversion of this starch into sugar does not depend, in
 the cases I have witnessed, upon the use of improper temperatures,
 but arises from a deficiency of diastase (the principle which effects
 the change of starch into sugar). In the ordinary process of brew
 ing, a certain quantity of water and malt are mixed together of a
 proper temperature. After standing for a time, this water, or as it
 is then termed, wort, is drained from the malt, and a second portion
 of water is run on to form the second wort. There can be no doubt
 but the principal portion of the starch is converted during the first
 mashing, but it never is all. Now it must be remembered that as
 diastase is soluble, it is taken up by the first wort, and when that is
 run off, the diastase passes away also. The improvement consists
 simply in adding diastase to the second wort, to convert the remain
 ing starch into sugar. This is done by the addition of a portion of
 malt (which contains diastase) previous to mashing a second time.
  In a brewing of 30 quarters, I should take 29 quarters for the first
  mash, and add the remaining quarter to the second. There is such
  an increase as to warrant me in advising            adoptionits         brewers  by       all
  and distillers.

  according  to   the usual practice, where           exposed

  that for some      time,   because the wort must run       slowly      order          in              to
  come bright.      The improvement consists             havingin    float     thea               in

  upon which   it   rests when empty. As the wort runs into the back
  the float rises with        it,
                              and falls again when          pumped up

examination.
    The plan usually adopted in this kind of research, namely, ob
serving by the aid of thermometers the time occupied by the passage
of a certain amount of heat lengthways through the substance of a
prism, one end of which was exposed to a high and constant tem
perature, having failed on trial with these bodies, in consequence of
their feeble conducting powers, the following method was had re
course to with perfect success:—The various substances examined
were cut with the greatest care into cubes of 2:8 inches in the side,
and a hole drilled in the centre of one of the faces half way through,
large enough to receive the bulb of an exceedingly sensitive thermo
 meter, together with a little mercury to improve the contact with the
 substance of the cube.          The temperature of the mass being exactly
 observed, it was next plunged,              but       all            its
                                                      upper surface, into large                                  a

 affording      comparison

                                        of                                  perhaps                         or
 more properly, resistance                     to

                      BICHLORIDE OF HYDROGEN.
This  compound, which contains one proportion of chlorine more
  than exists in hydrochloric acid, may be obtained, according to M.
Millon, by slowly and gradually projecting binoxide of lead into con
centrated hydrochloric acid, surrounded by a cooling mixture of ice
and salt.  In the reaction which occurs under these circumstances,
the liquor produced assumes a deep yellow colour, without any sen
sible disengagement of chlorine, and an abundance of protochloride
 [of lead] is formed.
   The bichloride of hydrogen, which gives the liquor its colour and
properties, has not yet been separated from the medium in which it
is dissolved. This compound possesses but little stability, for, at
common temperatures, it continues to evolve chlorine during several
days. Mercury decomposes it by absorbing part of the chlorine,
and thus causing the reproduction of hydrochloric acid.   Its compo
sition would appear to be 1 equivalent of hydrogen + 2 equiva
lents of chlorine = H Ch*.
   This bichloride would be formed by the reaction of 3 equivalents
of hydrochloric acid, or 1 equivalent of binoxide of lead, as shown
by the annexed equation:
            3 H Ch, + PbO2 = Pb Ch 4-2 H O, + H Ch*.

ON THE ACTION OF CHLORIDES UPON PROTOCHLORIDE                           OF   MER
                 CURY.  BY M. MIALHE.
   M. Mialhe remarks that Capelle, in 1763, first observed the dan
 ger arising from a mixture of calomel and sal-ammoniac; Proust after
wards proved the conversion of calomel into corrosive sublimate by
the action of the alkaline chlorides.        After mentioning other au
thors, M. Mialhe refers to a note of his own contained in the Jour
nal de Pharmacie for February 1840, in which he details experiments
proving,     1st, that calomel acted upon by the alkaline chlorides al
ways yields more or less corrosive sublimate; 2ndly, that it is to
this partial conversion calomel owes       itsmedicinal powers; and             he
afterwards mentions different authors who have confirmed his opi
nions.
                            *
   M. Mialhe then relates various experiments which               he
                                                                has since
performed    to determine the proportion    of corrosive sublimate result
ing, under certain conditions, from this action.

hours, the temperature varying from 68° to 77°Fahr.; there was
produced 0:6 of a part of corrosive sublimate.
   Similar experiments were made with calomel prepared by preci
pitation, with precisely similar results.
   Erperiment II.-1000 parts of the assay liquor" had 60 parts of
calomel (à la vapeur) digested in it for 24 hours, at a temperature
varying from 104° to 128° Fahr.; 15 part of corrosive sublimate
was produced.
   The preceding experiments repeated with precipitated calomel
(précipite blanc), yielded a mean of 17 part of corrosive sublimate.
This chemical result confirms the opinion of therapeutists, who have
always considered the calomel obtained by precipitation as sensibly
more active than that prepared in the dry way.
   The following question was then examined: Is the quantity of
sublimate produced proportional to that of the calomel employed, or
to that of the alkaline chloride

   These two experiments, repeated with precipitated calomel, gave
the following results:—
    1st Erperiment.—Sublimate         1.8 part.
   2nd Experiment.—Sublimate 0-6 part.
   Experiments were then made to decide the question, whether the
degree of dilution of the alkaline chlorides put into contact with the
calomel, had any remarkable influence on the quantity of sublimate
produced: this was found to be the case, as indeed theory would
indicate.
   It was also proved, by direct experiment, that the presence of
neutral organic bodies does not hinder the conversion of calomel
into sublimate; on the contrary, dextrine favours the change; sugar
and albumen probably do not modify it; and lastly, lard and gum
arabic very evidently retard
                                             in it.                                           on

atmospheric air modifies the results.
    1st Erperiment.—Without the presence                  air.    Water 2000   of

bottle; sublimate produced 0-3 part.
   2nd Erperiment.—The same substances allowed                  react with the           to
presence       the air, yield 1:1 part
               of                           sublimate.     of
  It   appears, then, that calomel and the alkaline chlorides, when
air  ispresent, produce three times          much sublimateas        when they                 as
                                                                                                                  of as

                          it.                 this appears  of be, the fact,             to
stated
          byM. Guibourt, that calomel absorbs certain quantity                 a
oxygen        common temperatures;               higher temperature the ab
            is at
                                                            at   a
sorption      greater; and        the case now mentioned, the absorption
                                        in
is accelerated by the presence                        of
                                         the alkaline chlorides.            not                         It   is
therefore surprising that the proportion                sublimate should   of                                     be
greater when the air         present, since for every equivalent

                                   sublimate       produced      and moreover
                                                                     is                  ;
each equivalent              of

and   l of alkaline oxide.
   To check these researches, the following experiments were made                                                 :
    1st Erperiment.—Water 1000 parts, calomel and hydrochloric
acid each 60 parts, digested twenty-four hours                    temperatures           at
between 104° and 122° Fahr.              sublimate    produced,
                                                      ;            without the
contact      air, 0.4 part.
            of
    2nd Experiment.—The same substances, reacting with air present,
gave 1-4 part             of
                     sublimate.
     Itmay       concluded from the foregoing, that about two-thirds
                    be                                                                                            of
the sublimate produced are formed              the influence    by oxygen, and                of

of  calomel into metallic mercury and calomel.

sublimate, &c. by the influence of boiling distilled water deprived
of air. 1000 parts of boiling distilled water and 60 parts of calomel
were kept at 212° for an hour; after cooling,

                                                 the water was found
to contain 0 1 part of sublimate.
   This experiment repeated with precipitated calomel gave 0 1 part
of sublimate.
   When calomel then is boiled in distilled water, sublimate is un
questionably produced without the contact of air, but the quantity
produced is infinitely smaller than when oxygen is present; but in
this case it is oxichloride of mercury which is formed, and not mere
bichloride of mercury.—Annales de Chimie et de Physique, Juin 1842.
        ON     CINCHOWATINA—A NEW VEGETABLE ALKALI.
  M. Manzini obtained this alkali from the            Cinchona ovata, which
has   always  been admitted not to possess       any febrifuge power.   The
process employed in preparing this substance was exactly similar to
that used for obtaining quina.
    Its properties are, it crystallizes in prisms, which are longer than
those of cinchonia; they are white, inodorous, bitter, but this is long
in being developed, on account of the slight solubility of this sub
stance. Alcohol dissolves it very well, especially when hot, but
aether is not so perfect a solvent, and in water it is almost insoluble.
Dilute acids dissolve it readily and form salts, which usually crystal
lize readily, are very soluble even in weak alcohol, but more so when
hot than cold; these salts are decomposed by the alkalies and their
carbonates, which precipitate cinchovatina; they are also decomposed
by tannin, iodide of potassium, bichloride of mercury, chloride of
platina, chloride of gold and other metallic chlorides. Ammonia also
precipitates the salts of cinchovatina, setting the base at liberty, but
 only a part of it is separated in an insoluble state, especially if the
excess of ammonia is considerable; a portion of the base remains
 dissolved by the ammonia, and is deposited in slender crystals by the
 evaporation of the alkali; even that portion of the cinchovatina
 which is precipitated, and which is perfectly amorphous, eventually
 becomes a crystalline mass of a splendid pearly whiteness; it re
 quires some days for the production of this change. The alcoholic
 solution of cinchovatina is very bitter; it restores the blue colour of
 reddened litmus, and renders syrup of violets green. When subject
 ed to a heat gradually increasing to 366°Fahr., cinchovatina suffers
 no loss of weight, nor any change of appearance; when heated in a
 tube to 370°Fahr. it melts into a brownish liquid without volatili
 zing; on cooling it solidifies into a mass of a resinous appearance, of
                                          as its
 the colour of colophony, with            surface covered with cracks;           in

 At about 374°Fahr. it decomposes, and then yields extremely fetid

   When sufficient chlorine has been added to decompose the whole
of the alkaline bromide, the paper immersed is not immediately
coloured, for then the iodine exists in the liquor in the state of bro
mide, and no longer acts upon the starch; but this remarkable cir
cumstance occurs, that the paper being withdrawn from the liquor
and exposed to the air, the moistened part assumes a reddish tint in
about two minutes, then becomes violet, and afterwards blue; the
same reaction occurs, but in a longer time, when the starched paper
is left to macerate in the liquor.
   This effect, unquestionably owing to the decomposition of the
bromide of iodine by the organic matter of the paper, or perhaps
even of the starch itself, admits of detecting minute quantities of
iodine in the alkaline bromides.—Journal de Chim. Médicale, Sep

     PREPARATION    OF FERROCYAN      IC ACID.       B.Y.   M. POSSELT.
   This acid, now sometimes also termed hydroferrocyanic acid, was
discovered by Porret, and called by him ferrochyazic acid. According
to M.Posselt the following is an improved process for obtaining       it:-
agitate with aether a concentrated aqueous solution of ferrocyanic
acid as obtained by the decomposition of ferrocyanide of lead by
means of sulphuric or hydrosulphuric acid, the acid separates imme
diately and may be obtained by filtration; this remarkable separa
tion of the acid from the water which holds it in solution, requires
but little aether.    If the solution is moderately concentrated, the
whole forms a thick mass by agitation, and after some time the fer
rocyanic acid suspended in the aether, separates from the water sa
turated with aether, and swims on the surface. The water is to be
removed by a pipette; the thick mass is to be put on a filter and
washed repeatedly with a mixture of alcohol and aether, containing
a considerable portion of the latter; it is then to be passed between
folds of absorbent paper to remove the moisture, and afterwards to be
perfectly dried over sulphuric acid in the air-pump.
    In order to avoid preparing ferrocyanide of lead and the aqueous
solution of ferrocyanic acid, a concentrated solution of ferrocy
anide of potassium may be prepared in boiled water, and it is to
be allowed to cool, entirely excluded from the air; it is then to be
mixed with an excess of hydrochloric acid, also deprived of air, and
this mixture is to be shaken with aether in the manner described.
The acid separates in the same manner, and is to be dissolved in al
cohol, to which a little sulphuric acid is to be added to combine
with the potash which it may still contain; the liquor is to be filter
ed if it is not clear, and this alcoholic solution is to be agitated
with aether; this again separates the acid, which is to be dried as
before described.                             -

even the oxalates.             It   does not when cold dissolve binoxide                                   of mer
cury; but if it       be heated the acid is decomposed    into hydrocyanic
 acid, which forms a cyanide with the mercury of the binoxide, and
into cyanide of iron, which is additionally oxidized at the expense of
a part of the binoxide of mercury, and metallic mercury separates.
   The ferrocyanic acid prepared by the process described is in the
state of a white powder, frequently with a slight blue or yellow tint.
When it is perfectly dry it may be long exposed to the air without
alteration, when moist the decomposition takes place more rapidly:
the acid becomes gradually blue, and is slowly and totally converted
into Prussian blue.
   It may be long exposed in a covered platina crucible to a tempe
rature of 212°, and excluded from the air, without losing weight or
suffering any sensible change; eventually, however, it is decomposed
under these circumstances.
   When it is more strongly heated, hydrocyanic acid is disengaged
and cyanide of iron remains, which is oxidized. If it be heated in a
current of carbonic acid gas, and the temperature be not raised above
212°, hydrocyanic acid is evolved and white cyanide of iron is left,
and this decomposes also at a temperature somewhat above 212°. It
is,        well known, very soluble        water, and the solution submit

LV.     Letter addressed by M. Edmond Becquerel to the Editors
   of the Annales de Chimie et de Physique, in Reply to Mr.
   Daniell's Letter to Mr. R. Phillips on the Constant Poltaic
   Battery, inserted in the Phil. Mag. for April 1842*.
INI   the Annales de Chimie et de Physique for December 1841,
         published a Notice on constant voltaic batteries, in
which I stated the facts relating to the subject just as they
result from experiments performed by various natural philo
sophers who have been occupied with this subject.
   Mr. Daniell, thinking that I had not done him justice, has
thought it necessary to reply to several of my assertions in
the Philosophical Magazine for April 1842.              It was far from
my intention to have wished to say anything which might be
displeasing to him, and to have sought to misrepresent facts,
with a view to attribute to my father a discovery which did
not belong to him; in this respect Mr. Daniell is strangely
mistaken as to my intentions, and without this motive,         I should
not have replied to him, having nothing to change, with re
spect to the main point, in the facts which         I mentioned in my
notice.
   In every physical question three things are to be considered;
the idea, the principle, and the applications. Now, it is proved
by undoubted facts, that from 1829, and even several years
before, my father had invented and constructed constant vol
taic batteries, which, in truth, had not the power of action
and the advantages possessed by the constant voltaic batteries
of Mr. Daniell, who made them known in 1836. The ap
paratus invented by my father at once received the denomina
  * From the Ann. de Chim. et de Phys. for August 1842 (Third Series,
vol. v. p. 412), published towards the end of September.

  tion of constant voltaic batteries (appareils d courant constant),
  and, as they still perfectly fulfil the purpose he had intended,
  it is impossible to contend with him for the idea, the principle,
  or the application within certain limits.
      The details into which I shall enter will leave no doubt
  about the priority of invention, at least               I
                                                 hope so. For more
  than fifteen  years  the electro-chemical   reactions,   by means of
  which    my  father was enabled to obtain       crystallized   mineral
  substances, were produced by the aid of small apparatus com
  posed of tubes in the form of the letter U, closed at their cur
  vature by a partition of moist clay designed to separate the
  two liquids placed in the two branches of each tube, one of
  which contained a solution of sulphate, nitrate or chloride of
  copper in contact with a plate of copper, and the other con
  tained a solution of sea-salt, into which a plate of zinc or of
  another metal was immersed. Such is the arrangement of
  the simple apparatus which is scientifically known by the
  name of pile d cloison*.
     The form of this apparatus is of little importance, since it
  may be infinitely varied: for example, instead of a tube in
  the form of a U, we may take any kind of vessel, separated
 into two compartments by a diaphragm of bladder, baked
 earth, plaster, or linen, &c. But                all
                                             these various modifica
 tions enter into the principle              of
                                      the U-tube.
     After the year 1829, and before Mr. Daniell's publication,
 my father made several communications relating                the same        to
 subject;  in   fact, we find     the Comple Rendu des Séances
                                       in                                                      de

 ratus   giving  a  current which was     sensibly   constant for two
 entire days.
    According      tothis, therefore, Mr. Daniell cannot pretend
to   the  discovery      the general principle
                        of                                      on

my father had occasion          the beginning, for the production

                  Voltaic Battery, in Reply to Mr. Daniell.                                               331
 answer that he was not guided by the works of his predecessors
 in the construction of his battery, and that the principles upon
 which it rests are different from those which my father had
 long since admitted.       He states, for example, that the rapid
 diminution, as well as the definitive cessation of the cur
 rent in ordinary batteries, are due to the deposition of zinc
 on the negative plates of each couple. We agree perfectly
upon this point; the annihilating action produced by the
presence of the zinc comes under that designated by the term
polarization of the electrodes. In my Notice, indeed,            men                                I
tion, p. 438, in the eighth and following lines, that “each
negative plate (of copper or of platinum) retains on              sur                               its
face alkaline    elements,  such      hydrogen   arising
                                                   as    from the de
 composition        water, and bases arising from the decomposi
                       of
tion    ofsaline matters dissolved        water.” This phrase does
                                                          in
 not exclude    any     the  of
                             bases;   the zinc therefore arising from
 the decomposition               of
                          the salt                 of
                                      zinc must equally     deposited                      be
 on  the negative plate. This deposition being effected, the
 action      the liquid
             of                        on
                               the zinc necessarily gives birth                                           to
 counter-current which more and more destroys the action                                                   it of a

pile, although very convenient, as based upon the same prin
ciples as the apparatus which my father has used for a long
time.
    Further on Mr. Daniell adds: “Even in the use of the
diaphragm, which might at first sight appear similar, there is
a direct opposition, for my object is to keep the two electro
lytes which           I
                    employ perfectly separate, so that no portion
of one     may  penetrate   to the other, except in the process of
electrolysis.”
    I  confess that       I
                         know not how Mr. Daniell can separate
two     liquids   by  a membrane moistened by them and which
they can penetrate, without that passage from one to the other
taking place which is otherwise called endosmose and exos
mose. It is impossible to realize this condition; the only
means of retarding for as long a time as possible the mixture
of the two liquids, is by substituting for the membrane a thick
 diaphragm of clay, as did my father; the intensity of the cur
 rent is then diminished, but constant effects are obtained
 which may continue for months, for years.
    Still further on Mr. Daniell says: “ and              repeat, that inI
 my constant battery nothing depends upon the contact and
 action of the two liquids upon each other.”
    I  do not understand this assertion; for every one knows that
 two different liquids acting upon each other by an intermedial
membrane, disengage electricity enough to produce a current;

334      Prof. Grove's Remarks on a Letter of Prof. Daniell.
of    these philosophers;       I cannot see that I have.    I  have on
many occasions mentioned their experiments before my own
in the history of the voltaic pile, both as acknowledging their
 priority and as not wishing to claim what was not my due;
 probably it is this which has led to a misconception on the
 part of Mr. Daniell, but           I  have distinctly stated the idea
 which    immediately     led to the construction of my battery in the
 paper which describes it (Phil. Mag., May 1839). After de
 tailing an experiment with two strips of gold-leaf in nitric and
 hydrochloric acids separated by a porous diaphragm, and
  showing that upon contact of the two strips the gold in the
  hydrochloric acid was dissolved, and that a voltaic current
  was established, say,I       “It   now occurred to me, that as gold,
 platina and two acids gave so powerful an electric current,” d
 fortiori “ the same arrangement, with the substitution of zinc
  for gold, must form a combination more energetic than any
 yet known:” this was the simple deduction which led to my
  subsequent experiments.          I have in most cases been content
  to publish experiments with no more of theory than was re
  quisite to connect them; it is a general and I think a just com
 plaint that there are already too many speculations on this sub
 ject; but in a letter published in the Philosophical Magazine
 for Feb. 1839, p. 129, previous to the discovery of my battery,
  I  gave my own notions of the principles of voltaic batteries,
 notions which in some respects agree with those of Mr.
 Daniell, but which also suggest some new views of voltaic ac
 tion. There is one experiment there detailed in which copper
 is reduced by copper, which had much influence on my subse
 quent experiments, but which is not explicable by any prin
 ciples laid down by Mr. Daniell; at the conclusion of this
 paper     I say,  “if   these principles be correct, very superior
  combinations     may     be discovered:” how this prediction has
  been fulfilled the public is the best judge.
      Far be it from me to disclaim any assistance from the ex
  periments of Mr. Daniell or of M. Becquerel;          I shall ever re
  tain a grateful recollection of the assistance rendered to my
  first efforts in science by the latter gentleman. I cannot at this
  distance of time well describe what effect their experiments
  had upon my mind.           In the progress of science it is difficult
  to define the frequently unperceived effect of prior discoveries
                                                I
  upon subsequent experimentalists, but cannot for many rea
  sons acquiesce in the assertion of Mr. Daniell above quoted.
      Mr. Daniell was for a long time attached to the theory of
  the deposition of metals in the voltaic circuit being the result
 of a secondary action of the nascent hydrogen, a theory ge
 nerally adopted until combated by Hisinger and Berzelius; thus

     Prof. Grove's Remarks on a Letter of Prof. Daniell.                                        335
in his papers, Phil. Trans., 1836, p. 117       et seq., he proceeds to
explain his constant battery as dependent upon the removal
of that hydrogen by causing it to deoxidate copper: in a
subsequent publication (Phil. Trans., 1889) he abandons this
view, and considers the deposition of the copper as “a primary
result of electrolytic action.”        This would altogether alter
the  theory   of his  battery  and of mine. I do not think it is a
matter of great consequence which theory be adopted; each
has many peculiar difficulties, each tends to many similar
conclusions, and either may lead to equally successful experi
mental results. Theory is valuable as a means not as an end,
and that theory of the voltaic battery is in my opinion the
best which best collates the observed phaenomena and which
leads to the discovery of the best voltaic combinations. But
although I would hesitate, without more conclusive experi
ments, in ascribing this superiority to either of these theories,
there is another principle of the voltaic battery enounced by
Mr. Daniell, as to which, so far from agreeing with him, I must
take leave (with every respect for his scientific attainments)
to differ toto calo: it is as to the relative extent of surface to
be given to the metals of voltaic combinations.             Mr. Daniell
has in the Phil. Trans. for 1836, p. 128, and in several subse
quent papers, stated that the best theoretical form for a voltaic
combination is when the generating metal is arranged with
regard to the conducting one.as the centre of a sphere to                                        its
periphery, and recommends              rod within

  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
           GENTLEMEN,
       OUR Number for last September                                       contains a paper by           Mr.
     Warington “On the Change of Colour in the Biniodide
of Mercury.”     Permit me to observe, that the facts contained
in the first part of that paper were long ago discovered and
published by myself, in your Journal (S. 3, vol. ix. p. 2*).
   As I do not wish to be deprived of the discovery of one of
the most curious phaenomena in optics, I beg leave to draw
Mr. Warington's attention to that paper, and briefly to re
 capitulate          its
                contents.
    In that memoir have shown,   I

            glass nearly       contact with each other,                                                      in

very fine objects for the polarizing microscope.

to my memory the very similar words which         used when                I                       I
first announced the invention of the polarizing microscope in
your Journal (vol. v. p. 324), viz.
    “The field of view appears scattered with the most brilliant
assemblage of highly coloured gems, affording one of the
most pleasing sights that can be imagined. The darkness of
the ground on which they display themselves greatly en
hances the effect.”
      With regard to the above points, then,                        I consider           that they
were sufficiently established by me in 1836.
    The second part of Mr. Warington's paper, however, con
tains a fact both new and important; I mean the solution of
the yellow crystals in the liquid and the formation of the red
ones, of a different form, in their places.         But this observa
tion is most strictly analogous to the phaenomenon which                                           I
discovered in the iodide of lead, and published in your Journal

 tion of the germinal membrane in one of these two ways. Both
 theories       been put forth before the discovery of the germinal
 spot. But when the existence of the latter became known,
                                                                   the   Year 1840.
 the discoverer of the same said that probably the macula
germinativa represented the first foundation of the germinal
 membrane. This conjecture obtained more probability from
 the obvious fact, that the number, size and distribution of the
 germinal spots alternated according to the different stages.
  Research, however, first in the Mammalia, and then in Rep
 tiles and Fishes, showed that in consequence of fecundation
 the interior of the germinal vesicle presents new cells, or that
 (as was seen in the Rabbit) within the germinal vesicle new
 cells are really built up upon the foundation of the germinal
 spots.” (Introductory Remarks, p. 13.)
    First stages in the development of the fecundated ovum, espe
cially that of the Mammalia. As was already remarked in the
introduction, the most important publications of the past year
concerning embryology are concentrated in the subjects of
this chapter.     We will therefore, before presenting some ex
tracts of the details, state the most important results. With
few exceptions, to be mentioned,         the observations have re
                                                   all
ference      the Mammalia, and indeed
             to                               the Rabbit. to
   1.  At the period               of
                           the rut certain changes have already
taken place        the ovarium, the [Graaftan] follicles, and the
                    in
structures appertaining thereto.      Through      increased con     an
gestion      the ovary single follicles become more strongly de
             of
veloped. The germinal spot, which gives the impulse             the                 to
formation         of
                 the new cells, probably undergoes changes                               of
this kind. From the observations    Négrier, above men   of

                                        cells within the germinal
vesicle”.

                                         the subsequently fecun
dated ova, but generally exceeds the same.    This fact, already
known, has been confirmed                     by
                                   the latest researches      the                   on
Rabbit.
  4.     often happens that more ora pass out
        It                                       the ovary than          of

cord the observations     Barry with those

 aborted ova.        In like manner, parts of the [Graafian] follicle
  which usually remain in the ovary, for example, portions of
  Barry's ovisac, may be found in the oviducts.
      5. Neither the place to which the ova in the tubes and uterus
 have advanced, nor the size of the same, nor the time that has
 elapsed since they left the ovary, affords an eract criterion for
 the degree of their internal development.              This position fur
  nishes only a confirmation of what was already                             knownº.
      6. The germinal vesicle does not disappear nor burst through
jecundation, but fills with cells, the formation of which proceeds
 from the germinal spot: and this takes place by no means in a
 peculiar manner, but according to a normal mode which mani
 fests itself elsewhere.      These circumstances, which really ex
  tend our     knowledge,    have been made known by the laborious
  researches of Barry. The general process is as follows:—It is
  known that in the interior of the germinal spot there exists a
  central body, which often becomes surrounded by concentric
  traces. This body now enlarges and fills with a pellucid fluid.
  That part of the germinal spot which is directed towards the
  interior of the germinal vesicle passes into cells, arranged
  like pill-boxes one within the other, yet so that the pellucid
  central vesicle remains near to the periphery [of the ovum].
  Within the cells thus arisen there are formed new cells. This
  cell-formation proceeds in layers from the centre towards the
  periphery.      The outer strata of cells are thus pushed further
  out, and the most external disappear while new inner strata
  form, so that the middle ones advance to the outer part.                In
  this manner the germinal vesicle becomes filled with masses
  of cells, while      its
                         membrane disappears. But              the situation in
 of    what was   originally   the centre       the    of
                                                     germinal    spot there
  are formed two cells, distinguished                       by

 340      Mr. Earnshaw in Reply      to  Prof. Kelland on the
 cundation thus consists in the imbibed seminal fluid stimulating
 the germinal spot to the cell-formation, according to the type
 of cells in cells. But many more cells are formed than re
 main; the outer layers being constantly absorbed.
    7. The furrows known to be presented by the yelk arise from
 the formation of cells (see Repertorium, v. 306). Their pre
 sence in Fishes was etablished by Rusconi, in Mammals by
 Barry. In Birds they may either entirely fail, or, as is more
 probable, be limited to the germinal membrane and not ex
 tended to the yelk.
    8. The rotation of the yelk or of the embryo in the ovum, pre
 viously observed in invertebrated animals and in Batrachian
 Reptiles, is also found to take place in Fishes and Mammalia.
 Rusconi perceived this rotation thirty hours after fecundation
in ova of the Pike; so that it is thus, met with where there
is a circumscribed germinal membrane.           In the Rabbit it was
seen by Barry, although he remained in doubt as to the na
ture of the rotating body which was determined by Bischoff.
The latter described also vibrating cilia on the superficial
cells. It now remains a point of especial interest, to extend
the observation to classes which otherwise do not exhibit         ci
liary motion, for instance the Grustacea.
   9.  Qf  the other structures   of  the [Graaffan] follicle which
pass out [of the ovary] along with the ovum, the tunica granulosa
and retinacula (discus proligerus) undergo liquefaction; while
within the zona there arise concentric formations of membranes
and fluid or semifluid rings. According to Barry, this forma
tion amounts to from four to five membranes. The attenua
tion of the zona above mentioned soon disappears. The chorion
is not formed out of the zona, but out of cells, which arise in
the tube and are laid down around the metamorphosed struc
tureS.

 Theory     of Molecular        Action according to Newton's Law. 341
was with great pleasure that                I
                                     read in Professor Kelland's
letter that the attention of the greatest mathematicians in Eu
rope is now alive to the necessity and importance of having
“the difficulties which attend the theory” removed: and
rejoice that Professor Kelland has undertaken the task of
                                                                                             I

memoir on the    subject printed in the Cambridge   Philosophical

                                 º, #, +.
Transactions,     have shown, apparently to Professor Kelland's
                                   2
satisfaction, that when                                          are not zero,           the
medium is incapable of transmitting light, and have dismissed
at once as foreign to the subject the case where these quan
tities are zero, which case the Professor argues “embodies
the real state of things.”  The grounds on which I dismissed
this case in so summary a manner were these:–
    1st. The acknowledged experimental fact of the superpo
sition of waves of light requires that the forces called into
play by a displacement should depend only (or at any rate
chiefly) on the first power of the displacement.
    2ndly. The received explanations of refraction through cry
stals and of other phaenomena, assume that the force of restitu
             If º, º, #.
tion depends only on the first power of the displacement; and,
                  2          2          2
   3rdly.                                       be zero,the first powers of the
displacement disappear; and therefore this case is inconsist
ent with the known results of experiment and the require
ments of received and established theory.        Yet Professor
Kelland thinks that the real state of things is embodied in the
excepted case, and founds his belief on arguments drawn from
analytical expressions in his memoir. It appears to me, then,
that the shortest way of bringing the controversy to an end,
will be to show that the Professor's own investigations, under
proper mangement, lead us to the same results as were given
in my memoir. At pages 162, 163 of the Professor's paper
on Dispersion, we are told that on the hypothesis which he

LXI.    Professor Kelland's Vindication                    of himself against     the
                Charges     of the Rev. M. O'Brien.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,                                                Paris, June 5, 1842.
I HAVE
     on me
               read, with extreme astonishment, the attack made
              by  Mr. O'Brien in your Magazine for this month.
 My first impression was that it did not become me to reply
to it in any shape, but, on reflestion, it has appeared probable
that many persons may read it who are not intimately ac
quainted with the subject, on whom the effect of silence would
be equivalent to the admission of the justice of the statements
made.       Ishall therefore enter into a brief explanation, with
a view to direct your readers to the facts, not to carry on a
controversy.      But in commencing               I
                                           am naturally induced to
ask, wherein have I offended Mr. O'Brien?              For it must be
noted by every one that Mr. O'Brien's object is not to                          “re
ply” to my remarks, but to remove an impression which he
        I
thinks have endeavoured to create, “that he has done nothing
in his paper which had not been already done by myself
in my memoirs.”          Now I should be exceedingly sorry to
create a false   impression;    and I am sure no person who reads
my remarks will accuse me of having done so intentionally.
Still had Mr. O'Brien candidly stated that such was the im
pression on his mind, either in your Journal or personally
when I saw him in Cambridge, I would have addressed my
self diligently to remove            But Mr. O'Brien's procedure
                                     it.
leaves  no  room for any other course than           reply publicly
                                                                to                     to
his  charges,   and leave  it    the world
                                 to             judge  to
                                                        between us.
    First, then, have attributed
                       I                myself the “notation” em
                                             to
ployed, “the equations          M. Cauchy,” the conclusion “that
                                of
transverse and normal vibrations are              general propagated
                                                           in

                                                  I
such dishonesty.        They are all,        far  as    know, due
                                                                as
                                                                 I                 to
Cauchy.      Nor  is   there one       of
                                     the conclusions       M. Cauchy  of
which I    have,   even    byaccident,  called   my  own.      will not    I
waste words about this.        M. Cauchy himself assures me that
I  have spoken with perfect justice and propriety.
    Secondly, have   I   attributed    myself the conclusion “that
                                            to

346          Prof. Kelland's Vindication of himself against
assertions about what I have said or denied suffice to effect it.
Let us take an instance or two, and I will add all that can
be added to such assertion by way of answer.               Mr. O'Brien
says,  “I  have arrived at a result never obtained before, namely,
that dispersion must arise from the direct action of the par
ticles of matter upon those of aether.           This result is denied
by Professor Kelland.” I answer, never denied                I Of course                  it.
I  object       to
                the word must.         The facts are simply these.
With regard               to
                    the action       the particlesof   matter        those    of                     on
of  aether, M. Cauchy and Mr. O'Brien adopt one hypothesis,
whilstI    had adopted another. On theirs, the velocity             trans                            of
                               on
                                                                 or of
mission   depends       the direct action     the  particles      matter;                        of
on   mine,   itdoes not. That either            both may        wrong                           be              is
perfectly possible;        groping after truth, we cannot reason
directly from data                  upin
                               laws, but must work our way back
                                           to
from assumed laws         the  experimental
                                 to           data. Hence the value
of   researches such       those before us. They may ultimately
                                    as
lead   to truth even      the time when least approaching
                                 at                                                                        to   it.

    But this leads me        another of Mr. O’Brien's assertions.

what was only asserted by Mr. Green, viz. that transverse and
normal vibrations are in general propagated with different
velocities.      I
                 have learned since that M. Cauchy had previously
arrived at the same result.        Professor Kelland distinctly de
nies the correctness of this result in the Royal Edinburgh
Transactions, vol. xiv. p. 396.”            I have not the passage to
turn   to,  but your  readers  have,  and fearlessly assert,

denied the correctness         M.     of
                                  Cauchy's    result.    could not have
done       so.
             The assertion,                or
                                 rather hypothesis,       Mr. Green                 of I                        is,
if my memory does not deceive me,                 very different affair.

having fallen into error further than       states.
 I   assert, first, that when       remembered that one

are correct; and secondly, that         never deduced one result
                                                          I

it concerned.
   Mr. O'Brien's argument that because M. Cauchy's equation
 is   of
      one form and mine         another, one must
                                            of        incorrect,                             be                     is
 only good when the hypotheses are identical. That they are
 not stated          to
               be otherwise must be    fault of mine.   But         a                                           I
 have never employed the equations   this form,    the best    in                             to                    of

   Mr. O'Brien's argument against the equations I have used,

is not zero, is good only on the hypothesis that g is not
measured along one of the axes. Had Mr. O'Brien read
my papers he would have seen that             have twenty times over  I
at least,  given   this expression  a value which is not zero. But
when the direction of transmission in an isotrope medium is
under one of the axes, the expression is zero. And these are
the only circumstances in which I have used it as such; your
readers will find my fundamental equations deduced in your
Magazine for May, 1837. I think they will see my views cor
rectly stated there, and trust they will do me the justice to
                                           :-
examine them before they give credence to the following as
sertions of Mr. O'Brien
   “And here I must enter a decided protest against all Pro
fessor Kelland's reasoning on the subject of transverse and
normal vibrations.”        “Now this error in the fundamental
equations vitiates             all
                         his results,    far    they relate

certain announcements, received from Professor Bessel”, of
phantoms which can be produced on surfaces by mercury va

1840, p. 84); Sept. 1840, p. 218; Sept. 1841, pp. 198, 199;
you will find that I had published facts of the kind; spectral
appearances, that could be revived on metals, glass, and other
bodies, by the breath, by vapour of camphor, by mercury
vapour, &c. The very purpose for which I described them was
the striking resemblance of some of them to Daguerreotype
images.       Ihave repeatedly shown, that by placing a coin or
any other object on iodized silver, in the dark, the vapour of
mercury will bring out a representation of                   And  it.  one        in         of

    Part I, of the Philosophical Transactions for the present
       (p. 99) I mentioned having often seen a muscular
<U+017F>ºbril becoming a fasciculus;    and gave delineations of fibrils
undergoing this change.      I happen    to have just made a pre
paration in which the transition is remarkably well seen, and
have sketched it (chiefly in outline) in the accompanying figure.
At A, the young fasciculus still exhibits the double spiral;
while at B, it is so far advanced as to present the usual trans
verse striae.  Here the striae are too minute for examination.
The preparation is from muscle of a fish. In the fasciculus
C   (from the Turtle),      the
transverse striae are obviously

    LXIV.          On the Preparation of Artificial Yeast.                                By GeoRGE

        often becomes a matter of great practical importance to
            it in our power to excite the vinous fermentation under
    circumstances in which ordinary yeast cannot be obtained. In
    making bread, for example, although the use of yeast may be
    avoided by employing what is called “leaven,” or dough
    which has already become sour and partly putrefied by spon
    taneous change—a practice which has been followed from the
    most remote antiquity, and is still occasionally in use—the
    bread so made is always to be distinguished by a peculiar sour
    and nauseous taste and smell, and can never bear comparison
    with that fermented by yeast.
        The object of the present notice is to point out a method
    by which yeast of the most unexceptionable quality can be
    artificially produced at will. I am aware that some substitute
    for ordinary ferment in brewing has long been known to cer
    tain persons, who go about the country and impart their secret
     to those who are willing to purchase                           it:

Boutron and Frémy on the formation of lactic acid, serves to
solve this difficulty, as it will doubtless many others of far
greater magnitude and importance.         It has been shown that
“the kind of chemical     change  going on in the decomposing azo
tized  body  or ferment,   determines the kind of decomposition
which shall occur in the neutral ternary substance, subject to
its  influence;” that diastase, for example, according                                              to      its
peculiar condition, whether fresh from the germinated grain,

                     causing the conversion          sugar into lactic of

      Inone   experiment    the following materials were used:—a

ciently cooled, the ferment added. The results of the experi
ment were, a quantity of beer, not very strong, it is true, but
quite free from any unpleasant taste, and at least a pint of
thick barm, which proved perfectly good for making bread.
   It appears to me that this simple plan would enable distant
residents in the country, and settlers in the colonies, to enjoy
the luxury of good bread when a little malt could be got—
a very easy home manufacture from grain of any kind: the
hops might probably be omitted when the yeast alone was the
object.
  ".  moderately strong infusion of malt which has not been
boiled, suffered to stand in a warm place for some days,
speedily becomes sour and turbid, and begins to evolve gas;
this change rapidly progresses, carbonic acid is given out
plentifully, and a deposit of thick insoluble whitish matter
formed, which readily excites fermentation in a dilute solution
of sugar; the supernatant liquid contains alcohol, acetic acid,
and, I believe, lactic acid.
   When wort which has been boiled and hopped is set aside
to decompose spontaneously, the change it undergoes appears
to depend very much upon                    its
                                        strength.    When weak, three

of wheaten dough, that an acid state preceded that in which
it became an alcoholic ferment; and if in this condition it be
mixed with a dilute solution of common sugar, and the whole
kept warm for several days, it furnishes a sour liquid which is
rich in lactic acid, and from which white crystallized lactate
of zinc is easily prepared. There is a tendency in the liquid
to run into the alcoholic fermentation, and to produce vinegar
by a subsequent change, but still the quantity of lactic acid so

This    salt steppe is distinguished from many of those which are
   interposed between the Ouralsk and the Volga or are situated
on the Siberian side of the Ural Mountains, by consisting not of
an uniform flat resembling the bed of a dried-up sea, but of wide
undulations and distantly separated low ridges; nevertheless it                                           is,

360             Sir John Herschel on                       the Phaenomena           of    the
i.e. the difference of temperature) is greatest, the reverse process
is going on. Caves in moderately free communication with the air
 are dry and (to the feelings) warm in winter, wet or damp and cold
 in summer. And from the general course of this law I do not con
 sider even your Orenburg caves exempt, since however apparently
 arid the external air at 120°Fahr. may be, the moisture in it may
 yet be in excess and tending to deposition, when the same air is
 cooled down to many degrees beneath the freezing point.
    “The data wanting in the case of your Orenburg cave are the
 mean temperature of every month in the year of the air, and of ther
mometers buried say a foot deep, on two or three points of the sur
                                        I
 face of the hill, which if understand you right is of gypsum and of
 small elevation.       I do not remember the winter temperature of
 Orenburg, but for Catherinenburg (only 5° north of Orenburg),
 the temperatures are given in Kuppfer's reports of the returns from
 the Russian magnetic observatories.                             If
                                                  anything similar obtains at
 Orenburg I see no difficulty in explaining your phaenomenon.              Re
jecting diurnal fluctuations and confining ourselves to a single sum
mer wave of heat propagated downwards alternately with a single
 winter wave of cold, every point at the interior of an insulated hill
rising above the level plain will be invaded by these waves in suc
cession (converging towards the centre in the form of shells similar
to the external surface), at times which will deviate further from
mid-winter and mid-summer the deeper the point is in the interior,
so that at certain depths in the interior, the cold-wave will arrive at
mid-summer and the heat-wave in mid-winter.               A cave (if not very
 wide-mouthed and very airy) penetrating to such a point will have
 its its                                         be by
     temperature determined             that                    of

                                             alternately heated and cooled.
As the south side          the hill    sunned and the north not, the sum
                                                 is

fore that this is the true explanation of your phaenomenon.
     “I should observe, that in the recorded observations of the Ca
therinenburg observatory, the temperatures are observed two-hourly,
from eight A.M. to ten P.M., and not at night.    The mean monthly
temperatures are thence concluded by a formula which I am not
very well satisfied with; but the error, if any, so introduced must
be far too trifling to affect this argument.   The works whence the
above data are obtained are, ‘Observations Météorologiques et
Magnétiques faites dans l’intérieur de l'Empire de Russie,” and
“Annuaire Magnétique et Météorologique du Corps des Ingénieurs
des Mines de Russie,' works which we owe to the munificence of
the Russian government, and which it is satisfactory to find thus
early affording proofs of utility to science in explaining what cer
tainly might be regarded as a somewhat puzzling phaenomenon,
as it is one highly worthy of being further studied and being
made the subject of exact thermometric researches on the spot, and
wherever else anything similar occurs.”
   Sir John Herschel then states, that since he began this letter he
had examined some old documents and found the paper which ac
companied his letter. “The date of this manuscript,” he adds, “as
nearly as I can collect it from collateral circumstances, must have
been somewhere about the year 1829, or rather before than after.

    a visit to the glacier of Chamouni in the summer of 1821, I was
IN struck  with the very remarkable positions of several large blocks
of granite resting on the glacier in various parts. They were perched
on stools of ice of less diameter than the blocks themselves, which
overhang their supports on            sides,           all

Dec. 1,
  1841.  A    paper was first read, entitled, “Report of the Destruc
                tion by Earthquake of the Town of Praya de Victoria,
on the 15th of June, 1841.”      By Mr. Consul Hunt; communicated
by direction of the Right Hon. the Foreign Secretary of State.
   The town of Praya stood at the east end of the island of Terceira,
and contained 562 houses; near it were the villages of Lageas (523
houses), Villa Nova (206 houses), Agoalva (244 houses), Fontinha
(203 houses), and Fonte do Bastardo (144 houses), the total popula
tion being about 9000 souls. The town of Praya had been on a
former occasion (1614) totally destroyed by an earthquake, and
Angra, the capital of the island, situated twelve English miles
distant, was considerably injured, the shocks being severely felt
in the island of St. Michael.        Although menaced during many
earthquakes, Praya had escaped injury from that time till the 12th
of June 1841, when, at 4 P.M., a violent shock was felt, and with
diminished force to the westward.         At twenty-five minutes past
five, a second, more powerful shock was experienced, and through
out the 13th of June, tremblings were felt at short intervals.       At
4 A.M. on the 14th a perfectly perceptible undulation destroyed all
those buildings which had been previously weakened, but during the
remainder of that day the island was visited by only occasional slight
shocks. On the 15th, at 3 A.M., violent tremblings and horizontal
undulations of the ground commenced, and continued, with intervals
of ten minutes, and a duration of about 10 seconds, until 30 minutes
past 3 o'clock, when a strong, vibrating and distinctly visible rocking
motion was communicated to the surface, and threw down the un
destroyed portion of Praya, several churches and houses of the adja
cent villages, and considerably injured the remainder, as well as
many elevated public buildings in other parts of the island.       The
ground then remained comparatively at rest until 40 minutes past 2
A.M. on the 16th, when a violent earthquake did further damage;
but from that period no additional injury was sustained, though the
island did not resume a permanently quiescent state till the 26th of
June. The number of houses thrown down is estimated to be 800,
but   several others must be rebuilt, and of the remainder the greater
 number require extensive repairs.
    During the whole of these earthquakes the motion was greatest at
 Praya, diminishing in force to the westward, and every convulsion
 was preceded by a loud subterranean or submarine noise to the east
 ward of Terceira, which so exactly varied in intensity with the force
 of the succeeding shocks, that the noise became not only the harbinger
 but the measure of the severity of the earthquake. A rent an English
 mile in length was formed in the ground, extending from the shore
 to the westward.
    The less severe shocks were not felt beyond Terceira: others were

366         Geological Society:      the Rev.          R. Everest's
experienced, of apparently equal force, at St. George's, about fifty
miles to the south-west, and at Graciosa, about the same distance to
the north-west of Praya; but only the earthquake which destroyed
that town was felt, though not powerfully, at the capitals of Pico,
sixty-eight miles south-west, and of St. Michael's, the same distance
to the south-east.  At Fayal, eighty-five miles west by south, and at
the eastern end of St. Michael's, 105 miles south-east by east, no mo
tion was  perceived, as far as Mr. Consul Hunt had been able to ascer
tain.  If the shocks felt about 30 minutes past 3 o'clock on the
morning of the 15th of June, in the several islands, be divided into
four degrees of intensity, each interval, the author says, will be
found to contain a distance of about seventeen miles, the eastern
end of Terceira being on the first degree, or seventeen miles from
 the centre of eruption; the western end thirty-four miles; Graciosa
and St. George's fifty-one, and the capitals of Pico and St. Michael's
 sixty-eight miles. The latter places, equally distant from the centre
 of eruption, experienced shocks of equal degrees of diminished
 force.
     Mr. Consul Hunt then alludes to Buffon's notice of submarine ex
 plosions between St. Michael's and Terceira, attended by earthquakes
 in those islands, and the appearance of newly formed islets; also to
 the throwing up of Sabrina, near St. Michael's, in 1811*, the effects
 of which were powerfully felt in that island, but not in Terceira,
 fifty miles distant; and, on account of these phaenomena, he, in
 conclusion, advises mariners to keep a sharp look-out for shoal water
 on approaching Terceira from the eastward.
     A paper, entitled “Some Geological Remarks made in a Journey
from Delhi, through the Himalaya Mountains, to the frontier of
Little Thibet, during 1837,” by the Rev. Robert Everest, F.G.S.,
was then read.
    The author's route, after quitting Delhi, lay through Seharun
pore, the Keeree pass in the Sevalik hills, and Mussoori to the Jumna,
thence nearly north-west to the valley of the Paber, as far as Roo
roo, where it quitted the course of that river and crossed the moun
 tain range to Rampore.     It then ascended the valley of the Sutluj
to the Leo    River, and terminated near the Khealkhur Fort, on the
frontier of Little Thibet. The country consists of alluvial deposits,
the tertiary strata of the Sevaliks, a vast sandstone deposit, an ex
tensive clay-slate formation containing limestone and sandstone,
various metamorphic rocks, greenstone and granite.
    Delhi is situated on the most northern promontory of an extensive
sandstone formation, which stretches many miles in a south-west and
south-east direction, following the course of the Jumna, and re
sembles, in mineral characters, the transition quartzose sandstones
of Europe. It alternates, though rarely, with layers of soft talc slate,
and a few miles to the southward of Delhi with clay slate. To the
south-west, a little beyond Goongony, and in other localities, sienitic

           Geological Remarks made in a Journey in India.                   367
rocks are connected with it.         No fossil remains have been discovered
in the formation.       At Delhi- the strata are highly inclined towards
the east-south-east.
    From Delhi to beyond Seharunpore, a distance of more than 100
miles, the surface of the country consists of a fine sandy soil, and
contains nodules of kunkur, similar to alluvial granitic or primary
detritus brought down by the Jumna.                 Beyond Seharunpore the
tertiary beds of the Sevalik range commence; but Mr. Everest alludes
to their mammalian remains only for the purpose of remarking, that
no portions of the wild elephant, which now abounds in that district,
have been found in the tertiary strata; and he quotes, as an analo
gous case, the absence of the bones of the Asiatic elephant in the
mammalian deposits of the Irawaddi.               From these facts he infers
that the present species did not co-exist with the Elephas primige
nius, the mastodon, or the associated mammifers.
    The chain of the Himalayas, which rises like a black wall on the
opposite of the valley of the Dhoon, or that which separates it from.
the Sevalik hills, consists, where crossed by the author (about 77°
55' E. long.), of strata highly inclined to the north-east, and com
posed of dark blue or variegated clay slate, sometimes sufficiently
hard to be used for roofing slates, but generally soft, of compact,
dark blue and black carbonaceous limestone, and of highly conso
lidated quartzy sandstone resembling that near Delhi.              No organic
remains have been noticed in these beds.            Dykes of greenstone con
taining diallage were observed by the author.
    From Mussoori" (lat. 30° 25', long. 77° 55' E.), Mr. Everest de
scended to the Jumna, over beds similar to those just described, and
of slate containing angular fragments. In the bed of the river the
strata are very much disturbed.           Beyond the Jumna the rocks con
sist of   purplish  clay  slate,  often  passing  into quartz slate and talc
slate. The      general  dip   is to the  north-east,  but the angle of incli
nation is stated to     vary  from   nearly  horizontal to vertical.   Beyond
the   village of  Luchwarree,      not far from the   Jumna,   occur blocks of
greywacke similar to those observed in the descent to that river.
Thence to the heights of Deobun, the most lofty point between the
Jumna and the Tonse (lat. about 30° 47', long. about 77° 48' E.),
the strata present little variety, but the last 2000 feet of ascent con
sist of rugged, black and grayish blue limestone, similar to that at
Mussoori.       The descent towards the Tonse exhibits slates similar to
those    previously   described, dipping between north and east.          They
 are  occasionally   intersected    by  greenstone   containing  pistacite, and
passing in some places into hornblende slate and serpentine. At the
 village of Kundah, before reaching the Tonse, limestone reappears,
 highly inclined to the north-east, and extends to the bridge. The
 bed of the Tonse, and of its tributary the Paber, are filled with
 boulders of gneiss, and they occur at heights of 200 feet above those
 rivers.    The slate rocks, in ascending the river-valleys, change in
    * The degrees of latitude and longitude given in this abstract must be
 considered only as approximations.

368         Geological Society: the Rev.           R. Everest's
their composition from that previously exhibited; containing, first,
frequently nodules and layers of quartz, and, though rarely, of fel
spar, and afterwards passing into well-defined gneiss; and still fur
ther, as at Raeenghur and Rooroo, different varieties of gneiss alter
nate with talc-slate, quartzose slate and mica slate. This progress
ive change, from the party-coloured earthy slates of Mussoori to
crystalline schists, on approaching the higher ranges of mountains
covered with perpetual snow, perfectly accords, Mr. Everest states,
with what he had previously observed in two journeys to the sources
of the Ganges and the Jumna. The dip of the beds in the valleys of
 the Tonse and Paber is to the north-east.
    At Rooroo Mr. Everest quitted the course of the Paber and
 crossed the mountain range to the valley of the Sutluj.         The highest
 point which he attained on this ridge was only 8000 feet above the
 level of the sea, and it was then, the middle of April, nearly free from
 snow.     From the view which this pass afforded, the author ascer
 tained that the country shelves or declines from the north-east to the
 south-west, the mountains between the north and east rising far above
 the limits of forests and being white with snow, while among those
 to the westward or southward few peaks appeared above the range
 of forests, and little snow was seen. The rocks composing this moun
 tain range consist near Rooroo of mica slate, with a very slight dip to
 the east and south-east, but the inclination of the beds in ascending
 towards the pass becomes considerable, but in the same direction.
 North of Kersole (lat. 31°25', long. 77° 33' E.) gneiss appears dipping
 south and south-east, and approaching occasionally granite in cha
 racter. This rock ranges half way to the Sutluj, where black, com
 pact limestone, and black, glimmering, soft slate are exposed. Near
 the junction of the Nuggur with the Sutluj, strata of crystalline,
 white quartz slate dip to the south, and are traversed by a mass of
 greenstone, which first rises vertically through the strata, then passes
 horizontally between them, and finally bursts upwards and projects
 above the surface. Where the position of the greenstone conforms to
 the bedding of the slate, the laminae of mica and hornblende assume
 a similar arrangement, and where the greenstone intersects the slate,
 those minerals have a position vertical to    it.   A gradual passage from
 greenstone into the quartz slate was likewise noticed         by the author.
 About two miles below         Rampore     (lat. 31°   34', long.   77° 30'),
in   the  valleyof    the Sutluj,   quartz  slate alternates with chlorite
 slate and talc slate, the dip being    to                               at
                                             the west and south-west     a
 considerable angle. Above Rampore the rocks first consist          of  alter
 nations of   white quartz slate and clay slate, the strata being much
 disturbed; and afterwards     of talc slate associated with greenstone   or
 hornblenderock, dipping north-east.         Before reaching Seran, gneiss
 containing kyanite appears, and extends with occasionally interve
 ning masses   of   granite to  Nasher (lat. 31°47', long. 77° 46' E.).
 On the opposite side     of  the river  at   that place are precipices   of
 slate traversed    by white veins; but   at    the bridge,a   large-grained
 white granite with tourmalines appears, and extends,          in  connexion
 with mica slate and gneiss intersected       by  granite veins, seven days'

         Geological Remarks made in a Journey           in India.      369
journey to Akbah (lat. 31° 56', long. 78° 8' E.).          At this village
granite also occurs, but separated from that rock by a narrow
ravine is a low promontory of clay slate and dark flinty slate dip
ping to the north. Beyond Akbah the Sutluj bends to the north,
and on both sides of the river the outline of the rocks is considerably
softened in consequence of their being evidently composed of perish
 able clay slate similar to that at Mussoori; but in the more distant
ranges, granite, mica slate and gneiss may be detected by the rugged
outline and the great height of the rocks. This clay slate, Mr.
 Everest says, is not of later origin than the granite and crystalline
schists, because it is penetrated by veins of granite which may be
traced to the great masses of that formation.       The dip of the slate
on one side of the river is  west, and on the  opposite  apparently east.
Beyond Lipi, a few miles from Akbah, are precipices of clay slate,
talc slate, and dark flinty slate interstratified with greenstone.
After quitting Khanum the country becomes still more desolate, and
the strata consist, first of earthy slate, in some places carbonaceous,
in others brecciated, then of greyish green highly consolidated green
stone, and afterwards of masses of blackish and brownish grey com
pact limestone. The valley of the Namkulling, a small tributary of
the Sutluj, presents a fine section of these strata, the upper part
being composed of the limestone and the lower of the slate. The
dip from Khanum is between west and south-west.            From Seenum
(lat. 32°5', long. 78° 16' E.) Mr. Everest proceeded across the Hun
gung pass, 14,837 feet above the sea. The ground being covered with
snow, little of the structure of the country was visible, but projecting
strata of reddish brown compact limestone appeared on the crest of
the hill. The view northward presented bare rocks as far as the eye
could reach, but from the softness of the outlines, Mr. Everest infers,
that the strata belong to secondary or tertiary deposits.         Rugged
ridges of primary rocks resembling dykes cross this dreary expanse.
Beyond Hango (lat. 32°12', long. 38° 18' E.) beds of reddish and
greenish grey compact limestone alternate with earthy and car
bonaceous shale, the dip being to the north-west, and blocks of
greyish quartzose sandstone are scattered over the surface. These
appearances extend to the heights above Leo, where the earthy shales
are traversed by veins and layers of granite, and at the point of
contact are changed into mica slate.      In the descent to the village,
nearly 2000 feet, the granite veins gradually increase in number, pre
dominating in the lower parts; and the associated rocks become more
and more crystalline, so that near the river nothing is visible but
mica slate, gneiss, quartz slate and granular limestone, the strata
dipping to the south-west. Beyond Leo (lat. 32° 18', long. 78° 17' E.)
the road ascends over granite and dark mica slate, containing kyanite
and pistacite; but the earthy strata are stated to occur at higher levels.
On the opposite side of the river is a section several thousand feet in
vertical dimensions intersected by a net-work of granite veins and

opening on the hollow in which the village of Change is situated

370              Geological Society: Prof. Owen's Description
Everest's journey, and he was prevented from examining the locality
which produces the Ammonites and other fossils obtained by Dr.
Gerard; but he believes, from the information supplied by the natives,
that they are met with abundantly beyond the frontier, imbedded
in black compact limestone and earthy carbonaceous shale. Mr.
Everest further states, that since his journey Captain Hutton has
discovered them within the frontier.
    In the course of the memoir the author mentions having seen at
Seenum the skin of a “leopard ” recently killed near the village,
though large quantities of snow were then (May) lying upon the
ground, and that he has frequently observed in February and March
their tracks on the snow as high as the limit of the forests. He
also states that he has observed monkeys at the height of full 8000
feet above the sea in the same months when the ground was co
vered deep with snow, feeding in great numbers on the seeds of the
fir cones.
   A paper was afterwards read containing a “Description of the Re
mains of Six Species of Marine Turtles (Chelones) from the London
Clay of Sheppey and Harwich.”        By Richard Owen, Esq., F.R.S.,
F.G.S., Hunterian Professor in the Royal College of Surgeons.
   The author commences by quoting the generalizations given in
the latest works which treat of Fossil Chelonians, and examines the
evidence on which those from the Eocene clay of Sheppey had been
referred exclusively to the freshwater genus Emys by Cuvier and
others, and he points out the circumstances which invalidate the
conclusions that had been deduced from          He then proceeds    it.                             to

and for the remaining fourth with the temporal or zygomatic ele

   These proportions are reversed in the Emys expansa, in which the
similarly expanded plate of the parietals is chiefly united laterally
with the temporal bones. In other freshwater tortoises the parietal
plate in question does not exist.
   The same evidence of the affinity of the Sheppey Chelonite in
question to the marine turtles is afforded by the base of the skull:—
the basi-occipital is deeply excavated; the processes of the pterygoids
which extend to the tympanic pedicies are hollowed out lengthwise;
the palatal processes of the superior maxillary and palatine bones are
continued backwards to the extent which characterizes the existing
Cheloniae; and the posterior or internal opening of the nasal passages

                              of
in  existing Cheloniae, yet presents                        all
                                               the essential characters          that                    of
genus. There              central vacuity left between the hyosternals and
                          is   a
hyposternals; but these bones differ from those                   the young Emys of
in   the long pointed processes which radiate from the two anterior

372             Geological Society: Prof. Owen's Description
angles of the hyosternals, and the two posterior angles of the hy
posternals.
   The xiphisternals have the slender elongated form and oblique
union by reciprocal gomphosis with the hyposternals, which is cha
racteristic of the genus Chelone.
    The posterior extremity of the right episternal presents the equally
characteristic slender pointed form.
    With these proofs of the sternum of the present fossil being modi
fied according to the peculiar type of the marine Chelones, there is
evidence, however, that it differs from the known existing species in
the more extensive ossification of the component pieces: thus, the
pointed rays of bone extend from a greater proportion of the margins
of the hyo- and hyposternals, and the intervening margins do not
present the straight line at right angles to the radiated processes.
    In the Chelone Mydas, for example, one half of the external margin
of the hyo- and hyposternals, where they are contiguous, are straight,
and intervene between the radiated processes, which are developed
from the remaining halves; while in the Chelone breviceps about a
sixth part only of the corresponding external margins are similarly
free, and there form the bottom, not of an angular, but a semicircular
interspace.
    The radiated processes from the inner margins of the hyo- and hy
posternals are characterized in the Chelone breviceps by similar mo
 difications, but their origin is rather less extensive; they terminate
 in eight or nine rays, shorter and with intervening angles more equal
 than in existing Chelones. The xiphisternal piece receives in a notch
 the outermost ray or spine of the inner radiated process of the hy
posternal, as in the Chelones, and is not joined by a transverse
 suture, as in the Emydes, whether young or old.
    The characters thus afforded by the cranium, carapace, plastron,
 and some of the bones of the extremity, prove the present Sheppey
 fossil to belong to a true sea-turtle; and at the same time most
 clearly establish        distinction from the known existing species
                            its                                                          of

they lead to conclusions of much greater interest than the previous
opinions respecting the Chelonites of the London basin could have
originated. Whilst these were supposed to have belonged to a fresh
water genus, the difference between the present fauna and that of
the Eocene period, in reference to the Chelonian order, was not very
great; since the Emys or Cistudo Europaea still abounds on the Con
tinent, and lives long in our own island in suitable localities: but
the case assumes a very different aspect when we come to the con
viction, that the majority of the Sheppey Chelonites belong to the
true marine genus Chelone; and that the number of species of the
Eocene extinct turtles already obtained from so limited a space as
the isle of Sheppey exceeds that of the species of existing Chelone.
   Notwithstanding the assiduous search of naturalists, and the attrac
tions to the commercial voyager which the shell and the flesh of the
turtles offer,     all
                 the tropical seas     the world have hitherto yielded
                                                          of
 no more than five well-defined species     Chelone, and     these only

  It  is obvious, therefore, that the ancient ocean        the Eocene epoch       of
was less    sparingly inhabited       turtles;      by
                                               and that these presented                                          a
greater variety       specific modifications than are known
                        of                                           the seas                     in

   Extract from a letter from Wm. H. Miller, Esq., Professor of                   Mi
neralogy in the University of Cambridge.
   “I   regret that my engagements in Cambridge have prevented my
being present at the meeting of the Chemical Society, especially as
I was desirous of offering my services in determining the form of any
crystalline products that may present themselves to chemists who
are engaged in original researches.               Also, in return, I might make
bold to ask some members of the              Society      to supply me with certain
objects of crystallographic and optical research from their laborato
ries.”
   “On the Analysis of the Chalk of the Brighton Cliffs,” by Dr.
Edw. G. Schweitzer.
   My attention was directed to the soil of this neighbourhood, for
the purpose of ascertaining if the chalk contains any ingredient pe
culiarly favourable to the growth of Gramineae, in consequence of
the well-known fact, that the herbage of the South Downs, along
the coast of Sussex, affords a superior food for cattle, producing meat
of excellent quality, for which these Downs are justly celebrated.
The result of my analysis substantiates the presence of phosphate of
lime, an ingredient valuable for the nutrition of plants. The chalk
is composed of the following substances in 100 parts:—
                 Carbonate of lime . . . . . . . .             98°57
                  ... ...      of magnesia....                  0'38
                 Phosphate of lime          ........            0-11
                 Protoxide of iron          ........            0.08
                  -- - --  - of manganese....                   0'06
                 Alumina. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         0- 16
                 Silica . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     0-64
                                                                        100'00
    To ascertain the quantity of phosphoric acid,                     I  followed Dr.
 Schulze's method (Journal für prakt. Chemie, xxi. S. 387–389),
 which he recommends           for the analytical investigation of soils.
 Finding it useful and correct, I subjoin an extract from his treatise.
 The process is based upon the fact, that phosphate of lime and
 phosphate of magnesia are soluble in acetic acid, while the phos
 phate of peroxide of iron and phosphate of alumina are not so.

This being the      case, the soil or mineral is to be treated with hydro
chloric   acid,  and the iron which the solution contains per-oxidised,
the    phosphate     of protoxide of iron being soluble in acetic acid.
Should the muriatic solution contain more phosphoric acid than
oxide of iron or alumina, (which seldom is the case, as the latter are
usually predominant,) peroxide of iron or alumina is to be added,
the solution must also be freed from every trace of silica. The
earthy muriates are precipitated with ammonia, after which acetic
acid is added, and the whole gently digested. The precipitate will
dissolve again, with the exception of the phosphates of peroxide of
iron and alumina. When both these ingredients enter into the pre
cipitate, caustic potassa will give the means of ascertaining their
respective quantities.
    The solubility of the phosphate of protoxide of iron, and the inso
lubility of the phosphate of peroxide of iron in acetic acid, when
freshly precipitated, give an excellent method to separate quantita
tively these two degrees of oxidation. The manipulation is obvious.
    The discovery by Professor Ehrenberg, that the Brighton chalk
consists of microscopic shells, is a decided proof of              animal origin,     its

made of it:-8-2 grains, previously dried at a temperature of boiling
water, were submitted to along-continued red heat in a small green
glass tube, to which a chloride of calcium tube was attached; it
lost 1-0 grain, which corresponded with the weight gained by the
absorption tube; 8.2 grains dissolved in dilute nitric acid, and pre
cipitated while boiling by caustic potash, gave, after the necessary
treatment, 4.5 grains of the red oxide of manganese; the solution
was then acidified by sulphuric acid, and evaporated to dryness to
expel the nitric acid, redissolved, deoxidized by alcohol and the
oxide of chromium thrown down by ammonia, again evaporated to
dryness, to avoid the possibility of any of the oxide being in solu
tion, and the oxide of chromium, well washed, gave 2.3 grains. We

  may be again dissolved in hot water, a little chlorine passed, the
  solution supersaturated with carbonate of soda, digested with animal
  charcoal, and once more decomposed by an acid.
      It is to be observed, that hippuric acid only crystallizes in a
  distinct and characteristic manner when pure, or at least when in
  a condition approaching that state; under other circumstances it
  usually separates either as short radiated needles, or as a granular

by putrefaction.   It  is astonishing that a substance which so pow
erfully resists the action of chlorine, should be so easily affected by
simple contact with putrefying matter.
   A glance at the composition of hippuric acid will show that this
change is altogether different from that which urea suffers under
similar circumstances, the assimilation, namely, of the elements of
water by which it becomes carbonate of ammonia.         Hippuric acid,
on the contrary, seems to pass into benzoic by an absorption of
oxygen from the air, carbonic acid and ammonia being at the same
time produced.

    May 3.-The following communication was made         :-
    “On a curious Formation of Prussian Blue,” by Robert Por
rett, Esq.
    Mr. Porrett was led to attend to this subject by an observation
accidentally made while walking in the garden of a friend.        He
found that a great number of the pebbles in the gravel walk were
tinged of a fine bright blue colour; and on remarking the appear
ance to the owner, and inquiring as to the cause, though it had
never before attracted notice, he ascertained that before the fresh
gravel had been laid down, the walks had been strewed with some
refuse lime from the gas-works, for the purpose of destroying the
worms, and over which the red gravel of the neighbourhood of
London had been placed only a few weeks before the appearances
described were observed.
    The blue colour was entirely confined to the upper surface of the
pebbles which was exposed to the atmospheric air, and was found to
be Prussian blue. The pebbles affected were siliceous, having a
white exterior coating.     Mr. Porrett considers this production of
 Prussian blue to have arisen from some of the gas-lime having been
 dropped accidentally on the surface of the new gravel, and that the
 peroxide of iron there found had been deoxidized by some of the
 sulphur compounds contained in the gas-lime, giving rise to the
 formation of a combination of iron with cyanogen, also present in
 the lime, and calcium, and that this compound had been decomposed
 by the action of the carbonic acid of the atmosphere, or by the
 siliceous matter of the stone, and thus causing the formation of the
 Prussian blue”.

                      There are two stop-cocks. The
horizontal one g is for admitting the supply of gas,
which passes up the fixed tube pp into the sliding tube
m m.   Between the outer fixed tube t t and the inner
fixed tube pp, water is contained to serve as a lute to
confine the gas. The sliding tube is kept at whatever                                   tit,
height it may be placed, by means of a spring inserted
in a stuffing-box formed by the screw ss above                       ff.
The spring is represented apart, r. It is formed out                           ,
of  a short bit of another metallic tube of such bore as *
only to permit the tube m m to slide through it easily. , i.
Four holes in the circle of the wider tube r are bored jº
at equal distances, and a vertical slit is cut by a saw                       t
from each hole through to the bottom of the tube.
After being thus cut, the cut parts are squeezed to
gether by the hand, and the tube r being put over
the tube m and confined in the stuffing-box at s, forms
a convenient spring for keeping the sliding tube m at
whatever height it may be placed. The stop-cock w
is to let out any water that may by accident get into
the tube pp. The tube mm should not be less than
half an inch in diameter. The burner b, which is                 |
copied after one in Professor Graham's laboratory, Uni
versity College, burns after the manner of a rose
burner, but it is in the form of a ring, instead of
being solid. It may be called a ring-burner.          It per

the sole constituents of the substance are phosphoric acid, peroxide
of uranium, oxide of copper, lime and water, a known weight was
dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and copper was precipitated as sul
phuret by transmitting sulphuretted hydrogen gas through the solu
tion. The precipitated sulphuret, when filtered and washed, was
digested in nitric acid, and from the solution thus obtained, oxide of
copper was precipitated by potash, washed, ignited and weighed.
   (2.) The solution, separated by filtration from the sulphuret of
copper, was next evaporated to dryness and mixed with a little con
centrated sulphuric acid to convert phosphate of lime into sulphate,
the mixture was diluted with alcohol, in which sulphate of lime is
quite insoluble, and filtered. The sulphate of lime was washed with
alcohol, dried, ignited and weighed.
   (3.) The filtered alcoholic solution, containing phosphate of ura
nium dissolved in the excess of sulphuric acid, was evaporated to
dryness, the residue digested in nitric acid, and phosphate of ura
nium precipitated from the acid solution by ammonia. This, when
washed and dried, was gently ignited and weighed.
   (4.) The water contained in the substance was determined by ob
serving what loss in weight it sustained when calcined at a dull red
heat; and
   (5.) The remaining ingredient, the phosphoric acid in combina
tion with oxide of copper and lime, was considered as the deficiency
on the weight of the original substance.

   Having had it in contemplation some time since to investigate by

loric of elasticity of the vapours of several liquids, I found myself

      When the corresponding numbers in the three columns are com
   pared, it will be at once observed, that the values of f, investigated
   by the method just explained, are somewhat less than those extracted
   from the table I have been hitherto in the habit of using; but that
   they are considerably greater than the values of Kämtz, the differ
   ences being generally better than twice as great in the latter        in
   stance as in the former.     This will be more manifest by taking a
   mean of the different results in column 2, and comparing it with the
   force of vapour corresponding to the same temperature as given in
   the two other tables. Now, the mean of the temperatures is 61°63,
   the quotient got by dividing their sum by twenty.        But the corre
   sponding mean value of f, in column 2, must be differently calcu         ~
  lated, seeing that the temperature and the corresponding tensions of
   the vapour augment at a very different rate.         For temperatures,
   in fact, in arithmetic progression, the corresponding tensions are in
  geometric progression, and, although this is well known to be but an
  approximate law, it may be considered as rigorously true for the limit
  ed range of temperature within which my experiments have been made.
  To calculate, therefore, the mean force of vapour, as deducible from
  the numbers in column 2, and which must correspond to the tempe
  rature 61°63, it is only necessary to add together the logarithms of
  the numbers in this column, and divide their sum by twenty, and
  the quotient will be the logarithm of the mean.      When this process
  is gone through, the mean logarithm is found to be 73699, and the
  corresponding number 54575.           The following, therefore, are the
  tensions of   aqueous  vapour  at   61°63, as deduced from my experi
  ments, and as extracted from the tables of Dalton and Kämtz.

  Difference between Dalton's number and that of Kämtz         = +   0.174.
     It thus appears, that the result at which I have arrived is some
 what    less than the Daltonian number, but considerably greater than
  that given by Kämtz; and that, therefore, my experiments, as far
 as they have been discussed, give at least a prima facie countenance
 to the opinion, that the values of the elastic force of aqueous vapour,
 as given by the latter philosopher, are, at and about 61°63, below
                                    -
 the truth.
     Before, however, this conclusion can be considered as fully esta
 blished, and before we can judge correctly of the amount of the
 errors by which his table is affected, it will be necessary to inquire
 whether the thermometer I have employed be a true one.               This
 essential inquiry I have been enabled to institute by my friend Pro
 fessor Lloyd, who has put into my possession, for the purpose, a
 thermometer given him by Professor John Phillips, together with a
table of differences between it and the standard thermometer belong
ing to the Royal Society. Upon a comparison of the two instru
ments, I find, that at and about 60°, the thermometer I have em
ployed stands 6 of a degree higher than that lent me by Professor
Lloyd, while the latter stands 3 of a degree higher than the standard
in possession of the Royal Society; so that the indications of my

instrument are at 60°-9-10ths of a degree higher than the truth.
If such be the case, 5457, instead of being the force of vapour at
61°63, is the force at 61-63                             –
                                    0.9 = 60°73; and to compare the
result of  my  experiments    with the tables of Dalton and Kämtz, it
is only  necessary  to extract from these the values of the force of
vapour corresponding to the temperature 60°73.

   The supposition of a uniform change can, however, be regarded as
an approximation to the truth, only when the interval of time be
tween the first and last reading is very small, in comparison with the
interval between the successive maxima and minima, in the fluctua
tions of the irregular movement. Hence, we may conclude, that it is
important, in the first place, to employ three readings in preference
to any greater number; and, secondly, that it is desirable that the
time of vibration of the magnet itself should be as small as possible,

  shanks.
      Mr. Snow's observations admitted of being so grouped as to fur
  nish four sets of comparisons in right ascension and five sets in de
  clination.   The effects of parallax and refraction were computed by
  the formulae used at Greenwich (Greenwich Observations, 1836,
  pages lxiv. and lxv.). The right ascension of the star was taken
  from Lord Wrottesley's Catalogue, the declination from the Astro
  nomical Society's Catalogue, and the semidiameter of Venus from
  Mr. Snow's Observations; and thus the right ascension and declina.
  tion of the planet were obtained for the Ashurst sidereal times of
  observation and compared with the places interpolated from the
  Nautical Almanac for the same times. The resulting corrections to
  be applied to the right ascensions and declinations of the Nautical
  Almanac are as follow      :-

     The mean epoch is about 8" 30" Greenwich mean solar time.
     The author remarks generally with respect to the treatment of
 such observations, that they may be boldly grouped without sensible
 error, so as to make one reduction serve for a considerable number
 of observations; and that to ensure the greatest facility for group
 ing, the observations of one element (if both cannot be made simul
 taneously) should be repeated several times as rapidly as possible
 alternately with similar sets of observations of the other element.
     With respect to the value of such observations, the results above
 given will show that an equatoreal, when thus used, is no mean rival
 to meridian instruments.       The star can be subsequently determined
 with any required degree of accuracy, and the observations can be
 made with as great freedom from constant error with an equatoreal
as in the meridian.       In this latter respect, indeed, the power of re
petition gives to the equatoreal a great superiority, and may be made
 to counterbalance the disadvantages arising from want of steadiness.
 The last-named quality can, however, in most instances, be obtained
in as great a degree as is requisite. The hour-circle being firmly
 clamped, if the instrument be well balanced, sudden changes can
 arise only from careless handling.
    The supposed uncertainty and instability of the adjustments are
probably the principal obstacle to the free use of equatoreals in En
gland; but the author considers that most equatoreals can be ad
justed very nearly, and that when ordinary care has been taken, the
position remains sufficiently permanent; and it is certain that when
rationally used, the effect of any unavoidable derangement is so nearly
annihilated as to be quite insensible.         The difficulty of performing

 400                 Royal Astronomical Society.
 the adjustments of an equatorealis very trifling, if it be methodically
 undertaken, and the residual errors much smaller than would at first
 sight seem possible. With well-turned collars and pivots an error
 of half a minute, arising from flexure or other causes, must be looked
 upon as an impossible quantity, in which case the differential effects
 upon objects in the zodiac might be disregarded. With respect to
methods of observing, the author recommends that the telescope be
 moved in declination like a transit, in order that the star and planet
 may pass over the same part of the wire.       In this case reliance is
placed only on the adjustment of the cross-axis; but when the de
 clination is not changed, it is presumed that the position of the wire
is correct; and this can be ascertained with only a moderate degree
of certainty. In equatoreals which can be reversed in every position,
 the observations should be made, one group in one position, and the
second in the position reversed.      The best wiring for such observa
 tions, the author considers to consist of three, five, or seven im
 movable wires, at equal distances, and parallel to the meridian,
 transit-wires, in fact, and seven equidistant wires at right angles to
 these, at 5' interval, the plate which carries the latter wires being
 moved by a micrometer-screw.        The advantages of this system are
a saving of time in screwing the micrometer, less wear of the screw,
 and less dependence on it for large intervals.
    Thus far it has been shown, that an equatoreal instrument may
 be made to rival meridian instruments, by the bestowal of a little
 more time and trouble; there are, however, many cases where the
 equatoreal is more convenient, and many where it can, and the
 others cannot be used.
    A planet which comes to the meridian at a late or inconvenient
 hour of the night may be observed several hours earlier with the
 equatoreal.    In so variable a climate as ours, it is not too much to
 say, that the number of good planetary observations might be thus
 very much increased; and if an equatoreal were steadily directed to
 this object in the southern hemisphere, to meet the case where the
planet has considerable south declination, we should soon have the
materials by which the present sufficiency of theory might be satis
 factorily tested.   The superior planets cannot always be observed in
 full daylight   with large meridian instruments, yet equatoreals of
 even a small size might be made to determine their places with great
 accuracy after sunset. Again, large equatoreals, which are now
tolerably abundant, might take charge of the minor planets. Micro
metrical observations only have been taken notice of in the prece
ding remarks, the divided circles of the instrument being considered
only as finders, and for performing the adjustment, though in some
instruments they are large and good enough to be used in differen
tial observations. Still the proper use of the equatoreal is the as
certaining of small differences by means of the micrometer and
time.
    In conducting the observations, the author recommends that there
should be made each night two or three transits of the star of com
parison, and of two other stars, one above and one below it a few

                    Institution of Civil Engineers.                  401
degrees,    the instrument being clamped in right ascension, by which
means it would be made evident whether the derangement of the
adjustment had any sensible effect upon the place of the planet.       It
is the want of observations to accuse derangement which makes the
stars observed as moon-culminators less satisfactory than if they
were more widely spread in declination.
     With respect to observations of the moon, the author mentions
one set, originally suggested by Struve, but never carried into effect.
There are three observations which might be made when a bright
star is occulted by or reappears from under the moon's bright
limb :—
     1. The time of disappearance or reappearance of the star.         -
     2. Micrometrical measures of distance between the star and the
moon's bright limb, the clock-work and the wire micrometer with
 the slipping piece being used.
     [This is the common observation of distance, and might be use
fully applied to the case of a near approach.]
     3. Differences of right ascension between the moon and star, the
 hour-circle being clamped as in ordinary transit observations.
     If the place of the moon be computed from these three observa
 tions, we ought to arrive at the same result; and if we do not, the
 difference between the first and second result arises from the moon's
irradiation, and will give a measure of it; also a difference between
 the second and third results would show some error in the mode of
 taking the transit of the moon's limb, which is at present rather a
 doubtful point in practical astronomy.       If by certain corrections,
 constant either to the observer or the telescope, these results can
 be made to agree in each case, and always the longitude might be
 determined in a shorter period, though with more calculation than
 at present, and a greater certainty be obtained from transits of the
 moon's limb.
     In conclusion, the author hopes that the attention of persons who
 possess good equatoreals may be directed to the planets whenever
 those bodies are favourably situated with respect to an observable
 star. The adjustment is really nothing, and if pairs of stars above
 and below be observed, any error arising from mal-adjustment can
 be ascertained and allowed for. The artist will take care, if warned,
  that the cross-axis shall be at right angles to the polar axis, and the
 reductions, in ordinary cases, are very trifling, especially if by   ju
  dicious grouping one reduction is made to serve for several observa
  tions.

     May 3, 1842.—“Description of the Tunnels, situated between
  Bristol and Bath, on the Great Western Railway, with the methods
  adopted for executing the works.”     By Charles Nixon, Assoc. Inst.
  C.E.
     The works described in this paper comprised a large quantity of
  heavy earth-work in tunnels, &c.; they were commenced in the spring
  of the year 1836, and terminated in the year 1840. The whole of

  the tunnels are 30 feet in height from the line of rails, and 30 feet
  in width; they are curved to a radius of about 120 chains; the
  gradient of that part of the line is four feet per mile. The strata
  through which they were driven consisted generally of hard gray
  sandstone and shale, with the gray and dun shiver, &c.; in a few
  places only, the new red sandstone and red marl were traversed.
  Every precaution was taken for securing the roofs, by lining them
  with masonry where the nature of the strata demanded                          and                                 it,          in

models that had recently been furnished by engineers to the Museum
of CEconomic Geology.
     He then proceeded to remark upon the geological features of the
South-Western Coal-Field near Bristol and Bath, which had been
described by Mr. Conybeare and himself, in the Transactions of the
Geological Society of London (1824).
     Some of the tunnels near Bristol are driven in the Pennant grit
of the coal formation, where it is thrown up at a considerable angle,
and composed of strata yielding slabs and blocks of hard sandstone
used extensively for pavement.
     In traversing such inclined and dislocated strata, the engineer's
attention should, he conceived, be especially directed to the original
joints that intersect the beds nearly at right angles to their planes of
 stratification, and also to the fractures produced during the move
 ments they have undergone.        These natural divisions and partings
 render such inclined stratified rocks unworthy of confidence in the
 roof of any large tunnel, and liable to have masses suddenly de
 tached.
     Inclined strata of a similar sandstone are perforated by many tun
 nels on the railway near Liège, in nearly all of which the roofs are
 supported by brick arches.
      It has been found impossible to make the tunnels through lias
 and red marl without continuous arches of masonry.
      In any of the tunnels which have been carried through strata of
  the great oolite, the parts left unsupported by masonry would, in his
  opinion, be peculiarly liable to danger, because even the most com
 pact beds of oolite are intersected at irregular intervals by loose joints
 at right angles to the planes of the strata, and occasionally by open
 cracks: and it is to be feared that the vibration caused by the rail
  way carriages would tend eventually to loosen and detach these
  masses of stone.
       He apprehended still greater danger would exist in tunnels cut
  through the loosely joined strata of chalk, unless they are lined
  throughout with strong masonry; and even that, in a recent case, had
  been burst through by the weight of the incumbent loose chalk
  coming suddenly upon the arch.
       In open cuttings through chalk,where the numerous interstices and
  the absence of alternating clay-beds prevent any accumulation of
  water, there is little chance of such frequent landslips as occur where
  beds of stone, gravel, or sand rest on beds of clay; but until the side
   walls of chalk are reduced to a slope at which grass will grow, they
   will be subject to continual crumblings and the falling down of small
   fragments, severed by the continual expansion and contraction of the
   chalk, under the destructive force of atmospheric agents, and chiefly
   of frost.
       In open cuttings, where the inclination of the strata is towards the
   line of rails, the slope should be made at a greater angle than if the
   strata incline from the rails; if this be done, fewer landslips will
   occur from accumulations of water between the strata thus inclined
   towards the rails; and such slips may be further guarded against by

 404.                            London Electrical Society.
minute and careful observation of the nature of the individual strata,
and a scientific application of subterranean drains at the contact of
each permeable stratum with a subjacent bed of clay.
   Tunnels can be safely formed without masonry in unstratified
rocks of hard granite, porphyry, trap, &c., and in compact slate
rocks; also in masses of tufa, such as cover Herculaneum, and are
pierced by the grotto of Pausilippo near Naples; but, in his opinion,
wide tunnels driven in stratified rock could not be considered secure
unless they were supported by arches.
   Mr. Sopwith confirmed the remarks on the importance to the
civil engineer of a knowledge of the geological character of the strata
through which tunnels or open cuttings were to be made: the cost
was materially affected, as well as the stability of the works.    The
angle of inclination and the lines of cleavage should be carefully
studied: on one side of a cutting the slope might be left steep, and
all would be firm and dry; whilst on the other, if the same slope
was adopted,          all
                  would appear disintegrated and wet, and series                            a             of
accidents would             be
                    the necessary consequence.  He could not suffi
ciently urge the importance               of
                                  more intimate connexion between

    character of the several   methods is examined, in connexion with
    the  phaenomena  of the human mind. The character of our first prin
    ciples, and the logic of the early theorems of each branch of pure
    mathematics, are proposed by this class of philosophers as the im
    mediate subjects of their investigation. The other class, and that the
    more influential and learned one, proposes to discover the influence
    of methods of research upon the progress of discovery, to classify
    our knowledge according to                                its

practised computer in the Nautical Almanac Office was employed to
read three thousand of the logarithms of numbers and eight degrees
of the trigonometrical portion (all chosen at hazard), and compare
them with tables of undoubted accuracy. The consequence was, the
detection of only three errors, one in the numbers, two in the sines,
&c.; of these three there was only one which an expert user of the
tables could not have detected at sight.       This being considered, and
also the number of errors which were detected in Hassler's book du
ring the printing, it is certain that the work before us must be very
correct; as correct, indeed, as any table is likely to be unless it have
been first stereotyped and then re-examined, and much more.so

for each colour, and that the two directions of vibration in a
#.      wave-plane will have the same relation to them as be
 ore; while the difference of the squares of the two velocities
of propagation will continue proportional to the product of
the sines of the angles which the wave normal makes with the
optic axes; but the sum of the squares of these velocities will
be increased or diminished by a quantity proportional to the
square of a perpendicular                     let

the silver receives an impression of the figure, writing, or crest, which
may be cut upon the agate, or horn. The figures, &c., do not ap
pear on the silver at the expiration of the ten minutes, but are ren
dered visible by exposing the silver plate to vapour, either of amber,
water, mercury, or any other fluid.        He (Sir D. Brewster) had heard
Prof. Bessel say, that the vapours of different fluids were analogous
to the different coloured rays of the spectrum; that the different
fluids had different effects, corresponding to those of the spectrum ;
and that they could, in consequence of such correspondence, produce
 a red, blue, or violet colour.     The image of the camera obscura might
 be projected on any surface,—glass, silver, or the smooth leather
 cover of a book, without any previous preparation; and the effects
 would be the same as those produced on a silver plate covered with
 iodine.
     This paper gave rise to an animated conversation, in the course of
 which M. Bessel said that he had seen some of the pictures taken by
 this process, which were nearly, but not quite, as good as those ob
 tained by Mr. Talbot's process.—Sir D. Brewster said, this was the
 germ of one of the most extraordinary discoveries of modern days;
 by it there seemed to be some thermal effect which became fixed in
 the black substance; and not only so, but M. Bessel informed him,
 that different lights seemed to affect different vapours variously, so
 that there seemed to be something like a power of rendering light
 latent; a circumstance which, if it turned out so, would open up
 very new and curious conceptions of the physical nature of light:
 on the emission theory, it would be easy to account for this; on
 the undulatory theory, he could not conceive how it could be possi
 ble.—Prof. MacCullagh said, he believed Newton had somewhere
 thrown out a suggestion, that luminous particles, as they entered
 into bodies, might be caught and retained, within certain bounds, by
 continual attractions.—Sir D. Brewster said, that the experiments
 which he had performed with nitrous gas seemed to strengthen
 some such view as this, for, at certain temperatures, we had here
 an instance of a gaseous body as impervious to light as a piece of
 iron.—Sir    J. Herschel thought it a pity to encumber this new and
 extensive field of discovery now laid open to them by any specula
 tions connected with the theory either of undulations or emissions.
  He had found that paper could be so prepared, as that the impres
                                                                           on it,

 were not; and thus         became possible        impress

announced by the Italian chemist entirely corroborates his own nu
merous observations on the same subject; and the following he
states to be the results of his experiments:—
   1. Calomel which is perfectly free from sublimate, digested with
its own weight of hydrochlorate of ammonia, or any other alkaline
chloride, in distilled water at a temperature of 100° to 104°Fahr.,
during 24, 36, or even 48 hours, underwent no change of colour.
The filtered liquor did not, by means of any reagent, appear to con
tain a trace of a mercurial salt.
   Some pigeons which were made to drink of this same liquor for
several successive days suffered no inconvenience: the calomel lost
no sensible weight.
   2. The same mixture exposed to a temperature of 122° to 140°
Fahr., yielded a liquor which acted precisely in the same way with
reagents and on the animal oeconomy as the foregoing.
   3. By continued boiling, however, and under the influence of a
great excess of chloride, the conversion took place, but only parti
ally.—Journal de Chimie Médicale, Septembre 1842.
METHOD OF DISTINGUISHING ZIN C FROM MANGANESE IN SO
  LUTIONS CONTAINING AMMONIACAL SALTs. BY M. OTTO.
   If solutions of chloride of zinc and chloride of manganese, con
taining much hydrochlorate of ammonia, be rendered alkaline by so
lution of ammonia, the addition of the smallest quantity of solution
of hydrosulphuric acid precipitates white hydrated sulphuret of zinc,
whilst no effect is produced by it in the solution of manganese,
more being required to obtain a precipitate of the sulphuret of the
latter metal. If acetic acid be then added to the solutions, the sul
phuret of manganese dissolves very readily, whilst that of zinc re
mains undissolved.        M. Otto advises the use of hydrosulphuric acid
and not   hydrosulphate     of ammonia, because the latter, always con
taining persulphuret, may occasion mistakes, since acetic acid sepa
rates sulphur from                     If,

decomposition of animal substances, by the hydrated fixed alkalies,
into water, carbonic acid and ammonia, if they contain azote. It
results from the experiments of M. Reizet, that this process is not
entirely free from all chances of error.     In the first place the mix
ture of soda and lime retains atmospheric air confined in a peculiar
state of condensation; this air cannot be expelled either by a cur
rent of gas, nor under the influence of a vacuum.        During combus
tion, the azote of this air gives rise to ammonia, which is added to
that coming from the substance submitted to analysis.        Faraday has
observed that non-azotized     organic substances, even charcoal and the
 metals which decompose water, yield ammonia when calcined with
 potash in contact with air.
    Another chance of error in the process of MM. Varrentrapp and
 Will results from the circumstance, that the alcohol in which the
 perchloride of platina is dissolved, reduces this salt to the state of
 insoluble protochloride; this operation takes place very slowly, it is
 true, but it is so considerable that the protochloride formed, mixing
 with an ammoniacal salt of platina, adds to         weight, and conse         its
 quently sensibly increases the proportion          azote.         not ex     of                     It    is
 plained how MM. Warrentrapp and Will always obtained less azote

    Even diluted acids readily dissolve this salt, decomposing it and
 evolving sulphurous acid. The solution in hydrochloric acid yields
 crystals of chloride of sodium by evaporation, and by the addition
 of ammonia a green crystalline precipitate of ammonio-chloride of
platina.    The solution in sulphuric acid yields, after the requisite
evaporation, crystals of sulphate of soda, and assumes the deep colour
well known to be owing to the protosulphate of platina.             At a cer
tain degree of concentration, metallic platina separates, a property
which is well known to belong also to the protosulphate of platina
prepared by direct combination.
   The solution in nitric acid when evaparated by heat has a deep
reddish-brown colour; if to this hydrochlorate of ammonia be added
no precipitate is formed, but if the solution be evaporated with the
hydrochlorate of ammonia almost to dryness, and water be added to
the residue, there remains a great quantity of ammonio-chloride of
platina, which does not dissolve.      It appears that the reddish-brown
colour is  owing   to the formation of sulphate of platina, a salt, which,
as observed by Mr. E. Davy, is not decomposed           by hydrochlorate of
ammonia, unless they be      evaporated   together  to dryness.

cury with conia is insoluble in water, alcohol or aether; the compound
is white, pulverulent, and decomposes at 212°Fahr., becoming yellow.
If to an aqueous solution of conia one of sulphate of alumina be
added, crystals are gradually formed, which with the microscope are
easily seen to be octohedrons.   These crystals, when they have been
carefully washed, blacken if heated on platina foil.-Ibid.

       MY DEAR SIR,
    the Philosophical Magazine for February 1839 I have
INgiven an account of an experiment in which a galvanometer
was permanently deflected when connected with two strips of
platina covered by tubes containing oxygen and hydrogen.
At the conclusion of my notice, say,                I           “I
                                                   hope, by repeating
this experiment    in series, to effect  decomposition    of water by
means of        its
              composition.” The next paper            mine published     of
in the same   year  contains     account  an    battery        of
                                                            which the

public has since attached my name, and which led me into                                             a
different field of research.
     Inreading over my papers lately for          purpose alluded   a                                to
in my letter      of

                                        I I
My impression was, that had expressed hope not very likely          a
to    be
       realized; but after      few days’ consideration
                                         a                     saw my                  I
way more clearly, and determined            try the experiment.

           still think this would be the best mode of effecting
the  object; but as it was very troublesome in manipulation,
I  determined to try the platina platinized by voltaic depo
sition from the chloride, as proposed for a different purpose
by Mr. Smee.            I
                     therefore caused a series of fifty pairs to be
constructed, the form and arrangement of which is given in
the annexed figure, where or denotes a tube filled with oxy
gen; hy one filled with hydrogen, and the dark line in the
 axis of the tube platinized platina foil, which in the battery
I  constructed was about one-fourth of an inch wide. It is ob
 vious that, by allowing the platina to touch the liquid, the latter
 would spread over           its
                          surface            by

                                   to
 tery was charged with dilute sulphuric acid, sp. gr. 1-2, and
 the following effects were produced:—

                                        in                       as

in one direction throughout the circuit, and the oxygen in the
reverse.   It was found that 26 pairs were the smallest num
ber which would decompose water, but that four pairs would
decompose iodide of potassium.
   5th. A gold leaf electroscope was notably affected.
   6th. The battery was charged with distilled water; the elec
troscope was affected, and iodide of potassium decomposed.
   7th. Although the        phaenomena were too marked to render
it in the least     probable    that accidental circumstances could
have produced the current, still counter experiments were care
fully gone through; thus the gases were repeatedly changed,
oxygen being placed in the tubes which had contained hydro
gen, and vice versä.        The effects were equally powerful, and
the direction of the current was reversed.
    8th. All the tubes were charged with atmospheric            air; no
                                                       -
effect was produced.
    9th. The battery was charged with carbonic acid and nitro
gen in the alternate tubes; not the slightest effect observable.
     10th. It was charged with oxygen and nitrogen; not any
 effect.                                                      -
     11th. With hydrogen and nitrogen, slight effects.              The
 difference between this and the last experiment at first struck
 me as extraordinary, but upon consideration was easily ex
 plicable.    The liquid being exposed to the air would neces
 sarily absorb some oxygen, and this with hydrogen would give
 rise to a current.     This was proved by the liquid rising in the
 hydrogen tubes, but not in those containing nitrogen; and,
 as a further proof, one set of tubes was charged with hydro
 gen, and the alternate set with acidulated water without gas;
 a slight current was perceptible: with oxygen and the liquid
  in alternate tubes there were no effects produced.
      12th. As the oxygen and hydrogen were procured in the
 first instance by electrolysis, and as Dr. Schoenbein in his
  careful experiments on polarized electrodes supposed the pe—
  culiar substance which he has named Ozone to be a principal
  agent, I caused the tubes to be charged with oxygen evolved
  from chlorate of potash and oxide of manganese, and hydro
  gen from zinc and sulphuric acid; the effects were the same.
      The tubes were not     all   of equal size, nor were they gra
   duated; the exact proportional diminution      of gas  in  each tube
   could not   beascertained with    perfect accuracy;   both gases did
   diminish, and the hydrogen      so much more rapidly than the oxy
   gen, that my assistant, who was unacquainted with the rationale
  of   the battery, observed that the hydrogen was absorbed twice
  as      as
       fast   the oxygen.      Mr. Gassiot  is  now preparing   a    gra
   duated   battery of this  sort, bywhich the point will be accurately

 LXXIII.      On the Constant Voltaic Battery. By J. F. DANIELL,
     Esq., For. Sec. R.S., Prof. Chem. in King's College, London;
     in a Letter addressed to R. Phillips, Esq., F.R.S., &c.
       MY   DEAR       SIR,
 I?    appears from Professor Grove's letter, published in the
     last Number of the Philosophical Magazine, that        was                         I
 under a misconception in supposing that he had derived his
 battery from principles announced by me; and that my me
 mory was treacherous in suggesting that I had heard him, at
a very crowded meeting of the members of the London Insti
tution, admit (with a compliment which was impressive, but
doubtless much greater than the occasion required) that it
was in following up my train of reasoning that he was led to
the construction of the instrument whose wonderful powers
he was then about to illustrate.   But waving this point of re
collection, the error is certainly excusable, inasmuch as the
nitric acid battery exactly resembles the constant battery in
every particular except the substitution of platinum and                                    ni
tric acid for copper and sulphate of copper; and an experi
mentalist might, very obviously, have been led to the change
by following up the principle of diminishing contrary elec
tromotive powers and resistances to a current originating with
the zinc.    Professor Grove, however, states (although he
“cannot at this distance of time well describe what effect my
experiments had upon his mind”) that he cannot acquiesce
in the assertion that he was so guided; but that the idea
which immediately led to the construction of his battery is
distinctly stated in the Phil. Mag. for 1839. The experiment
referred    to,

acid.   What this has         do with the nitric acid battery,                              in
which the two acids        contact are the nitric and sulphuric,

the iodine a series of coloured zones of the various tints of

possible, and with tints undisturbed by the action of light, it

     coloured Films formed by Iodine, &c. upon Metals.          429
loured circles, until these come in contact at their circum
ferences, when the two systems will slowly coalesce and pro
duce one common outline of the form of an ellipsis.
   As the colours formed on various metals by the above-men
tioned agents are very similar to one another, it may be suffi
cient to examine in particular those produced on silver by
iodine.
   The external film of the iodide of silver rings, which cor
responds to the central black spot in those of Newton, is com
pletely invisible, it being impossible to perceive any difference
between the parts so covered, and those      where the metal is
intact; but by exposing half the plate to the influence of light,
whilst the other part remains covered, the silver is then found
darkened far beyond the limits of the external gold-coloured
 zone, where previously the surface was perfectly clear. The
 dark film thus rendered apparent is now liable to be rubbed
 off by the slightest friction, whereas before it was very adhe
 rent to the subjacent surface. The first zone is of a pale gold
 colour, which assumes a deeper tint as the thickness of the
film increases: the second zone is blue, the third white:
after these appear the different colours of the spectrum in re
 gular succession, as in the films studied by Newton and others,
 viz. yellow, orange, red, blue, green, yellow, &c. The pre
 sence of the golden-coloured zone in the place mentioned is
 worthy of remark, as in the tables of Newton of the colours
 presented by films of various thicknesses, the blue is stated as
 immediately following the black. The same gold film is the
 first which appears on most metals when their surface is at
 tacked in this manner.        Chlorine and bromine on silver;
 oxygen on steel; chlorine and bromine on titanium, bismuth,
 &c., commence their colours in the same way. Copper, how
 ever, is in one respect an exception, this metal first becoming
 of a dark red, which increases to a ruddy brown and then
 changes into blue; this deviation is fully accounted for by the
 colour of the copper itself; with this single particularity, this
metal undergoes the same alterations as the others.
    The action of light on the different colours of the iodide of
silver is very interesting: the most correct way of studying
this is to protect one half of a system of coloured rings by an
opake screen, while the other half is exposed for a short time
to the influence of the solar rays. The golden zone undergoes
the greatest change ; at first it grows darker, then red, and
at length is converted into a beautiful green. The blue film,
which comes next in thickness, suffers considerable alteration
in its tint, assuming much deeper and more brilliant shade;
                     a
the rest of   the colours appearto   be  similarly affectedby  the

430                    Dr. Waller's Experiments                      on the
action     of light, though to a                   very slight degree,            acquiring a
trifling accession in their brilliancy. It has already been re
marked that light destroys the adherence of the external in
visible film: the same thing obtains with the second or gold
coloured film, which turns green, but only to a certain depth
of the film, as may be proved by slightly rubbing the part
thus altered; the green colour is then seen to disappear, and
beneath the pulverulent portion thus removed is found the
gold colour, having almost the same appearance as before
the plate had been exposed.             As this experiment may be re
peated several times with the same results, it shows to how
inconceivably small a depth the light has acted to produce
this effect. To ascertain what would take place on augment
ing the thickness of the portion turned green, and the ad

  The affinity of chlorine with silver               is much inferior to that
which it possesses for copper.

metal.

  Bromine, when the surface of this substance is perfectly
dry, has no more action upon it than iodine; but if it have a
slight coating of moisture, as is formed by merely condensing
on it the vapour of the breath, the coloured films are formed
without difficulty by the vapours of bromine.   Their appear
ance is the same as those of the iodide of silver, viz. gold,

was   exposed   to iodine with a piece     of pure silver; as the
former was so much the harder of the two, it was naturally
supposed that the chemical action would be slower in exerting
itself on it than on the latter. This, however, was not the
case, as may be seen by the following statement of the result
of the experiment:—

   The intensity of the resistance offered by the different films
of iodide of silver to a continuation of the chemical combina

various spectral tints make their appearance.

   The third cause of error may be avoided by operating with
vapours of about the same force. In those described, the
average time employed in passing to the maximum was ge
nerally about half an hour; if that were not taken into consi
deration, different results might be obtained.
   In regard to chlorine, there exists another cause of compli
cation, the affinity which it possesses for water; for when dis
engaged in the ordinary manner, chlorine carries with it a
certain quantity of water which may very much alter the re
sults of the experiment.

LXXVII.        Reply to Professor Kelland's Defence of the New
   tonian Law of Molecular Action.       By S. EARNSHAw, M.A.
   Cambridge *.
    ROFESSOR. Kelland's defence of the extension of New
      ton's law of force to molecular action consists of a critique
upon my memoir “On the Nature of Molecular Forces;”
and of a reply to my letter which appeared in your Magazine
for July (pres. vol. p. 46).                 I
                                  shall therefore for the sake of
precision divide what I have to say in answer to his remarks
into two corresponding heads.
   1. With respect to the critique on my memoir, it is evident
that it has been written by the Professor under the notion that
my investigations have supposed each particle of the medium,
except the one for which the forces are calculated, to be in
their respective equilibrium positions.     I gather this from the
repeated charge he brings against me of drawing dynamical
inferences from a statical investigation.      Will the Professor
point out what step, in that part of my paper which is written
against Newton's law, requires that the particles of the me
dium should be in their equilibrium positions? With the ex
ception of the last article, where it is expressly stated that the
particles are in equilibrium, my paper is an investigation of
the properties of a vibrating medium, i.e. a medium in a state
of vibration. At any instant during the motion of the medium
I   fixupon particle and investigate the properties
                a                                         the forces      of
which    urge       that moment;    the other particles meanwhile
                         to at
                    it
are supposed                the positions which
                                 be   in              particles      as         in   a
state     of
           vibration they had      the instant fixed upon.
                                             at                 [Let

ton's law which violates this supposition.]               I find as a result
that there is always one direction in which the particle is
urged from              its
                    position                    of
                                   rest; and therefore,          the motion                   as

             In                                my letter printed    to    your                            in

                                                                repulsion (en             or

  as I   have nowhere      employed    the direct action         matter).    By              of
   the indirect action of matter           mean that effect which results

when the density and arrangement of the aether are changed
by the introduction of particles of matter which exclude some
particles of aether from certain portions of space, and thereby
affect the equilibrium positions of the remaining particles of
aether.     The Professor next endeavours to guess the reason
          I
why did not draw from my equations any inferences respect
 ing the direct action of matter. The answer is simple; a most
important step required that the vibrating medium should
 consist of homogeneous particles. The step I allude to is that
where (S. 3. vol. xx. May, p. 372) I have “assumed the law of
displacement at the time t to be #, = a sin (r h-i-T),” which
assumption is not true when the particles of matter vibrate, be
cause then a could not be invariable through the medium.                                   I
think no blame attaches to me for causing this perplexity to the
 Professor, as I have expressly added, “it will be understood
that what follows applies only to media in which this law of
disturbance can be transmitted,” which understand to be a         I
formal renunciation of all connexion with the direct action of
matter. The Professor, therefore, in referring me to Mr. O'Brien
(October, p. 269) to be set right in my notions, seems to have
fallen into the mistake of supposing that what Mr. O'Brien
has written on the direct effect of matter (March, note at
p. 208) can refute what I have written on the indirect effect
of matter.
     I
     do not think I fully understand on what ground the Pro

fessor affirms (October, p. 264) that have not taken account
of “the want of action of particles of aether in the portion of
space occupied by the material particles” (October, p. 264);
for, as I have taken into account                      all
                                                                                   I of

             of the Newtonian Law of Molecular Action.                  443
wave's     front.”    By this process it is established beyond the
possibility of a doubt, that when the operation represented by
X is performed in the expression which Professor Kelland
quotes (p. 268) from M. Cauchy, the result ought to be                  in
dependent of the position of the wave's front; and so it is
proved either that my equations and M. Cauchy’s are identical,
or that M. Cauchy’s are at variance with experiment. The
methods by which we have obtained our equations are perfectly
dissimilar, but I believe the equations themselves are identical.
In deducing his M. Cauchy has adhered closely to theoretical
considerations; but in deducing mine, I have proceeded to a
certain point by the guidance of theory, and then beginning
from a more advanced point, where the results of experiment
were known, have worked backwards to meet theory.                     It is
therefore     easily seen that my   results  being  a mixture of   theory
and experiment would not present the same appearance to the
eye as the results of M. Cauchy, which are obtained from
theory alone. They must, however, be identical in fact, or
else theory is discordant with experiment.             What therefore
Professor Kelland has written (p. 268) about “the axis of
transmission” is grounded on a misconception, from which
also has sprung his idea that “the form of my equations”
 (p. 46), from which my inferences have been drawn against the
Newtonian law, &c., “does depend on the position of the front
of the wave.”
    I  believe I have now replied to every objection of import
ance which Professor Kelland has brought forward;                   I
                                                                   cannot
 however conclude this letter without remarking, that it is ob
 vious that a discussion like the one in which we are now en
 gaged never can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion un
 less both parties write with perfect candour and a single eye to
 the discovery of the truth. All arguments which do not really
 bear upon the Newtonian law must be avoided; and those
which do bear upon        it,    after due scrutiny they
                                if                             befound   to
 be   true, unhesitatingly admitted with       all  their consequences.
I   would therefore, with       aview of  shortening our labours, re
spectfully request the Professor not         to  take     sowide     field,

 cannot       beanswered, it
                          is    clearly quite unnecessary for him        to

     1.Does Professor Kelland admit that I have satisfactorily
proved that the quantity n used in his memoir on dispersion
is equal to zero?
    2. Does he admit that the evanescence of that quantity
 destroys his equations of motion?
    3. Does he admit that the evanescence of his
                                                     equations of
motion destroys his proof of the transversality of vibrations?
    4. Does he admit that the disappearance of his equations of
motion in a medium of perfect symmetry whenever Newton's
law is introduced, is a sufficient proof that that cannot be the
law of molecular action ?

   It   is not difficult to show, that the areas                  of the sections of the
surface made by the coordinate planes are T a b, T a c, and
ºr b c respectively, and in general that the area of any conic
section whose equation is
            A*a* + Bºy” + 2 A B cos v. a y = 1,
is independent of y, the angle between the axes of coordinates,
where A and B are the reciprocals of the segments into which
the line moving between the axes of coordinates is divided.
    From this known property that if a line of constant length
revolves between two fixed rectangular axes, the locus of the
middle point is a circle, may be deduced a method of con
verting rectilinear into circular motion, rigorously exact, and
simple in construction, admitting an unlimited length of
stroke, and obviating the necessity of using a working beam
or connecting rod ; a change which would introduce a de
cided improvement in the construction of the steam-engine”.

certain quantity of water and allowed to stand for some days,
when the haematoxylin crystallizes out, and may be pressed
between bibulous paper, &c. The residual extract itself con
tains more of the substance; from 2 pounds of extract treated
with 10 pounds of aether, Erdmann obtained between 3 and 4
ounces of haematoxylin.
    The colour of haematoxylin varies from a straw yellow to a
deep yellow; when pulverized it is white or pale yellow. The
crystals can be obtained some lines in length; their form has
been studied by Wolff and previously by Teschemacher (Phil.
Mag. S. 3. p. 28). It tastes like liquorice root without any
trace of bitterness or astringency. Chevreul describes it dif
ferently, but he probably had an impure substance.          -
    Haematoxylin dissolves slowly in cold water, but very easily
in boiling water. It is necessary to employ water which has
been previously boiled, for the smallest possible trace of am
monia causes the haematoxylin to become purple, and Erd
 mann proposes this substance as the most delicate test for
 ammonia: pure oxygen or air freed from ammonia does not
 alter the colour.  The crystals must be dried by pressure in
 bibulous  paper.  The filtering paper which is used for the
 solutions of  haematoxylin  must be free from lime.    Haema
toxylin is soluble in alcohol and aether, but the solution in
anhydrous aether does not yield crystals.   By exposure to
sunlight the substance acquires a reddish colour, but no change
in its constitution is effected.
   It does not sublime, leaves behind a great quantity of char
coal when heated in a tube; does not evolve ammonia when
heated with potassa, and consequently contains no nitrogen.
This hamatoxylin loses water at ordinary temperatures,
and the desiccation is completed at 100–120°C.; it contains 8
atoms of water,         its

  then evaporated, the ammonia being carefully replaced from
  time to time (excess is to be avoided), a compound crystallizes
  out in dark violet grains which contains ammonia combined
  with Hacmatéin; these crystals must be quickly filtered off and
 dried by pressure and exposed to the air, but heat must not be
  employed. The mother liquor may be precipitated by means
 of acetic acid, haematéin falls down in the form of an ochre-red
  voluminous body like hydrated sesquioxide of iron; when dried
 it is dark green with a metallic glance, red by transmitted
 light; the powder is red. Slowly solublein cold, easier in boiling
 water. Soluble in alcohol with a reddish brown colour, very
 little soluble in aether; dissolves in potassa with a blue co
 lour, which exposed to the air passes through red into brown;
 with ammonia it gives a purple solution which soon turns into
 brown; formula C" Hº O". Haematoxylin absorbs 3 atoms
 of oxygen under the influence of ammonia, and forms haema
 téin, and 2 atoms of water, C" Hº" Ol' + O* = C10 H30
 Old 4-H O2.
     No carbonic acid is formed during the change.
     Haematéin-ammonia is a bluish-black or rather violet-black
 powder, which under the microscope is seen to consist of
 quadrilateral prisms.     It is soluble in water with an intense
 purple colour, with alcohol it gives a reddish-brown solution.
 Heated to 100° C. it loses water and ammonia, it must there
 fore be dried over sulphuric acid. When dry it does not
 decompose of itself, but if moist or in solution a spontaneous
 decomposition takes place.       Formula C* Hº N* Oi"; con
 sequently 1 atom of haematéin takes up 2 atoms of ammonia
 and 1 atom of water. Erdmann gives the ammonia com
 pound the formula    C*H*      O'” + 2 Nº Hº O, and haematéin
 C10 H28 Olš + H2 O.
    Haematéin-ammonia gives coloured precipitates with most
metallic solutions. The lead compound is blue, but it is basic,
for the supernatant solution is acid; at first the washings are
colourless, but soon become brown-coloured: it is probable
that under the influence of oxide of lead, air and moisture,
the haematéin undergoes slow oxidation and decomposition.
The blue compound was washed a little and then analysed:
the organic part of it agreed pretty well with the formula
C40H28 O15.
    A reddened solution of haematoxylin is decolorated by
sulphuretted hydrogen, and on evaporation pure haematoxylin
is obtained; a solution of haematéin is also rendered colour
less by sulphuretted hydrogen, but in this no reduction
takes place, for on evaporating, as the gas is driven off the
solution acquires   itsoriginal dark colour, and crystals   ofhae

matéin are formed, but not a trace of haematoxylin.      It is
evident, therefore, that the sulphuretted hydrogen enters into
combination with haematéin, as Chevreul has already stated.
The lead and copper compounds of haematéin were also treated
with sulphuretted hydrogen, but in no   case was any reduction
visible. A few  experiments   were made on the action of nas
cent hydrogen, which appeared to have better success.-(Journ.

     Liebig and Wöhler have discovered that this body is pro
duced when narcotine is exposed to oxidizing agencies.     It is
best prepared in the following manner:—Narcotine is dissolved
in a considerable excess of dilute sulphuric acid, finely pow
dered peroxide of manganese is added, and the whole heated:
it soon begins to assume a saffron-yellow colour and to evolve
carbonic acid. It must be heated to boiling, and this tem
perature maintained as long as carbonic acid is evolved. At
the end of the operation there must still be excess of oxide of
manganese and sulphuric acid.     It is filtered while hot; the
liquid on cooling forms a mass of fine acicular crystals; these
must be washed with cold water, and purified by re-solution
in water and decoloration with animal charcoal.                                    Opianic
acid crystallizes in fine silky needles, whose form cannot be

 salicine, as has been shown by Gerhardt; by fusing salicine with
 an excess of caustic potassa, hydrogen is evolved; the mass
 must not be allowed to become perfectly white, for then some
of the salicylic acid is decomposed. Marchand employed two
pounds and a half of potassa to half a pound of salicine.         If
 too little potassa is used, resin and salicylous acid are pro
 duced.     Marchand found the same formula as Piria.        If this
salicylic acid be mixed with strong nitric acid the action is
exceedingly violent, and picrin-nitric acid is produced;                                          if,

not   being   achromatic,      the screen rv had to be placed in an
inclined position in order to obtain a neat spectrum-image of
the hole in bb, and this was attended with the great advan
tage of elongating the total length of the spectrum, and there
fore increasing the measures.             In order to obtain sensitive
surfaces of great delicacy the silver plates were first iodized
lightly, and then exposed to the vapour of bromine until they
attained a full golden yellow.

   The same result is obtained when other sensitive surfaces
are employed, the period of time differing for different bodies.
Guided, therefore, by the analogy of heat, perceive that bo                I
dies have a relation to this imponderable agent corresponding
to that of specific heat. It follows therefore with certainty that,-
   The specific tithonicity of bodies is the prime function on
which their sensitiveness depends.        Under this point of view
the sensitiveness is inversely as the specific tithonicity.
   The circumstances under which this experiment is made
serve also to show that metallic bodies are non-conductors of
tithonicity.
    This contrasts remarkably with their action towards heat.

Transparent minerals, such as topaz, selenite, Iceland spar,
quartz, produced the same results as glass. . But on gloomy
days the phaenomena did not appear, a bright sunshine being
apparently requisite for their production.            “When a piece of
nitrated paper, for instance, was rolled round a cylindrical
surface of moderate convexity, covered with black velvet, and
the piece of glass laid gently in contact with                the effect              it,                  of
sunshine was exalted           the line at                  of
                                             contact, but on either side
of  that line       as
                  the interval increased the influence             the glass                of

                              at
could     beperceived between the impressions under the glass
and  in  the free air.”
    Now       all
              this    precisely what should happen
                         is                                    the tithono            if

sition. The rays, which come from the sun, pass through the
glass with but little loss from absorption, falling upon the ni
trate they decompose            and now it,   commences radiating, but
                                                            it

character    they  possessed    before   impinging       the nitrate. Now        on
they cannot get through the glass, before they passed without
difficulty.         So   precisely
                         it
                         is              the case  in heat. Much            of

dark surface that can absorbit that surface becomes presently
warm and commences radiating; but the physical constitution
of   these rays      changed, they cannot get through the glass,
                         is
and  if  a non-conducting       black surface, half covered             piece                    by

covered half would for these obvious reasons become the hotter.
For the same reason, precisely,             the tithonic experiment the
                                                       byin

     THE    18th
                Journal of the Academy of Sciences of Paris, for the
                  of July, 1842, contains a communication made by
     M.    Regnault    from M. Moser of Königsberg, “Sur la forma
     tion des   images    Daguerriennest;” in which he announces the
     fact, that “when two bodies are sufficiently near, they impress
     their images upon each other.”             The Journal of the 29th of
     August contains a second communication from M. Moserf, in
     which the results of his researches are summed up in twenty
     six paragraphs.         From these      I  select the following, which
     alone are to be considered on the present occasion.
         “9. All bodies radiate light even in complete darkness.
         “10. This light does not appear to be allied to phosphores
     cence, for there is no difference perceived whether the bodies
     have been long in the dark, or whether they have been just
     exposed to daylight, or even to direct solar light.
         “10. Two bodies constantly impress their images on each
     other, even in complete darkness.
         “14. However, for the image to be appreciable, it is neces
     sary, because of the divergence of the rays, that the distance
     of the bodies should not be very considerable.
         “15. To render the image visible, the vapour of water,
     mercury, iodine, &c. may be used.
         “ 17. There exists latent light as well as latent heat.”
         The announcement at the last meeting of the British Asso
     ciation of these discoveries naturally excited a more than or
     dinary degree of interest.        A discovery of this kind, changing,
     as it  does, the  features,  not only   of the theories of light adopted
     by philosophers, but also the commonly received opinions of
     mankind, was more calculated to awaken attention than any
     thing which has been brought before the public since the
     publication of Daguerre's beautiful photographic process.
     Having instituted a series of experiments, the results of which
     appear to prove that these phaenomena are not produced by
     latent light, I am desirous of recording them.
         I would not be understood as denying the absorption of
     light by bodies; of this I think we have abundant proof, and
     it is a matter well deserving attention. If we pluck a Nastur

tium when the sun is shining brightly on the flower, and carry
it into a dark room, we shall still be enabled to see it by the
light which it emits.
   The human hand will sometimes exhibit the same phaeno
menon, and many other instances might be adduced in proof.
of the absorption of light; and, believe, indeed of the prin
                                                  I
ciple that light is latent in bodies. I have only to show that
the conclusions of M. Moser have been formed somewhat
hastily, being led, no doubt, by the striking similarity which
exists between the effects produced on the Daguerreotype
plates under the influence of light, and by the juxtaposition
of bodies in the dark, to consider them as the work of the
same element.                                        -
    1. Dr.   Draper,    in the   Philosophical   Magazine      for Septem
ber 1840, mentions a fact which has been long known, “That,
if a piece of very cold clear glass, or what is better, a cold po
lished metallic reflector, has a little object, such as a piece of
metal, laid on       it,
                       and the surface be breathed over once, the
object being then carefully removed,                          you breathe

singular phaenomenon may                   be
                                         exhibited for many days after
the first trial     ismade.” Several other similar experiments
are mentioned,        all   of
                           them going        show that some mysterious

 by  the gold and the large medal were most distinct; not only
 was the disc marked, but the lettering                      on

bing off the vapour,        was found that the gold and silver had

made permanent impressions              the copper.  on

image      ofthe copper coin was,          well           as
                                                     the others, most  as
faithfully given, but the gold and silver only made permanent
Impressions.
    7.    silvered copper plate was now tried with
          A                                                   moderate                a
warmth (3).         Mercurial    vapour   brought   out  good   images
of  the  gold   and  copper;   the silver  marked,   but not well de
fined.
    8.  Having repeated the above experiments many times with
the same results,       was desirous
                                I          ascertaining   of electricity             if
had    any    similar  effect;  powerful    discharges   were passed
through and over the plate and discs, and             was subjected        it                           to
a  long-continued current without any effect. The silver had
been cleaned off from the plate (7),           was now warmed with
                                                                it

the coins and medals                   and submitted
from      very
          a      large  Leyden   jar;       exposing      on mercurial          it

strange

                       say, spectral       images         of   those which had been                     re
ceived                 the plate when
                                was         it             silvered (7); thus proving
that the influence, whatever       may be, was exerted

      I  placed upon    plate    copper, blue, red and orange
                                     a           of
coloured glasses, pieces                   of
                              crown and flint glass, mica, and
square      tracing paper.
              of             These were allowed         remain                       to                 in a
contact half      hour. The space occupied
                           an                       the red glass               by
was well marked, that covered          the orange was less by                                           di
stinct, but the blue glass left    impression; the shapes
                                                     no        the                                of
flint and crown   glass were well made   out, and     remarkably
strong impression where the crown glass rested         the tracing               on a
paper, but the mica had not made any impression.
   10. The last experiment repeated, after the exposure                                                 to
mercurial vapour; heat was again applied        dissipate    the           to                     it;

equally distinct images, the orange the next; the others left but

exert so powerful an influence over the laws of the material
 creation. Although attention was called to the singular man
 ner in which vapours disposed themselves on plates of glass
 and copper, two years since by Dr. Draper, Professor of Che
 mistry at New York, and about the same time to the calorific
 powers of the solar spectrum, by Sir John Herschel”, and to
 the influence of heat artificially applied, by myself (17), yet it
 is certainly due to M. Moser of Konigsberg, to acknowledge
 him to be the first who has forcibly called the attention of
the scientific world to an inquiry which promises to be as

The general boundary of tract may be considered as sufficiently
defined on the north by the band of mountain limestone which runs
from Kirkby Stephen by Heskel, on the west by the coast, and on
the south by the discontinuous and irregular band of linestone,
which again nearly meets the great mountain limestone ridge of
Yorkshire, by which, and the great fault along          base, the district                   its

developed, supposing the faults             have been caused  to   the elevation

  disturbance of the carboniferous system. There is also, however,
  another law pointed out by that theory, viz. that a system of dislo
  cations may also exist having the same directions as the strike of
  the disturbed beds.          Consequently those faults which are in the
  direction of the strike of the beds of the older formations, may,
 according to this theory, be assigned to the epoch of the elevation
 and dislocation of those beds. The great faults of the Dudden,
 Coniston Water and Troutbeck are of this class, since their direc
 tions coincide very nearly with the mean strike of the older beds.
 Theory, therefore, leaves the epoch of these faults undetermined;
 nor has the point been settled by observation, since there is no
 direct evidence to prove whether these faults have affected the
 mountain limestone or not.
     It may be thought that the mountain limestone must have been
 more decidedly disturbed by the great faults above mentioned had
 they been produced at the epoch of the disturbance of the carboni
 ferous system.         It must be remarked, however, that the direct evi
 dence of these faults is found only at a considerable distance from the
 existing portions of mountain limestone, and that if they originated in
that central and local elevation to which the actual configuration of
 this tract must be due (at whatever epoch it took place), the diver
 ging faults, however great near the centre of the district, would dis
 appear as they approached                      its
                                        boundary.      The author, however,                               is
disposed       to  refer the four great faults above mentioned                 the                  to
disturbance         ofthe older rocks.      They appear         have produced   to
 such enormous relative displacements                 the massesof       opposite             on

do not coincide with that of the actual strike of the older beds. The
author shows that           this coincidence existed (as

directions of the above faults and that of the strike.

are found reposing                  on       an

 that the last stage              of   its

to 200 feet. This velocity will decrease as the wave expands,
unless the current be constrained to pass through a comparatively
narrow channel, like that which must have been formed by the pass
Stainmoor when just submerged beneath the surface of the ocean.
In such case the velocity of the current might be much increased.
   With respect to the magnitude of the blocks which might be
moved by a current of given velocity, the author remarks, that the
facility with which the transport of a block may be effected
depends principally on                  its
                             form. The more       approximates       per       it                                 to
fect sphericity, the less, cateris paribus, will     the force necessary         be
to  remove it. The author conceives that there           no doubt what                   is
ever but that  blocks,  not more spherical than  many   rolled blocks are

escarpment which overlooks the valley of the Severn, could not
possibly be formed by oceanic currents, except under very peculiar
conditions, which we have no reason to believe to have existed in
those localities.     On the contrary, the formation of such escarp
ments   during   the gradual emergence of the land would be a neces
sary consequence of that emergence under conditions which must
have obtained in numerous instances. Hence the author concludes
that the escarpment of the wolds was formed subsequently to the
transport of the blocks which are now found in that region.             He
conceives that, with respect to the theory of transport by currents,
difficulties founded on existing inequalities of surface have been far
too strongly contended for on the one hand, and too easily admitted
on the other.
   The author is anxious that his views should not be misunder
stood as respects the glacial theory, or that which would refer the
transport of blocks to floating ice. He is quite prepared to believe
in the possible extension of glaciers beyond the boundaries to
which they now extend, wherever such greater extension can be ac
counted for consistently with the conclusions of collateral branches
of physical science; and also to believe that such more extensive
glaciers, where they have existed, may have been the means of
transport of erratic blocks, provided sufficient mechanical cause
can be assigned for their movement.         With respect to the iceberg
theory, though he rejects       applicationits    the case investigated   to                                 in
this communication         altogether unnecessary

observed phaenomena,         conceives that floating ice may probably

of  examining    the pretensions     of the instrument.          In this view.        have                                     I

added to each the same letters of reference to the same parts.                           I
transmit to you also the opinion of Carlini of Milan, and of his col
leagues, as to this instrument, which was submitted to their                                                                       ex

         “I
         may begin by stating that the chief object of the instrument
is to determine the difference of right ascension between any two
stars, without the agency of time as an element, the equatoreal                                                                    an
 gular difference between them being measured directly, in arc, on
an hour-circle, graduated in degrees and minutes for that purpose.
 It is true that time does enter as an element into the principle of the
instrument, inasmuch as a certain part of the machinery is moved
by clock-work, in the manner used in many equatoreals; but this
agency is purely mechanical and subsidiary, and does not require
that the absolute time should either be exactly known, or                        march                                 its

cipal axis telescope, and partly by the equatoreal motion, either of
the whole apparatus, or by the rotatory movement of the principal
axis, by means of the declination telescope. This motion, I may
mention by the way, of the principal or polar axis may be made at
pleasure, independently of a large frame-work attached to the         in
strument, which is moved by the clock-work,          There is an hour
circle in the plane of the meridian, fixed to this outer frame-work,
and another circle fixed to the lower extremity of the polar axis,
which may be clamped or freed from that which belongs to the frame
work. The speculum, at the other extremity of the axis, is so con
trived that it moves along with the frame-work.
    “It will therefore be understood, that if the upper speculum be
so directed towards a star that the rays reflected from it pass down
the polar axis telescope, they will be received and reflected, first,
from the central speculum, and secondly, from the speculum in the
declination telescope, to the eye, in whatever position the declina
tion telescope may be. Now, if the hour-circles be clamped, so as
to form one, and the frame-work be put into gear with the clock
work, the whole will move round at the rate observed by the heavens,
and, consequently, the image of the star reflected from the upper
speculum will continue in the centre of the field of the declination
telescope, for any required length of time, and in every possible po
sition of that telescope.
    “Suppose, now, that the relative position of the equatoreal circle,
fixed to the frame, and that carried by the polar axis, be carefully
ascertained by reading off their graduated circumferences, by micro
scopes or otherwise, and that then the circle carried by the polar
axis be unclamped, that axis will be left free to revolve and to carry
with it the declination circle, and likewise the declination telescope,
but without interfering with what may be called the celestial move
ment of the frame, or that of the upper speculum, which, by going
along with, continues to reflect the rays from the star to which it
was originally directed; and, consequently, to preserve the image of
 that star constantly in the centre of the field of the declination tele
scope. This declination telescope is now directed to any other given
star whatsoever, the image of which, viewed directly, is to be brought
into coincidence with that seen by reflection from the upper specu
lum. If now the equatoreal circles be clamped, and a second set
of readings be made, it is obvious that the difference between the
 two will be the difference, in arc, of the right ascensions of the
 Stars.
    “When the observation commences, the declination telescope is
 directed to the standard star, as well as the upper speculum, so that
 the images, seen direct and by reflection, are made to coincide in
the centre of the field of view of the declination telescope. The
 graduations of the declination circle are then read off, to be com
 pared with those when the second observation is made, or that of
 the star whose place is to be determined. The difference of these
 readings will give the difference of the declinations of the two stars,
 in the same manner that the difference of the readings of the two

concentric hour-circles (as they may be called) at the lower end of
the polar axis, gives the difference of the right ascensions.
    “If  clock-work machinery be not in such perfect adjustment as
to keep   the standard star, first observed, correctly in the centre of
the field of view, it may be brought to that point by a tangential
movement of the frame-work, to be made by hand, at the moment
of making the second observation, without in any respect vitiating
the integrity of the observation, for this small movement does no
more than compensate for any error in the going of the clock.
   “As it may not be always convenient to move the whole frame
which is attached to the clock-work, the upper speculum, at the
upper end of the axis, is so fitted as to be capable of being turned
round independently of the frame, to which it is fixed by a mode
rately stiff collar.   This movement, which may be made roughly by
hand, or more nicely by a tangent screw, enables the observer,
without stopping the clock-work machinery, to direct the speculum
to any given standard star; and I may observe that only those of
the first and second magnitudes are named for this purpose by M.
Wettinger, as he fears the light lost by the three successive reflec
tions might render any less brilliant stars invisible.       This, however,
does not affect stars viewed     through  the declination  telescope,  which
looks directly to           its
                         object, and     supposedis       capable         to

General Meeting.
   “Sir, I have just now received your letter, by which you an
nounce to me that the Royal Astronomical Society have honoured me
with their Gold Medal.     I recognise in it a valuable sign of the kind
attention of this Society towards me and my labours; and      I beg you
to present to them my sincerest thanks.
   “Pray have the goodness to allow the medal to be sent to M.
Praetorius, Secretary and Librarian of His Royal Highness Prince
Albert, who will undertake to send it to me.
   “Of late my labours in the lunar theory have been considerably
advanced.     The calculation of the perturbations is finished, and I am
now engaged on the calculation of provisional tables for the purpose
of comparing my results with observations, and of determining the
correction of the elliptic elements which result from them.          I am
now giving to these tables the necessary extension, that they may
afterwards serve as definite tables, after having applied to them the
necessary corrections which are required by the new determination
of the elliptic elements.   To combine with exactness in these tables
the most convenient mode of calculating the places of the moon, I
have chosen the form that M. Carlini has given to the tables of the
sun, as much as it is possible to do so. However, the labour of
calculation of the tables themselves is much increased   by this arrange.

   That whilst the edges of the furrow are closing, a white line
having a filamentous appearance arises between it and each ganglion,
the connexion of which with the central parts corresponds with the
swellings which give to those parts a sinuous appearance.
   That another white line arises between the ganglia, and connects
them together, so as to cause them to offer collectively an arrange
ment somewhat analogous to that which the ganglia of some inver
tebrate animals present.
   That another line appears to proceed from each ganglion exter
nally, and to join one which runs parallel with the axis of the body
and communicates with the cardiac ganglion.                      -
   Resuming the pathological part of his subject, Professor Fisher
gave the following statement of the views he entertained on the
subject of Spina bifida, when that disease is situated in the lumbo
sacral region*:—
   That the coalescence already described of the ganglia constitutes
the primary irregularity to which          the others that the disease pre

                      be     indirectly referred.

                                               the position those ganglia
                                                  is
occupy, and by their volume, the comparative greatness                which                                of
may      be
         due      their connexion with the sacral plexus

    That the branches of the lumbar and sacral vertebrae are not ab
sent in the region affected, but are more or less everted by the pre
sence of the tumour.
    The researches which Professor Fisher has made on the defective
formation of the spinal cord have led him to adopt the following
general view regarding the plastic process of that organ;–
    That although the spinal cord possesses, like every other organ, a
plastic process peculiar to itself, yet that process may be so influ
enced by the anomalous condition of some of the roots of the spinal
nerves as to lead to a partial malformation, or even to a partial de
ficiency of the organ *.
    The following are the therapeutical inferences that Professor
Fisher has drawn from his investigations of the disease in ques

forded either by the ordinary manure, or the ammonia &c. of
the atmosphere, sulphate of ammonia has been introduced,
and found to be a most valuable auxiliary, as a top dressing, to
the farmer.
   It  has been found to impart a greater degree of fructifica
tion to grass, wheat, and other grain, than any other dressing
yet discovered, and at a less cost by 50 per cent.
    The mode of application as adopted by Mr. C. Hall of
Havering-atte-Bower, Essex, is as follows:—
    Having selected several fields of grass, peas, turneps, and
wheat, he had sown broad cast on parts of these fields quan
tities at the cost of 5s. 3d., 11s. 4d. and 21s. per acre; the
sulphate having cost him 17s. per cwt.
    The produce was kept and threshed separately, when the
increase from the wheat land was found to be as follows:—
                                                                      6 5s.

     MM. Larocque and Thibierge detail also various experiments on the
  modes of detecting opium proposed by Dr. Christison, and they mention
  that their results differ much from his. They state that these dif
 ferences may arise from three causes, 1st, the inequality of the com
 position of the opium of commerce; 2ndly, the analytical process em
 ployed by Dr. Christison, which consisted in decomposing the meco
 nate of lead by sulphuretted hydrogen—this the authors show fre
 quently masks the meconic acid, and that it could only be detected
 by decomposing the meconate of lead with dilute sulphuric acid :
 3rdly, the variable nature of the liquids with which opium is mixed.
     The authors have also, as the results of their experiments, arrived
  at the following conclusions:–
     1st. By the aid of reagents it is possible to determine the pre
 sence of morphia, strychnia and brucia in substances, which, after
 being mixed with the salts of these alkalies, have undergone the
 vinous, acetic or putrefactive fermentation.     M. Orfila has already
 shown that the    putrefactive  fermentation does not alter morphia.
     2ndly. Crystallized iodic acid, or a concentrated solution of this
 acid, is susceptible of being decomposed by neutral azotized bodies;
 but a dilute solution of this acid cannot be decomposed by them un
 less there be added concentrated sulphuric acid, crystallizable acetic
 acid, oxalic, citric or tartaric acid.
     3rdly. Iodic acid should not be employed as a test of morphia
 without the greatest caution.
    4thly. Perchloride of gold produces such effects with the vegetable
 alkalies, as serve to distinguish morphia, brucia and strychnia from
each other.
    5thly. The reagents on which the greatest reliance may be placed
as tests of morphia are, nitric acid, neutral perchloride of iron, and
 perchloride of gold.
     6thly. By the use of reagents, morphia which has been mixed with
beer, soup or milk may be detected.
    7thly. It is also easy to prove by reagents the presence of mecomic
acid in soup or milk, especially when the meconate of lead is decom
posed by dilute sulphuric acid.—Journal de Chimie Médicale, Octo
bre 1842.
NON-DECOMPOSITION OF VEGETABLE ALKALIES                  BY EXPOSURE
                        TO FERMENTING BODIES.
    It appeared to MM. Larocque and Thibierge a subject of some
interest to determine by experiment, whether the vegetable alkalies
suffered decomposition when in contact with fermenting substances.
It had, indeed, been proved by Orfila and Lesueur that acetate of
morphia suffered no change discoverable by reagents, under these
circumstances;      and M. Merck detected strychnia, morphia and
brucia after   they   had been exposed to fermenting animal and ve
getable matters during twenty days.
    The following experiments were made by MM. Larocque and
Thibierge:–

   To 3080 grains of blood there were added 5' 14 grains of [sul
phate of ; ) brucia; this mixture was exposed to the air from the
2nd of June to the 3rd of August; at this period the blood was pu
trefying and fetid.   It was evaporated to dryness; the residue was
treated with  boiling alcohol; the solution obtained was filtered and
evaporated to dryness, and treated with water acidulated with ace
tic acid. The solution thus procured was filtered and evaporated
to a syrupy consistence. In this state it was reddened by nitric acid,
and become of a violet tint by the successive application of nitric
acid and protochloride of tin.
    Mixtures of the following substances were made on the 2nd of
June :—7700 grains of distilled water, 154 grains of yeast, and 462
grains of sugar. To four such mixtures were separately added 5'14
grains of sulphate of brucia, 5' 14 grains of sulphate of strychnia,
and 5' 14 grains of acetate of morphia.    These mixtures soon began
 to ferment, and when after standing several days the evolution of
carbonic acid had ceased, they were evaporated to dryness, then
treated with boiling alcohol, and after evaporating the spirit, the
residue was treated with water acidulated with acetic acid, and in
this liquor, evaporated to a syrupy consistence, the characteristics of
the alkali introduced before fermentation were determinable.
    Some red wine holding hydrochlorate of morphia in solution had
been kept in a bottle loosely corked from July 1841 to the 15th of
 June 1842; the liquid exhaled a strong odour of acetic acid; after
 treating in the manner above described, and decolorized by animal
 charcoal, it did not yield crystals, but by evaporation to a syrupy
 consistence it gave a residue which was reddened by nitric acid, ren
 dered blue by perchloride of iron, was precipitated by tannin, and
reduced the chloride of gold.—Ibid.
          PREPARATION AND COMPOSITION            OF PEPSIN.
   In order to prepare pepsin in quantity, M. Vogel, jun. employed
the following process:—The glandular skin of the fresh stomach of
the hog was separated from the serous part, and after having cut
it into small pieces it was treated with cold distilled water; after
twenty-four hours' immersion, the water was poured off and fresh
portions added. This operation was repeated during several days,
until a putrid odour was perceptible. The aqueous infusion thus
obtained was precipitated by acetate of lead, the white flocculent
precipitate formed containing the pepsin mixed with much albu
men; this precipitate being diffused through water, it was decomposed
by hydrosulphuric acid gas. When the liquor is filtered, the solu
tion contains pepsin and sulphuric acid, while coagulated albumen
 and sulphuret of lead remain on the filter.        A very small quantity
 of hydrochloric acid, added to the solution of pepsin and acetic acid,
 is sufficient to render it capable of artificial digestion.
    In order to procure solid pepsin, the filtered liquor must be eva
 porated to a syrupy consistence, carefully avoiding ebullition, and
 afterwards adding absolute alcohol to   it.     After some time whitish
                                                              a

bulky precipitate is formed, which is to be dried by exposure to the
air; and it is then a yellowish viscid mass of a peculiar animal
odour and a disagreeable taste.     Pepsin thus obtained has an acid
reaction, because it always contains a small quantity of acetic acid, to
deprive it of which various processes were tried, and that which suc
ceeded was heating it in a salt-water bath for some hours, by which
a white powder soluble in water and possessing no acid reaction was
obtained. It is to be remembered that pepsin loses some of                                                              its

     ON A NEW MODE OF FORMING AMMONIA.                                                            BY M. REIZET.
     The           of M. Kuhlmann have shown that under the
           researches                                                                                                           in
fluence of spongy  platina, nitric oxide mixed with excess of hydrogen
produced ammonia. On repeating the experiments of M. Kuhlmann,
M. Reizet substituted several metallic oxides for spongy platina.
The results which he obtained are very interesting, and throw great
light on the obscure cause of catalytic action*. M. Reizet states, that                                                                   .
with an apparatus, consisting of two bottles, each of the capacity of
about 60 cubic inches, for evolving hydrogen gas and nitric oxide,
and 145 grains of sesquioxide of iron, heated in one end of an ana
lysis tube, he obtained sufficient ammonia to completely saturate
360 grains of commercial hydrochloric acid.—Ibid.

       Currents produced by the Leyden-electrical Induction.
 I.
     THE      facility with which, by means of the instruments
          described in the preceding memoirt, the presence of
 an instantaneous electric current in a metallic wire is detected,
 encouraged me to seek indications also of the currents which
 are derived from actuation or induction.
     Ihad surrounded a little cylinder of iron with two copper
 wires covered with silk, which formed two parallel coils, and
having placed the cylinder upon the cap of a needle, I made
 use of this apparatus as a re-electrometer, the delicacy of
 which varied as       I
                      made the currents pass through one only
 of the said  coils, or through both at the same time, or joined
 them so that the current had to pass through one first, and
 then through the other; with these two parallel coils       made                 I
 my first attempt on the Leyden-electrical induction.     Having
 however taken that re-electrometric cylinder from the cap of
 the needle, I connected one of the wires which surrounded it
 with the ends of the coil of a re-electrometer, and the Leyden
jar being discharged upon the other wire, connecting           ex
 tremities with the two coatings,    have seen the needle

    I suspected  that the deviations obtained in this and other
similar experiments might proceed, not from induction occa
sioned immediately by the instantaneous current of the jar,
but from magneto-electric induction, produced by the tem
porary magnetization of the iron cylinder surrounded by the
two coils. However, the cylinder being taken away, and a small
glass rod substituted, the same phaenomenon took place.

     I  suspended the connexion between the little copper cylin

  instead with the ends of the coil which surrounded               and then        it,

  deviations         no

 distance, so to remove my doubt that some part of the dis
 charge might fall upon the                       bodies instead of
 the  extremity   of the metallic band  upon which I intended the
 spark to pass, I attached two long copper wires to the        ex
 tremities of the said band, and I went to some meters distance
 to discharge the jar; but the effects upon the re-electrometer
 were not different from those already observed.
    If  these experiments do not serve to show that the current
 of the Leyden jar passing through a metal causes in a neigh
 bouring metal an electric current by induction, they would
 yet prove a very singular and unexpected property of the
 discharge of the Leyden jar; that I mean of dispersing itself
 in part in the worst conductors, even after having begun to
  traverse the best, since it must be said that the electric fluid
 descending by the vertical band scarcely reaches the point
 where this touches the wool or the sealing-wax, when a part
 of it quickly passes through the wool itself, and finding the
 band of lead underneath, a fraction of this part of the cur
 rent passes into the band itself which is under the wool, and
 reaches the external coating of the jar by the shortest way;
 whilst the other fraction makes a much greater turn to traverse
 the coil around the re-electrometric iron, and at length reach
 ing the wool from the opposite part, and there passing through
 the confining stratum, rejoins the other part of the larger band
 communicating with the external coating of the jar. That such
 a dispersion and division of discharge does not take place,
 seems proved by the experiments which I shall now describe.
     VI. I made the experiments of the preceding section, but
instead of laying the plate upon which the jar was discharged
upon the confining portion for the space of two decimeters,
I   caused it to touch it only at a few points, bending it up
wards at both sides; and I observed that if that part of the
plate parallel to the under one was distant from the latter only
a few centimeters, the effects upon the re-electrometer were
 still visible; but when the distance was two decimeters, there
were no longer any deviations in the re-electrometer.
     Having again laid the said plate upon the confining stratum,
I   cut in two the leaden band which communicated with the
ends of the re-electrometer, and I placed near, between them,
the sections, without their touching; and this was done, be
cause, if in discharging the Leyden jar a part of the current
were carried upon this plate, crossing the confining part,     all
this portion must pass through the coil  of    the re-electrometer,
and thence     produce   much   greater deviations than when the
band offered   a    continued conductor.        on
                                             But,     the contrary,
 the effects in  this case were nothing; consequently,   in   these

stated,    to
            the re-electrometric coil.

I     closed also the circuit formed       this third band,       con                         by
necting the ends            of   it,
                          and covered       free space      seven de                 of
cimeters with silk, and attached                  to  a
                                            fourth uncovered band
in   the manner now      described;   the   Leyden    jar being dis
charged upon this, there were unequivocal signs                                        of         an         in
duction which we will call                  of
                                  the third order, and       thus ob                 I
tained also the induced currents                  of
                                        the fourth and fifth orders,
 by adding another ring similar          those described, and then
                                                  to
another still.
    XIV. After the result here stated, there appeared me
                                                                                                  or of to
no   longer any doubt that the instantaneous currents              the
confining armatures cause currents                         by
                                              true induction       ac
tuation    inthe conductors near which they pass; and              ad                             I
dressed myself      study the properties
                       to                    this action.  of  wished                  I
first to  see whether the induction would take place even                                                    if
there should      be
                  some metallic stratum         well    the confining
                                                                as           as
strata between the actuating and actuated conductors.
   Between two bands               of
                            lead, both covered with silk, placed                       I
another, with care,       order that there might
                             in                           no metallic            be
contact between the bands.         Having connected one            the                            of
covered bands with the wire         the      of
                                         re-electrometer,    and dis

504        Prof. Marianini on the Currents produced by the
charged the Leyden jar upon the other similarly covered, the
needle deviated, as when there was no naked band between
the actuating and the actuated plates.
    But if the two ends of the metallic band between the ac
tuating and the actuated plates were connected, then the
Leyden jar being discharged as above, there was no deviation
in the re-electrometer, or it was very small, and only took
place when the jar was considerably charged; which appears
 to me to prove, that when the actuating current operates upon
 a closed metallic circuit, it induces in it a contrary current,
 which either wholly or in part destroys the effect of the    ac
 tuating current upon the second actuated band.
     I  connected the ends of the middle band with the re-elec
 trometer, and now connected the ends of the third band with
 them, now employed them unconnected. In the first case, the
jar being discharged upon the first band, the deviations were
 somewhat small, and in the second evidently greater. There
 was not so much difference in the two cases as in the prece
 ding experiment, in spite of the small interval between the ac
 tuating band and the immediately actuated one.
     XV. Two silvered copper wires were placed parallel to
 each other, each by means of two pegs of wood covered with
 sealing-wax, at one meter distant from each other, and move
 able, so as to allow the distance between the wires to be
 varied, while they still remained parallel.   Having connected
 one of these with the ends of the wire of a re-electrometer,
 and discharged the Leyden jar upon the other,         I saw that
  the induction visibly took place, even when the distance be
 tween the actuating and actuated wires was seven centime
  terS.
     I  have already observed in § XI., that when the actuation
  only took place on a small space of the actuated conductor,
  the effect was less.   Now, applying the ends of the re-electro
  metric wire to two points more or less distant from each other,
  I have observed that the signs of an induced current began
  to appear when the extent of wire subject to actuation was
  about a centimeter and a half, and the distance from the ac
  tuating wire two millimeters. When the actuated wire was
  three centimeters long a degree of deviation was obtained,
  and this increased to ten degrees when the extent of actuated
  wire was six or seven decimeters. It did not increase on the
 wire being considerably lengthened, which I tried to the ex
  tent of a meter.     I have observed the same on varying the
  length of the actuating wire.
             I
     XVI. connected the ends of a perfect Nobili's multiplier
  with those of the actuated metallic wire, and discharged the

         Induction          of instantaneous Electric Currents.                       505
Leyden jar upon the actuating wire under the most favour
able circumstances for obtaining the induced current; but the
galvanometer did not make the smallest movement; nor was
the result different when experimenting with the bands of lead
instead of the copper wires; and this proves that such ac
tuated currents are instantaneous, like the actuating.
   XVII. On obliging the actuating current to pass through
a metallic wire several hundred meters in length, the induced
current was excited; nor did I perceive any different effect
when it did not pass through that long wire.     The same re
sult also occurred when I forced the induced current to pass
through the long wire before reaching the re-electrometer.
   The induction did not fail either, when, instead of one end
of the actuated wire being in metallic contact with one end
 of the coil of the re-electrometer, both were immersed in
water, and distant from each other more than a decimeter;
nor was the result different when the actuating current was
made to pass through a stratum of water more or less thick.
   The inductions of the second and third orders also, did
not fail when made to pass through a long metallic wire or a
stratum of water, although under such circumstances they
appeared much weaker.
     XVIII.   Making use of a small iron cylinder surrounded
by two parallel coils, similar to that mentioned in §           con            I.,
                                                                               I
nected the two ends         one  of them,  and  of
                                                 having discharged
upon the other the small Leyden jar charged              fifteen de       to
grees,  no  movement       the magnetized needle ensued; and the
                                 of
reason appears        me   to         to   be
                                 that the current induced        the                 in
circuit  so  formed was   contrary,  and  nearly  equal    magneti        in
zing force      to
                the immediate current.
     have also constantly observed, that the somewhat weaker
              to to byof
currents        the first two       three residual charges were
                                                or
indicated       one      twoordegrees      deviation; and this,
                                                       of                                 as
                           i.
it appears       me, arises from the weakest current not being
sufficient      cause     sensible induced current
                                a                          the wire       in
circuit already mentioned.
   Thus I    have seen that      stronger charge, for example
                                           a                                              of
forty  or fifty degrees, was indicated       several degrees by  de                  of
viation; never,                  many      so          as
                                           were observed when the
other wire was unconnected: and this shows that when the
wire was joined the immediate current prevailed over the                                  in
duced.
  XIX. The phaenomena induction which have hitherto
                                           of                 of      I
spoken, presented               no  me; but this was not the
                                                     of to

most    the experiments
       of                    this subject  onmade use     three   I              of

 506          Prof. Marianini on the Currents produced by the
 small Leyden jars not having more than a square decimeter
 of exterior coating, and with each of these I observed that the
  re-electrometric deviations indicated that the induced currents
  were directly contrary to the actuating.                   for example, the If,
 discharge        the jar
                 of            the direction
                                  or                 the band,     of      the ac        or   of
 tuating wire parallel          the  to in
                                      actuated,   proceeded       from   right                            to
 left;   inthe band,              in
                                  the neighbouring actuated wire, the
 induced current passed from left               right: and, seeing
                                                              to                this               in
  an analogy         to
                    the volta-electric induction              Faraday”,       of felt              I
 more and more         persuaded     that the  phaenomena        observed      pro
 ceeded really from Leyden-electrical induction. But quickly                             I
 began     todoubt        when applied myself
                             it         I                  confirm, with the
                                                                           to
 large jars, the results obtained with the small; for,                       using            on
 these, the deviations        theinstrument indicated that the induced
                                   of
 current, and that which caused                proceeded  it,      the same         in                  di
 rection    inthe two     parallel  and    neighbouring      conductors.
 I     doubted whether, from the quantity                    electricity beingof

                                       to                                   given         in   a

                               Savary        steel   needles,

                                                                           to

                                  I                                                                  to   a
 hundred, the inductions                the smaller jars were always

 I     turned   my    attention               to
                                      the construction           the little jars,   of

 difference      of

 on   that  discontinuity               of
                                  the coating; and             long held this I
 opinion, from having observed that two large jars, having the
 external coatings formed                 many small squares
                                              of    so                   tin-foil,        of
of  about one centimeter square, attached                  the glass,      to that              so

                  Induction    of instantaneous Electric Currents.                                               507
the cause of those different effects, although remote, depended
on the different capacity of the jars; for the large jars, with dis
continuous external coatings, may be considered as furnished
with small electric capacities only, as many of these small squares
remain idle in charging or discharging the jars themselves.
    Considering, then, that the least capacity of the confining
coatings involves as a consequence, that with similar charges,
that      is, furnished with                an
                                     equal quantity         electricity, the           of
spark must pass              greater distance, and thence find similar
                              to   a                                                                    a

                              effecting                                                 in it
I  wished          see,
                    to        if           retardation     a the discharges
of  the large jars, there might perhaps             the same direction       be                                   of
the induced current that was observed with jars                  less power.                    of
I     therefore caused the         discharges      the   large jars      of

508            Prof. Marianini on the Currents produced by the
   Saline water being substituted for the spring water, a devia
tion of five degrees was obtained.
   In order the better to assure myself of the insulation,                           I
twisted round the tube a band of lead covered with silk;                             I
repeated the experiments several times, and the results were
always such as to lead to a conclusion that it was not neces
                                                         i.
sary that the electricity should pass through a metal to cause
the Leyden-electrical induction; it being sufficient that it
should pass through some conductor, in          that the passage
might be accomplished with sufficient celerity.
    XXI. I     connected the liquid contained in the tube which
 was used in the experiments above described, with the ends
 of the re-electrometric wire, and I then discharged the Leyden
 jar upon the extremities of the band which surrounded the
  tube itself. The needle deviated almost a degree.       renewed          I
 the experiment; but on repeating the same discharge in the
 same direction six times, I found the needle deviated four de
 grees. Hence we see that it is not necessary that the actuated
 conductor should be metallic, in order that the Leyden-elec
 trical induction should take place.
    From the experiments of this and the preceding paragraph,
 it may be deduced, that the induction would take place if
 neither the actuating nor the actuated conductor were metal
                   I              I
 lic; which, believe, have also verified by apposite experi
 ments.
    XXII.     Having interrupted the actuating wire in another
 place,    I
           connected one end of it with the external coating of a
 Leyden jar not charged, and the other with the internal+.                           I
afterwards discharged a jar equal to that in power upon the
 wire itself. The induction took place, and the charge was
divided between the two jars, which proves that it is not ne
cessary that the identical fluid of one coating should pass to
the other, to produce the phaenomena of Leyden-electrical
induction.
    XXIII.     Also the simple sparks drawn from the prime con
ductor may produce currents by actuation.       Whilst one of the
wires described in § XV. was connected with the re-electro
metric coil, I         let
                    pass some sparks upon one extremity        the             of
other, keeping the other extremity        communication with the
                                                  in
ground; and observed some movement
                  I                               the magnetized
                                                            in
needle     atevery spark  that appeared.
    Once, with fifteen sparks directed upon the actuating wire,
a   magnetization     the iron
                        in              of
                                 the re-electrometer was obtained
with the induced currents, which caused the needle         deviate        to
three degrees.

            Induction of instantaneous           Electric Currents.               509
     But reserving to myself to treat, on another occasion, of the
induced currents produced by sparks and by other electric
currents, artificial or natural, it appears to me that we may in
the mean time conclude,-
   1st. That the instantaneous current of the Leyden jar, or
of the Franklinian square” passing through a metallic cur
rent, causes an electric current, also instantaneous, in another
metallic conductor, near to          it,
                                  and forming     closed circuit,
                                                                a
a phaenomenon which         call ILeyden-electrical  induction, be
cause analogous -         to
                       that called          by
                                       Faraday volta-electric                     in
duction.
  2nd. That the same induced current may cause      another          in
conductor    second current
               a               induction; and this second,
                                       of
again another, and    on; whence may
                               so         produced currentsbe
  Leyden-electrical induction,  the second and third orders,
                                           of
.   C.
   3rd. That the Leyden-electrical induction also takes place
when the circuit through the metallic actuated conductor                           is
closed    byvery long metallic conductor,
            a                                   even       con  or    by    a
ductor not  wholly metallic.
   4th. That such induction also takes place when the dis
charge    the Leyden jar traverses
          of                           very long metallic con
                                                 a
ductor, and also     non-metallic conductor; nor does the
phaenomenon fail          to a
                     appear, when        not the identical fluid
                                                it   is
of one coating which passes          to
                                the other.
   5th. That the induced current takes       the actuated con
                                                          in
ductor the same direction which the inducing current takes
in the actuating conductor whenever the jar has great electric
capacity, and      not too weakly charged.
                     is                          But the direction
   opposite when the charge            jar   rather weak,
                                                                          or or
is                                the of              is     when
the electricity has    pass through
                           to             bad conductor,
                                                a            when
the jar       small electric capacity.
          is
          of
   6th. That the phaenomena                 of
                                        induction may        seen,        be
although neither the actuating nor the actuated conductor                          is
metallic.
   7th. That finally, such inductions are not exclusively from
Leyden jars and the Franklinian square, but are obtained
also with instantaneous electric currents from other sources.

(Dr. J. Milner), and a trial took place in his court, which lasted eight
days. The result was, that a form of recantation was proposed to
Mr. Frend, which he refused to sign; and sentence of “banish
ment” from the University was passed.             This banishment is not
expulsion, as persons unacquainted with the University generally
believe, but a deprivation of the right to reside within the limits of
the University; and, accordingly, though the sentence was confirmed
on appeal, Mr. Frend continued to hold his fellowship till his mar
riage, and remained to the day of his death a Master of Arts, and a
member of Jesus College.         He retired of course from Cambridge,
and came to London, where he maintained himself till 1806, by
adding the profits of teaching and writing to the income derived
from his fellowship.       When the Rock Life Assurance was founded
(1806), Mr. Frend, who had previously been consulted in the for
mation, was appointed actuary of that company, a post in which he
remained until a severe illness compelled him (in 1826) to retire
from active life.    His health, however, recovered, and he continued
his mental employments with an activity very unusual at his age,
until the beginning of the year 1840, when he was attacked by
paralysis, under which he lingered with almost total loss of speech
and motion, though with the smallest possible decay of mind or
memory, until February 21 of the last year, when he closed a life,
which is regarded, even by those who differed from him, as a splendid
example of honesty in the pursuit of truth, and of undaunted deter
mination in the assertion of all that conscience required.
    The losses and inconveniences which attended his banishment
from college were not among the greatest risks which he ran.                At
 a subsequent period, when the political struggle was at               height,          its
 and government prosecutions were frequently directed against the
 mere expression        opinion, Mr. Frend was one

 was currently said, that had the government succeeded               obtaining         in
 convictions, there was         an
                             intention       instituting several more; and

 another remarkable person, his own most intimate friend Baron
  Maseres, whose leading idea          seems      have been

 all     who had done the same thing.
     There was also another peculiar circumstance which                        doubt                                     no

  and was,     the opinion

  the Deity, led him much into the acquaintance               his elder brethren,          of

                      Royal Astronomical Society.                     515
  as he frequently  termed them, of the Jewish race; and he would
  have held any biography of himself very imperfect which omitted to
 note how strongly he felt toward their persuasion.       It seldom hap
  pens that any person devotes himself so keenly to any history with
 out imbibing some opinion of the superiority of its subjects; and
  Mr. Frend carried to the very verge of paradox, or it may be a little
 beyond, the notion that the mathematical and astronomical science
 of ancient Judea was substantially equal at least to that of any
 period of modern Europe, not excepting the present. Their lunar
 calendar was as good as if it had been made from modern observa
 tions, and much better adapted to represent a long period than any
 other; as much of pure mathematics as any one ought to admit
 flourished among them in the time of Solomon. It is needless to say,
 that not a vestige of historical evidence was ever produced in favour
 of these opinions, nor did we ever hear of any modern Jew who had
 carried his notions of the learning of his ancestors to such a length.
 Among modern nations, Mr. Frend had a peculiar respect for the
 Chinese, and was impressed with the opinion (not by any means
peculiar to himself) that their government and social state is a model.
The rudiments of science which he found among these nations, the
ancient Hebrews and the modern Chinese, were easily magnified by
his temperament, which was both sanguine and contemplative, into
as much of astronomy and arithmetic as he had been able to save
from the pollution of attraction and negative quantities; conse
quently, these countries were the depositories of real science, un
corrupted by sophistry.       For the ancient Greeks and their writings
 he had an open contempt; they were children who had learned of
the Jews, and spoiled their masters' doctrines: the good was due
to their teachers, the bad was their own. All this time, and in the
midst of such strange singularities of opinion as were never long
absent from his mind, there was an eagerness to see the good of
every thing actually present, which made his approbation very easy
to gain. No one who talked with him could soon fathom the wide
difference of sentiment between the two; for whatever might be the
subject, there was a side on which it could be favourably viewed;
and for that side Mr. Frend's mind, or that part of it which regu
lated his first expressions, had the quality (we must not say the at
traction) of a magnet. His persuasion of the rapid advances which

ran dry; and his interest in every thing new, which promised im
provement to any class of mankind, in any one of those particulars,
was, even after he was unable to speak or move, a commanding in
stinct, which he could not have disobeyed if he would.          This un
varying effort to detect good in whatever came before him was es
sentially linked to his religious feelings, the source of his daily com
fort, by the view which he never ceased to take of the ultimate con
sequences of Christianity; which he looked upon as the gradual re
storer of mankind to a state of perfect goodness and knowledge.

 asked which would, perhaps, add some force to the preceding re

 written four pages a-day, or thereabouts, of theological discussion
 during his whole experimental career, run off with such a splendid
 portion of the first-fruits of real chemistry?
   The other work of Mr. Frend, his ‘Elements of Algebra,’ will lead
 every one who peruses it to think, with sincere regret, of his having
preferred rejection to amendment; and will be a lesson to writers
yet to come, that they should let that stand which appears to lead
 to truth, whatever warning they may think it necessary to give that

is now nearly completed, and ready for the press, and will contain
above 8000 stars. To each star will be annexed not only the annual
precession, but also the secular variation of such precession, and the
proper motion when it can be ascertained. The usual constants for
determining the apparent positions of the stars at any required
epoch will also be given. This work cannot fail of being a valuable
addition to the resources of the astronomer.
   The Members may be interested in learning that the Standard Scale
 of this Society has been reported to Her Majesty's Government,
 as one of the best means of regaining an accurate determination of
 the Standard Yard that was destroyed in the conflagration of the two
 Houses of Parliament; and that an indirect overture has been made for
 the acquisition of              it,
                       should the Government eventually consider                                                 it

intendence and responsibility of the present Astronomer Royal, and
at his own suggestion. That work is now completed, and it is un
 derstood that the funds required for printing the results will be fur
 nished by the Board of Admiralty. The planetary places are com
 pared with the best existing tables, and the difference in heliocentric
 longitude and latitude given exactly as in the recent volumes of the
 Greenwich Observations, with a term which takes into account the
 errors of the solar tables, should any sensible errors be therein found.

solar system, the mean density of the earth. The slight discrepancies
which still remain, and which appear to show that something de
pends on the substance employed, and more on unknown circum
stances connected with the torsion-balance itself, are not such as to
throw any reasonable doubt on the density obtained being true
within less than a hundredth part of the whole. So much can safely
be said at the present time; and it is not improbable that a still
 smaller limit of error may be substituted for the one just named.
Mr. Baily's final report may be soon expected, and in the meantime
 some detail of the history of the experiment is actually in the hands
 of the Secretaries, and will shortly be read at an ordinary meeting
of the Society. The work itself will form the fourteenth volume of
the Memoirs, and a portion of the tables is already in the hands of
the printer.
   The Council have the satisfaction of announcing that the thir
teenth volume of the Memoirs will be ready, perhaps, before the
completion of the twelfth; Mr. Baily, having been lately engaged
in reprinting, at his own expense, the catalogues of Ptolemy, Ulugh
Beigh, Tycho Brahé, Halley, and Hevelius, in the type and form of
our Memoirs, has offered the whole to the Council, to form the
volume in question. As might have been expected, these catalogues
have undergone such a revision and comparison as will materially
increase their utility, and make these integrant portions of the                                            hi
story of astronomy familiar to the observer of our own day, who now
looks upon them as difficulties, and refers to them (if, indeed, he
have so much as the means of doing so at all) as little as he can
help. The outlay saved to the Society by the manner in which this
volume comes to us, though deserving and obtaining our warm ac
knowledgements, is the least part of the benefit; nor could the Council
have omitted one word of the preceding testimony, if the manuscript,
being, as it   is,
                such     would gladly have been received, had been
                                as
presented     in   the usual manner.
     The whole       of the volume  printed, excepting the preface,

   In the Address of the President at the last Anniversary of the
Society, honourable mention was made of Mr. Henderson's investi
gations relative to the presumed parallax of a Centauri.     These                           in
vestigations have been continued to the present time; and from some
observations recently received by him from Mr. Maclear, at the Cape
of Good Hope, he is confirmed in his opinion relative to this subject,
and considers the parallax to be about 1". The Council trust that
they shall soon receive from Mr. Henderson a detailed memoir on
this important subject, which will then be read at the ordinary meet
ing of the Society.
   The Council regret that they have to announce the retirement of
Lieut. Raper from the office of Secretary to this Society; an office
which he has filled with the greatest zeal and attention, and which
calls from this meeting the expression of their best thanks.  Nothing
but the love of science and the talents which he possesses could
have induced him to take so active and important a duty, often
times at a sacrifice of private ease and convenience: but this remem
brance is at once the source of our approbation and the cause of our
regret.
   The Council trust that the award of the medal to Prof. Hansen will
meet the approbation of the Society.       The labours of M. Hansen
are well known to those astronomers and mathematicians who have
attended to, and cultivated, that branch of inquiry which more espe
cially relates to those abstruse and intricate points of investigation
that require the greatest exercise of mental exertion.     The grounds
on which this award has been made will be more       fully explained in
the Address of the President at the close of this  Report.

    It is for researches in this second department of our science, un
doubtedly the most arduous and difficult of the two, that your Council
have awarded the Society's Gold Medal for the present year to
Professor Hansen, the Director of the Observatory at Seeberg, and,
according to annual custom, the duty devolves on me of stating to
you the grounds of their decision. The subject is not very suscep
tible of popular explanation; in fact, the especial services which M.
Hansen has rendered to astronomy consist in the development of new
formulae, and the exhibition of new artifices of calculation, in the
remotest and most abstruse departments of mathematical analysis.
Nevertheless, I trust I shall be able to convey such an idea of their
nature and object as will enable you at least to appreciate the mo
tives which have influenced your Council in conferring on our                                           il
lustrious Associate this testimony of the Society's approbation.
    In proceeding to determine the motions of a celestial body u
by a central force, and disturbed by the action of other bodies, the
accelerating forces in the direction of rectangular coordinates are
expressed by three differential equations of the second order, which,
as is well known, can only be integrated by approximation.                    To
obtain    approximate    integrals, two methods have been        principally  fol
lowed.      The first consists in deducing from the differential equa
tions, expressions for the variations of the radius vector, longitude,
and latitude of the disturbed body in a function of the disturbing
force and       its
                 partial differentials; and         integrating these expres

                    developing them          series which proceed according

                      of                                             else     theor             by
method     of parabolic   quadratures. This          the most obvious method
                                                            is
of    determining the perturbations, and also the simplest when the
approximations are only carried            terms to            of
                                                       the order     the eccen    of
tricities and inclinations; but when           closer approximation becomes
                                                      a
necessary, and terms          ofhigher order are required

the expressions become complicated, and the method accordingly
loses its advantages.
    The other method          obtaining approximate results
                              of                                       known          is                in

be referred to Newton himself, the accelerating forces which act on
a celestial body are conceived to be divided into two parts, one of
which renders integrable the differential equations between the co
ordinates and the time, and gives the elliptic orbit which the body
would describe about a centre of force if there was no disturbance;
while the arbitrary quantities introduced by this first integration are
supposed to be rendered variable by the other part, and their varia
tions determined by means of differential equations of the first order,
whose integrals (usually obtained by successive approximation) give
the elements of the true perturbed orbit, from which the radius
vector, longitude, and latitude of the body at any given time are com
puted.
    The first example of this method of computing the planetary per
turbations was given by Euler in the Berlin Memoirs for 1749,
where he obtains the differential equations of the first order of the
inclination and longitude of the node by varying the arbitrary con
stants which express these two elements in the elliptic orbit.       But

   On taking a general view of Hansen's method *, the point which
first presents itself as remarkable, and that indeed in which the
novelty of his process essentially consists, is the original and highly
ingenious artifice which he employs in order to arrive at the ex
 pressions for the 'perturbed coordinates,     namely, the longitude,
radius vector, and latitude.           In the usual method of proceeding, the
arbitrary constants introduced by integration are determinate func
tions of the elliptic elements and time, and the perturbations of co
ordinates are obtained by supposing the elements to vary.                 Instead
of the true time, M. Hansen introduces into the functions an ana
logous, but indeterminate quantity, and considers the elements as
invariable.       He then determines the variations which this quantity
must      undergo     (in other words, he finds what alteration must be
made in the time, in the place where it enters explicitly into the
 elliptic formulae), in order that the elliptic formulae, with altered
 time and invariable elements, may give the same value of the inde
 terminate functions as would be found by using the true time and
 variable elements. Suppose, for example, the function of elements
 and time to be the true longitude; then the problem, according to
 M. Hansen's method of viewing                   amounts       it,

 of expressing the lunar and planetary perturbations, so as to render
 the numerical calculations more easy and more certain. There                                                              is,

lunar perturbations, which presents difficulties of a peculiar kind, is
not so far advanced, and much is still wanting to render it complete
even as a symbolical theory.          But in a recent number of the Nach

been for some time engaged, are now proceeding towards a conclu

thods apply with as much advantage to the moon as to the planets.

                                            in

apparent, and owing to the real revolution                                        of the solar system
round it.
   Applying these remarks to the case of the star 61 Cygni, and
assuming Bessel's value of the parallax, and the usually assumed
elements of the orbit of this binary system, it appears evident that
this system is unconnected with the solar system. It does not, how
ever, appear impossible that both systems revolve round a third at an
immensely greater distance than that of the sun from the earth.
   The author, in conclusion, adverts to the great importance, in
the present advanced state of practical astronomy, of noting the po
sitions of the stars having the greatest proper motions with        pos                                     all

                                            of       discovering whether          of
the motions are performed         one plane, and whether they are uni

   The method of coordinates here employed by Mr. Graves is entirely
distinct from that which is developed by Mr. Davies in a paper in
the 12th vol. of the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
Mr. Graves apprehends, however, that he has been anticipated in the
choice of these coordinates by M. Gudermann of Cleves, who is the
author of an “Outline of Analytic Spherics,” which Mr. Graves
has been unable to procure.
   The President communicated a new demonstration of Fourier's
theorem.
   A letter was read from Professor Holmboe, accompanying his me
moir, De Priscd Re Monetarid Norwegia, &c., and requesting to know
from the Academy whether any of the coins described in that work
are found in Ireland *.
   July 12+.—Part I. of a “Memoir on the Dialytic Method of                                              Eli

                    Sylvester, Esq., A.M., of Trinity College, Dublin,
and Professor of Natural Philosophy in University College, London,
was read.
   The author confines himself in this part to the treatment of two
equations, the final and other derivees of which form the subject of
investigation.
   The author was led to reconsider his former labours in this de
partment of the general theory by finding certain results announced
by M. Cauchy in L’Institut, March Number of the present year,
which flow as obvious and immediate consequences from Mr. Syl
vester's own previously published principles and method.

and    let n = m + 1, where i is zero or any positive                              value (as may be).
   Let any such quantities as z" U, r*                       V, be termed augmentatives
of U or V.
   To obtain the derivee of a degree s units lower than V, we must
join s augmentatives of U with s -- of V. Then out of 2 s + 1
equations

    The author then enters into a disquisition relating to the number
of terms which will appear in the final derivee, and concludes this
first part with the statement of two general canons, each of which
affords as many tests for determining whether a prepared combina
tion of coefficients can enter into the final derivee of any number of
equations as there are units in that number, but so connected as
together only to afford double that number, less one of independent
conditions.
  The first of these canons refers simply to the number of letters
drawn out of each of the given equations (supposed homogeneous);
the second to what he proposes to call the weight of every term in
the derivee in respect to each of the variables which are to be elimi
nated.
   The author subjoins, for the purpose of conveying a more accurate
conception of his Pyramid of derivation, examples of the mode in
which it is constructed.

 2. and 6. of the preceding sections.             The author also refers to the
railway section near Droitwich *, and identifies with the bone-bed the
 two-feet band of white micaceous sandstone six feet above the top
 of the green marl, as it contains the same indeterminable small
 bivalve. He has also examined sections of the lias escarpment at
 Norton near Kempsey, and Cracombe Hill near Evesham, and has
invariably detected, a few feet above the base of the lias clay, a
thin band of white sandstone containing the same shell.
    The bone-bed at Axmouth, Watchett, Aust, Westbury, and other
southern localities, occupies precisely the same geological position,
or a few feet above the top of the greenish marls which terminate
the New Red system, though much more rich in organic remains;
and Mr. Strickland draws attention to this remarkable instance of a
very thin stratum ranging over a distance of about 112 miles.
    The great abundance of fossils in some parts of this stratum the
author considers an indication that a much longer period probably

   Lastly, Mr. Strickland notices the occurrence of precisely analo
gous bone-beds in the Upper Ludlow rock, described by Mr. Mur
chison in the “Silurian System’ (p. 198), and in Caldy Island, near
the junction of the carboniferous limestone with the old red sand

544        Geological Society:                 Mr. Colthurst             on Contortions
in his paper read at Plymouth, respecting the mode of accumulation
of the bones.    He states that these osseous remains cannot have
been derived from the emptying of some cave, because the mass of
superincumbent matter which has been removed from above the
beach proves that the bones must have been deposited where they
were found at a very ancient period, and long before they could have
been affected by human agency. There are also no known caves
containing bones sufficiently near.            On the contrary, says Dr.
Moore, if the sea was at one time at the level indicated by the beach,
the Hoe must have been an island accessible by animals at low
water, and there appears no obstacle to the supposition that the
bears might have selected the beach to devour their prey; and the
stranded whale may have added to the banquet. Whether the bones
were drifted or not, their occurrence on the top of the beach, and
not in     it,
            prevents, the author says, any identity              time      their       of             in
origin; but that the beach previously existed, and was                   marine             to
origin,     proved

tion  ofthe beach far above     any  point attained    by  the sea   during  the
greatest storms, states that the deposit must have been elevated by
natural causes; and that, however uncertain the exact period               such                        of
 an event,    seems

many   of the contortions, faults and dislocations       strata, especially       of
among sedimentary rocks, and which are commonly attributed                                                  to
the agency      forces acting from below rather than

without.
   The embankment fifty-four feet height, and rests
                                is                       vegetable

soil, beneath which are four feet alluvial clay;    of
                                                 then occurs   bed                                     a

            produced in the strata beneath an embankment.                                                    545
of gravel varying from ten to three feet in thickness, but which thins
out in some places, and under it is the regular London clay, traversed
in almost every direction by slimy joints. The surface of the country
gradually slopes towards the Brent, the difference of level between the
south side of the embankment and the Brent being about twenty feet.
   On the night of the 21st of May 1837 the embankment began to
settle, and in the morning it was found that the foundation had given
way, and that on the south side, or towards the Brent, a mass of
 ground, fifty feet long and fifteen feet wide, had protruded from under
 the earthwork.      During the four succeeding months this mass con
 tinued to increase in dimensions, and the disturbance to extend, so
 that the surface, for a considerable distance from the base of the
 embankment, had assumed an undulated outline, and the subjacent
 beds, where cut into, exhibited corresponding curvatures, overlappings
 and cracks, the whole of which are described in the memoir, but can
 not be rendered intelligible without diagrams.            In the embankment
 itself the symptoms of failure were confined to a settlement of about
fifteen feet, and a large fissure near the top, on the side opposite to
that where the foundation had yielded, and which extended the whole
length of the slip. To this fissure, and                          its
                                                      dip towards the disturb

                          of

    At the end twelve additional months, during which the embank
                     of

 bodies discovered in the laminated clay; and secondly, to describe
  the various forms which the mouth of the Ammonite assumes in
 different species and in different stages of growth in the same
 species.
    The fossils obtained from the laminated clay are stated to be as
 follows:–1. A succulent plant. 2. Lignite, with oysters sometimes

548         Geological Society:            Mr. Lyell        on the Recession
resting on what resembles a sepiostaire. He mentions likewise ten or
twelve species of fishes, but without giving names; also coprolites.
   2. Respecting the form of the mouth of the Ammonites and the
changes at different periods of growth, Mr. Pearce states his belief,
that the terminal lip or mouth has a different shape in the young
shell of almost every species, but assumes in the old a straight out
line, and that he has been aware of this circumstance several years.
Of cases of young shells with differently shaped lips, he mentions
Ammonites Brongniarti (Inf. oolite), A. sublavis (Oxf. clay), A. ob
tusus (Lias), A. Kanigii (Kelloway Rock, the mature shell is stated
to have a straight mouth), A. Calloviensis (Kelloway Rock, the lip of
the old shell is stated to be slightly contracted and to terminate with
gently undulating sides), A. Walcottii (Lias), and A. Goodhalli, fur
nished in the mature state with a single horn-like projection at the
front of the mouth. In addition to these species he enumerates those
noticed in the preceding part of the paper. Mr. Pearce is further of
opinion that at different periods of the formation of the shell the la
teral processes were absorbed and reproduced, and that therefore
they are found in various stages of growth, but are invariably want
ing in the mature shell. In some species in which the successive
mouths were much contracted or expanded, the new shell the author
says was continued without the absorption of the lip, leaving a highly
projecting rib or a deep furrow”.
   After a careful examination of upwards of twenty species in his
collection, with perfect mouths of               all
                                          ages and from different strata,
not including the Oxford clay, Mr. Pearce has found the external
chamber       vary considerably

structure of the country.         Mr. R. Bakewell in 1830°, published an
account of the country adjacent to the Falls, and Mr. De la Beche
in 1831 t, endeavoured to point out the gradual manner in which
the receding Falls, if they should ever reach Lake Erie, would dis
charge the waters of the lake; Prof. D. Rogers also in 1835 f
showed distinctly, that, as the Falls retrograde, they would cut
through rocks entirely distinct from those over which the waters are
now precipitated, and correctly represents the superior limestone at
Buffalo as newer than the limestone of the Falls, though he omits
the intervening saliferous formation. Mr. Conrad likewise, in his

|     Geological Report             of
                             the State    New York for 1838.

550            Geological Society:          Mr. Lyell            on the Recession
and layers of chert, the whole deposit was first called the corni
tiferous formation by Prof. Eaton. In this part of the State of New
York, and still further to the west, in Upper Canada, the limestone
is only 50 feet thick, whereas at Schoharie in the Helderberg moun
tains, 300 miles to the eastward, its thickness is 300 feet.
    2. The Onondago salt group.–This series of beds, Mr. Lyell says,
is extremely unlike any described member of the European Silurian
group.    With the exception of a stratum of limestone at the top
containing Cytherina, it consists of red and green marls with beds of
gypsum, the former being undistinguishable from the marls of the new
red system of England; and they are also destitute of fossils.      Salt
springs are of frequent occurrence, but no rock salt has been disco
vered in the group. The breadth of the zone of country occupied by
the deposit is not less than 16 miles, and Mr. Hall infers from it and
the slight southerly dip of the strata, that the entire thickness in the
neighbourhood of the Niagara is at least 800 feet, an estimate con
firmed by the nearest sections eastward of the river. In some parts
of the State of New York the thickness is not less than 1000 feet.
Along the Niagara the formation has been greatly denuded, and is
covered by superficial drift, except at a few places.
    3. The Niagara group.–This series of beds commences near the
rapids, above the great cataract. It comprises, 1st, the Niagara, or
Lockport limestone, and 2ndly, the Niagara, or Rochester shale;
and it contains in both divisions fossils identical with those of the
Wenlock limestone of England, with others peculiar to North Ame
rica. The limestone at the rapids and the Falls is 120 feet thick; the
upper 40 feet, being thin-bedded, have given way to the frost and the
action of the stream; but the lower 80 feet, being massive, forms at
the cataract a precipice, beneath which occurs the shale, also 80 feet
thick.
    4. The Protean group.–Under the water at the base of the Falls
crop out the higher beds of this formation, the name of which has

 observations,          he
                        concludes that the ravine has been formed                the                     by
 river; but        heassumes, that       shallow valley pre-existed along the
                                                  a
 line of   the present defile, resembling the present one between Lake
 Erie and the Falls. His reasons for conceiving that the river has
 been the excavating agent, are, 1st, the ravine being only from 400
to   600 yards wide          the top, and from 200
                                  at                           400     the bottom,
                                                                                to           at
 between Queenstown and the Whirlpool; 2ndly, the inclination
                                                                                                              to of
 the bed      ofthe river, 14% feet per mile, being everywhere cut down
 the regular strata; 3rdly, the fact that the Falls are now slowly re
 ceding; 4thly, that freshwater formation, which the author ascribes
                                  a
to   the body      ofwater which flowed along the original shallow valley,
 exists on Goat Island and half               mile lower down the river, and
                                                       a
 could not have been          deposited   after the Falls had receded farther
 back than the Whirlpool. Mr. Lyell considers that the indentation

                            of the Falls of Niagara.                                553
of about two acres on the American side of the Niagara, and not re
ferable to the action of that river, is no objection to the theory of the
recession of the Falls, because he conceives that the stream flowing
down it could have effected the denudation, aided by atmospheric
agents; and because a similar objection might be founded on a ra
vine on the Canada side opposite the Whirlpool, where several par
allel gullies have been deeply eaten into by streams. The charac
ters of this ravine were carefully examined by Mr. Lyell and Mr.
Hall, and appear to have escaped previous observers. What was
anciently a ravine joins the defile of the Niagara at this point, but
it is entirely filled with horizontal beds of drifted pebbles, sand and
loam; the first, near the bottom of the deposit, having been cemented
into a conglomerate by carbonate of lime. This is the only interrup
tion of the regular strata along the course of the Niagara; and Mr.
Lyell observes, it is desirable to ascertain if it be a prolongation of
the ravine which intersects the great escarpment at St. David's, west
of Lewistown.
   The author states, that he is by no means desirous of attaching
importance to the precise numerical calculations which have been
made respecting the number of yards that the Falls have receded
during the last half century, as there are no data on which accurate
measurements could be made; and because fifty years ago the district
was a wilderness. Mr. Ingrahaw of Boston has, however, called his
attention to a work published by the French Missionary, Father Hen
nipen, in which a view is given of the Falls as they appeared in 1678.
Goat Island is represented dividing the waters as at present; but
besides the two existing cascades, a third is depicted on the Canada
side, crossing the Horse-shoe Fall at right angles, and appears to
have been produced by a projection of the Table Rock.           In the de
scription Father Hennipen states, that this smaller cascade fell from
 west to east, and not like the other two, from south to north.
    Seventy-three years afterwards, in 1751, a letter on the Falls, by
 Kalm, the Swedish botanist, was published in the ‘Gentleman's Ma
gazine.’ It is illustrated by a plate, in which the third Fall is omit
 ted; but the writer states in a note, that at that point the water
was formerly forced out of          its
                                  direct course           by
                                                     projecting rock, and
                                                           a
 turned obliquely across the other Fall”.
    Mr. Lyell then proceeds show what are the geological evidences

    1. Coniston Limestone.—This calcareous band, which has been
laid down in great detail by Prof. Sedgwick, was adopted by Mr.
Sharpe as the base of his inquiries.            It usually rests upon dark
brown shale, and consists, in       lowest part,        hard, dark blue, slaty
                                                       its                            of   a

thinner calcareous bands abound with casts.               list    fossils given             A                of

                                 the formation exceeds 5000 feet.
   3a. Lowest Division.—This portion                                      of
                                                   the Windermere rocks con
           gray              grits       argillaceous    slates, containing thin
             of of
sists             schistose        and
beds       limestone on the banks           Coniston Lake.      of The strata are

               Geology   of the South of   Westmoreland.              557
stated to be much affected by cleavage lines.       The usual strike of
the beds at the foot of Coniston is said to be    north-east,   but great
variations are shown to occur in other   portions of the district, in con
sequence of anticlinal ridges which range north and south.            The
boundary between this division and the middle one passes from the
foot of Coniston Water to the ferry on Windermere, and thence by
the foot of the valley of Kentmere, across Long Sleddale at Murth
waite Crag, south of Tebay Fell, Langdale Fell and Ravenstone Fell,
to Rathay Bridge, but it is much affected by dislocations. The general
range of the division, Mr. Sharpe states, may be traced by the grits
and slates forming a series of bold hills which stand out in relief
above the tame rounded masses of the argillaceous schists of the
middle division.
    The author alludes to a band of calcareous slates shown by Prof.
Sedgwick to range from Blawith to the south-west, but he states that
he failed to find its eastern continuation; he alludes likewise to Mr.
Marshall's account of having found lower Silurian fossils in it; and
he is induced, on this account, to conceive that the calcareous band
may form the uppermost portion of the lower Silurian rocks. The
lowest division of the Windermere series is stated to be well exposed
on the shores of Coniston Lake.
    3b. Middle Division.—This deposit consists of hard argillaceous
rocks, usually striped or banded gray, blue, or white, and sometimes
brown; it contains also beds of soft shale and hard grits similar to
those of the lowest division.     On the west side of Windermere the
usual strike is north-east, but to the eastward of the lake the strata
are stated to be thrown into great confusion by faults ranging north
and south. The boundary between this and the upper division is
drawn by the author from Newby Bridge to Witherslack; but from
Whitborrow to the Lune, the southern edge of the deposit is over
laid unconformably by various rocks of more modern date. East of
the Lune the Windermere rocks are stated to be less concealed by
other formations, the southern boundary ranging from a little east of
Barbon to Barbon Fell House, where it is again overlaid by carbo
miferous limestone.     The only traces of organic remains mentioned
by the author are some crushed specimens, one of which he considers
to be a Phragmoceras.
    3c. Upper Division.—This division consists of hard, compact,
 purplish greywacke, little affected by cleavage, and can be distin
 guished from the Ludlow rocks only by the absence of fossils. The
 strata are greatly disturbed by north and south anticlinal faults.
 The division is exposed in only two limited districts; one south of
 Windermere, and the other east of the Lune, constituting Barbon
 Beacon and the western end of Casterton Fell, all the intermediate
 district being occupied by newer formations.
    4. Ludlow Rocks.—This series rests, the author says, unconform
 ably on the Windermere beds; but the want of conformity is stated
 to be inferred, not from the usual evidence of irregular deposition at
                                                              formations,

upper divisions of the Windermere series.      The deposit is composed
of hard, purplish gray, argillaceous strata, and though intersected by
several cleavage plains, does not possess a slaty structure.    The lines
of stratification are usually well-marked by thin rotten layers full
of casts of shells, the intermediate portions being devoid of organic
remains. The range of the Ludlow rocks, as limited by the author
to beds which contain fossils, and commencing west of Kendal Fell.
is stated to be a narrow strip at the base of Underbarrow Scar; and
on the east of Kendal Fell, is a patch on the Tenter Fell, north-west
of Kendal. In the valley of the Kent, the Ludlow rocks are con
cealed by newer deposits; but east of the valley they constitute the
high anticlinal ridge of Benson Knot and Helme, the top of the latter,
however, being old red sandstone; they occupy also all the country
thence to the Lune, except the highest point of Lupton Fell, where
the Windermere rocks are brought to the surface, being bounded on
the west, south, and east by mountain limestone or old red sandstone.
The usual strike of the beds is said by the author to be north and south,
and the dip either east or west, the strike conforming to the direction
of the principal faults. The chief anticlinal north and south ridges
are stated to be Benson Knot, Helme, Old Hutton Common, and
Lupton Fell: several east and west faults are likewise mentioned
in the paper; as in Lambrigg Park and Fell, in Mansergh Common,
west of Lunesdale, and at Old Town.
   A gradual passage from the upper beds of the Ludlow rocks into
the tilestone of the old red sandstone is exposed at the top of Helme
at Old Town and the southern part of Mansergh Common; and
the author is induced to infer, from eleven of the twenty-five
species found in the bottom beds of Herefordshire occurring also
in the upper Ludlow rocks of that district, and from seven of the
remaining fourteen species occurring low in the Ludlow rocks of
Westmoreland, that the beds which have been considered to form
the bottom of the old red sandstone ought to be included in the Silu
rian system. A further argument in support of this arrangement is
drawn from the fact, that where the old red sandstone rests on the
Windermere rocks these doubtful beds are wanting, the shells being
found only where the Ludlow rock occurs.
   A list of thirty-four species of fossils is given in the paper, con
sisting almost solely of Ludlow Testacea figured in Mr. Murchison's
work, but the author does not state positively to what portion of
the Ludlow series the Westmoreland beds ought to be assigned.
   5. Old Red Sandstone.—The following distinct districts, composed
of old red sandstone, occur within the area described by the author:
(a.) that in the valley of the Lune and the neighbourhood of Kirkby
Lonsdale; (b.) those near Kendal and in the valleys of the Kent,
Sprint, and Mint; and (c.) that near Shap and Tebay.
   5a. To the old red of the valley of the Lune, above Kirkby Lons
dale, the author assigns the bed of loose conglomerate and red clay,
which he says dips under the scar limestone of Casterton, the lime
stone being inclined to the south-east at an angle of 30°, and the
conglomerate to the east by north at an angle of 25°. The want of

                   Geology   of the South of      Westmoreland.                  559
conformity is stated to be more manifest to the westward; for where
the limestone bends round by Kirkby Lonsdale bridge it dips 25° or
30° to the south-south-east; at Catshole quarry the strata are arched
with a north-west strike; at Hollin Hall quarry the dip is south-west
 30°, and at Teamside 40° south-east; but the old red sandstone dips
 throughout, as far as the beds can be seen, to the east. At Caster
 ton the loose conglomerate is 100 feet thick, and passes downwards
 into red marl, occasionally mottled blue, and estimated to be fifty feet
 thick. This marl rests on alternating beds of red marl and red sand
 stone, beneath which is a considerable deposit of dark red tilestone
and light-coloured sandstone, forming the passage beds into the               Lud
low rocks. The total thickness is estimated at 1000 feet. To the
north of the Casterton fault, the lower beds of the old red sandstone
are stated to be raised up and exposed, far to the eastward of their
position below Casterton; and above this spot the right bank of the
river is said to be composed of the lowest beds of the tilestones and
the passage beds into the Ludlow rock, but the left bank to consist
of tilestones and red sandstones. The dip is east, at an angle of 25°.
Mr. Sharpe also assigns to the old red sandstone, but not definitive
ly, the bed of brown gravel, or of brown clay full of pebbles, which
covers the whole of the valley of the Lune to its junction with the
Rathay, and up that valley nearly to Sedbergh.      It forms a line of
low hills on each side of the Lune, resting on the northern edge of
the tilestones above Barbon Beck, and conceals the junction of the
Ludlow rocks on the right of the Lune with the Windermere rocks
on the left of that river.
   5b. Several limited patches of old red sandstone occur in the
neighbourhood of Kendal, the remnants, in the author's opinion, of a
once continuous mass. They consist, near Kirkby Lonsdale, of red
conglomerates, red marls, and red and light-coloured sandstones,
with tilestones, which pass downwards into the Ludlow rocks.
Some of these patches, as on the top of Helme and at Monument
Hill, two miles north-east of Kendal, have been raised to a consider
ably higher level than the rest of the formation.                  Three miles above
Kendal the old red sandstone is well-exposed on the banks of the
Sprint, consisting of
          Loose conglomerate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 60 to 80 feet.

  The strike of the beds is north by west, and the dip east by north
10°, and they are unconformable to the adjacent older rocks. Similar
 beds are  slightly exposed in the banks of the Mint, near Lavrock
 Bridge, striking east, and dipping 5° north, a bearing different from
 that of all the neighbouring rocks. They are separated from      more    a
 extensive  patch  about Greyrigg       by   an
                                        anticlinal ridge           of

irregularity of the position of the former, yet the author thinks, that
from the want of conformity of the Ludlow rocks to the Windermere,
and from the faults which traverse them extending into the old red
sandstone, that they were deposited subsequently to the protrusion
of the granite. Having thus defined the limit of that event, Mr.
 Sharpe proceeds to show its effects.          In the south of Westmoreland,
 he  says,  it threw into a   high  angle   the strata of Coniston limestone
and Windermere schists, and produced the great east and west faults
around Coniston and Windermere, as well as in Middleton and Cas
terton Fells; likewise the dislocations of the Coniston limestone,
with their prolongations in the valleys of Coniston, Esthwaite, Win
dermere, Kentmere, Long Sleddale, &c., which are not continued
into the Ludlow rocks. These valleys, or lines of cracks, Mr. Sharpe
says, are quite distinct in character from the north and south syn
clinal valleys in those rocks; he is also of opinion that the valley
of the Lune had a similar origin, but the older rocks being con
cealed by newer deposits,          resemblanceits       the other valleys   to less                          is
 complete.
