of the coil to the other; the number of these layers is generally
even, so that the beginning and end of the wire are at the same
extremity of the coil. But it is clear, that in a coil, whose points

                                to             electrical excitation,                   of
the tension must increase from the middle towards each extre

mor does an increased length of wire add anything to the bril
liancy of the phaenomena as soon as the resistance of the partial
vacuum is small in comparison to that of the induction wire.
Without doubt the induction coils for obtaining sparks and
 other phaenomena of tension would be more effective and durable
if the thickness of the insulating medium were increased. But
 even if the length of wire might then be reduced to some extent,
 the coil would have to be large in size in order to produce the
 desired effects, the inducing coil would have to be increased to a
 corresponding extent, and a stronger voltaic battery would be re
 quisite; in short, the apparatus would lose much of                present                             its
 convenient dimensions for      practical  purposes.

    fers from the rotating current-breaker, where a straight electro
    magnet oscillates horizontally on a point between the upright
    arms of a steel horseshoe magnet, and where the ends of the
    encircling wire dip into two semicircular mercury cups, con
    nected with the poles of a galvanic battery, and separated by
    an insulating partition.  Here the pauses are of much shorter
    duration than the moments of activity of the current, because
    the former occur only when the ends of the wire pass over the
    partition.   The construction of this rotating current-breaker
    might, indeed, be so changed as to make the pauses equal in
    duration to the periods of activity; but to do so would be to
    render the instrument more expensive, and as this equality was
    not necessary in the present investigation,   have continued to     I
    use Neef’s hammer.
                                                Condenser.
        At first my          condenser was exactly  similar to the one con
    structed by Ruhmkorff, probably according to Fizeau's own                              in
    structions; it consisted of a long piece of oiled silk covered on
    both sides with tinfoil, and folded to and fro in layers so as to
    occupy less space, and to allow only parts of one and the same
    sheet of tinfoil to touch each other.       Each of these sheets of tin
    foil was 8 feet  long    and 11 inches broad. Soon afterwards a
    second condenser, about one-fourth the size of the first, viz. 23
    inches long and 11 inches broad, was used; the folded layers
    were separated from one another by mill-board in order to pre
    vent contact between the posterior surfaces of the tinfoil, which, if
    present, would necessarily be prejudicial.
        Afterwards I became acquainted with the simplification pro
    posed by Halske, wherein the voluminous arrangement in Ruhm
    korff’s apparatus is replaced by a single covered sheet of mica
    not greater than the octavo form.                          I
                                                have had an opportunity of
    testing a condenser of this kind and of this magnitude prepared
    by Prof. Riess, and                I
                               thereby convinced myself, that, under the
     circumstances under which the test was applied,               effect was     its
     very nearly equal                    great

                             that to  the         oiled silk condenser.

    to   itsmagnitude,      causedis    one         by

 of  the contact-breaker which hammer against one another suffer,
 owing     to  the sparks which are produced between them.               The
 sole advantage which the great condensers possessed over the
 small ones was, that the former produced less noisy sparks than
 the latter. With the former, too, the sparks followed one another
 more quickly when the distance between the poles approached
 the limit       which the sparks can
                at                             obtained singly,

 superfluous, nor are they                       so
                                      for other reasons.       First,     the                        all
 results mentioned were obtained with current from one or from     a
 two pairs        Grove’s battery; and the comparison
                to of                                             both cases               of
 appeared        indicate, that,                 by

wire    of double section and single length, one          single section             of
and double length was employed.            The phaenomenon was still
more    perceptible   when the latter  wire,  which was now      millim.                         1
                                                                   by
thick and 200 feet long, was replaced             wire #rds      millim.
                                                                   a                        ofa
thick and 400 feet long, without changing anything else about
the apparatus.            both cases where the primary current was
                             In
comparatively weak, and the inner induction current compara
tively strong, the condenser                      of
                                       square inch surface, which was

before     so
            effective,  was now almost without effect.
   Thirdly, the action        condensers depends essentially upon the
                                   of
                                                   be exerted. All the
                                                                       is
induction coils on which their influence                               to
results before mentioned were obtained with             very thin induc          a
tion  wire,  10,000  feet long;    when the thicker wire, 2400 feet
long, was employed, the small condensers again manifested                                             a
very small action, and sometimes none whatever; indeed, the
two smallest condensers appeared not only not            strengthen the           to
development        sparks between the poles
                    of                               the induction coil,    of
but actually      weaken the same. This phaenomenon manifested
                   to
itself equally when the galvanic current traversed              short and                 a
thick,   or  along and thin wire. On the contrary, however, the
two large condensers         oiled silk still retained,
                                   of                         both cases,              in
their former energetic action; indeed            was clearly perceptible
                                                                   it
that the condenser        feet    8 length was superior
                                              in                  the one                   to
2  feet long.
    Hence the stronger the galvanic battery, the longer and more
conducting the circuit                      its
                                  current, and the thicker and more

      I
      have employed two, of unequal dimensions. The axes of
the  greater   are 10; and 7 inches in length, and in it points,
spheres, and discs can be introduced.       The axes of the smaller
one are 4} and 3 inches in length.        For most experiments the
latter is sufficient, and besides this, it possesses the great advan
tage of being exhausted, to a few lines of pressure, by means of
a few strokes of a good air-pump.
      I
     have also employed an extra plate, such as is furnished with
most air-pumps, but modified so as to suit the institution of
electric experiments in a vacuum.      A glass disc is cemented
upon the brass disc; in both two holes are made, in which
two thick copper pins are fastened so as to be air-tight, and
yet not to touch the brass; these pins project above and below,
are 6 inches distant from one another, and their extremities are
provided with holes and clamp-screws, so as to receive the
necessary connecting wires.    By means of the glass disc, many
experiments  can be made which it would be impossible to
make in the egg; for upon it several kinds of apparatus can be
placed, and over                all

present to say if it contains Schreibersite.
   The specific gravity of a slice weighing 6 oz., containing, how
ever, cavities, and other matter, I found to be about 6.5.        For
meteoric iron it is perhaps unusually soft; and though it shows
no regular crystalline or Widmannstättian figures when a polished
surface is treated with nitric acid, yet there is apparent a slightly
welded or mottled texture, brighter in some parts than in others.
   It was not, however, until the iron had been cut up into slices
for the purpose of polishing and for exchange, that discovered                         I
it had not a perfectly homogeneous structure, but was in many
places more or less honeycombed with cavities, some of which
actually contained what appeared to be pure lead! In some the
lead was not larger than a pellet, and did not       the entire                       fill
cavity which contained                   it;

     N   a memoir, a              full translation of which is given in the last
      volume of the Scientific Memoirs, M. Knoblauch showed
that radiant heat passed in different quantities in different direc
tions through certain uniaxal crystals; and also that the quality
of the heat, after having traversed the crystals in different direc
tions, was different.  In the present paper he extends his re
searches to biaxal crystals.

of the prism was vertical, the rays issuing from the prism were

the rays fell upon       thermo-electric pile, and the deflection

   Qualitative differences were also observed in this case, de
pendent on the position of the plane of polarization. Glasses
of different colours were used to test the quality of the heat.
Calling the quantity falling upon the pile previous to the intro
duction of the glass 100, the ratio of this quantity to that
which passed through the glass in the respective cases is given
in the following table:—

    We must conclude from this table that the heat whose plane
of polarization coincides with that of the optic axes, possesses,
after        its
         passage through the topaz,       greater power       traversing
                                                                  a                                 of

manifest from the following table:—

   We here observe, that the rays which pass        greatest quantity                 in
through the red and yellow glass are the most intercepted                                                            by

exists between the heat issuing from hornblende and that issuing
from topaz.     For the heat whose plane       polarization coincides

    The qualitative differences that were observed are exhibited in
the following table:—
                              Planes coincident.              Planes crossed.
         Red glass .........      100   : 66                     100  : 44

         Yellow glass ......      100   : 53                     100   : 59
    It is worthy of remark, that with the same position of the
 plane of polarization and of the optic axes, the heat, in the case
 of hornblende, passes worse through blue glass and better
 through yellow glass; and in the case of pistacite, better through
blue glass and worse through yellow glass, than the rays for
which the planes enclose an angle of 90°. In the case of red
and green glass this antithesis is not observed.
    M. Knoblauch next placed two plates of pistacite together,
both cut at right angles to the middle line, and examined their
effect upon the passage of heat in the direction of the said line,
first, when the planes of the optic axes of both plates were
coincident; and secondly, when they were at right angles to
each other: the proportion of the quantity transmitted were
as 100 : 130, the former representing the quantity transmitted
when the planes were at right angles to each other, and the
latter the quantity transmitted when they were parallel.
    Qualitative differences were also exhibited, as shown by the
following table:—
                                 Planes of the optic axes of the two plates.

         Yellow glass ......      100 : 41                       100   : 88
    In   these experiments the Nichol’s prism was removed, and
the   light   direct from the mirror of the heliostat was permitted
to pass through both plates successively.
                                                                               -
    A plate of brown mica was next examined, in the same manner
as the heavy spar, topaz and hornblende.                  In this case the ratio
of Q to Q' was as 100 : 109.
    The power of the heat to pass through glasses of different
colours is exhibited in the following table             :-

     In   this case, the differences, both quantitative and qualitative,
in both groups of rays are evident.
     The ease with which plates of mica of any required thickness
may be obtained, rendered this body peculiarly adapted to show
the manner in which the differences exhibited above were affected
by the thickness of the plates.
     In the first place, a plate was chosen of about one-third the
thickness of the plates made use of in the foregoing experiments.

    From this table we derive the general conclusion, that the
qualitative difference            of
                               the rays which we have here compared
become more evident             the thickness
                                    as              the crystal throughof
 which they pass        increased.

     In   all
            the experiments hitherto recorded, the direction            the                          of
 calorific rays   was that          of
                                the line which bisected the acute    angle
 enclosed       by
                the two optic axes. M. Knoblauch next proceeded
to  compare the quantities                of
                                     heat transmitted      different direc         in
tions  by  the same    crystal.
   The Nichol’s prism was removed, and the direct solar rays
were permitted          fall upon
                             to         cube   a dichroite; the rays first
                                                                of
passed     inthe direction        the middle line just referred to, and
                                     of
afterwards in the direction of the line which bisected the obtuse
angle enclosed               by
                         the optic axes, the “supplementary line.”
The quantity transmitted             the former case, compared
                                          in                          that                           to
transmitted        the latter, was
                        in               100: 36.   as
    The crystal was next placed             that the supplementary line,
                                                         so
and with         the plane         the optic axes, was vertical, and the
                                      of

                of it
                heat transmitted along the middle line was com
pared with the quantity, transmitted                   direction     right
                                                                     in   a                      at
angles     to the  plane       the ofoptic  axes: these   quantities  were
found     tobe          in
                   the ratio             of
                                   100 46.          :
     In both these cases, therefore, the quantity transmitted along
the middle line was greatest.
   Comparing the direction             the supplementary line with the
                                              of

Radiant Heat through Crystals to the direction of Transmission.                               21.
perpendicular to the optic axes, the quantities transmitted in
these respective directions were found to be in the ratio of
100 : 139.    Although the crystal here examined exhibited cer
tain mechanical defects, M. Knoblauch considers it certain that
the differences stated cannot be referred to this cause.    In the
case of dichroite, radiant heat passes in the direction of the
middle line in the greatest quantity; in less quantity perpen
dicular to the plane of the optic axes, whereas the direction of
minimum transmission is that of the supplementary line.
   The qualities of the heat passing in these three directions
were next examined.     In the first compartment of the following
table, the heat transmitted parallel to the middle line is com
pared with that transmitted parallel to the supplementary line;
in the second compartment, the middle line and the perpendi.
cular to the plane of the optic axes are compared; and in the
third compartment, the supplementary line is compared with
the perpendicular to the plane of the optic axes.     In      cases                     all
the quantity falling upon the glass     set   100, and the ratio
                                                        is     =

     From these observations               M. Knoblauch           concludes,            that the

to the optic axis are the effects the same.     If the heat is polar
ized, differences dependent on the position of the plane of
polarization are observed in one and the same direction. Here
also the radiations perpendicular to the axis are the same.
Along the axis alone is the transmission of the heat, and                                                          its

24.         The Rev. S. Haughton on the Chemical Composition of
   Such being the state of geological knowledge on this subject,
it occurred to me that it might be useful to direct attention to a
distinction of a chemical character which appears to exist between
these two groups of granites,                                   I
                                  a distinction to which have been
led in the course of a series of analyses of Irish granites, in
which        I
          have been for some time engaged.       The distinction to
which        I
           have alluded is the following.      The granites of the
main chain contain more potash than soda; and vice versä, the
granites to the east of the chain, which are isolated from it and
from each other, contain more soda than potash; showing that
the circumstances, unknown to us, under which the isolated
granites were formed, were such as to yield to the molten mass
a quantity of soda greater than that possessed by the granites of
the principl chain.
                                                           I
   In illustration of the foregoing generalization, offer analyses
of granites from the following localities:–
                 Granitic chain.                 Isolated granites.
      .    Dalkey, Co. Dublin.            1. Cushbawn, Co. Wicklow.
      .    Foxrock, Co. Dublin.           2. Croghan Kinshela, Co.Wicklow.

      .    Killballyhugh, Co. Carlow.
      .    Blackstairs, Co. Wexford.
      .    Ballyleigh, Co. Wexford.
      It
     will be seen, on reference to the Ordnance Map, or any
good map of Ireland, that the localities selected extend from the
north to the south of both the granite series; and on reference
to the geological maps of Wicklow and Wexford, it may be ob
served by those unacquainted with the geological structure of
this part of Ireland, that the granites of the second group ex
amined are taken from the distinct and distant isolated patches
of granite.
   In order to investigate the relative proportions of quartz, fel
spar and mica, of which these granites were composed,          used   I
the  following method,  which  appears  to be as simple as any that
has been proposed for such a purpose.
   Let the per-centage of silica in the granite be divided by the
atomic weight of silica, and let the quotient be denoted by a.
   Let the per-centages of alumina and peroxide of iron be divided
by the atomic weights of alumina and peroxide of iron respect
ively, and            let
                the sum   the quotients
                                   of      foundso         be             by
                                                                               be b.
                                                     denoted
   Let the  per-centages    lime, magnesia, potash, and soda
                                    of
divided          by
             the atomic weights          of
                                    these elements, and the sum
of the  quotients  called          c.

                 the Granites             of   the South-east         of     Ireland.                     25
   Then, on the hypothesis that the granite is composed exclu
sively of quartz, felspar, and mica (margarodite), since
       Quartz                    = SiO3
       Felspar     = RO, SiO3 + R2O3, 3SiO3
       Margarodite = R0, SiO2+2(R*0°, SiO2)+2HO,
we find, if Q, F, M denote the number of atoms of quartz, fel
spar, and margarodite present in the granite, the following rela
tions:—
                                 a=Q+4F +3M
                                 b= F +2M                                                             .   (1)
                                 c= F + M.                      }
  In   these equations, a, b, c are given by the analysis; and
from these equations, Q, F, M may be found. Having deter
mined Q, F, M, we can obtain the per-centages corresponding
to them by multiplying Q, F, M by their respective atomic
weights.    The atomic weight of quartz is known, and is 46;
but the atomic weights of felspar and mica vary with the rela
tive proportions of the ingredients composing these minerals.

A FEW        years ago Graham published an extensive investiga
        tion on the diffusion of salts in water, in which he more
especially compared the diffusibility of different salts.  It appears
to me a matter of   regret, however,  that in such an     exceedingly
valuable and extensive investigation, the development of a fun
damental law, for the operation of diffusion in a single element
                                                          I
of space, was neglected, and have therefore endeavoured to sup
ply this omission.
     It   was quite natural to suppose, that this law for the diffusion
                          its        identical with that, according
                                                              in be

 again immediately draw the requisite quantity of water.          Now
                                                                                                          j.
this quantity of water, which, cateris paribus, during the unit of
time, can diffuse itself into the saturated solution without sensibly
altering the concentration at that point, depends upon the eas
mobility of the particles of the solution. The space in
the compensation takes place must therefore also be, cateris
paribus, so much shorter, and consequently the stream of water
towards the saturated solution stronger, the more easily mobile
the particles of the solution are.          was unable to verify this I
theoretical conclusion   by   direct experiment.     expected that the          I
excess of water   passing   through   the membrane,   above the quan
tity of salt passing in the contrary direction, must be found
much smaller, when the mobility of the upper solution was im
peded by the addition of chalk magma.            No such diminution
of this excess, however, could be remarked in the experiment.
   A second conclusion from the hypothesis just developed can
be thus expressed: the excess of the diffusing water, above the
salt passing in the opposite direction, is smaller, the wider the
pores of the separating partition.       Or    according      Folly's*    if,                   to

   The comparison of the experiments adduced above with the

shows, though not absolutely, that the truth of this hypothesis

     VII.   Onthe Spontaneous Decomposition of certain Sulpho
             methylates. By ARTHUR H. CHURCH, Esq.”
     the latter part of June 1853, I prepared a quantity of sul
 IN phomethylic   acid, and neutralizing the mixture of sulphuric
 and sulphomethylic acids with finely-powdered native carbonate
 of baryta of unusually excellent appearance, expected to obtain
 sulphomethylate of baryta not far from pure; but the carbonate
 of baryta was contaminated with a considerable amount of car
 bonate of lime, consequently the product was a mixture of sul
 phomethylate of baryta with the corresponding lime-salt: that
                          I
 this was the case did not discover, however, until the present
 year. The mixed salts, crystallized, and dried between bibulous
paper, were set aside and forgotten until April last. The weight of
the salts was not less than 380 grns. The general formula of the
 sulphomethylates, dried as justmentioned, is C*H*M2SO4+2aq.
The loosely-stoppered bottle containing the salts had been ex
posed indiffused daylight for a period of twenty-two months before
it was disturbed. At the end of this time complete decomposition
had taken place, the bottle no longer contained a trace of the
original salts.    At first three-fourths, the bottle was now little
more than half full; the upper portion of                       its
                                                         contents was                a
yellowish liquid         disagreeable odour and acid reaction; the
                          of
lower was white, apparently amorphous solid, but
             a                                                 this last   on

                                                a
this numerous distinct crystals sprang, their bases remote from
the light, and their summits inclined towards                   it.
   And first      these crystals, which were perfectly transparent

than 2°. The specific gravity          different specimens varied be
                                          of

                                         of                         mil         61
lims.  in length and 2.5 millims.      breadth. The crystals belong
                                          in
to  the oblique prismatic system, and exhibit many interesting
modifications; their behaviour          polarized light was the same

                              some aspects their lustre       pearly,  is            in
others vitreous.      Aqualitative examination indicated the presence
of  calcium, sulphuric acid, and water; while the quantitative
estimation   of these constituents       the crystals dried over sul

    The crystals were not altered by an exposure of two hours to
a temperature of 100°C.; heated a few degrees above this point
they lose water, becoming milk-white.
    The white amorphous powder filling the lower part of the
bottle was sulphate of baryta, but occurring here and there in it
were botryoidal masses of granular sulphate of lime. An ana
lysis of this sulphate gave numbers approaching somewhat closely
to the formula 2CaSO4+aq; a sulphate of lime having this
formula has been observed occurring as a grayish crystalline
deposit from a boiler working under a pressure of two atmo
spheres”.
    The crystalline crust from which rose the prismatic crystals
already described, was also sulphate of lime, of the formula
CaSO4+2aq.
    The yellow fluid previously mentioned was thoroughly ex
amined. Its reaction was strongly acid : on the addition of pure
precipitated carbonate of baryta, an escape of carbonic acid took
place and a heavy powder was precipitated, this was separated
by filtration and proved to be sulphate of baryta.            The filtrate,
now perfectly neutral, was introduced into a retort and distilled;
water having a slightly aromatic odour collected in the receiver;
 the residue in the retort solidified on cooling to a mass of colour
 less crystals.    From this substance, recrystallized by means of
 alcohol, dissolved in the smallest possible quantity of water, and
 separated again by spontaneous evaporation of the water, the
 following analytical result was obtained, the crystals having been
 dried between folds of bibulous paper:—415 grim. of salt gave
 ‘2445 grim. of sulphate of baryta, corresponding to 58.91 per
 cent. of BaSO4; theory, as C*H*Ba2SO4+2aq, requires 59:02.
 A second analysis, for which a portion of the salt dried at 100° C.
 was employed, gave me the following numbers:–5605 grim. of
 salt furnished 3637 grim. of sulphate of baryta, corresponding to
 64.88 per cent. of BaSO4; theory, as C*H*Ba2SO4, requires 649.
     The saturated solution of this salt is not altered
                                                             by prolonged
 ebullition, and the crystals may be heated above 100°C. without
 becoming acid or otherwise decomposing.

phate  of ammonia upon potassium-alcohol. Also we might hope
to obtain sulphobenzolic acid, C*H*2SO", by the action of
nitric acid on sulphocyanide of phenyle, just as hyposulphaethylic
acid is obtained from the corresponding aethyle term. A more

  Mr. Macdonald         on the   Anatomy of Nautilus umbilicatus.                 45
a fact which may serve to modify the views       of those who, adopting
the speculations of D’Orbigny on the sexes of the Ammonites as in
dicated by the characters of their shells, apply them also to the
several kinds of Nautili known.
    The body of N. umbilicatus is larger and more elongated than
that of N. Pompilius as it occurs in the South Seas, although the
specimens of the latter species brought from the Chinese Seas much
exceed both in size.    In the N. umbilicatus, the longitudinal lamellae
 on the median lobe of the external labial processes are divided by a
 wide groove into two lateral sets, and the corresponding lamellae be
 tween the internal labial processes are about seventeen in number
 and of considerable thickness. In N. Pompilius, the latter lamellae are
 much thinner and more numerous, and the lateral sets of the former
 are united together in the median line, commencing anteriorly with
 an azygos transverse lamina.       In both kinds, however, the corre
 sponding tentacula may be distinctly traced out, with only such
 minor differences as might be expected to occur in different speci
 mens of either separately; the digital, labial and ocular groups
  agreeing sufficiently both as to number and character in the two

     Referring to former observations of his own on the eye of N. Pom
 pilius, the author observes that they closely apply to N. umbilicatus,
  which affords confirmation of his opinion that the pigmentary coat
  ing is subjacent to the retina.   He finds no vestige of a lens, and in
  place of vitreous humour, a mere viscous matter protecting the
                                                               -
  retina from the sea-water.
    The organ of hearing, which had escaped detection in the speci
 men   of N. Pompilius dissected by Professor Owen, altered as it
 doubtless had been by long immersion in spirit, was discovered in
 the example of N. umbilicatus examined by the author.     It consists
 of two spheroidal acoustic capsules placed, one on each side, at the
 union of the supra- and suboesophageal ganglia, and measuring about
 one-twelfth of an inch in diameter.    Each capsule rests internally
 against the nervous mass, and is received       on       itsouter side into       a
 little depression  the cephalic cartilage.
                       in                       It   is   enveloped   in  kind
 of fibrous tissue and filled with     cretaceous pulp consisting
                                       a                                mi of a
 nute, elliptical, otoconial particles, presenting under high power
                                                                a                  a
 bright point near each end, varying much         in  size, and sometimes
 combined into stellate, cruciform         other figures.
                                           or               Cilia were not
 observed within the capsules.
    The inside    ofthe mouth     furnished with three groups
                                  is                                 of
                                                                   papillae,
 one   of  which occupies the median line between the orifice            theof
 tongue-sac and commencement           ofthe oesophagus.     These lingual
 papillae,   as well      the rest, are clothed with long and slender
                            as
 columnar epithelium-particles.
    The author agrees with Mayer          regarding the well-known folli

46                         Royal Society:—
 blood passing through the branchiae under changes of pressure to
 which the animal may be subjected at different depths. These fol
licles are subcylindrical in form, and somewhat dilated at the free
 extremity, to which is appended a folded and funnel-shaped process
of membrane which expands rather suddenly and presents a jagged
 border. They open by an oval or slit-like orifice into the afferent
 branchial vessels, on each of which, as Professor Owen has observed,
they are disposed in three clusters. The outer membrane is smooth
and glossy, homogeneous in structure, and sprinkled over with mi
nute, rounded, transparent bodies, resembling the nuclei of cells.
Beneath this layer, flat bundles of fibres, apparently muscular, are
traceable here and there, principally disposed in a longitudinal direc
tion, and sometimes branched.          The lining membrane consists of a
loose  epithelial   pavement,    similar in many respects to that of the
uriniferous tubules of the      higher  animals, the cells containing, be
sides the  nuclei,   numerous minute oil-globules, or a substance much
resembling concrete fatty matter.          This membrane is thrown up
into very numerous papillae and corrugations, so as greatly to in
crease the extent of surface.        The papillae are more numerous to
wards the attached end, and a circlet of longitudinal folds, with
transverse zigzag corrugations, radiate from the bottom of the fol
licle, in which a number of small pits or fenestrations are sometimes
visible.   The funnel-shaped membranous process above noticed is
continuous with the lining membrane. The cavity of each follicle,
therefore, communicates with the exterior through the centre of this
process, and the aperture is thus guarded by a kind of circular valve
permitting the escape of secreted matters, but effectually preventing
the entrance of fluid from without.
    Some considerations are next offered in support of the view
adopted as to the functions of these vascular appendages.
    Lastly, on the question whether the peculiarities of structure re
cognized respectively in N. Pompilius and N. umbilicatus are suffi
cient to establish a difference of species, or are attributable merely to
variety, the author observes, that any tendency in a being to revert
to an original type, when such has been determined, betrays variety;
but this tendency is never manifested in the Nautili under consider
ation by the occasional occurrence of specimens presenting charac
ters which place them intermediately between N. Pompilius and
N. umbilicatus. Having visited the Fijii Islands since he formerly
wrote on N. Pompilius, he finds that the umbilicated Nautili are not
known to the natives, although N. Pompilius is very plentiful; but at
Fatuna or Wallis's Island, where both are found, the people recog
nize the difference between them depending on the presence or
absence of umbilical pits. On this the author remarks, that although
particular localities, with    all  attending circumstances, may favour
the production    of   varieties, yet the permanence     of the distinctive
characters  of  these Nautili without symptom       ofamalgamation, and
the discovery    of   a female specimen   of   N. umbilicatus, are strong
arguments   in    support of   the view that they are distinct species,
though very closely allied.

functions either of the time or of the elements; but in any case these

elements in taking the partial differential coefficients of the disturb

sisting of two planets to axes so chosen that the plane of ay shall
always coincide with the principal plane of the system, and the axis
of r, from which all longitudes are reckoned, shall always coincide
with the line of nodes; there are thus obtained twelve rigorous
simultaneous differential equations, of which nine form a system
apart, containing only the major axes, excentricities, epochs, longi
tudes of perihelia, and mutual inclination of the two orbits, and
afford an example of the so-called “elimination of the nodes;”
whilst the remaining three (which contain also these nine elements,
but not their differential coefficients) determine the motion of the
principal plane and of the line of nodes, relatively to fixed space.
The mutual inclination of the two orbits being supposed known,
their several inclinations to the principal plane are given by simple
relations; and the positions of the planets in their orbits (their
longitudes reckoned from the line of nodes) being supposed known,
their motions relatively to fixed space would thus-be completely
determined.
   Extract of a Letter, dated January 6, 1855, from J. Mitchell,
Esq., Quartermaster of Artillery, Bangalore, “On the Influence of
Local Altitude on the Burning of the Fuses of Shells.”
   “In the early part of the year 1848, at the annual practice of the
 Artillery in this garrison, it was observed that the fuses burned too
long a time. The regular burning of fuses being a matter of much
importance, the circumstance was duly reported to Artillery Head
 Quarters, and a portion of each kind was directed to be sent to
St. Thomas's Mount (eight miles from Madras and on the same
level) for examination, where they were found to burn correctly, and
as at that time no one suspected the real cause of the discrepance, it
was concluded there had been some error in the length of our pen
                                                                    i.
dulum, and there for the time the matter rested.
   “But as I was satisfied, for many reasons, that it was not owing to
an error in the pendulum, I determined to keep the subject in mind,
and for the practice in the following year (1849) I              to be
made an adjustable pendulum which beat seconds very correctly for
several minutes.     This pendulum was daily compared with two or
more seconds' watches to make       all   safe, and,   as   our longest time   of
flight did not exceed twenty seconds,         no
                                        error could possibly arise
from this source. The result was that the fuses again burnt too
long  at  Bangalore, and were again found      burn correctly
                                                       to                      at
St. Thomas's Mount.
    “This was mystery all; but after the matter had cost me much
                 a        to
thought,   occurred
           it        to me that the cause was       sought

gested that some fuses should be burnt at the Mount, or at Madras,
under a receiver, exhausted until the barometer stood at the Banga
lore mean height, or about 27 inches. This, however, it was not
found convenient to do; but, as an equally satisfactory way of test
ing the accuracy of my conclusions, a small number of fuses were
prepared and burnt at St. Thomas's Mount, at Bangalore, and at
two different altitudes on the Neilgherry Hills, as will be seen by
the annexed copy of an official memorandum; and although this ex
periment was too limited to enable us to compile a scale of the pro
bable times a certain length of fuse composition would burn at given
altitudes, it amply proves the fact that combustion is retarded at
considerable elevations. *

       March 29, 1855.-Thomas Bell, Esq., W.P., in the Chair.
     The following communications were read:—
     “On the existence of an element of Strength in beams subjected
to Transverse Strain, arising from the Lateral Action of the fibres or
particles on each other, and named by the author the “Resistance to
Flexure.’ ” By Peter William Barlow, Esq., F.R.S.
   The author commences by observing, that under the existing
theory of beams, which recognizes only two elements of resistance,
namely tension and compression, the strength of a beam of cast
iron cannot be reconciled with the results of experiments on the
direct tensile strength, if the neutral axis is in the centre of the
                               -
beam.
    He then proceeds to describe experiments made on two solid
 beams of cast iron to determine the position of the neutral axis.
 The beams employed were 7 feet long, 6 inches deep and 2 inches
 thick, on each of which small vertical ribs were cast, 12 inches
 apart; nine small holes were drilled opposite to each other in each
 rib, for the purpose of inserting the pins of a delicate measuring                          in
 strument.     The distances of the holes of the centre division of both
 beams were measured under various strains, and the results show
 that the extensions and compressions proceed in an arithmetical
 ratio from the centre to the upper and lower sides of the beam; and
 that at any given distance on either side of the centre, the amount
 of extension is equal to the amount of compression.
    The position of the neutral axis being thus conclusively ascertained
 to be in the centre, it is shown that, not only the ultimate strength,
 but also the amount of extension and compression with a given
 strain, indicates the existence of another element of resistance, in
 addition to the resistances to extension and compression.
    The author then points out, that in applying the law of “ut
tensio     sic
           vis”       contiguous fibres, under different degrees
                       to                                               exten      of
 sion and conipression, the effect             of
                                             the lateral adhesion has been
omitted, and each fibre has been supposed                 to    be
                                                            capable     taking     of
up the same degree            of
                            extension        or
                                           compression             acted sepa
                                                                    as   if
                                                                         it

                                        of         fibres.
  It      then shown that this supposed independent action
          is                                                                the         of
fibres     inconsistent with other practical results, and evidence
           is                                                                                is
exhibited        of powerful lateral action when unequal strains are
                      a

    From these and other considerations, the author              led     think
                                                                         is         to

which the bars were          separated      vertically, was varied in the several
forms of    girder   experimented        upon.        By these means the bar form

degrees of flexure.          The different forms of girder experimented
upon were of equal length, and were compared with solid beams and
with bars of the same metal broken by direct tensile strain.

value of the total resistance at the outer fibre is ascertained, and

    From these experiments, the particulars of which are fully de
 tailed, the following facts are elicited             :-
     1. That in all cases the total resistance at the outer fibre, at the
 time   of rupture, is greater than the tensile strength.
    2. That in girders having the same depth of metal, it                              increases
                                                                 -
when the deflection increases; and
    3. That in girders having the same total depth, and the same de
flection, the resistance is greater when the depth of metal in the
beam is greater.
    And it follows that there is an element of strength depending on
the depth of metal in connexion with the deflection; or in other
words, dependent on the degree of flewure to which the metal form
ing the beam is subjected.

   The author next proceeds to examine the law under which this
resistance varies; and considering the total resistance in the solid
beam to be composed of two resistances, one being constant and
due to the tensile strength, and the other variable and depending on
the depth of the metal in connexion with its deflection, the experi
ments indicate that the resistance to flexure varies, throughout all
the girders, directly as the amount of deflection into the depth of
the metal.
   The paper concludes by pointing out the important amount of
this resistance, the operation of which has been hitherto unknown,
and which in cast iron exceeds the tensile strength of the metal, and
shows that comparisons of the strength of different forms of section,
based on the existing theory, which assumes the resistance at the
outer fibre to be constant and equal to the tensile strength of the
metal, must be entirely fallacious.

   “On the Metallic and some other Oxides, in relation to Catalytic
Phaenomena.” By the Rev. J. Eyre Ashby.
   I purpose to detail some experiments on the metallic (and a few
other) oxides, made with a view to ascertain their powers to produce
and maintain, catalytically, the combustion of various gases and va
pours; and to annex such considerations as appear to be suggested
by the facts. By catalysis I understand the operation of one body
upon another, under favourable circumstances, whereby the second
body is resolved into new chemical combinations, while the first
(whatever may happen during the process) remains finally un
changed.     This must be taken as not including explosion by per
cussion, in which the change takes place owing to the external
application of dynamic force.
   The apparatus for experimenting comprehends a variety of shal
low capsules; wire-gauze, of iron, copper, and brass, of different de
grees of fineness, cut into discs a little larger than the vessels on
which they are to be superimposed; a spirit-lamp with large wick;
a pair of pliers, and a few rings of wire to support the gauze, if
necessary, while heating it in the spirit flame.   The method of pro
cedure is simple: the watch-glass, or capsule, is nearly filled with
 the liquid whose vapour is to be tried; on a wire-gauze disc is
spread the oxide whose powers as a catalyser are to be tested, and
this being warmed (more or less) over the lamp, is set down upon
the upper rim of the capsule.    Sometimes it is necessary to heat a
layer of the oxide in the middle of a small combustion-tube, and
pass over it the gas, or mixture of gases.
   I tried the following substances with pyroxylic spirit (hydrated
oxide of methyle) and alcohol separately.
    1. CoO appeared to possess the power in some degree, but per
haps the specimen was in too dense agglomeration, which is not
essentially reduced by trituration.
   2. Co., Os maintained the catalytic combustion very well.

           The Rev.   J. E. Ashby on Catalytic Phanomena.              53
    3.  AgO, reduced to metallic silver, which shows a strong ten
dency on gauze, and acts perfectly in the combustion-tube.
    4. U, Oa, HO became, at red heat, anhydrous mixture of U O
and Us O1, showing strong tendency.         A very pure specimen cata
lysed the vapour as it changed from yellow to green, after which it
died away. Will not act below 570° (F.).
    5. SnO ; strong tendency.
    6. SnO2; slight tendency.
    7. WOs apparently produces the effect if placed while glowing,
over alcohol, but gradually dies away, as if very slowly cooling.
    8. Pb, O. changed to PbO, and showed a strong tendency, but
 quickly faded and grew cold.
    9. CdC), placed while very warm over pyroxylic spirit, burst into
 glow and catalysed, but always died off after the lapse of from half a
 minute to two or three minutes, and then became incapable.
    10. CaO (on the gauze), no effect.
    11.  SiO, exhibited a tendency.
    12.  Stourbridge clay; no effect.
    13. Al, Oa appeared to have no effect in maintaining catalytic
 combustion on the gauze, but when made red-hot and quenched in
 absolute alcohol, it changed from pure white to a black substance
 and oxidized a portion of the alcohol.       That this is not owing to
 carbon in the alcohol is   evident,  because the same change occurs
 when it is  quenched  in strong  liquid  ammonia.    I suspect that it is
 a new oxide of aluminum.
    14. Ni, Oa, formed by heating carbonate of nickel nearly to red
 ness, failed; prepared from the common nitrate, it acted for a short
 time; reduced as an intensely black velvety substance from the purest
 nitrate, then warmed but not made red-hot, it glowed and catalysed
 with alcohol or ether. With pyroxylic spirit, it was left at the end
 of the operation of a greenish drab, which I suspect to be a mixture
 of Ni, Os with NiO, although it may be Ni, O, changed only in ap
 pearance, for when treated with nitric acid no nickel is dissolved.
     15. MnO, is changed at red heat into Mn2O3, which, with alco
 hol, ether, and pyroxylic spirit, continues the slow combustion very
 steadily.   A specimen of very pure Mn2O, acted extremely well, as
 did also a  portion of “euchrome” (a hydrated sesquioxide of man
 ganese (impure) dug from the estate of Lord Audley), after being
 heated in the air to drive away the carbonaceous matter with which
 it was mingled. Mn., O, will, if sufficient care be taken, catalyse
 the moist gas arising from a strong solution of ammonia.
     16. Fe, Oa, when in the state of a light puffy powder, catalyses the
 vapour of ether, alcohol, and pyroxylic spirit, only requiring to be
 heated on the gauze before it is laid over the capsule.      It is cheap,
 easily employed, and of invariable action.     I have  kept up  the com
 bustion for several hours on a surface of 120 square inches.
    By means of a catalytic lamp in which the liquid employed is con
 tinually supplied from a reservoir and maintained at a constant level
 in the capsule, I have used 7 or 8 square inches continuously during
 thirty-six hours. This lamp I have occasionally used for laboratory

54                                        Royal Society:—
purposes, where a gentle and equable heat was required for several
hours.
   Pursuing my experiments with the oxides of the metals, heated
on wire gauze, I tried as many as I could procure or make, and by
a tolerably wide induction                        I
                                        found that the sesquiorides have the
strongest tendency to produce and maintain the catalytic glow, and
do produce it in every case in which they are not decomposed by the
amount of heat required to begin the operation.

original colour returns.         But             made red-hot and quenched

virtue of which three molecules of sesquioxide may suffer reduction
as if they were only one molecule, and divide into two molecules of

         Fe2O3+NH3+0, alternate reduction and oxidation,
         Fe Os–H NHA (in water), reduction.
    To show the last, add ammonia to a solution of Fe03, KO, and
Fe2O3 will be precipitated.
    A mixture of ten parts by weight of powdered chlorate of potassa
with one part of Fe, O, disengages oxygen with extreme facility and
 great oeconomy of heat as compared with the oxides of copper and
 manganese; and it is the more convenient because n grains of the
mixture will represent almost exactly n cubic inches of disengaged
 oxygen.
    A state of mechanical division is not absolutely necessary for the
 catalysation of some inflammable vapours by Fe, O3; an old nail,
 entirely transmuted into rust, will perform the operation; and when
 we consider that in many cases of fermentation, decay and putrefac
tion, this oxide may be present, divided or aggregated, while heat is
 evolved, and inflammable gases and vapours are set free, we may
hereafter be able to trace some instances of “spontaneous com
bustion” to the catalytic action of the sesquioxides of iron.

    The present communication is a revised and modified version of a
paper bearing the same title, which was read on the 18th of January
and 1st of February, and which was, by permission, withdrawn. The
chief modification applies to the author's views respecting the struc
ture of the vitreous body as deduced from entoptical phaenomena. He
is now of opinion that the arborescent system of which he infers the
existence in that part of the eye (Phil. Mag. vol. ix. p. 305) does not
consist of tubes filled with globules or cells, as he at first supposed, but
of cell-constituted filaments,     In a note, dated March 27, 1855, he
gives the following enunciation of his present views as to the struc
ture of the vitreous body:—
   “In the vitreous humour are innumerable transparent globules,
beads or cells, of less specific gravity than the fluid, extremely
minute, and of uniform size, which are arranged, without eaception,
in rows to form the threads of a lax, elongated, irregular web,
springing from the general surface of the capsule by, commonly,
exquisitely small meshes, and extending into the interior by others
of increasing size, so that the innermost part of the web—which lies

which occur when the insulated wire is immersed in water, as in

 the third at the remote end near the communication with the earth.
 When the connexion of the battery with the wire was completed,
 the galvanometers were successively acted upon in the order of their
 distances from the battery, as in the experiments recorded by Dr.
 Faraday.    When the earth connexion at the remote extremity of the
 wire, on the contrary, was completed, the disturbance of equilibrium
 commenced at this end, and the galvanometers successively acted in
 the reverse order, i. e. the galvanometer which was the most distant
 from the battery was the first impelled into motion.      In the latter
 case, before the completion of the circuit the needles of the galvano
 meters had assumed constant deflections to a limited extent, owing
 to a feeble current arising from the uniform dispersion of the static
                                                                          -
 electricity along the wire.
    Earp. 5. The two extremities of the 660 miles of wire were brought
into connexion with the opposite poles of the battery. When one
of the ends previously disconnected from the battery was united
 therewith, the galvanometers at the extremities of the wire, and con
sequently which were at equal distances from the poles of the bat
tery, were immediately and simultaneously acted upon, while that
which was in the middle of the wire was subsequently caused to
move. When the wire disconnected in the middle instead of near
one of the poles of the battery was again united, the middle galvano
meter, which was the most remote from the battery, was the first
acted upon, and those near the poles subsequently.                       -
    The comparison of the two above-mentioned experiments show
that the earth must not be regarded simply as a conductor, which
many suppose to be the case. Since in the first experiment there were
not many yards' distance between the two earth terminations, did
the extent of ground between them act only as a conductor, the two
galvanometers at the extremities of the wire should have acted simul
taneously, as in the second experiment, and as would have been the
case had a short wire united the two extremities which proceeded
to the earth.

   Eap. 6. One pole of the battery was connected with the earth, and
the opposite pole with one extremity of the 660 miles of wire, the
other end remaining insulated; a delicate galvanometer was interposed
near the battery. Notwithstanding there was no circuit formed, the
needle showed a constant deflection of 33}*; the feeble current
thus rendered evident is not so much to be attributed to imperfect
insulation, as to the uniform and continual dispersion of the static
electricity with which the wire is charged throughout               its
                                                                 entire

remain constantly in contact with one of the poles of the battery;
but the galvanometer was successively shifted to different distances
from the battery.      The strength of the current was now shown to
be inversely as the distance of the galvanometer from the battery,

    The deflections of the needle of the galvanometer employed in
 these experiments were, when they did not surpass 36°, very nearly
 comparable with the force of the current.                     This I ascertained in the
 following way.     I took six cells of the small constant battery de
 scribed in my paper “On new Instruments and Processes for deter
 mining the Constants of a Voltaic Circuit,” printed in the Philo
 sophical Transactions for 1843, and placed in the circuit formed of
 the 660 miles of wire, the earth, and the galvanometer, successively
  1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 cells.        Leaving out of consideration the resist
 ances in the cells themselves and in the earth, which were very in
 considerable in comparison with that in the long wire, the force of
 the current should be approximately proportionate to the number
 of the elements; and since the deflections of the needle nearly indi
 gated this proportionality, as the following table will show, it may
 be assumed that the force of the current, when the deflection of the
 needle did not surpass 36°, nearly corresponded with the angular                   -
 deviation.                                                                  -

   From the preceding experiments (6. and 7.) it seems to result,
that whatever length of wire is connected with the battery, if a gal
vanometer is placed at the farther extremity of the wire and a con
stant length added to the other termination of the galvanometer,                                                       its
indication remains always nearly the same.          Thus the galvanometer
indicated 6}” when        was placed close
                            it                  the battery and 110 milesto
of  wire were subjoined beyond it; and            when 550 miles were        5°                                        in
terposed between the battery and galvanometer, the same length,
 110 miles, being subjoined.          like manner, when 220 miles were
                                                 In
added   beyond   the galvanometer    placed   near the battery, the indica
tion was   12°;  precisely  the same                              as
                                          when 440 miles were interposed
and 220 added. So also when 330 miles were added, the deviation
of  the galvanometer was 18°; and 15° when 330 miles were inter
posed and 330 added.            have I                            no

going on, from the time the lead had been laid down.        An attempt
made to stop it by driving nails through it into the rafters had failed.
The force by which the lead had been made to descend, whatever it
was, had been found sufficient to draw the nails”.      As the pitch of
the roof was only 16}*, it was sufficiently evident that the weight of
the lead alone could not have caused it to descend.         Sheet lead,
whose surface is in the state of that used in roofing, will stand firmly
upon a surface of planed deal when inclined at an angle of 30°t, if
no other force than its weight tends to cause it to descend.         The
considerations which I have stated in the preceding articles led me
to the conclusion that the daily variations in the temperature of the
lead, exposed as it was to the action of the sun by its southern
aspect, could not but cause it to descend considerably, and the only
question which remained on my mind was, whether this descent
could be so great as was observed.       To determine this I took the
following data:—
   Mean daily variation of temperature at Bristol in the month of
August, assumed to be the same as at Leith (Kaemtz, Meteorology,
by Walker, p. 18), 8°21 Cent.
   Linear expansion of lead through 100° Cent. 0028436.
   Length of sheets of lead forming the roof from the ridge to the
gutter 232 inches.
   Inclination of roof 16° 32'.
   Limiting angle of resistance between sheet lead and deal 30°.
   Whence the mean daily descent of the lead, in inches, in the
month of August, is determined by equation (2) to be
                                                                        *.*.*

                l-'027848 inches.
   The average daily descent gives for the whole month of August a
descent of '863288.               If
                         the average daily variation of temperature
of the month of August had continued throughout the year, the
lead would have descended 10, 19148 inches every year.       And in the
two years from 1851 to 1853 it would have descended 20'38296
inches.   But the daily variations of atmospheric temperature are less
in the other months of the year than in the month of August.        For
this reason, therefore, the calculation is in excess. For the following
reasons it is in defect:—1st, the daily variations in the temperature
of the lead cannot but have been greater than those of the surround
ing atmosphere. It must have been heated above the surrounding
   * The evil was remedied by placing a beam across the rafters near the ridge,
and doubling the sheets round           it,
                                      and fixing their ends with spike nails.

atmosphere by radiation from the sun in the day-time, and cooled
below it by radiation into space at night. 2ndly. One variation of
 temperature only has been assumed to take place every twenty-four
hours, viz. that from the extreme heat of the day to the extreme
 cold of the night; whereas such variations are notoriously of con
 stant occurrence during the twenty-four hours.       Each cannot but
have caused a  corresponding   descent of the lead, and their aggregate
result cannot but have been      greater than if the temperature had
passed uniformly (without oscillations backwards and forwards) from
 one extreme to the other.
    These considerations show, I think, that the causes I have
assigned are sufficient to account for the fact observed. They sug
 gest, moreover, the possibility that results of importance in meteor
ology may be obtained from observing with accuracy the descent of
a metallic rod thus placed upon an inclined plane. That descent
would be a measure of the aggregate of the changes of temperature
to which the metal was subjected during the time of observation.
As every such change of temperature is associated with a corre
sponding development of mechanical action under the form of work*,
it would be a measure of the aggregate of such changes and of the
work so developed during that period; and relations might be found
between measurements so taken in different equal periods of times,
successive years for instance, tending to the development of new
meteorological laws.
   The following are the results of recent experiments f on the
expansion of ice :—

Ice, therefore, has nearly twice the expansibility of lead, so that a
sheet of ice would, under similar circumstances, have descended a
plane similarly inclined, twice the distance that the sheet of lead
referred to in the preceding article descended.    Glaciers are, on an
increased scale, sheets of ice placed upon the slopes of mountains,
and subjected to atmospheric variations of temperature throughout
their masses by variations in the quantity and the temperature of
the water, which flowing from the surface everywhere percolates
them. That they must from this cause descend into the valleys is
therefore certain.   That portion of the Mer de Glace of Chamouni
which extends from Montanvert to very near the origin of the Glacier
de Léchaud, has been accurately observed by Professor James Forbest.
Its length is 22,600 feet, and                 its
                                    inclination varies from 4°19'22"

“Mr. Hopkins              placed a mass of rough ice, confined by a square
frame or bottomless box, upon a roughly chiselled flag stone, which
he then inclined at a small angle, and found that a slow but uni
form motion was produced, when even       it was placed at an incon
siderable slope.”   This motion, which Mr. Hopkins attributed to
the dissolution of the ice in contact with the stone, would, I appre
hend, have taken place if the mass had been of lead instead of ice;
and it would have been but about half as fast, because the linear
expansion of lead is only about half that of ice.

small pieces, in moderately warm water, and by means of pressure
and washing, separated the sporules and soluble constituents from
the cellular matter. Then, by allowing the water that had been
used in this operation to remain undisturbed for several hours, the
 sporules were collected in the form of a dark brown-coloured, muddy
 deposit. This was well washed once or twice with water, and
 dried in an oven, as was also the cellular matter, and the watery
 solution was evaporated to dryness.          On testing these three sub
 stances, it was found that only two of them, namely the sporules
 and the cellular tissue, were capable of producing anaesthesia; the
 aqueous extract evolved a thick irritating vapour, but this did not
 occasion insensibility on inhalation.
    It was clear, therefore, that the narcotic principle should be looked
 for in the two former. Accordingly, small portions of each of them
 were digested for several hours in boiling alcohol, aether, bisul
 phide of carbon, wood-spirit, chloroform, diluted sulphuric acid, and
fusel oil, but in every instance the residuary matter, when pressed
 and dried, was found to retain                     a its
                                         original narcotic quality.     Fresh
 quantities were then soaked for        considerable period       hot alkaline         in
 lye, and     in   hot solution
                   a                  moderately strong nitric acid, until

   As the washing by decantation requires some practice, and is not
always practicable, the oxalate of lime may be filtered and washed;
then dissolved on the filter with very dilute boiling muriatic acid.
The solution obtained, which may be reduced by evaporation if
necessary, is then put into the apparatus for the evolution of the
carbonic acid, and after it has been neutralized with ammonia, the
chromate of potash is added.    In order to prevent any evolution of
chlorine, a small quantity of oxide of mercury must be added before
the sulphuric acid is added to the mixture.—Liebig's Annalen, May

other organic bodies, and to constitute it one sui generis, naturally
suggest the inquiry, in what form it is contained in the plants and
 animals from which it is derived.          If it exists ready formed in the
 indigo-bearing plants, how is it that though, when in a free state,
insoluble in water, acids, alkalies, alcohol, and most simple men
 strua, it should so easily be extracted from those plants by a mere
infusion with cold water ? If it does not pre-exist in the plant, in
 what state of combination is it contained therein, and what is
the nature of the process by which it is eliminated? The usual
method of preparing indigo from the Indigoferae consists in steep
ing the plant, especially the leaves, in water, drawing off the
infusion, allowing it to undergo fermentation, and then precipi
                                                   i.
tating by means of agitation with air and the addition of lime
water.     Now it may be asked, is this process of fermentation,
which is often very tedious and difficult to manage, essential to
the formation of indigo-blue, or is it merely an accidental phae
nomenon attending                     its
                               preparation?                essential,   If  what

   Roxburgh, who is the earliest authority I have had an oppor
tunity of consulting on this subject, states that his predecessor,
De Cossigny, whose work on the manufacture of indigo, pub
lished in the Mauritius, is very rare, was of opinion that volatile
                                   ii.
alkali was the agent by which the colouring matter was extracted
from the plant and        in solution until volatilized by the agi
tation process.   Roxburgh, who, like De Cossigny, was one of
the few possessing special chemical information who have ex
amined the process of manufacturing indigo from the Indigoferae
on the spot, concluded, from his experiments, “that the indigo
plants contain only the base of the colour, which is naturally
green; that much carbonic acid is disengaged during                     extri                           its
cation from the leaves; that the carbonic acid                   the agent                    is
whereby         itprobably extracted and kept dissolved; that am
                     is
monia      not formed during the process; that the use
           is                                                        alkalies                       of
is   todestroy the attraction between the base and the carbonic
acid; and that the vegetable base being thereby set                  liberty,                       at
combines with some        colouring   principle    from the    atmosphere,
forming therewith        coloured insoluble fecula, which falls

                Dr. Schunck      on the   Formation     of   Indigo-blue.             77
a very decided    conviction that indigo-blue pre-exists in the Poly
gonum tinctorium, but not in a free state; that it is combined
with some organic substance or substances, which render it
 soluble in water, aether and alcohol; and that it requires the
operation of potent agencies in order to destroy this combination
and set the indigo at liberty.      Osmin Hervey*, in a memoir on
the   Polygonum   tinctorium,  which in some parts is rather obscure,
inferred from his experiments:–1. That indigotine exists in
the leaves of this plant in a state of combination with a resin.
2. That this natural compound of indigo and resin contains both
white indigo and blue indigo, and of the latter a larger propor
tion the older the leaves are. 3. That by the influence of cer
 tain organic substances, the indigo-blue is again reduced to the
colourless state, if the solution be effected by means of water,
without any destruction of the natural compound taking place.
 Girardin and Preissert again returned to Chevreul's view, that
the colouring matter is contained in the leaves of this plant in
the form of reduced indigo.        Since the publication of these trea
tises, no new ideas have, as far as            I
                                         know, been promulgated by
chemists in reference to this subject<U+017F>.
    It will be seen that the opinions of the chemists which have                 I
just shortly reviewed are of three kinds, and may be stated as
follows:–1. Indigo-blue exists ready formed in the plants from
which it is derived.     2. It is contained in these plants in the
form of reduced     indigo.   3. It does not pre-exist in the vege
table, but is formed subsequently to the extraction of the latter
by means of a process of fermentation, a process which manifests
itself by the evolution of gases of various kinds. To each of these
views very strong objections maybe raised. If the colouring matter
 is formed at once in the plant, it is difficult to conceive by what
 means it comes to be dissolved by water, for no combination of
 indigo-blue with any organic substance can be produced which
 is soluble in water.    If to this it be objected, that a compound
 of this nature is produced   by the plant, and cannot after decom
 position be reproduced, then it is at once admitted that indigo

               refrain from expressing on the present occasion my regret,
which is probably shared by many others, at the want of a general chemical
bibliography, comprising references to       all

             Dr. Schunck   on the Formation     of Indigo-blue.         79
endowed       with a striking and positive colour, is only one of a
long chain of bodies succeeding one another, and is generally
not the last product of decomposition.             The other process, of
which the formation of alizarine is an         example,   yields colouring
matters of a fixed and stable       character,   which are not further
changed by a continuance of the process to which they owe their
formation.       Now  if indigo-blue  be a body which is formed from
some colourless substance       existing  in the plant, we should infer
à priori that the process by which it is formed is one of fermen
tation or putrefaction, not requiring the intervention of oxygen
or of alkalies; a conclusion, however, so much at variance with
the generally received ideas on the subject of the formation of
indigo-blue, as to require the aid of very decisive experiments
for its establishment.
     I shall   now proceed to give an account of the experiments
 which     I have undertaken with a view to elucidate this subject.
     The only plant cultivated in this country which is known to
 yield indigo in any quantity is woad, Isatistinctoria; and as it
 was necessary to examine the indigo-bearing plant in a fresh
 state and in considerable quantities,        I had recourse to this one
 for the    purpose.   Having   procured    10 lbs. of good French woad
 seed, I sowed it at the commencement of the spring of last year
 on about half an acre of land.        It was sown in drills about two
 feet   apart,  each drill being  previously    well supplied with farm
 yard manure. In a short time the young plants appeared, and
 grew vigorously during the summer months.              Some of the plants
 bore   flowers,  and ripened  their seeds in the course of the autumn.
     At no time during the whole progress of the growth were
 there any visible indications of the presence of blue colouring
 matter on the leaves or stems.           Some of the ripe seeds only
 were    tinged  with a dark   purple    colour,  forming a thin coating
 on the exterior.     The greater proportion of the plants, however,
 bore leaves which did not exhibit the glaucous appearance nor
 the fleshy consistency, which, according to authors, are charac
 teristic of the cultivated variety of woad.           They were, on the
 contrary, of a bright grass-green, and possessed but little succu
  lence—characters which belong rather to the wild variety.
                   I
     As soon as could collect a small quantity of leaves, com       I
  menced my experiments.                                         I
                                 Having taken some leaves, chopped
  them fine and then extracted them with boiling water. The filtered
  liquid was light brown and transparent, it had a bitter taste and
  an acid reaction.     It deposited no indigo-blue, however long it
  might be left exposed to the atmosphere, and hence it might
  have been inferred that it contained no indigo-blue.           Neverthe
  less, a very simple experiment sufficed to show that it was capable
  of yielding an appreciable quantity of that colouring matter. On

adding to it sulphuric or muriatic acid and boiling, it became of
a darker colour, and deposited a quantity of dark brown, almost
black flocks.         Now these flocks contained indigo-blue; for if
after  collecting     them on a filter and washing out the acid, they
were treated with boiling alcohol, they communicated                        to the
latter a  bright    blue   colour;   and on    being    treated with a     boiling
alkaline solution of protoxide of tin, they gave a yellow solution,
which on exposure to the air became covered with a thin blue
film.    A small quantity of finely-chopped woad leaves having
been    pounded       in a mortar with water until converted into a
uniform green pulp, yielded on being strained through calico a
dark green opake liquor.            On heating this liquor to near the
boiling-point, the vegetable albumen contained in it coagulated,
carrying down with it the green colouring matter. On now
filtering through paper, a green coagulum was left on the filter,
while a clear light yellow liquid ran through.                On adding acetate
of lead to the    liquid,   a  yellow precipitate   fell;    and on again filter
ing, the liquid ran through almost colourless.                   The lead preci
pitate being decomposed with dilute sulphuric acid, the filtered
acid liquid was boiled, when it gave a few black flocks, which,
however, contained no indigo-blue”.                             If,
                                                        however, sulphuric                            or

         Dr. Schunck              on the Formation                 of Indigo-blue,                 83
allowed to remain exposed to the atmosphere they attract moist
ure again, and become flaccid and difficult to pulverize.     The
powder must be kept warm until it is used.
    I. The leaves thus reduced to powder, being put in a displace
ment apparatus, such as is used for the preparation of tannic
acid, are extracted with cold alcohol.   The percolating liquid is
dark green.    The extraction is continued until the liquid runs
through of a light green colour.    The alcoholic extract is now
distilled in a retort, until a great part of the alcohol has passed
over; it is then evaporated in a basin at a moderate temperature.
During evaporation, a large quantity of chlorophyll and fatty
matter separates as a green glutinous mass, which is to be sepa
rated by filtration.   The filtered liquid, which is brown, is to be
further evaporated until it leaves a thick brown syrup. This
syrup, being poured into a flask, is redissolved in warm alcohol,
which it does with some difficulty, on account of the change
which the substance has undergone in consequence of the heat
employed in distilling the alcohol.       To the warm solution there
is now added several times its volume of aether.              The aether
renders the solution    milky,   and  precipitates   a large  quantity  of
matter, which collects at the bottom of the flask into a dark
brown syrup.      After this syrup has completely settled, the aether,
which is also dark brown, is distilled. When the greatest part
has distilled over, water is added to the syrupy residue.               A
quantity of brown fatty matter is precipitated, which is filtered.
The filtered liquid is light yellow, and contains the substance
 almost in a state of purity.     Should a further purification, how
ever, be necessary, this is best effected by agitating the liquid in
 the cold with hydrated oxide of copper.           A green solution is
 obtained, which is filtered, and a current of sulphuretted hy
 drogen gas being passed through                         it,

but without any advantage resulting, as the substance was not
entirely removed from the aether by means of water, a consider
able quantity still remaining dissolved in the aether.
     III.The pounded woad leaves are extracted in a displacement
apparatus, as before, with cold alcohol. To the green alcoholic ex
tract there is added an alcoholic solution of acetate of lead, which
produces a pale green precipitate,the precipitation being then com
pleted by the addition of a little ammonia.   The precipitate, which
is bulky, is placed on a filter andwashed with cold alcohol, until the
percolating liquid instead of being dark green is only light green,
and the excess of acetate of lead and ammonia have been removed.
It is then suspended in water, and a current of carbonic acid gas
is passed through the liquid. The precipitate gradually becomes
paler in colour and at last almost white, and loses considerably
in bulk, while the liquid acquires a yellow colour. The latter
being filtered, sulphuretted hydrogen is passed through it to
precipitate a little oxide of lead contained in   and being again                       it,
                                                                                              or

thin layers, and leaving it for some time in vacuo over sulphuric
acid. On attempting to dry it in the water-bath, it immediately
undergoes          a complete           alteration.          Its     taste is slightly bitter and
nauseous.    Its solutions have always an acid reaction, but
whether this reaction is peculiar to it in an absolutely pure state,
Iam unable to say. When heated in a tube it swells up, and
gives fumes which condense to a brown oily sublimate, in which,
after some time, a white crystalline substance is formed. When
boiled with caustic alkali it evolves ammonia.              Its compounds
have a yellow colour. With caustic alkalies, baryta, and lime
water, the watery solution turns of a bright yellow.               The alco
holic solution gives with sugar of lead a bright sulphur-yellow
precipitate, which is increased by the addition of ammonia. The
watery solution gives no precipitate with acetate of lead until
ammonia is also added.           Its most remarkable and interesting
property is that of yielding indigo-blue when treated with strong                                              *

indigo-blue whenever indican is decomposed by acids.       Never
theless, the quantity of indigo-blue produced is always relatively
larger when the indican is pure than when the latter has begun
to change.    Of the two colouring matters, the indigo-blue is
always the first to be formed.   If sulphuric or muriatic acid be
added to a solution of indican in the cold, and the mixture be
allowed to stand in the cold for some time, a slight precipitate
is gradually deposited which consists almost entirely of indigo
blue. It is only after boiling for some time that the formation
of indirubine commences, when the colour of the liquid changes
from blue to purple. The constant occurrence of a red colouring
matter both in indigo and in the indigo-bearing plants along
with indigo-blue—a fact which has been repeatedly observed,—
has led chemists to suspect that there must be some necessary con
nexion between the two.      From the experiments just described,
it follows that, in the case of woad at least, they are both pro
ducts of decomposition of one substance.       If nitric acid be added
to a  watery solution of indican,  a slight deposit  of indigo-blue is
formed, which of course disappears immediately on heating the
liquid.
   There is another very remarkable property of indican which                                                      I
have to describe, a property, the knowledge of which will pro
bably throw great light on the process of manufacturing indigo.

the watery solution, be heated for some time in the water-bath,
or if its watery solution     boiled,        be                 or

subsequent stage of the process.    If the watery solution be then
boiled with the addition of  sulphuric or muriatic acid, it becomes
in the first instance of a darker colour, and after considerable
boiling, deposits slowly a quantity of dark brown, almost black
flocks. The liquid filtered from these flocks contains sugar, just
as in the case of indican itself.         The flocks themselves generally
consist of two bodies.         If they be collected on a filter, washed

with a brown colour, and after filtration and evaporation, is left

                         tried a small quantity of it by boiling with
sulphuric acid, and ascertained that it gave indigo-blue and indi
rubine; but on heating the whole quantity to the boiling-point
with acid, I obtained instead of these two bodies, a substance
dissolving in alcohol with a brown colour. It was evident that
the indican, in consequence probably of the solution being very
dilute, had taken up the elements of water before the acid could
act on      it,
            and that the latter then gave rise         the products              to                         of

silver is precipitated; and when ammonia is added, a further
reduction takes place, accompanied by the formation of a metallic
mirror.     On adding chloride of gold to the watery solution and
boiling, a quantity of metallic gold is deposited in bright scales
and spangles; and on adding caustic alkali to the filtered solu
tion, an additional quantity of gold is precipitated as a purple
powder, The watery solution gives no precipitates either with
neutral or basic acetate of lead, only on adding ammonia does
any precipitation take place.        It is soluble in alcohol, but not
in aether. In              its

  An analysis which            I
                             made of a lead compound, prepared
directly from a watery extract of woad by precipitating with
acetate of lead, filtering, and then adding ammonia to the filtered
liquid, gave a composition agreeing pretty well with the formula
C32 H43 NO46+ 13PbO.
  It  appears, therefore, that the organic substances contained in
these lead compounds differ from one another merely by the ele
ments of water; and it may hence be inferred, with a great degree
of probability, that indican itselfin a state of purity differs in com
position from them merely by containing the elements of several
equivalents of water less.    Assuming               it its
                                              composition         repre          to   be
sented  by  the formula   C*H*NO”,           must      shown how this   be
formula explains the formation         indigo-blue.

     If the formula
                  of the lead compound is C12H90114-4PbO, it
is probable that the sugar in an uncombined state has the for
mula C*H190*. It differs, therefore, from other kinds of
sugar by containing less hydrogen than is necessary to form
water with the oxygen.    Its formula      however, perfectly        is,                                           in

Acetate of lead produced in the alcoholic solution a cream
coloured precipitate, which was separated by filtration; and on
adding a small quantity of ammonia to the filtered liquid, a
cream-coloured precipitate again fell, which was collected on a
filter, washed with alcohol, and dried in vacuo. On analysing
  I
it obtained the following results:—
   0.3705 grim., burnt with oxide of copper and chlorate of                          pot
ash, gave 0.2670 grm. carbonic acid and 0.0730 water.
   0.3800 grim. gave 0-0680 grm. chloride of platinum and                            am

  After deducting the oxide of lead, the amount of which stands
in no simple relation to that of the other constituents, the organic
substance combined with the oxide of lead will be found to have
a composition expressed by the formula C*H*NO”, as will be
seen by the following calculation:—

   This body is therefore formed from indican by the latter taking
up 3 equivalents of water and then losing 1 equivalent of sugar,
as will be evident from the following equation                     :-
     1 eq. indican    C*H*NO3 \                   <U+017F>co Hº NO”

                      C32 H36 NO39                     C52 H86 NO39
  It is perfectly conceivable that an additional equivalent of
sugar may separate from the body C*H*NO” before the de
composition is finally completed; that is to say, that there exists
another intermediate body containing 28 equivalents of carbon.

                                                 The difficulty

ing compounds with alkalies and other bases which are not com
pletely decomposed by acids.    The analyses which I have made
agree best with the formula C19H8N0°.       If this be the correct
formula, it differs in composition from indigo-blue by the ele
ments of three equivalents of water, just as the body or bodies
from which        formed differ from indican by containing the
                       it is
elements of several equivalents more water.
   The analyses of indiretine led to more definite results. The
substance was prepared from indican, which had undergone the
alteration of which I have several times spoken, by treating it
with boiling sulphuric acid, collecting the dark brown deposit
which was formed on a filter, washing out the acid, treating with
boiling alcohol, filtering from the indihumine which remained
undissolved, and evaporating the alcoholic solution to dryness.

    I havecertainly not observed the disengagement of carbonic
acid during  the formation of indiretine, but the evolution of gas
might easily elude observation during the long-continued boiling
which is necessary for the production of this substance.
   The want of material has for the present interrupted the
further prosecution of my experiments.       As soon as shall have                 I
obtained an additional quantity of the fresh plant, it is my inten
tion to continue them. The action of acids on indican requires
still further examination, and the effects produced by ferments
and other agents remain to be investigated.          also propose to      I
examine other   indigo-bearing plants, in order to ascertain whether
they contain indican or not.
   The results of the present investigation may be summed up in
the following propositions:—
   1. The Isatis tinctoria does not contain indigo-blue ready
formed, either in the blue or colourless state.
   2. The formation of the blue colouring matter in watery ex
tracts of the plant is neither caused nor promoted by the action
of oxygen or of alkalies.
   3. Indigo-blue cannot be said to exist in any state of combi
nation in the juices of the plant: it is merely contained in them
potentially.
XI.   On the alleged Fluorescence of a solution of Platino-cyanide

I
      GENTLEMEN,
    was surprised, some time since, by reading in Poggendorff’s
      Annalen the statement of Dr. Böttger, which has since been
republished in the Philosophical Magazine, that a solution of
platino-cyanide of potassium is highly fluorescent.        My own
observations had led me to the conclusion, that “it is only in
the solid state that the platino-cyanides are sensitive, their solu
tions look like mere water*.” In consequence of Dr. Böttger's
statement,     I
              have just examined again a solution of platino
cyanide of potassium, with the advantage of bright sunshine and
a complete quartz train; and so far from          being eminently   its
fluorescent, find             it     be

the electrolytic, the transference of the electric force appearing
to be essentially associated with the chemical changes which
occur; the second kind may be called conduction proper, and
there the act of conduction leaves the body ultimately as it found

bodies we retain for consideration the class of electrolytes only,
then, though the amount of electricity of a given intensity which
these can transmit electrolytically when they are fluid is often
almost infinitely greater than that which they can convey on
wards by conduction proper when they are solid, still the con
duction in the latter cases is very evident.    A piece of perfectly
dry solid nitre, and of many other electrolytes, discharges a gold
                                                          I
leaf electrometer very freely, and believe by the power of con
duction proper; and that being the case, do not see that the                 I
assumption of the very highest condition of electrolytic conduc
tion when the nitre is rendered fluid is any argument for the
absolute disappearance of the conduction proper which belonged
to the body in the solid state, though it may override the latter
for the time, and make it insensible. These considerations are,
however, such as arise rather from the absence of the final and
 strict proof on the opposite side, than from anything very posi
tive in their own character; but it has occurred to me that the
phaenomena of static electricity will furnish us with many reasons
 of a positive nature in favour of the possession by liquid electro
 lytes of the power of conduction proper. Some of these I will
 endeavour briefly to state, illustrating the subject by a reference
 to water, which in              its
                        pure state has but low degree        electro     a                      of

bands of gutta-percha, by which they were well insulated, and
being about 3 inches diameter, they formed, when placed in con
tact, a double system 6 inches in length. A metallic ball,
about 4 inches in diameter, was connected with the electric
machine to form an inductric body, an uninsulated brass plate
was placed about 9 inches off to form an inducteous body; be
tween these the associated water balls could be placed so as to
take part in the induction, and when the electric charge was so
low that the moist atmosphere caused no transmission of elec
tricity, the balls could be introduced into position and brought
away without having received any permanent charge.          Under
these circumstances, if the associated balls were brought into the
place of induction, were then separated, withdrawn and exa
mined, they were found, the one charged positively and the
other negatively, by electricity derived from themselves, and
without conductive or convective communication with any other
substance than their own water.
   It is well known indeed that by the use of water we may
replace    metal         in    all

and about p will become charged positive, and those at and about
n negative, solely by the disturbance of the electric force origin
ally in the bubble, i. e. without any direct transmission of the
electric force from N or P; the parts at e or q will have no elec
tric charge, and from those parts to p and n the charge will rise
gradually to a maximum. The electricity which appears at p, n,
and elsewhere, will have been conducted to these parts from other
parts of the bubble; and if the bubble be replaced by two hemi
spheres of metal, slightly separated at the equatorial parts eq,
the electricity (before conducted in the continuous bubble) will
then be seen to pass as a bright spark. Now the particles at
any part of the water bubble may be considered under two points
of view, either as having had a current passed through them, or
as having received a charge; in either view the idea of conduc
tion proper supplies sufficient and satisfactory reasons for the
results; but the idea of electrolytic conduction seems to me at
present beset with difficulties.   For consider the particles about     .
the  equator  eq,-they  acquire  no final charge, and they have con
ducted, as the action of the two half spheres above referred to
 show; and they are not in a state of mutual tension, as is fully
proved by very simple experiments with the half hemispheres.
Therefore oxygen must have passed from e towards n, hydrogen
from e towards p, i. e. towards and to the parts to which the
electricity has been conducted, for without such transmission of
 the anions and cations there would be no transmission of the
 electricity, and so no electrolytic conduction.       But then the
 questions arise,   Where do these elements appear f is the water
at n oxygenated, and that about p hydrogenated ? and may the
elements be at last dispersed into the air at these two points, as
in the case of decompositions against air poles? (Exp. Res.455,
461, &c.)      In regard to such questions other considerations
occur   respecting  the particles about p and n, and the condition
of  charge   they  have acquired. These have received the elec
tricity which has passed as a current through the equatorial
parts, but they have had no current or no proportional current
through themselves—the conduction has extended to them but
not through them; no electricity has passed for instance through
 the particle at n or at p, yet more electricity has gone by some
kind of conduction to them than to any other of the particles in
the sphere. It is not consistent with our understanding of elec
 trolytic conduction to suppose that these particles have been
 charged by such conduction; for in the exercise of that function
it is just as essential that the electricity should leave the decom
 posing particle on the one side, as that it should go to it on the
 other: the mere escape of oxygen and hydrogen into the           air
 not enough   to   account for the result, for such escape may be is

for a time, amongst other serious objections, that already given,
that the products would not be found at the places to which the
electricity has been conveyed), still the present argument would
have like force. At renough electricity may have passed through
to decompose two particles of water, at s only enough to de
compose one,—how is a particle between r and s to change ele
ments with the particles either towards r or towards s, if electro
lytic change only is to be admitted for how, as before inquired,
can two particles throw their power on to, or receive their power
from one º Many other considerations spring out of the thought
of a water bubble, under static induction; but these just ex
pressed, with those that relate to the seat of electrolytic action,
whether at the place of current or of charge, create a sum of
difficulty fully sufficient, without any others, to make me suspend
for the present any conclusions on the matter in question.
    The conduction power of water may be considered under
 another point of view; namely, that which has relation to the
 absolute charge that can be given to the fluid. A point from
 the electrical machine can charge neighbouring particles of air,
 and they issue off in streams.

               theories
        phaenomena of crystallization have been but short lived in
their reputation; and, indeed, it may be safely doubted if any
occupy such a position as to entitle them to much credit.
   The subject is itself one of much interest; and although the
consideration that so many able minds have failed in the attempt
to investigate it may naturally deter an inquirer, still the prize
is sufficient to persuade him to hazard the attempt.
     I shall   first takeshort review of the many theories which
                                    a
 have been advanced in explanation of the phaenomena, and                                                         I
trust I shall be able to show that some were unquestionably
faulty, and       byall
                 undoubtedly and confessedly deficient.
   Passing      the many absurd theories advanced        this subject                        on

 Christian Huygens.                       In

                       their unequal density separated the incident

another, but it was totally erroneous in theory, as Dr. Wollaston
has ably shown.
    Immediately after him, Dr. Wollaston published in the Philo
sophical Transactions a theory of the manner in which the
common octahedron and tetrahedron may be built up of spheres
having a mutual attraction for each other. He evidently con
sidered his ideas the same as those of Hooke, as he says he found
himself anticipated by that writer.      He does not seem to have
prosecuted his inquiries very far, indeed he leaves totally un
noticed the innumerable other forms to be met with in mature.
He does, however, make some observations with regard to the
cube, but he does not appear to have satisfied himself; his words
are to this effect:-‘‘If a number of white and an equal number
of black balls are so arranged that each white ball shall be equi
distant from the four nearest black balls, and also from the
adjacent white balls, the form which they would take would be
a cube.”
    I shall now endeavour to show that this theory of the forma
tion of the octahedron is faulty, inasmuch as the molecules, if
left to themselves, would never assume such an arrangement.
   If  any four spherical atoms become attached in consequence
of their mutual attraction, they will combine in the manner
shown in Plate I. fig. 1, and any fifth atom will attach itself, as
shown in fig. 2; but if we examine fig. 3, which represents the
arrangement which he supposes them to have, we will find that
any five adjacent spheres occupy a position such as shown in
fig. 4, a position which they evidently never would naturally
aSSume.
   Wollaston himself seems to have some lurking doubts of the
validity of this assumption, as he begins by showing how the
spheres will become aggregated    if on a plane, and then from this
basis builds  up  the octahedron;  this, however, is the very man
ner in which crystals do not form.
   The first who really investigated this most interesting subject
was the Abbé Haüy; his work forms an aera in the history of
the science.     He perceived that many crystals were liable to
cleavage, and that thus in many cases new solids were obtained;
he was led from this to consider, that, if this cleavage were con
tinued long enough, he would ultimately arrive at the absolute
atom; and he assumed, without sufficient foundation, that this
atom should have the same form as the solid obtained by cleavage.
   The forms which he considered the molecules to have were the
tetrahedron, parallelopiped, and the three-sided prism.         He
clearly showed that many of the forms could be constructed with
these elements, and he pointed out how some of the secondary
forms would result from certain decrements or omissions in the

regular succession of the particles. He however failed in account
ing for the formation of the ordinary octahedron, as such a form
could not result unless from a mixture of little tetrahedrons and
octahedrons, or unless the tetrahedrons were united by their
corners, leaving spaces between them.           The necessity for such
an arrangement so unaccountable and so totally at variance with
the rest of his theory was evidently subversive of             He more               it.

                   take place, nor does      seem possibleit                               to   do   so   on
his hypothesis.      He seems      have begun
                                           to       the wrong end, and   at

having procured specimens       felspar, taken from seven localities
                                                                of

         the Granites     of the Dublin           and Wicklow Mountains.             117
at about equal distances in a line stretching forty miles from
Dublin,        I
             subjected them to careful analysis, and furnished the
results to the Academy, and also to your valuable Journal.
These results leave nothing to be wished for as far as the second
question is concerned, as in every case the specimen appeared to
be true orthose, resembling in every particular those which are
to be found in Killiney and Dalkey.
   In the last Number of your Journal perceive that a commu   I
nication has been made by Professor Haughton, in which he
gives a number of analyses of rock specimens taken from different
localities in this range; his results appear to be altogether                            in
consistent with the opinion expressed by Sir Robert Kane as to
the character of the felspars of these mountains, and therefore,
of course, with the extended series of analytical investigations of
rock specimens on which Sir Robert Kane stated that he founded
his opinion, and which, although now nearly three years have
elapsed, he has never produced.
   Professor Haughton has, in the course of his research, dis
covered a most interesting fact as to the character of these gra
nites, namely that in every specimen taken from the range itself
the potash predominates over the soda, while in the outlying
granitic protrusions, the soda prevails, thus indicating a curious
 constitutional difference, which may, and probably does, accom
pany a difference of age in these rocks hitherto undiscovered.
   As to Mr. Jenning's interference in this discussion, he has
not, in my opinion, contributed much to either side; nor do                                I
think he understands the question in                bearings. all   its
                                                                    the             In

                                  felspars were produced and relied
                                           of

                                                       the alkalies was

current consists of two parts, or two alternate currents, one in
the opposite, and the other in the same direction as the inducing
current, corresponding respectively to the moments when the
circuit of the latter current is closed and broken.
   This can be detected by the galvanometer.       When the induc
tion wire is very  thin and long, and a galvanometer  is introduced,
no deviation is  observed;   but when the said wire is thicker and
shorter, or the inducing current stronger, the phaenomenon of a
                                          I
twofold deviation, which described in 1838, is observable+. This
is caused, of course, by quick, successive magnetizations of the
needle in opposite directions.
     If
      water or dilute sulphuric acid is introduced into the cur
rent between platinum plates, oxygen and hydrogen are liberated
at each plate, and after the cessation of the current no trace of a
polarization of the plates can be detected.
   In a similar manner, moistened iodide of potassium paper,
when put in contact with the poles, shows a separation of iodide
of equal strength at each pole.
   An electric thermometer rises, the direction of the current
being indifferent to      but       it,

   Second case.—When the    poles  are separated        stratum                                    a

lity with which it is here produced, even without any insulation
of the galvanometer, will appear somewhat remarkable.
    According to Riess, a thermic action is produced in the wire of
the interrupted current, but it is an exceedingly weak one. With
my less sensitive air-thermometer I could not detect this action,
although the same was sufficiently sensible to show the increase
of heat in the perfectly closed wire, especially when the latter
was thick.      It is worthy of notice, however, that notwithstanding
this, a thermo-electric battery was charged in exactly the same
manner as with a galvanic current, that is to say, opposite to the
 direction of the same.     I  observed it in a combination of two
V-formed bismuth and        antimony    pairs. The common thermo
 electric batteries are not here applicable, in consequence of their
imperfect insulation.
    The sparks at the point where the current is broken have also
a thermic action, in fact, a much greater one than that which
 takes place in the metallic circuit of the current. When very
 thin platinum wires are used as poles, and when they are brought
 near one another, it has already been observed by several phy
 sicists that the point of the negative wire, which is then sur
 rounded by the positive sparks, becomes red-hot.
     Chemical decompositions,      decompositions of water, iodide of
 potassium, &c., are effected in exactly the same manner as with
 a galvanic current, i.e. only one electrolyte is separated at each
 pole. In water the electrodes become polarized, and when they
 are composed of very thin platinum wires, the negative one
 becomes slightly illuminated at the extremity.
     Many of these decompositions are interesting when they are
 so made that the point where the current is broken is at the
 liquid itself. For this purpose the wires of the discharger are
 placed vertical and near one another, and the liquid is made to ap
 proach them from below, so that the sparks may be made to strike
 the liquid from both wires at once, or only from one, the other
 being kept immersed.         In general it is found that the stream
 of   sparks  from the   positive pole possesses a yellow or reddish
 yellow colour at the top, close to the point of the wire, and forms
 a blue disc below on the surface of the water; whereas the
 stream of sparks from the negative pole is blue at the top, and
 surrounds with this light a part of the wire from the point,
 whilst a yellowish glimmer rests upon the liquid. When the
 liquid is placed nearer to the wires, about a quarter of a line
 from them, the phaenomenon reduces itself to blue sparks at
  the negative, and yellow ones at the positive pole.
     Further, the phaenomenon is different according to the nature
 of the liquid. Non-conducting liquids, such as turpentine, do not,
  of course, show the phaenomenon at all.     With distilled water it is

126     Prof.    J.   C. Poggendorff on the Induction Apparatus
generated electricity is thereby increased. Hence a pole of the un
connected induction current acts upon the electrometer at a much
greater distance when the condenser is employed than when it
is not. From this it follows, that when the ends or poles of the
induction wire are separated by a certain thickness of air, the
sparks which break through it are increased in number when a
condenser is employed; indeed, many sparks appear when this
distance between the poles is so great, that, without a condenser,
not a single one would be visible. The condenser, therefore,
actually increases that part of the electricities which equalize
themselves at the poles, or are set in circulation, when the induc
tion wire is interrupted by air.
   This is also proved by the galvanometric deviation, which,
under these circumstances, is increased; whilst, as has before
been mentioned, it is not changed by the condenser when the
metallic continuity of the wire is unbroken.       It is also proved
by the decomposition of water which is effected by the induction
current when broken by air; for this action is also increased by
the condenser.
   What has here been said of tensions, sparks, deviations, and
decompositions, is also true of the physiological actions,—of the
shocks which are received when part of the body is introduced
into the circuit. These are also increased by the condenser.
Not only is the action of the easternal or actual induction current
more intense, but that of the inner or extra current is also                     in
creased.   I have convinced myself of this in several ways, the
least painful  of which was the following. Two platinum plates
were  placed  in spring-water, and connected either with the poles
of the induction coil or with the hammer on each side of the
point of interruption.    If the finger be immersed in the water
between the    plates, the effect of introducing the condenser can
be observed without pain.       The action is increased with the
quantity of the current, as Faraday terms                 it.
                                                     With the thin
induction wire the action      exceedingly weak, stronger with the
                               is
thick induction wire, and most sensible with the still thicker
wire of the extra current.         -
   These experiments induce me        to

128       Prof.   J.   C. Poggendorff on the Induction Apparatus
guished from the regular beat of the hammer. On the contrary,
by employing a strong galvanic current, these sparks are quite
visible; they are more steady than the interruption sparks, emit
a very clear light, throw out smaller sparks, and, with conden
sers of small dimensions, assume the appearance of a small flame
breaking forth from under the hammer. This is a consequence
of the great intensity of the current, which has also the effect of
fusing the platinum extremity of the hammer, even when the
same is 1 millim. thick, and soldering it to the anvil, so that the
action of the instrument is arrested unless the small electro
magnet has sufficient power to overcome the solder. The latter
always occurred when a current from one of Grove’s elements
was conducted through the wire 400 feet long and two-thirds                          of
a millim. thick.
   Riess found that this fusion could be avoided by using a long,
thin, German silver wire to connect the condenser       with the
hammer, and thus throwing a body of great resistance into the
circuit.   The discharge sparks, however, are thereby merely
weakened; they can still be observed by employing the current
from a battery of two elements, even when 120 or 130 inches of
German silver wire, 0.45 millim. in thickness, are introduced
between the condenser and the hammer by means of the rheo
chord, and it is at the same time indifferent whether the current
traverses the wires of the primary coil side by side or one after
the other.
   Further, the action of the condenser upon the induction cur
rent is weakened by so great a length of German silver wire, as
may be best seen by the luminous phaenomena in the electric
egg.    This is most perceptible when the wires of the primary
coil are traversed side by side; when they are arranged one after
the other, no diminution in the action can be detected, even
when 150 inches of German silver wire are used.      In the latter
case, however, where the interruption at the hammer is scarcely
perceptible, the luminous phaenomenon in the egg      without         is,             a
condenser, somewhat different   what  to     the first case;

conducted    through the coils of the other, in order to study the
influence of increased resistance upon the sparks and luminous
phaenomena in general.     For this purpose conducted the current    I
of the shorter of  my  induction wires through the 20,000 feet of
wire in the other two coils. The sparks were smaller and less
brilliant, but there was no perceptible diminution in the distance
at which sparks could be obtained. The additional introduction
of twelve beakers full of water, and connected by platinum arches,
did not alter this result.                                          -
   This corresponds perfectly with similar phaenomena in frictional
electricity, formerly studied by Riess.      Nevertheless, as far as
my own experiments are concerned,                               I
                                             am inclined to doubt

I        had here      an   opportunity         of   testing        an   assertion   of   Masson's.
This physicist states that when two induction instruments are
placed alongside one another, but     opposite directions, and are
                                                        in
thus connected with the electric egg, both electric lights, the blue
glimmering light and the positive flame, are simultaneously seen
upon each knob%.       From this    arrives          he
                                               the strange conclu        at
sion, that rarefied air possesses the property      simultaneously             of
conducting two electric currents                         of
                                       opposite directions.      ob                         I
tained    different and far more natural result, viz. that under
           a

                      to            allowing  two   by

             to                                 more than probable  it   is
that the strokes of the hammers of both instruments were not
exactly isochronous and synchronous. The phaenomenon observed
be by
        him would then           be

  combined one after the        other,  mutually disturb one another, and

  would produce with the same intensity                 galvanic current.
     Further,        the above
                    if              experiment          modified        that the                   so

                                   and the   subsequent      metallic closing                                      of B
B    again destroys this increase.
     Hence, when many induction coils are connected one after the

THE“Some         Observations on the Ova of the Salmon, in relation to
the distribution of Species; in a letter addressed to Charles Darwin,
Esq., M.A., W.P.R.S. &c.” By John Davy, M.D., F.R.SS. Lond.
& Edinb.
    In this paper the author describes a series of experiments on the
ova of the Salmon, made with the intent of ascertaining their power
of endurance under a variety of circumstances without loss of life,
with the expectation suggested by Mr. Darwin, that the results might
possibly throw some light on the geographical distribution of fishes.
   The details of the experiments are given in five sections. The
results obtained were the following:—
    1. That the ova of the Salmon in their advanced stage can be ex
posed only for a short time to the air if dry, at ordinary tempera
tures, without loss of life; but for a considerable time, if the tempe
rature be low, and if the air be moist; the limit in the former case
not having exceeded an hour, whilst in the latter it has exceeded
many hours.
    2. That the vitality of the ova was as well preserved in air satu
rated with moisture, as it would have been had they been in water.
    3. That the ova may be included in ice without loss of vitality,
provided the temperature is not so low as to freeze them.
   4. That the ova, and also the fry recently produced, can bear for
some time a temperature of about 80° or 82° in water, without
materially suffering; but not without loss of life, if raised above 84°
or 85°.
   5. That the ova and young fry are speedily killed by a solution
of common salt nearly of the specific gravity of sea-water, viz. 1026;
and also by a weaker solution of specific gravity 1016.
   Finally, in reference to the inquiry regarding the distribution of
the species of fishes, he expresses his belief that some of the results
may be of useful application, especially those given in the second
and third sections; inferring, that as in moist air, the vitality of the
ova is capable of being long sustained, they may during rain or fog
be conveyed from one river or lake to another adhering to some part
of an animal, such as a Heron or Otter, and also during a time of
snow or frost; and, further, that other of the results may be useful
towards determining the fittest age of ova for transport for the pur
pose of stocking rivers, and likewise as a help to explain the habitats,
and some of the habits of the migratory species.

 reason to believe that the long tentacula, so called, are the homo
 logues of the cephalic fins of Pteropods.
    The particular features of Phyllirrhoë, expressed in the last para
 graph, also serve to distinguish it from the Heteropoda, but it some
 what approximates this order in the general conformation of its body,
 which is elongated, laterally compressed, and presents a kind of pro
 boscis at the anterior, and a rudder-fin at the posterior extremity.
 There is also, as it would appear to be, a small remnant of the foot
 on the inferior thin margin of the body, and the lateral undulatory
 motion of the animal in the water exactly resembles that of Cero
 phora, or Carinaria.
    The heart of Phyllirrhoë, in common with that of Heteropods in
 general, holds a dorsal position.     The auricle lies posterior to the
 ventricle, as in Cerophora and Firola, but the reverse is the case in
 Atlanta and Carinaria, the difference being due to the relation which
 the respiratory surface bears to the heart itself, lying in every case
 on the auricular side.     Moreover it is remarkable that the rectum
 is directed backwards in the former instances, but turns forwards in
 the latter, taking an opposite course to that of the circulation
 through the heart.
    It may be observed in conclusion, that in Heteropoda the viscera
 are closely packed together so as to occupy the smallest possible
 space, while they are widely distributed through the abdomen in
 Phyllirrhoë; thus, again, calling to mind          relationship       its

little clusters of dark pigment-cells, disposed so much after the
manner of those of the ciliated arms as to lead to the impression that
it is one of the same series, or whorl of organs, to use botanical
phraseology.    A pectinate gill extends beneath the mantle, along
the anterior third of the dorsal region, lying, as in most cases, in
advance of the heart. The visceral mass of the body, though elon
gated, is but slightly curved upon itself, not exceeding half a turn.
The lobules of the liver, distended with large amber-coloured oil
globules, may be distinctly seen through the transparent outer enve
lope and shell.    Single spherical otolithes are contained in the
acoustic sacs, and the lingual ribbon is lengthy and flexuous, pre
senting a row of uncini on each side, with a series of minute
denticulations, pointing backwards on their anterior and posterior
borders.    The uncini of opposite sides interlock with one another
so closely as to conceal the rudimentary segments of the rachis
almost completely.    The shell is cartilaginous, transparent, planor
bicular, and perfectly symmetrical, presenting four rows of minute
conical tuberculations on its convex or dorsal surface. The gyri of
the involute nucleus are so curved as to leave a central perforation;
the mouth of the tube encroaches considerably on the last whorl,
and the outer lip is deeply notched between the two lateral rows of
tubercles. The author has named the species Jasonilla M'Leayiana.

    Note “On the position of Aluminum in the Voltaic series.” By
Charles Wheatstone, Esq., F.R.S.
   Having, through the kindness of Dr. Hofmann, been permitted to
examine a specimen of aluminum prepared by M. Claire-Deville, I
availed myself of the opportunity to ascertain one of the physical
properties of this extraordinary metal, which it does not appear
has been yet determined, viz. its order in the voltaic series. The
following are the results of my experiments.
    Solution of potass acts more energetically and with a greater evo
lution of hydrogen gas upon aluminum than it does on zinc, cadmium
or tin. In this liquid aluminum is negative to zinc, and positive to
cadmium, tin, lead, iron, copper and platina.      Employed as the po
sitive metal, the most steady and energetic current is obtained
when it is opposed to copper as the negative metal;                all

metals negative      to  which were tried became rapidly polarized,

   Nitric and sulphuric acids are known not        act chemically
                                                         to         any   in
sensible manner on aluminum.         With the former acid diluted               as
the exciting liquid aluminum   is negative     zinc, cadmium, tin, lead

current is insensible.   In both these liquids copper and platina are
negative to aluminum, and notwithstanding the apparent absence
of chemical action on the latter metal, weak currents are pro
duced.
   It is rather remarkable, that a metal, the atomic number of which
is so small, and the specific gravity of which is so low, should occupy
such a position in the electromotive scale as to be more negative
than zinc in the series.

   “An      Experimental             Inquiry into the nature of the metamorphosis
of Saccharine Matter,                as a normal process       of the animal oeconomy.”
By Dr. Pavy.
   The author begins by observing, that the saccharine matter met
with in the animal oeconomy is derived from two sources—from the
vegetable kingdom, and from the liver of the animal itself; in each
case being poured into the general circulation through the hepatic
veins. The liver not only enjoys the power of forming sugar, but
it likewise exerts (as shown by the experiments of Bernard) some
                                                                          it its
modifying influence over that which is traversing   capillaries and
which has been absorbed from the food,               which   by    transformed     is
from   vegetable   into animal    sugar,   and thus rendered more apt for
 serving    in
             the processes             of
                                 animal life.
   The sugar poured into the general circulation through the hepatic
veins is conveyed       the capillaries
                           to                the lungs, where
                                                  of                 great part    it   in

pearance of sugar takes place in the systemic capillaries, and un
equally so in different portions of them, induced him to push his
investigations, and see if there might not be some other cause in
operation in the living animal to effect the normal destruction of
sugar, besides the direct chemical action of the oxygen absorbed in
respiration.    The results of these investigations, which were first
directed towards the changes produced in blood normally containing
sugar, injected through the capillaries of lungs removed from the
animal, and artificially inflated with atmospheric air or oxygen gas,
have induced the author to refer the metamorphosis of sugar in the
animal oeconomy, to a process which is perfectly consistent and
analogous with the well-known chemical bearings of this substance
apart from the animal system.
   In experiments which the author has now several times re
peated, he injected blood removed from the right side of the heart of
an animal—and therefore normally containing sugar—through the
capillaries of the artificially inflated lungs of another; and found
that as long as the blood retains          fibrine, there       much de
                                                               its                      is   as

that where the fibrine has been separated from the serum and
corpuscles, the sugar ceases               influenced by the presence

tact with oxygen         requisite for the destruction
                           is                                 sugar.       But     of                      in

      Dr. Pavy on the metamorphosis of Saccharine Matter.            147
   This acid reaction of decomposing blood is only observable in
that which was previously pretty largely impregnated with sugar.
It appears to be owing to the formation of lactic acid. Certainly,
it cannot be due to carbonic acid, for the reaction remains after
exposure to a boiling temperature.
    The disappearance of sugar in the manner just pointed out does
not depend on the oxygen of the air, except in so far as this agent is
concerned in exciting the decomposition of the azotized constituents
of the blood; for the sugar disappears as rapidly when there is a
small, as when there is a large amount of surface exposed to the air.
But if the air be carefully and completely excluded, no signs of de
composition of the animal parts of the blood are to be observed, and
under these circumstances the sugar also remains. The disappear
ance of sugar is more rapid where the fibrine and corpuscles are pre
sent, than when the serum is exposed alone; and in accordance
 with this, the blood in the one case undergoes decomposition much
 sooner than in the other—a fact easily intelligible from the greater
 amount of azotized ingredients present.
     If blood normally impregnated with saccharine matter be placed
 aside until signs of incipient decomposition are observed, and the
 sugar is beginning to disappear, exposure to a current of oxygen
 rapidly completes the total disappearance of the saccharine con
 stituent.    In this observation we have a further illustration of the
 analogy that appears to exist, in the nature of the metamorphosis of
 sugar as a physiological process, and that which takes place chemi
 cally under the influence of an azotized compound, whose elemen
 tary particles are in a state of molecular transition.        During life,
 the   higher  organic  constituents of the blood are   capable  of under
 going the changes of assimilation on exposure to contact with
 oxygen, and there is a considerable destruction of sugar effected;
 for a short period after death these azotized constituents remain
 stationary and uninfluenced by oxygen, and with this, there is a
 corresponding suspension of the transformation of sugar; but finally,
 the animal matter of the blood on contact with oxygen, especially
 during a warm temperature, assumes a state of decomposition, the
 molecular changes of which again excite the destruction or meta
 morphosis of saccharine matter.
     The sugar disappears far less rapidly from diabetic blood under
 the influence of exposure to the atmosphere, than from healthy
 right-ventricular blood. From these, and a few other observations
 which he has as yet been able to make on the blood in Diabetes
 Mellitus, the author, were he to hazard an opinion on the nature of
 that obscure disease, would be disposed to say that there appears to
 be a modification of sugar produced by the liver, which is not suscep
 tible of undergoing the normal process of destruction in the animal
 system, and which, therefore, accumulating in the blood, is elimi
 nated by the kidneys.         The experiments of Bernard have shown
 that   vegetable   glucose  (grape-sugar)   is not susceptible of destruc
 tion in the     processes  of animal  life, unless converted into animal

       “A Second Memoir upon Quantics.” By Arthur Cayley, Esq.
F.R.S.
   The memoir is intended as a continuation of the author's introduc
tory memoir upon Quantics (vide Phil. Mag. vol. viii. p. 69, and Phil.
Trans. 1854, p.245); the special subject of the memoir is the theorem
referred to in the postscript of the introductory memoir, and the
numerous developments arising thereout in relation to the number
and form of the covariants of a binary quantic. The author, after some
remarks as to the asyzygetic integrals and the irreducible integrals of
a system of partial differential equations, and after noticing that the
number of irreducible integrals is in general infinite, proceeds to
establish the above-mentioned theorem, viz. that a function of any
order and degree satisfying the necessary condition as to weight, and
such that it is reduced to zero by one of the operations (wdy} —rdy
and {ydr}-yde, is reduced to zero by the other of the two opera
tions, i. e. that it is a covariant; and he shows how by means of the
theorem the actual calculation of the covariants is to be effected. The
theorem gives at once (in terms of symbols P,            which denote                  P',                        a
number        partitions) expressions for the number
                of                                         the asyzygetic                  of

          To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
             GENTLEMEN,
                    an account, which is making the tour of the newspapers,        of
  SEEING  an attempt      to sound the depths of Niagara, which failed in con
  sequence of the great velocity of the stream not allowing the plumb
 to sink, it struck me that that which could not be accomplished by
 main force might be done by a very simple contrivance.
      The principle on which a schoolboy's common kite mounts in the air,
 overcoming the law of gravity, is well known; and I should think that
 an apparatus constructed on the same principle, and perhaps of a
 like form but much smaller, and strongly made of iron, would by
 the action of the current of water be forced to the bottom of the
river.       All boys know that the stronger the breeze, the higher the
kite flies. The depth might be easily determined by the angle of
 the detaining chain or wire with the surface of the water.               I merely
throw out the          hint, hoping   it  may perhaps   lead to the invention of
some apparatus that will overcome the difficulty.
     I enclose a rough diagram, and remain, Sirs,
                                              Your obedient Servant,

ON A FALL OF METEORIC                STONES AT BREMEWORDE           IN HANOVER.
                                   BY M. WöHLER.
     On the 13th of May last, at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, a very
remarkable fall of meteoric stones was observed near Bremeworde,

 not far from Hamburg.              This phaenomenon was accompanied by
thunder and a      great    hissing   noise. The sky was cloudy, so that the
meteor was not        seen;    but three stones were seen falling, and these
were found.        It is   very   probable that a greater number fell.              The
largest of these stones weighs 3 kilogrammes, the second 13 kilo
gramme, and the third 325 grammes.
    Like most of the aërolites observed, these stones are covered with
a black fused crust.        Their fracture shows a mixture of several mine
rals of a gray colour, amongst which a considerable quantity of me
tallic iron and sulphuret of iron may be distinguished.                  They present
a close resemblance with those which fell in Transylvania on the
4th of September 1852, and which form part of the collection in the
Imperial Museum of Vienna.-Comptes Rendus, June 25, 1855,

            the published account of his researches it is to be
       inferred, that the same heavy glass, by means of which he
produced the rotation of the plane of polarization of a luminous
ray, also led Mr. Faraday to the discovery of the diamagnetic
force. A square prism of the glass, 2 inches long and 0.5 of an
inch thick, was suspended with               its
                                         length horizontal between
the two poles       of

from the centre        one pole        to
                                    that     the other.                    A
ordinary magnetic matter, similarly suspended, would,                              as
well known, set          its
                        longest dimension from pole          pole.   To  to
distinguish the two positions here referred to, Mr. Faraday
introduced two new terms, which have since come into general
use:  he  called the direction parallel    the line joining the poles,
                                               to
the avial direction, and that perpendicular          the said line, the
                                                             to
equatorial direction.
   The difference between this new action and the ordinary
magnetic action, was further manifested when              fragment   a                  of
the heavy glass was suspended before           single magnetic pole:
                                                    a
the fragment was repelled when the magnetism was excited;

and to the force which produced this repulsion Mr. Faraday
gave the name of diamagnetism.
   Numerous other substances were soon added to the heavy
glass, and, among the metals, it was found that bismuth pos
sessed the new property in a comparatively exalted degree.      A                                                        t
fragment of this substance was forcibly repelled by either of the
poles of a magnet; while a thin barof the substance, or a glass tube
containing the bismuth in fragments, or in powder, suspended
between the two poles of a horseshoe magnet, behaved exactly
like the heavy glass, and                   set      its
                                  longest dimension equatorial.

 Shortly after the publication of M. Plücker’s first memoir, Mr.
Faraday observed the remarkable magnetic properties of crystal
lized bismuth ; and his researches upon this, and other kindred
points, formed the subject of the Bakerian Lecture before the
Royal Society for the year 1849.
   Through the admirable lecturesofProfessor Bunsen on Electro
chemistry in 1848, I was first made acquainted with the existence
of the diamagnetic force; and in the month of November 1849
my friend Professor Knoblauch, then of Marburg, now of the
University of Halle, suggested to me the idea of repeating the
experiments of M. Plücker and Mr. Faraday.           He had procured
the  necessary  apparatus   with the view of  prosecuting    the subject
himself, but the pressure of other duties prevented him from
carrying out his intention.                    I
                                        adopted the suggestion and
entered   upon   the  inquiry   in M. Knoblauch's cabinet.           Our
frequent conversations upon the subject led to the idea of our
making a joint publication of the results: this we accordingly
did in two papers, the first of which, containing a brief account
of some of the earliest experiments, appeared in the Philosophical
Magazine for March 1850, and some time afterwards in Pog
gendorff’s Annalen; while the second and principal memoir
appeared in the Philosophical Magazine for July 1850, and in
Poggendorff’s Annalen about January 1851*.                    afterwards    I
continued    my  researches in the    private laboratory   of Professor
Magnus of Berlin, who, with prompt kindness and a lively
interest in the furtherance of the inquiry, placed             necessary    all
apparatus      my disposal.    The results      this  investigation

158        Prof. Tyndall on the Nature    of the Force       by which
   The foregoing introductory statement will, perhaps, sufficiently
indicate the present aspect of this question. The object       pro       I
posed to myself in commencing the inquiry now laid before the
Royal Society, was to obtain, if possible, clearer notions of the
nature of the diamagnetic force than those now prevalent; for
though, in the preceding paragraphs, we have touched upon
some of the most complex phaenomena of magnetism and dia
magnetism, and are able to produce these phaenomena at will,
the greatest diversity of opinion still prevails as to the real re
lationship of the two forces.       The magnetic force, we know,
embraces both attraction and       repulsion,  thus exhibiting that
wonderful dual action which we are accustomed to denote by
the term polarity.    Mr. Faraday was the first who proposed the
hypothesis that diamagnetic bodies, operated on by magnetic
forces, possess a polarity “the same in kind as, but the reverse
in direction, of that acquired by iron, nickel, and ordinary mag
netic bodies under the same circumstances*.”          M. W. Weber
sought to confirm this hypothesis by a series of experiments,
wherein the excitement of the supposed diamagnetic polarity
was applied to the generation of induced currents—apparently
with perfect success. Mr. Faraday afterwards showed, and his
results were confirmed by M. Verdet, that effects similar to those
described by the distinguished German, were to be attributed,
not to the excitement of diamagnetic polarity, but to the genera
tion of ordinary induced currents in the metallic mass. On the
question of polarity Mr. Faraday's results were negative, and he
therefore, with philosophic caution, holds himself unpledged
to his early opinion. M. Weber, however, still retains his belief
in the reverse polarity of diamagnetic bodies, whereas Weber's
countryman M. von Fellitsch, in a series of memoirs recently
published in Poggendorff’s Annalen, contends that the polarity
of diamagnetic bodies is precisely the same as that of magnetic
ones.    In this unsettled state of the question nothing remained
for me but a complete examination of the nature of the dia
magnetic force, and a thorough comparison of                  its
                                                       phaenomena
with those      ordinary
                of        magnetism.     This has been attempted
in the following pages: with what success        must

considerable  time and care to obtain the results here recorded.
During a first examination of the cubes eight anomalies presented
themselves—in eight cases the fibre set either oblique or axial.
The whole thirty-five specimens were carefully rescraped with
glass and tested once more; still two remained, which, though
repelled as masses, persistently set with the fibre axial, and
oscillated round this position so steadily as to lead to the sup
position that the real deportment of the substance was thus
exhibited.           Ithese cubes ten times successively, and
                         scraped

         II.   ON THE ROTATION of BoDIES BETWEEN PoinTED
                          MAGNETIC Poles.
        In
      his experiments                      on
                          charcoal, wood-bark and other sub
stances, M. Plücker discovered some very curious phaenomena
of rotation, which occurred                          on
                               removing the substance experi

To account for these phaenomena,          assumed, that      the    he                           in
substances which exhibited the  rotation,  two antagonist forces
were perpetually active—a repulsive force, which caused the

substance to assume one position; and an attractive force,
which caused it to assume a different position: that, of these
two forces, the repulsive diminished more quickly than the
attractive, when the distance of the body from the poles was
augmented.     Thus, the former, which was predominant close
to the poles, succumbed to the latter when a suitable distance
was attained, and hence arose the observed rotation.
   Towards the conclusion of the memoir published in the Sep
tember Number of the Philosophical Magazine for 1851, I stated
that it was my intention further to examine this highly ingenious
theory.                          I
            shall now endeavour to fulfil the promise then made,

a substance possessing three rectangular magnetic axes, no two
of which are equal.    In the experiment cited in Table II., the
mass was so cut that the short diagonal of the rhombic base
was perpendicular to the length of the specimen.     Carbonate
of tin, and the other powders, were compressed by placing the
powder between two clean plates of copper, and squeezing them
together in a strong vice. The line of compression in diamag
netic bodies always sets equatorial, when the field of force
is uniform, or approximately so; but between points the repul
sion of the ends furnishes a couple strong enough to overcome
this directive action, causing the longest dimension of the
mass to set equatorial, and consequently                                  its   line   of   compression
axial.

      III.      ON THE DISTRIBUTION of THE MAGNETIC Force
                       BETWEEN Two FLAT Boles.
     Inexperiments where a uniform distribution of the magnetic
force is desirable, flat poles, or magnetized surfaces, have been
recommended.       It has long been known that the force proceeds
with   great  energy  from the edges of such poles: the increase
of force from the centre to the edge has been made the subject
of a special investigation by M. von Kolke”. The central portion
of the magnetic field, or space between two such magnetized
surfaces, has hitherto been regarded as almost perfectly uniform,
and indeed for               all
                     ordinary experiments the uniformity       suffi                                  is
cient.   But, when                 we
                         examine the field   carefully,    find that                      we

strength of the influencing magnet.        Poisson figured the act.
of magnetization as consisting of the decomposition of a neutral
magnetic fluid into north and south magnetism, the amount of
the decomposition being proportional to the strength of the
magnet which produces            Ampère, discarding the notion

Poisson’s hypothesis, upon the strength              the influencing              of
magnet.
   The state into which the soft iron            here supposed       is                                     to   be
thrown        state
             is   a    constraint,
                                of  and when the magnetis removed,
the substance returns                     to   its
                                 normal condition.        Poisson’s sepa
rated fluids rush together once more, and Ampère's molecular
currents return         their former irregular positions. As our
                                to
knowledge increases, we shall probably find both hypotheses
inadequate       represent the phaenomena; the only thing certain
                      to
 is,that the soft iron, when acted upon         the magnet, thrown   by                              is
into an unusual    condition,     virtue    whichin       attracted; and

attraction now will be
                                                     nMM',                                                       -
or   n   times the former attraction;                          hence when              a   variable        mag

          Bodies are repelled from the Poles       of a Magnet.          171
netic pole acts on an opposite one of constant power, the attrac
tion is proportional to the strength of the former.
   Let us now take a body whose magnetization varies with that
of the magnet: a south pole of the strength M induces in such
a body a north pole of the strength M', and the attraction which
results from their mutual action is
                                    MM".                 -
   Let the strength of the influencing south pole increase from
M    to nM; then, assuming the magnetism of the body under
influence to increase in the same ratio, the strength of the above
mentioned      north pole will become nM', and the attraction,           - - -- -
expressed by the product of both, will be
             .  . .                n°MM';           -- -
that is to say, the attraction of a body magnetized by influence,
and whose magnetism varies as the strength of the influencing
magnet, is proportional to the square of the strength of the latter.
   Here then is a mark of distinction between those bodies which
have their power of exhibiting magnetic phaenomena conferred
upon them by the magnet, and those whose actions are dependent
upon some constant property of the mass: in the latter case
the resultant action will be simply proportional to the strength
of the magnet, while in the former case a different law of action
will be observed”.           -
   The examination of this point lies at the very foundation of
our inquiries into the nature of the diamagnetic force.              Is the
repulsion of diamagnetic bodies dependent merely on the mass
considered as ordinary matter, or is it due to some condition
impressed upon the mass by the influencing magnet”                     This
question admits of the most complete answer either by comparing
the increase of repulsion with the increase of power in the mag
met which produces the repulsion, or by comparing the attraction
of a paramagnetic body, which we know to be thrown into an
unusual condition, with the repulsion of a diamagnetic body,
whose condition we would ascertain.
    Bars of iron and bismuth, of the same dimensions, were
submitted to the action of an electro-magnet, which was caused
gradually to increase in power; commencing with an excitation
by one cell, and proceeding up to an excitation by ten or fifteen.
The strength of the current was in each case accurately measured
by a tangent galvanometer.            The bismuth bar was suspended
between the two flat        poles,  and, when the magnet was excited,

             Bodies are repelled from the Poles of a Magnet.                                         177
   Here we find experiment in strict accordance with the theo
retical deduction stated at the commencement of the present
chapter. The intensity of the magnetism of the steel needle is
constant, for the steel resists magnetization by influence; the
consequence is that the attraction is simply proportional to the
strength of the magnet.
     Aconsideration  of the evidence thus adduced from indepen
dent  sources, and obtained by different methods, must, I imagine,
render the conclusion certain that diamagnetic bodies, like mag
netic ones, exhibit their phaenomena in virtue of a state of mag
netization induced in them by the influencing magnet.        This
conclusion is in no way invalidated by the recent researches of
M. Plücker, on the law of induction in paramagnetic and dia.
magnetic bodies, but, on the contrary, derives support from his
experiments.   With current strengths which stand in the ratio
of 1:2, M. Plücker finds the repulsion of bismuth to be as
1: 3-62, which, though it falls short of the ratio of 1:4, as the
law of increase according to the square of the current would have
it,               show that the bismuth was not passive, but

the case       of
            the soft iron itself, M. Plücker finds far greater                       a
divergence; for here currents which stand     the ratio    1:2        in                        of
produce attractions only                 in   the ratio     of   1:276,

     we suppose the flat surfaces of the two semicylinders which
constitute the ends of the cores to be in contact, and the cores
so excited that the poles P and P' are of different qualities, the
arrangement, it is evident, forms a true electro-magnet of the
horseshoe  form; and here the pertinency of a remark made by
M. Poggendorff, with his usual clearness of perception, becomes
manifest; namely, that if the repulsion of diamagnetic bodies be
an indifferent one of the mass merely, there is no reason why
they should not be repelled by the centre of a magnet, as well
as by         its   ends.

of the ammonia eliminated during          these changes, is a matter,
the  investigation    of which must    necessarily  be attended with
 great difficulty; but with respect to         capability     its

                                   my friend Mr. Prideaux, that                                                he
 has habitually observed that salt mixed with guano retards the
exhalation       ammonia from the latter; and
                  of                                      has directed           he

                             to                             M. Barral,                 by
one   ofwhich   proves  this point      remarkable  degree.
                                                     in  a     M. Bar

                  to                                            guano,                         of
and     guano previously mixed with half
       of                                          weight    salt: the its                 of

             of           each being determined
                                 in                    the end     that        at                     of
time,   he found that the     pure  guano  had lost 11.6   per cent.                                           of
its nitrogen, whilst that mixed with salt had lost only per cent.                           5

had occurred was considered to be clearly proved. Water was
then added in quantity just sufficient to moisten the salt, and
upon the re-insertion of the test-paper, a diminished blueing
showed that the ammonia was being absorbed”; water was again
added, yet in insufficient quantity to dissolve the whole of the
salt, and the action upon the litmus was gone.     In this way, by
alternating the addition of the ammonia and the solution of the
salt, the presence of the ammonia might be rendered more or less
distinct, or unrecognizable. The reality of the absorption was
thus rendered undeniable; and it was equally evident that the so
luble portion of the salt contained the absorbing agents, since the
disappearance of the ammonia bore a direct proportion to the com
pleteness of their solution. It then became a question as to which
of the constituents of the soluble portion this agency was due.
   Now the chloride of sodium being the largest ingredient, it
was desirable at once to ascertain the part which it played in the
matter: a saturated solution of the pure substance was therefore
prepared, measured quantities of it taken, placed in bottles, and
shaken with successive portions of carbonate of ammonia solu
tion until a decidedly blue tinge was produced in the litmus
paper, which, for the purpose of having a standard test, was left
enclosed  in the atmosphere within the bottle for the space of five
minutes.    As the amount of ammonia added approached the
maximum,          its
                absorption became correspondingly slower, and                                                     it

    Now as soon as the solution of carbonate of ammonia is
 dropped into these salt solutions, there occurs (as might have
 been anticipated) a precipitation of the sulphate of lime which
 they contain as carbonate; this must be attended with a corre
 sponding fixing of the ammonia, the latter combining with the
 sulphuric acid to which the lime was previously united; and by
 this reaction, the immense difference observed between the ab
 sorbing power of these solutions and that of a solution of pure
chloride of sodium would appear to be accounted for. Whether,

   We ought, then, to have an index to the absorbing power of
a salt by a knowledge of the quantities of chloride of sodium
and of soluble lime-salt which it contains; an equivalent of lime
salt fixing an equivalent of ammonia, and the chloride of sodium,
the per-centage which it has been above shown to absorb.                     Let
us now apply this method of determination to the samples under

 absorption is most active, and even after several hours’ contact,
 there is yet a feeble tinge imparted to the litmus-paper when

  The addition of the solutions to the chloride of sodium was
continued until a slight film of carbonate of lime was deposited
upon the mixture standing for half an hour; a deduction was

made for the excess added; the numbers therefore represent the
amount of carbonate of lime which can be permanently held dis
solved by the chloride of sodium.            this, because I believe                             I
that a far larger amount may be retained in solution for a limited
time; for if the first trivial precipitate is disregarded, twice or
three times as much of the two solutions may be added without
  roducing any such increase of the precipitate as ought to occur,
 f at that stage the chloride of sodium absolutely refused any
further action.   But this somewhat curious result         think of                          I

190               Mr. H. F. Baxter     on the Force evolved
    The results obtained by Despretz+, Becquerelt and Mat
teuccii, have thrown strong doubts upon the conclusions deduced
by Du Bois-Reymond.           Several experiments undertaken by the
author of the     present paper,   both prior and subsequent to the
knowledge of Du Bois-Reymond's researches, tended to confirm
in his opinion the doubts expressed by these inquirers.              But the
positive evidence adduced by Du Bois-Reymond by means of
his galvanometer, combined with that of Matteucci obtained by
means of the frog, only made it incumbent upon the opponents
of Du Bois-Reymond to disprove his conclusions, if capable of
disproof, more by stronger experimental evidence than by theo
retical arguments; hence the renewal of the present inquiry.
    In   relating the experiments, to avoid unnecessary prolixity,
we shall endeavour to be as concise as possible, incurring, how
ever, some risk of being considered as not having sufficiently
eliminated the sources of error. Our great point will be to
establish facts; and whatever observations we might think me
cessary to make in reference to the origin of the effect produced,
these will form the subject of the concluding remarks, and may
be considered as distinct from the main object of the paper.
We shall relate in a general manner some results that were
obtained by means of a galvanometer consisting of but few coils.
To two brass handles of an ordinary medical electro-magnetic
machine, were attached thick copper wires, each about 8 inches
in length, and bent. Similar copper wires were connected with
the galvanometer, their free ends communicating with mercurial
cups, these cups forming the means of connexion with the brass
handles. Holding the metallic handles firmly, grasping one of
them and contracting the muscles of the arm powerfully, and
doing this alternately with each arm, we at first failed to obtain
any, or if any, but indecisive results. Upon repeating the expe
riments on another occasion, we ultimately obtained some defi
nite result and a clue to our former failures.            It was found that
when the muscles of the arms were contracted alternately at
definite periods, and continuing this act for some time, that as
the hands became moist a decided effect upon the needle occurred,
indicating the contracting arm to be positiveš to the other. We
considered that these results were due partly to the reaction of
the acid secretions of the hand upon the metallic electrodes,
partly to the skin becoming a better conductor than the dry
euticle, and partly perhaps to thermo-electric action.

the current goes from the zinc, through the fluid, to the platinum, the pla
tinum being the positive electrode.

  The question now arose, could not the effect which might be
due to muscular contraction coincide with that which arose from
the action of the cutaneous secretions     From the results ob
 tained by Du Bois-Reymond*, it would appear that the direc
 tion of the current due to muscular contraction is inverse, i. e.
from the hand to the shoulder.
    Several other experiments were undertaken in which different
 solutions were employed to moisten the hands; the effect upon                                            .
the needle was now much greater.      When one hand was moist
ened with a weak alkaline solution and the other with water, upon
contracting the muscles of the arm holding the alkaline electrode,
this became negative to the other; but by proper management,
by not having the solution too strong, we could make this arm
become positive, the current occurring during muscular contrac
tion overcoming the influence of the alkaline solution.  Feeling
the force of the objections that might be raised in reference to
the use of the metallic electrodes, we do not think it necessary
to relate any other experiments made with the use of these                                          in
struments.
   A galvanometert of the following construction was now em
ployed. It consisted of two coils, one placed above the other so
as to produce the full effect upon both needles, with an index to
indicate the amount of deflection.     Each coil was 2 inches in
length and the same in breadth, consisting of 1500 turns; the
thickness of the wire 37 gauge.          The needles were rather less
than 2 inches in    length;  the index,  of ivory, 3 inches in length,
As our   object  was to   ascertain, if  possible,   the easistence of the
force rather than the amount, a further description of             delicacy               its

192                 Mr. H. F. Baxter               on the Force evolved
glasses being half-filled with a weak solution of common salt,
covering the electrodes to the extent of an inch, two and some
times three fingers of each hand were held perpendicularly in
the vessels, the middle finger resting upon the bottom of the
glass vessel. When first introduced, a slight tremulous motion
of the needle was observed; upon taking the fingers out of one
vessel and reintroducing them, and repeating this act, a slight
effect appeared, at first definite, but this soon subsided. Similar
effects were observed when the fingers of the other hand were
used in a similar manner.      The fingers last introduced were not
always positive or negative to the others.      Keeping the fingers
in, then moving one of the fingers so as to make the fluid rise
and fall upon the surface of the electrode in one vessel, produced
but little motion of the needle.   After the fingers had been in
for some time, and the needle had become quite stationary, upon
contracting the muscles of one arm an effect occurred upon the
needle indicating the contracted arm to be positive to the other 3°;
by contracting the muscles of each arm alternately, the effect
amounted to 5°.    The result was definite, and the motion of the
needle steady.
  Du Bois-Reymond* considers that there are five circumstances
as influential in producing a current; viz. 1, température in
égale; 2, durée inégale de l’humectation avec le liquide con
ducteur; 3, tension inégale de la peau; 4, lésion de l’une des
places de la peau; 5, transpiration inégale. We could not refer
the effects we obtained to either of these circumstances;–to the
tension of the skin, for instance.
   Three solutions were now prepared; the first consisting of a
concentrated solution of common salt; the second of sulphuric
acid, one part of strong acid to six parts of water; and the third
of one part of liq. potassae (Pharm. Lond.) to four parts of
Water.
  It was found necessary that the following precautions should
                            to to.
be strictly attended    The solutions should      prepared and             be
well mixed   previous their use, and the electrodes covered                               to
the same extent.    The hands and fingers should         thoroughly             be
clean;   toattain this object they were first washed with the ordi
nary curd      or
              Windsor soap, and afterwards well rinsed      common                   in
water and wiped comparatively dry with           clean towel.   Thea
same towels should not         employed when using the different

                    during Muscular Contraction.                   193
   We need hardly state that the surfaces of the electrodes should
be clean and the contacts perfect.
    With the solution of common salt.      Upon the first introduction
of the fingers,  a slight tremulous motion of the needle occurred.
Withdrawing the right-hand fingers and reintroducing them
immediately afterwards, and repeating this act a few times, a
slight positive effect was produced upon the introduction of the
fingers. Withdrawing the left-hand fingers in the same manner,
a slight negative effect was at first obtained, but after a short
time the effect became indefinite, and ultimately slightly positive.
Keeping the fingers in and contracting the muscles of the arm,
the fingers of the contracted arm were positive 4° to 5°, and
made to increase.                                    -
   The solution in one vessel was now diluted to one-half. Upon
the first introduction of the fingers, the strong solution was
positive 5°. Keeping the fingers in and waiting until the needle
had become motionless, the contracted arm was positive to the
other; if the arm connected with the strong solution was con
tracted, the effect was greater than when the other was con
tracted, the current in the former case rising to 5°, in the latter
to 2° or 3°.
    With the acid solution.     Upon the first introduction of the
fingers, the needle would sometimes go 30° or 40°, but generally
speaking it would oscillate first to one side and then to the other.
Withdrawing the fingers of one hand and then reintroducing
them, this hand was positive to the other. Keeping the fingers
quiescent, and contracting the muscles of the arm, the corre
sponding fingers were positive 4°.
   The solution in one vessel was diluted to half the strength of
the former; the strong solution was positive to the other upon
the introduction of the fingers.         If the difference between the
two solutions was not too    great   (the exact strength being diffi
cult to state), we might determine a slight current to pass in a
constant direction, and then make the current arising during
muscular contraction overcome this constant current. Strong
solutions were found best for this purpose, from their forming,
perhaps, a better conducting liquid than the weaker solutions.
    With the alkaline solution.      Upon the first introduction of
the  fingers  no definite result, the needle tremulous.     Withdraw
ing the fingers and reintroducing them, the effects varied, but,
generally speaking, the reintroduction of the fingers produced a
negative result. The effect due from muscular contraction was
definite from 2° to 4°, the fingers of the contracted arm being
positive.
   The solution in one vessel was diluted to half the strength of
the other. Upon the introduction of the fingers, the diluted

 19 |                Mr. H. F. Baxter on the Force                            evolved
solution was positive to the stronger. We were enabled in this
instance, as with the acid solution, to obtain a solution of such
strength as to give a constant current in a certain direction, and
then make the current due from muscular contraction overpower
this current.   As we consider this fact of some importance, it
will be  necessary  to state the mode of ascertaining this constant
current. If we    find,  either upon the introduction of the fingers
of both hands at the same time, or upon the introduction of the
fingers of one hand, that a current existed in one direction to
the amount of about 2°, the current occurring during muscular
contraction, if it coincided with this constant current, would
cause the needle to advance to 4° or 5° or more ; but if it has
to overcome this constant current, the needle would only move
9° or 3°.  We need scarcely add, that the needle of the galva
mometer should continue to indicate this current whilst the
fingers  remain in the solution, which may be indicated by the
needle  receding to             its
                        normal position upon the withdrawal                                               of
the fingers.     great

actions.
    We have not yet alluded to the difference which appears to
exist between the results obtained by Du Bois-Reymond and
ourselves, viz. the direction of the current.         Du Bois-Reymond’s
experiments indicate that the current is inverse, i. e. from the
hand to the shoulder during muscular contraction; our results,
on the other hand, point out that the current is direct, i. e. from
the shoulder to the hand. We do not think that our results
differ much from those of Du Bois-Reymond; but as the discus
sion of this question will involve certain theoretical views, what
ever observations we shall have to make will be deferred to our
concluding remarks”.
     With the assistance of three friends an attempt was made to
increase the effect upon the needle by forming a pile, as it were;
we could obtain the effect, but there was no decided increase.
     Several experiments were undertaken with the rheoscopic frogf
in lieu of the galvanometer; the results were not so satisfactory
as could be desired, to justify their being recorded in the pre
 sent paper.
     The posterior limbs of a frog, separated at the pelvis, but
    * Since this paper was presented to the Royal Society, we have had the
opportunity of attending the interesting lectures of Du Bois-Reymond at the
Royal Institution. Du Bois-Reymond considers, as far as we could under
stand, that when the whole of the hands are immersed in the solution, and
the muscles of the arm are made to contract, then the current is due to
the swollen state of the skin, and perhaps to other circumstances;       but
should we be justified in concluding, that when the fingers alone are in the
vessel, then the effect is due to their swollen state?      If Du Bois-Rey
mond maintains that the current due to muscular contraction is inverse,
i.  e. from the hand to the shoulder, we can only add that we have never
been able to obtain that constant effect. We cannot deny that it frequently
happens, upon the first repetition of the experiment, that the current may
appear in favour of this opinion. Despretz has remarked, that the current
may appear first in one direction and then in another. We cannot insist
too strongly upon the necessity of having the hands perfectly clean, and we
are convinced that the failures and contradictory results which arise are
 due more to the want of attention on this point than to anything else. The
 direction of the current is a fact of the utmost importance; and as we shall
refer to this subject again in the concluding remarks, and as no reasons
 have occurred to lead us to alter our views, we prefer leaving the paper in
 its original state. (June 19.)
    f  The term rheoscopic has been recommended in the Report of the
 Committee of the Academy of Paris, in preference to that of galvanoscopic.
 We have employed both terms. When it is used for the detection of the
current, the former term is most applicable; but the frog may be a test of
a force in which the current force, in accordance with our present motions
 of force, cannot be shown to exist. If the dynamic condition and the cur
 rent condition of force be considered as equivalent terms, then rheoscopic
would be unobjectionable.

 connected by means   of the lumbar nerves and a portion of the
vertebral  column, were each placed in separate vessels containing
the solution of common salt; the muscles of one limb were then
made to contract, and an immediate effect upon the needle was
observed, the contracted limb being positive to the other from
3° to 4°. To prevent the fluid from being scattered upon the
electrode, a piece of glass was attached to the part as a weight
to avoid too great motion of the limb.      In some instances both
feet were removed: the effect upon the needle was still the same.
   Similar results were obtained with the acid solution, but with
the alkaline solution the effects varied, especially so if the solu
tion were strong. The alkali acted apparently upon the mucous
secretion of the skin.
   Great care was required to have the cutaneous surfaces clean
previous to the introduction of the limbs into the solutions, so
that no current could arise therefrom.

order to obtain the necessary contractions 2   Repeating the expe
riments of Matteucciº, we found that the contraction might be
obtained without placing the nerve in contact with the muscle.
At the same time we must add, that the effect upon the galva

animal secretions and the solutions                      on   the one hand, and between
the solutions and the platinum electrodes     the other; but that     on

we have such control over our experiments as to afford us faci
lities favourable for eliminating sources of error, how easily may
we conceive that they would apply with far greater force to
physiological researches devoid of such facilities. The strong
prejudices which exist in reference to electro-physiological              in
quiries cannot therefore be a matter of much surprise, but must
create a great difficulty to any individual who shall attempt the
elucidation of any electro-physiological problem experimentally;
for not only has he to satisfy, from the mixed character of the
 inquiry, the extreme views of the physicist on the one hand, and
 those of the physiologist on the other, but they also afford the
indolent inquirer a ready means of apparent refutation, and a
 powerful weapon to the controversialist. That these opinions are
 not ill-founded we might easily prove”.           Feeling the importance
 of basing the conclusions in these inquiries upon strictly experi
 mental evidence, in discussing the different views that may be
 entertained in regard to the evidence upon which our experi
 ments justify us in concluding that some force is evolved during
 muscular contraction, we shall confine our observations to the
 experimental results obtained by Matteucci and Du Bois-Rey
 mond, and endeavour to avoid everything of a purely controver
 sial character.
     Matteuccit has proved and shown by means of the galvano
 scopic frog, that during muscular contraction the muscles of the
 galvanoscopic frog may be excited to contract, and that for this
 purpose it is not necessary that the nerve should be brought into
 contact with different portions of the muscular fibre. In repeat
 ing these experiments, we have been able to confirm the results
 obtained by Matteucci.
     Matteuccii, in his endeavours to ascertain whether the mus
 cular current was increased during muscular contraction by form
 ing piles with muscular elements, failed to obtain any decisive
  result. Du Bois-Reymond, by means of his galvanometer, has
  satisfactorily shown that when the electrodes are so arranged
  with a muscular element that the current (muscular) passes
  through the instrument, that then, upon the contraction of the
  muscle, the needle of the instrument recedes, and this he calls
  “the negative variation” of the muscular current. This fact,
  established by Du Bois-Reymond, and also the results obtained
     * Strange to say, it has been urged that the time has not yet arrived for
  the prosecution of these experiments.   This is the only tangible objection
  that the author has yet had an opportunity of refuting. That objections
  may be started he is perfectly convinced; but as the inquiry professes to be
  eaperimental, the objections must be supported by experimental evidence
  before he can notice them.

198       On the Force    evolved during Muscular Contraction.
by Matteucci, have been confirmed by some of our own experi
ments.    But we cannot help thinking with Matteucciº, that the
falling or the receding of the needle in Du Bois-Reymond's
experiment may be attributed in a great measure to the variation
in the contacts between the surfaces of the muscle and the elec
trodes during the act of contraction. We are not aware that
the existence of the muscular current is disputed by anyone; it
has been attributed to nutritive actions by Matteuccit, and some
experiments   of our own<U+017F> tended to confirm the views of Mat
teucci.   We now have two distinct questions before us:—1st, Is
there, or is there not, any force evolved during muscular con
traction ? 2ndly, Is the muscular current affected during muscular
contraction ? and this brings us to speak of the results we have
obtained in the present paper.
   Du Bois-Reymond’s results lead him to consider that in the
frog the current is direct, and in man inverse, as shown by the
galvanometer.      Our experiments lead us to believe that the
current is direct in both instances.     Upon carefully looking over
Du Bois   Reymond's    S last   paper, it appears to us that he fre
quently obtains the direct current; but laying so much stress,
as he does, upon the necessity of a current (muscular) circulating
through the instrument prior to contraction before he can con
clude that the resulting action upon the needle is what he calls
“the negative oscillation” of the muscular current, that his object
was to ascertain whether the muscular current in the human
subject was not affected during muscular contraction, as in the
frog. We may be mistaken in our opinion.              As we have not
been able to obtain this inverse   current,  and if Du Bois-Reymond
has been endeavouring to obtain this inverse current to prove
“ the negative variation” of the muscular current in the human
subject, then the object that each of us has had in view differs:
ours has been to ascertain whether any force is evolved during
muscular contraction; Du Bois-Reymond's, whether the mus
cular current is affected during muscular contraction.           The
importance of Du Bois-Reymond's researches we do not deny;
but it appears to us to be of extreme importance that the two
questions should be kept perfectly distinct, although perhaps -
intimately connected with each other.
   The results of our inquiries lead us to believe, that during
muscular contraction a force is evolved, as in the fish, but that
it is only during extraordinary muscular exertion that it can
become manifest to the galvanometer.           We are perfectly aware

200     Prof.   J.   C. Poggendorff on the Induction Apparatus
of the above assertion, the more so as former observations on the
sparks of frictional electricity have led either to no results at all,
or only to uncertain ones.
   With the induction sparks obtained without trouble from a
continually interrupted current, such a proof is without the least
difficulty. It is even furnished in a very perceptible manner by
a good mercurial thermometer.   With this instrument of course
no measurements can be made, although comparative results can
be obtained by securing a continuous development of sparks, by
means of as uniform a motion and condition of the hammer as
can be possibly attained, as well as by paying attention to other
precautions which will be easily recognized as necessary.
   The following are some of the experimental results which were
obtained:—
   1. When a delicate thermometer is placed in or close to the
stream of sparks of the induction apparatus, a considerable rise
immediately takes place, contrasting greatly with the small de
velopment of heat in the wire itself.  This is the more remark
able, because, according to Joule's law, the heat generated in a
given time throughout the whole circuit of the induction current
is smaller when the circuit is broken by air than when it is con
tinuous.
    2. All other things being equal, this elevation of temperature
is different according to the nature of the metals or bodies from
which the sparks issue.
    In this respect, however, platinum, copper, iron, and silver
differ little from one another, although amongst them silver ap
peared to act strongest, and platinum weakestº.        But a great
difference exists between these metals and those which are but
little coherent, and are easily fused or vaporized.                      On an average,
their action is double that of the former.
   The following are the elevations of temperature observed during
the space of one minute in a series of experiments with different
metallic points. The cylindrical reservoir of the thermometer
was 11 millims. long and 3.5 millims, in diameter;         axis was            its

nature of the points which may be employed.        The method con
sists in the division of the current between two pairs of points
of different metals. The experiments (like the similar ones of
Faraday's with different gases) involve some difficulties, and
require to be carefully interpreted; because if by accident the
stream of sparks should be better conducted through one pair of
points than through the other, the former may, by the air be
coming warm, and by the volatilization of metallic particles,
obtain an excess over the latter which is not matural to it.        In
general, when the distances between points are equal, sparks
which are simultaneously obtained from both pairs of points
differ in colour and brilliancy according to the nature of the
metals, but apparently they do not differ in the spark-distance.
Very often the one or the other stream of sparks ceased for a
while without any very apparent cause; on the other hand, how
ever, when zinc, or still better tin, was compared with platinum,
it was always found that at small distances (1 or 2 millims.)
sparks only passed between the former metals, at greater distances
 (3 or 5 millims.) only between the latter metal.     Without doubt
at small distances the volatilized zinc or tin particles conduct so
well that they usurp the whole current.
   8. The luminous discharges in partial vacuum present similar
phaenomena to sparks in air.         The increase of temperature
thereby is very considerable, although not so great as with
sparks.    Although the strength of the current increases with
increasing rarefaction, the elevation of temperature decreases,
owing to the decreased resistance.
    9. In partial vacuum, too, the inequality in the temperature
of the poles is maintained, although it does not appear to be so

great as in free air.                                             -
   In one experiment the air was rarefied to about one inch of
mercury pressure, at which time, although the electric light was
continuous, it still produced a jingling noise, like that at the com
mencement of the crackling of the sparks in free air. Two ther
mometers stood at the distance of about a line from the brass knobs
between which the discharge took place, and which were 14 inch
asunder.    During one minute the thermometer at the negative
pole rose 15° or 15°-5 C., the one at the positive pole 12° or
13° C.
   All the above results were obtained by employing the thicker
and shorter of the described induction coils, a battery of two of
Grove's elements, and the condenser.

   As a general result of this comparison, it was quite evident
 that the action of the sparks of the induction coil was in cases                                          all
 quite   as   strong when                       vacuum without the

 condenser,      as     when
                       worked     air with

cases, indeed,  was  considerably
                        it         stronger.
   This was particularly the case with the thicker and shorter
induction wire, when the wires       the primary coil were   ofthe                                              at

                                 influence upon the spark-distance
of athe induction coil,   least      increasing influence; the sparks
                                        at              no
were merely stronger sometimes.          On the contrary, when the
primary wires were connected one after the other,                  form                          so   as   to

induction current upon the extra current.
    It may also be mentioned, that when the hammer vibrates in
a  vacuum,   and when the parts which beat against one another
are of platinum, the latter are very much attacked.         The platinum
part of the tongue, the brass part above            the screw     the pin,  it,                        of

evidently consists       finely pulverized platinum, which, when the

208        M.   J.   M. Gaugain      on an Electrical Apparatus
ourselves to the description of an apparatus wherewith M. Gau
gain has obtained results much more satisfactory than with any
other, and which is founded upon an observed fact which he
believes to be new.
   Let an ordinary electric  egg+ be taken, and let the upper knob
be coated with an   insulating  substance, the stem which supports
the knob being similarly coated, leaving naked only an exces
sively small portion of the surface of the knob : let the egg thus
prepared be placed in the circuit of a Ruhmkorff’s coil: intro
ducing a galvanometer also into the same circuit, the following
facts may be observed:—When the induced currents which cor
respond to the interruption of the inducing current (the only
ones which traverse the vacuum of the egg) pass from the covered
to the naked knob, the intensity of the current indicated by the
galvanometer goes on increasing as the air within the egg is
more and more rarefied; but this is not the case when the
induced currents pass through the egg from the naked to the
covered knob.   In this case the intensity of the current goes on,
at first advancing as the pressure is diminished; but when this
pressure descends below a certain limit, the deviation of the gal
vanometer diminishes; for a certain pressure it becomes zero,
and finally changes the sign when the vacuum is as perfect as
can be obtained with a good air-pump.           M. Gaugain limited
himself to the establishment of this fact without seeking an                     in
terpretation; this sufficed for the object he had in view, namely, to
show that the currents traversed the egg freely when they passed
from the covered knob to the naked one, and could not pass in
the opposite direction, when the vacuum was suitably made.
From this it follows that the electric egg, disposed as indicated,
can act, in relation to certain currents, the part               of   a valve   with
respect to liquids.
  M. Gaugain    believes that this electric valve may be useful in
a certain number of researches, and he has already applied it to
the solution of a question raised by M. du Moncel in one of the
last communications made by the latter to the Academy of
Sciences.   When a condenser is interposed in the induced cir
cuit of the apparatus of Ruhmkorff, the motion of the electricity
continues, as is proved by the physiological and luminous effects
produced on the circuit: but two different hypotheses may be
made as to the nature of this movement.       It might be supposed
that the electricity propagates itself across the insulating film of
the condenser in the same manner as it passes through a con
ducting body, and in this case          its
                                     direction would      constantly
                                                                  be
the same;  it might,       on
                          the contrary,         be
                                            supposed that the two
                *   A   glass receiver shaped like   an   egg.

                            which acts the part                of a       Valve.                            209
electricities, developed by the induction apparatus, accumulate on
the two surfaces of the condenser during the time the electro
motive force is active, and that they recombine as soon as this
force ceases to act.       According to this latter hypothesis, the
current    ought  to  pass  in opposite directions alternately; the
rigorous discussion of the facts M. Gaugain believes sufficient
to decide which of those hypotheses is the true one; but the
question may be resolved in a decisive manner by means of the
electric valve.
   To render our language definite,                            let
                                              suppose the condenser  us

                               have shown that equal weights of
           are    obtained, by submitting to the action of the
same current different electrolytes in which copper forms the
positive element, or what is called the cation.     proposed also                       I
to study the different electrolytes of which hydrogen is the elec
tro-positive radical, and had even commenced some experiments;
but   I have given up this investigation, which has become useless
since M. Despretz published his researches upon this subject,
and announced his intention of pursuing them.              shall here                            I
limit  myself  to the relation of the  following  observation upon
the decomposition of water.
   When distilled water is submitted to the action of a somewhat
powerful battery (sixty small Grove’s elements), the gaseous
bubbles which are disengaged at one of the electrodes are attracted
by the other electrode, probably in consequence of the great dif
ference of tension of the electricity at the surface of the two
poles.    The molecules of gas, and perhaps of water, electrized
by their contact with one of the poles, discharge themselves upon
the other.
   It is possible that, by this mechanical transfer, if may call                                     I
it   so,
       there may            be

electricity, which will necessarily
trodes are           to
                 each other.   But
                                                           I be
                                        greater the nearer the elec

            this may become considerable.
   The same thing does not take place       acidulated water, the         in
conductibility    which   of much greater, because the difference

   is with this view that have undertaken the following expe

a satisfactory result.
     I.
      Comparison of the quantities of copper and hydrogen sepa
rated by the same current.—The comparison of the quantities of
copper and hydrogen separated by electrolysis has been effected
by means of a somewhat complicated apparatus, which it would
be difficult to describe completely without the aid of a figure.                                                I
shall therefore confine myself to indicating briefly the mode in
which      I
          have operated.
   An electrical current traversed simultaneously a solution of
sulphate of copper, and some acidulated water.          The copper
deposited on a platinum wire was weighed directly.         The hy
drogen was determined by combustion, as in an organic analysis.

     It     appears      that the absolute                 differences        do not exceed the
limits of exactitude to be expected.      The greatest difference
is   ºr of the total quantity of water absorbed, and the average
relative difference only extends to gº. Faraday’s law is there
fore verified by these experiments.

       Comparison of the quantities of silver and copper separated
by the same current.—The comparison of the weights of copper
and silver separated by the action of the pile is much easier.
The electrolytes which                   I
                          have employed are pure sulphate of
copper and nitrate of silver.
   The electrolysis of the sulphate of copper was effected as in
the preceding experiments, and that of the nitrate of silver nearly
in the same manner.     A neutral solution of nitrate of silver was
placed in a tube closed at one end. In this a platinum wire was
immersed as a negative electrode, and a silver wire as the posi
tive one. The silver deposited was washed with distilled water,
then left to dry in the open air, and weighed. My first experi
ments did not present complete exactness, from certain causes
which were afterwards avoided.   1350 was taken as the equiva
lent of silver. The following Table contains the results of the
final experiments:—

   The absolute differences may be entirely referred to possible
errors in the weighing.   We may observe that the values of the
chemical  equivalents themselves are not determined with greater
accuracy, for if we only admit 395.1 as the equivalent of cop
per instead of 395-6, the law is mathematically verified by the
average of these experiments.
   Conclusion.—The weights of copper, hydrogen and silver,
separated by the same electrical current, are in proportion to the
chemical equivalents of these bodies, and Faraday’s law is veri
fied within the limits of errors of observation.

    HIS     is a work which will be welcome to every mathematical

most important improvements which modern mathematicians have

 The author has furnished an admirable text-book to those who are
 already,    to some extent, acquainted with the calculus.             He has stu
 diously avoided “all prolixity                detail   of alike unnecessary and

of course, no one can take objection; and the less so, as in this in
stance they have been faithfully executed. The researches of other
mathematicians on the subject have been carefully collected, and
not unfrequently considerably improved; besides which the author
has added much of his own, and treated the subject throughout with
great ability and elegance. Nevertheless it is worthy of considera
tion, whether, by expanding the second chapter on ‘Elementary Prin
ciples,’ and by entering more fully into those details of which we have
before spoken, the sphere of the book's usefulness could not be con
siderably increased.
The Elements of Plane Practical Geometry, with Illustrative Applica
    tions.   By E. W. DALLAs, F.R.S.E.          London: John W. Parker
    and Son, West Strand. 1855.
    The author's object in writing this work was “not so much to .
educate mathematicians as to provide the ordinary workman with an
intelligent reason for many of those problems of geometry that occur
in the operations in which he is daily employed, and a knowledge of
the principles of which must tend to correctness and excellence of
 execution.”     It is a difficult task to avoid embarrassing such a class
of readers with too much theory, and at the same time to preserve
 the necessary mathematical precision and sequence. This task the
 author has accomplished with praiseworthy skill; for although a
 mathematician would certainly detect imperfections, they are of such
 a nature as not to diminish the value of the book to those for whose
 perusal it was written.
    The number of theorems in the first part is as small as the ‘work
 man’ can desire, and they are demonstrated concisely and clearly.
 The practical problems in the second part are, for the most part,
 well chosen and skilfully solved. Amongst them the mathematical
 student will recognize many deducibles’ whose solutions have cost
 him much labour, and he will certainly find it instructive to compare
 his own solutions with those here given.         He must not forget, how
 ever, that in his case the principal value of these problems is to be
 found in solving them, rather than in knowing their solutions.
     The “observations and applications' appended to many of these
 problems are not so skilfully chosen as we could desire; they are
 intended to “afford some indication to the reader of the very general
 application of geometry,” but they do so very inadequately, and it
 it is quite possible that their perusal may be a source of some dis
 appointment to the ardent student.         Many of them he will certainly
 find interesting, others superfluous, because he would undoubtedly
 have made them for himself; others, again, he may find trivial, and
 a few, such as the remark about diverging rays in the sky (p. 65),
 are of doubtful accuracy.        Nevertheless the work will be a welcome
 one to those for whom it was intended; and the fact that it was
 undertaken at the suggestion of the Honourable the Board of Trus
 tees for the Encouragement of Manufactures, &c. in Scotland, is a
 good guarantee that such a work was needed.

   Notwithstanding the typographical beauty of this new edition,
there are misprints and errors in the examples which the editor will
probably correct in a future edition.” The additional examples form,
indeed, the chief recommendation of this new edition over the original;
but the greatest care ought to be bestowed to ensure the perfect accu
racy of these examples, which otherwise will only serve to confuse
and perplex the student, especially if he has no tutor. The few
additions to the original text of ‘Pratt’ are derived chiefly from MSS.
which have long been familiar to the Cambridge student.                           * **

We extract two simple “questions,’ one from his “Mechanics,’ and .
the other from his “Hydrostatics,” as good specimens of a class of
questions which we should be glad to meet with more frequently in
examinations and books:–                    -             -
   “A shopkeeper has a false balance, and thinks to make his cus
tomers' consequent losses and gains balance each other by weighing
the goods which he sells alternately in the one scale and in the other;
does he succeed?”         (Mechanics, p. 107.)
   “Is it advantageous to a buyer of diamonds that the weighing of
them should be made when the barometer is high or when it is low,
supposing their specific gravity to be less than that of the substance
used as the weight?”           (Hydrostatics, p. 39.)

  mariner, for, together with other advantages, the tedious operation
  of  a “day's work’ will be divested of half the usual trouble.
     When giving a course to the “quarter-master,” or “man at the
  wheel,” no mistake, so liable to be the case at present, can well
  occur; it will merely be necessary to direct him to steer, for instance,
 “north five points east,” or more briefly, “north five east,” “south
  six west,” &c. &c.
     I recollect an instance of a vessel steering N.W. by N. ; N.,
 instead of W. by N. # N. during thick weather in the Bristol Channel,
 thus running into danger from the similarity of sound between the
 courses alluded to.
     The practical application of the decimal card would not materially
 affect the charts previously published, which could have printed
 compasses containing thirty-six points pasted over the others. Such
 might be sold by any chart-seller.
     “Observations on the Human Voice.” By Manuel Garcia, Esq.
    The pages which follow are intended to describe some observa
tions made on the interior of the larynx during the act of singing.
The method which I have adopted is very simple. It consists in
placing a little mirror, fixed on a long handle suitably bent, in the
throat of the person experimented on against the soft palate and
uvula.     The party ought to turn himself towards the sun, so that
the luminous rays falling on the little mirror, may be reflected on
the larynx. If the observer experiment on himself, he ought, by
means of a second mirror, to receive the rays of the sun, and direct
them on the mirror, which is placed against the uvula.         We shall
now add our own deductions from the observations which the image
reflected by the mirror has afforded us.
                          Opening   of the Glottis.
    At the moment when the        person   draws a deep breath, the epi
glottis being raised, we are able to see the following series of move
ments:—the arytenoid cartilages become separated by a very free
lateral movement; the superior ligaments are placed against the ven
tricles; the inferior ligaments are also drawn back, though in a less
degree, into the same cavities; and the glottis, large and wide open,
is exhibited so as to show in part the rings of the trachea.          But
unfortunately,    however dexterous we may be in disposing these
organs, and even when we are most successful, at least the third
part of the anterior of the glottis remains concealed by the epi
glottis.
                         Movement of the Glottis.
    As soon as we    prepare  to produce a sound, the arytenoid carti
lages approach each other, and press together by their interior
surfaces, and by the anterior apophyses, without leaving any space,
or intercartilaginous glottis; sometimes even they come in contact
so closely as to cross each other by the tubercles of Santorini. To
this movement of the anterior apophyses, that of the ligaments of

                                     M. Garcia              on the Human Voice.                                         219
 the glottis corresponds, which detach themselves from the ventricles,
 come in contact with different degrees of energy, and show them
 selves at the bottom of the larynx under the form of an ellipse of a
yellowish colour. The superior ligaments, together with the ary
teno-epiglottidean folds, assist to form the tube which surmounts
the glottis; and being the lower and free extremity of that tube,
enframe the ellipse, the surface of which they enlarge or diminish
according as they enter more or less into the ventricles.         These last
scarcely retain a trace of their opening.       By anticipation, we might
say of these cavities, that, as will afterwards appear clearly enough
in these pages, they only afford to the two pair of ligaments a
space in which they may easily range themselves.                 When the
aryteno-epiglottidean <U+017F>olds contract, they lower the epiglottis, and
make the superior orifice of the larynx considerably narrower.
    The meeting of the lips of the glottis, naturally proceeding from
the front towards the back, if this movement is well managed, it
will allow, between the apophyses, of the formation of a triangular
space, or inter-cartilaginous     glottis, but one which, however, is
closed as soon as the sounds are produced.
    After some essays, we perceive that this internal disposition of
the larynx is only visible when the epiglottis remains raised. But
neither           all
              the registers    the voice, nor     the degrees
                                                 of               intensity, all                        of

                              taking this position.      We soon discover
that the brilliant and powerful sounds          the chest-register contract
                                                                        of

                        of                              orifice; and,    the            its                          on
contrary, that veiled notes, and notes        moderate power, open bothof

    This theory, though now generally admitted for reeds, and un
 doubtedly evident in the liquid vein, the toothed-wheel of Savart,
 the syrène of the Baron Cagnard Latour &c., has not to my know
 ledge, been yet applied to the glottis”. If we consider that the
 lips of this aperture, taken separately, can give no kind of sound,
 however we may try to make them speak, we must admit that the
 sounds which they give forth by their mutual action, are only owing
 to the explosions of the air produced by their strokest.         It is not
 necessary in order to obtain the explosion of sound, that the glottis
 should be perfectly closed each time after its opening; it suffices
 that it should oppose an obstacle to the air capable of developing                                                  its
 elasticity.        In

  then diverge in order to form the sides of the ventricles, and then

  perfectly horizontal, which line the outer aspect of the vocal liga

 greater pressure of air necessary to produce the greater intensity,
 would at the same time increase the number of pulsations, and so
 raise the tone ; but to prevent this, the glottis must at the same
 time be lengthened, and vice versd; or, in other words, that the dif

 produce the same number of shocks, but at different degrees of
 intensity.

    Various simultaneous causes modify the qualities of the voice:—
 1, according as the glottis partially or entirely closes the passage
between the explosions, it produces veiled or brilliant sounds; 2, the
tube which surmounts and surrounds it also greatly affects the
quality of the voice; by       contractionsits  gives brilliancy   it  and                             to   it

secondary current was to be aroused. tº The ends of the latter were
connected by wires with a third spiral placed at a distance, so that
when the secondary current was excited it passes through the third

varnished glass, was a fourth spiral, whose two ends were connected
with the universal discharger, between the knobs of which a quantity
of gun-cotton was placed.” When the battery was discharged
through the first spiral, a secondary current was aroused, in the
second spiral, which completed                             its

3.This enfeeblement increases up to a certain limit as the resistance is
 increased, from which forwards it diminishes until it becomes insen
  sible. This would appear to prove, that to react upon the primary
  the secondary requires to be retarded; and that the greater the
  amount of the retardation, up to a certain limit, the greater is the
  enfeeblement.     But by increasing the resistance we diminish the
  strength of the secondary, and when a certain limit is attained, this
: diminution   is first compensated for by the influence of retardation,
ºfrom which point forwards with every increase of the resistance, the
  enfeeblement of the primary is diminished.          A primary current

    If we calculate from these numbers the density of the porous
tabasheer, by adding the weight of the absorbed water (by which
the volume of the pores is determined) to the loss of weight under
gone by the body in water (which gives the volume of the solid
matter), and then divide the sum by the weight of the dry body,
so as to obtain the density of the porous body in the natural state,
we get 0,727, 0.6227, 0.6520.
   But the tabasheers are heavier than water; they sink in it imme
diately, and have consequently a greater specific gravity than that
thus calculated.     The author shows that Brewster observed this con
tradiction, but without troubling himself about the cause, determined
the space occupied by the silica and the pores from this incorrect
specific gravity, so that the space occupied by the pores in propor
tion to that filled by the silica was, according to him, as 2.307 : 1 ;
whilst, from the author's experiments upon the natural density of
tabasheer, it appears that this proportion is 0-0689 : 1, which agrees
with the behaviour of the body in water.
   Tabasheer which has been completely permeated by water and
become transparent, becomes perfectly opake in the air. This be
haviour, which Brewster believed to occur only with this body, in
duced him to set up a peculiar theory upon the small refractive
power of this substance, which he found to be less than that of any
other known body.         But without taking into consideration that the
number 976:10, which Brewster adopted for the refractive power of
tabasheer, is too small, as the author calculates it at 1500-5, we must
also take into account the opacity which is peculiar to the molecular
state of this substance.
   Tabasheer is evidently a mass produced from a jelly by desicca

               NOTE ON THE INFLAMMABILITY                                          OF HYDROGEN.
                -         BY M. BAUDRIMONT.
   It is said by  Berzelius and others, that hydrogen prepared in the
dry way does not possess the property of inflaming by contact with
spongy platinum; this phaenomenon,         first indicated by Faraday,
having been attributed by Berzelius to an allotropic condition of the
hydrogen, we have thought it worth while to repeat the experiment.
For this purpose vapour of water was decomposed by red-hot iron,
and the hydrogen thus produced (which is that said to be prepared
in the dry way) was directed upon spongy platinum, which, as we had
ascertained, possessed the power of igniting the ordinary gas. We
then found that it also inflamed the gas obtained from the vapour of
water.    On collecting some of this same gas in a bottle with a ground
glass stopper, and afterwards driving it out by means of a current of
water, so as to direct it upon a small mass of spongy platinum, the
hydrogen was again ignited.                                       If,
                                      therefore, this gas may acquire
various allotropic conditions, these cannot       proved by the fact ad            be
vanced         by
             Faraday, and which we have not been able         realise.—                                     to

             the discovery of aluminium by Wöhler, Deville has re
      cently taught us the means of procuring this metal in large

drochloric acid (in platina vessels); the solution evaporated to
dryness with sulphuric acid and heated until the excess of acid
was dissipated, gave a residue which dissolved completely in
water with the aid of a little hydrochloric acid.   From the solu
tion ammonia precipitated a considerable quantity of alumina.
The solution filtered from the precipitate furnished, on evapora
 .
tion, a residue of sulphate of soda free from potash.    Moreover,
      powder gave the well-known reactions of fluorine in a marked
  egree.
    This powder is kryolite of great purity; therefore, the coarse
powder I first obtained was not the form in which it is originally
introduced.     It is now to be obtained in Berlin in great masses;
for the  preparation   of aluminium, however, it must be reduced
to a very fine powder.
    In my experiments on the preparation of this metal, which
were performed in company with M. Weber and with his most
zealous assistance,   I made use of small iron crucibles of 1; inch
in height, and 1; inch upper diameter, which I had cast here.
In these I placed the finely-powdered kryolite between thin layers
of sodium, pressed it down tight, covered it with a good layer
of chloride of potassium, and closed the crucible with a well
fitting porcelain cover.
    I found chloride of potassium the most advantageous flux to
employ; it has the lightest specific gravity of any which could
be used, an important point when the slight density of alumi
nium is taken into consideration; it also increases the fusibility
of the fluoride of sodium.     I usually employed equal weights of
kryolite and chloride of potassium, and for five parts of kryolite
I  employed two parts of sodium; the most fitting quantity for
the crucible was found to be 10 grms. of powdered kryolite.
The whole was raised to a strong red heat, by means of a blow
pipe supplied with a mixture of atmospheric air and coal-gas,
through tubes, on the principle of Daniel's tube for the oxy
hydrogen blowpipe.
    It was found most advantageous to maintain the heat for
about half an hour and not longer, the crucible being kept closely
covered the whole time; the contents are them found to be well
 fused.   When quite cold, the melted mass is removed from the
 crucible by means of a spatula; this is facilitated by striking the
outside with a hammer. The crucible may be employed several
times; at last it is broken by the blows from the hammer.
    The melted mass is treated with water, when at times only, a
very minute evolution of hydrogen gas is observed, which has
 the same unpleasant odour as the gas evolved during the solution
 of cast iron in muriatic acid. The carbon contained in this gas
is derived from the very slight trace of naphtha adhering to the

238         Prof. Rose on a   new and advantageous   Method   of
   I repeatedly   employed   chloride of sodium (common salt de
crepitated) as a flux  in the absence of chloride of potassium with
out remarking any important difference in the amount of metal
produced, although a higher temperature is required in that case.
   The operation may also be conducted in unglazed crucibles of
difficultly fusible stone-ware of the above dimensions, although
they do not resist the action of fluoride of sodium at very
high temperatures so well, but fuse in one or more places. The
iron crucibles fuse, however, when exposed to a very high tem
perature in a charcoal fire.
   The produce in metal was found to vary much, even when
operating exactly in the manner recommended, and with the
same quantities of the materials.     I never succeeded in reducing
the whole amount of metal contained in the kryolite; it con
tains only 13 per cent. of aluminium; by operating on 10 grms.
of the mineral, the quantity I always employed in the small
iron crucibles, the most successful result was 0.8 grm. But 0.6
grim., or even 0.4 grim. may be considered favourable.         Many
       I
times obtained only 0.3 grim., or even less.
    These very different results depend on various causes, more
particularly, however, upon the degree of heat obtained.         The
greater the heat, the greater the amount of larger globules, and
the less amount of minutely divided aluminium to oxidise during
the cooling of the crucible.         I
                                    succeeded once or twice in re
ducing nearly the whole of the metal obtained to one single
button, weighing 0.5 grim, at a very high temperature in a stone
ware crucible.
  I   could not always attain the same heat with the blowpipe,
as it depended in some degree upon the pressure in the gaso
meter at the gas-works, which varies at different periods of the
day.    The following experiment will show how great the loss of
aluminium may be owing to the oxidation of the metal during
the slow cooling of the crucible and contents.
   In a large iron crucible were placed 35 grms. of kryolite in
alternate layers with 14 grims. of sodium, and the whole covered
with a thick stratum of chloride of potassium.          The crucible
closed with a porcelain cover, was placed in a larger earthen one
also covered, and the whole exposed to a good heat in a draft
furnace for one hour, and cooled as slowly as possible. The
produce in this case was remarkably small, for 0.135 grim. of
aluminium was      all
                    that could       be
                                    obtained    inglobules.
   The difference   inthe amount reduced      depends   also  insome
degree     on
           the more      or
                        less successful stratification of the sodium
with the powdered kryolite,          as

                                               the latter sometimes
escapes decomposition.      The greater the amount          ofsodium
employed, the less likely       isthis    to    the case; however,

     Our object was not to examine            a few isolated or only

the alloys existing in commerce, but to produce a great variety
of new alloys, in definite proportions, and to examine their phy
sical and chemical properties, &c,
   The first class of alloys which we shall describe is not only
quite new but highly interesting, as being the first alloys which
have been prepared with iron in definite proportions.      It is cer
tainly remarkable, considering the low price of iron, that no
efforts have been made to alloy this useful and cheap metal with
those of a more expensive nature, such as alloys of iron and tin,
or iron and copper, &c., which, if effected, would have given to
commerce cheaper alloys than those now in use.
   Our primary object in preparing the following alloys of iron,
was to render this metal less oxidizable by alloying it with a more
electro-positive metal than itself. We were convinced that if we
effected this, it would be the most practical method of obtaining
the long-looked for object of diminishing the injury which that
valuable metal sustains by exposure to the atmosphere; but we
were deceived in our anticipations, for the affinity of iron for
oxygen is such that it is not diminished, except in one case,
when combined with potassium or aluminium.

   The first trial we made consisted in heating to a very high
temperature some bitartrate of potash and iron, mixed with ex
cess of bitartrate of potash; the result was only a melted mass
of carbonate of potash, with a button of cast iron, no doubt
owing to the fact that the iron, being in a state of minute divi
sion, united first with carbon, and then was unable to unite with
potassium.
   We then made a mixture of fine iron filings and bitartrate of
potash in the following proportions:—
                                                                -

some very finely-pulverized charcoal, and submitting the whole

   But in the mass of chloride of calcium and charcoal remaining
in the crucible, there were a great number of globules varying
in size from that of a large pea to that of a pin-head. These
globules were as white as silver, extremely hard; and what ren
dered this alloy particularly interesting, was the property which
it possessed of not rusting when exposed to a moist atmosphere,

                   Alloys of Aluminium and Copper.
   To obtain these alloys, we had recourse to the same chemical
reaction as we employed to prepare those of iron, namely,–
      20 cquivalents of copper         .     .     . .     .   .   . 640

   We mixed these substances             intimately       together,    and after
having submitted them to a high temperature for one hour, we
found at the bottom of the crucible a melted mass covered with
chloride of copper, and in this mass small globules, which on
analysis gave the following results:—
                     Copper       . .      .     .    91-53

   We made another mixture of chloride of aluminium and cop
per in the proportions above stated, but left out the lime; we
also obtained an alloy, which yielded the following results:—

   We also analysed a deposit formed constantly at the bottom
of a metallic bath, composed of melted zinc and tin, and which
is used for galvanizing iron. This deposit was found to be com

   This alloy had not the lamellar appearance of zinc, but a cry
stalline one, and was extremely hard and slightly fusible. We
thought, perhaps, that the bath was saturated with iron, which
had combined with the zinc and had gradually deposited.         We
accordingly took some of the melted alloy of zinc and tin in
various parts of the bath and examined them, but found only
traces of iron.   It is certainly remarkable that the iron does not
remain diffused in the metallic bath, which is constantly kept in
a state of fusion, but combines in definite proportions with zinc,
forming a crystalline compound, and that it deposits at a tem
perature   of at least 800°F.
    This fact induced us to examine the composition of the metallic
bath, which being a very large one, gave us a good opportunity
of ascertaining a very interesting problem, viz. whether when we
employed definite proportions of zinc and tin to compose             and                              it,
melted them together, the mass                  of
                                     the bath would have uniform                             a
composition,      would vary according
                   or                          the depth. The bath

   Therefore these alloys are much less attacked than the metals
which compose them; and it is certainly interesting to find that
the alloy No. 3, which contains nearly 50 per cent. of zinc, is
attacked so slightly by the hydrochloric acid.      This inertness
of an acid, having a most powerful action on one or more of the
metals composing an alloy, is most curious; and what increases

   The results contained in the last table illustrate our views
completely, viz. that alloys having a definite composition offer a
most extraordinary resistance to the action of acids, as we have
alloys the metals of which are most violently attacked by nitric
acid, and still we find but a comparatively small amount of alloy
dissolved by this powerful acid.
   We hope at a future time to publish the result of our labour,
which will not only consist in examining the comparative tena
city, hardness, &c. of certain alloys, as compared with the metals
composing them, but the influence which, say one, two, or three
equivalents of a metal entering into the composition of an alloy,
may have on the physical and chemical properties of the said alloy.

   The differences between the two formulae appear to me to be

   Action of Magnet and Current combined.—In examining this
subject, eight experiments were made with each particular bar;
it will be remembered that fig. 6 gives a general view of the
arrangement.
    1. Four experiments were made in which the magnet was
excited first, and after the suspended bar had taken up         posi                 its
tion     equilibrium,

current through the surrounding helix was observed.
    2. Four experiments were made                    in
                                         which the helia was excited
first, and when the bar within        had taken
                                           it             position    up       its              of

deflection observed.

   Both the current which excited the magnet and that which
passed through the helix were now interrupted, and the polarity
of the magnet was reversed. On sending a current through the
helix in the direction of the arrow, the deflection of the bar was
from the position of the defined line to that of the dotted one, fig.9.

   Interrupting the current through the helix, and permitting
the bar to come to rest under the influence of the magnet
alone, a current was sent through the helix in a direction op
posed to    its   former one: the deflection produced was that shown
in fig. 10.

    A series of experiments was next made, in which the bar was
first acted on by the current passing through the helix, the mag
net being brought to bear upon it afterwards.        On the passage
of the current   through  the helix in the direction shown in fig. 11,
the bar set  its length parallel   to

   For the sake of increasing the force, the helix was removed
from    itslateral position and placed between the two poles,                                         as   in

 264             Prof. Tyndall on the Nature of the Force by which
deportment    exhibited by fig. 11 of the present series was ob
tained.   In a recent memoir on the same subject, M. v. Feilitsch%
states that he has sought this result in vain. Sometimes he
observed the deflection at the moment of closing the circuit, but
conceived that it must be ascribed to the action of induced cur
rents; for immediately afterwards a deflection in the opposite
direction was ooserved, which deflection proved to be the perma

be  more strikingly evident.
   To effect the comparison      the manner here indicated, the
                                                       in
figures have been collected together and arranged upon Plate                                                 III.
The first column represents the deportment      the normal para                   of
magnetic bar under         the conditions all
                                          described;  the second

column, that of the normal diamagnetic bar; the third shows
the deportment of the abnormal paramagnetic bar, and the fourth
that of the abnormal diamagnetic bar.
    A comparison of the first two columns shows us that the de
portment of the normal magnetic bar is perfectly antithetical to
that of the normal diamagnetic one. When, on the application
of the second force, an end of the former is deflected to the right,
the same end of the latter is deflected to the left. When the
position of equilibrium of the magnetic bar, under the joint action
of the two forces, is from N.E. to S.W., then the position of
equilibrium for the diamagnetic bar is invariably from N.W. to
S.E. There is no exception to this antithesis, and               have been                             I

effects.
   Fig. 39 Plate IV. represents the disposition of the apparatus
used in the examination of this question.      AB is a helix of
covered copper wire one-fifteenth of an inch in thickness: the
length of the helix is 5 inches, external diameter 5 inches, and
internal diameter 1.5 inch. Within this helix a bar of bismuth
6% inches long and 0.4 of an inch thick was suspended.       The
suspension was effected by means of a light beam, from two
points of which, sufficiently distant from each other, depended
two silver wires each ending in a loop: into these loops,     the                                           ll',
bar    bismuth was introduced, and the whole was suspended

helix,   was first suspended        receiver, which protected

fibre had exhausted itself: the bar was then         removed,  and the
beam, without permitting the fibre           twist again, was placedto

upon the bismuth bar observed.    M. v. Feilitsch has attempted
a similar experiment to that here described, but without success:
when, however, sufficient power is combined with sufficient deli
cacy, the success is complete, and the most perfect mastery is
obtained over the motions of the bar.
   The helix above described is the one which I have found most
convenient for the experiments; various other helices, however,
were tried with a result equally certain, if less energetic.   The
one first made use of was 4 inches long, 3 inches exterior dia
meter, and three-quarters of an inch interior diameter, with wire
one-fifteenth of an inch in thickness, the bar being suspended
by a fibre which passed through a slit in the helix: sending
through this helix a current from a battery of 10 cells, and ex
citing the cores by a current from 1 cell, the phaenomena of re
pulsion and attraction were exhibited with    desirable precision.        all

                           describe the results obtained     opera                                  by

suspended,     current was sent through the helix,

the magnets can have no permanent effect upon the helix; the
current through the latter, measured by a tangent galvanometer,
is just as strong when the cores are excited as when they are
unexcited. The helix may certainly have an effect upon the
cores, and this effect is either to enfeeble the magnetism of the
cores or to strengthen it; but if the former, and the bar were
the simple bismuth which it is when no current operates on                                                    it,

  But it does not sufficiently express the facts to say that the
bar is capable of two different states of excitement; it must be
added, that both states exist simultaneously in the excited bar.
We have already proved that the state necessary for the action
of one pole is not that which enables an opposite pole to produce
the same action; hence, when the two ends of the bar are
attracted or repelled, at the same time, by two opposite poles, it
is a proof that these two ends are in different states. But if this
be correct, we can test our conclusion by reversing one of the
poles; the direction of                      if, in its
                             force being thereby changed,      ought                                       it

bar. This      the case:
                   is            any one    in
                                            the instances cited, the   of

both poles      the same quality, the repulsion
                       of                               the one                            of                     is    so

                       the attraction     the other, that the bar    of
remains without motion towards either of them.
     To carry the argument                      a   step further,               let   us    fix   our attention

Such induced currents would, according to known laws, have a
direction opposed to those of the inducing magnet, and hence
would produce the phaenomena of repulsion. To carry out the
assumption here made, M. Weber is obliged to suppose that the
molecules of diamagnetic bodies are surrounded by channels, in
which the induced molecular currents, once excited, continue to
flow without resistance.

                                       I
    and those which published in connexion with M. Knoblauch,
    with a considerable share of his attention. He corroborates all
    the experimental facts, but at the conclusion states three objec
    tions to the manner in which these facts have been explained.

quer ces mouvements du bismuth cristallisé, comme on a essayé
de la faire, par la force repulsive de l'aimant, qui, suivant l'expé
rience de M. Tyndall*, s'exerce avec plus d’intensité parallèle
ment aux clivages que dans la direction perpendiculaire à ces
plans.
   “Remarquons encore qu'on ne trouve pas constamment l'accord
qui devrait exister, selon les idées de MM. Tyndall et Knoblauch,
entre les phénomènes magneto-cristallisés et les effets produits
par la compression dans le bismuth, si l’on considere ces plans

   With regard to the first objection, may say that it is ex                     I
tremely difficult to meet one so put; it is simply an opinion, and
I can  scarcely say more than that mine does not coincide with
it.     would gladly enter upon the subject and endeavour

sented by the arrows;
and if this force be
purely repulsive, theac
tion upon every single
particle of the diamag
metic mass furnishes
a moment which, in
the position here as
sumed, tends to turn
the rectangular boxin
the direction marked
by the arrow. It is
perfectly impossible
that such a system of
forces could cause the box to turn in a direction opposed to the
arrow; yet this is the precise direction in which the box turns
when the magnetic force is developed.
   Here, then, we have a mechanical effect which is perfectly
inexplicable on the supposition that the diamagnetic force is
purely repulsive. But if the conclusions arrived at in the fore
going memoir be correct, if the diamagnetic force be a polar
force, then we must assume that attraction and repulsion are
developed simultaneously, as in the case of ordinary magnetic
phaenomena.      Let us examine how this assumption will affect
the  analysis of the experiment before us.
   The marked end of a magnetic needle is pulled towards the
north magnetic pole of the earth; and yet, if the needle be
caused to float upon a liquid, there is no motion of       mass                            of its
towards the terrestrial  pole referred     The reason     this     to.

           Bodies are repelled from the Poles                                   of a Magnet.                       285
  Let us apply this reasoning to the experiment with the bis
muth prisms already described.      The motion of the magnetic
needle in the case referred to is not more inexplicable, on the
assumption of a purely attractive force, than is the motion of our
rectangular box on the assumption of a purely repulsive one;
and if the above experiment would lead to the conclusion that
the end h of the magnetic needle is repelled, the experiment
with the bismuth leads equally to the conclusion that the end                                                           f
of the prism hf, fig. 2, must be attracted by the pole N. The
assumption of such an attraction, or in other words, of diamag
netic polarity, is alone capable of explaining the effect, and the
explanation which it offers is perfect.
   On the hypothesis of diamagnetic polarity, the prism hf turns
a hostile end h to the magnetic pole N, and a friendly pole                                                                 f

286           Prof. Tyndall                on the     Nature         of the         Force by which
it follows that  a very slight deviation of the box from the equa
torial  position is sufficient to give the moment of p' a prepon
 derance over that of p, and consequently to produce the exact
effect observed in the experiment.
   The consistency of this reasoning is still further shown when
we operate in a field of force which diminishes speedily in inten
sity as we recede from the magnet.           Such a field is the space
immediately in front of pointed poles.         Suspending our rectan
gular box between the points, and causing the latter to approach
until the box has barely room to swing between them, it is im
possible to produce the phaenomena which we have just described.
The intensity with which the nearest points of the bismuth bar
are repelled so much exceeds the attraction of the more distant
end, that the moment of attraction is not able to cope success
fully with the moment of repulsion; the bars are consequently
repelled en masse, and the length of the box takes up a position
at right angles to the line which unites the poles.
   It is manifest, however, that by increasing the distance be
tween the bismuth bar and the points acting upon               we dimi                         it,

   The formation of an insoluble arseniate of tin is nothing new
of itself, for it has long been known that metalloidic acids form
insoluble precipitates with certain insoluble metallic acids.  only                               I
point out the favourable circumstance by which a constant com
pound is formed, namely, by taking care to operate with an excess
                       -
of the metalloidic acid. Phosphoric acid in excess gives with
peroxide of tin,

   Stannate of soda is used as a mordant in print and dye works.
I  have made numerous experiments on a large scale to decide
whether in calico printing or dyeing, the hydrated peroxide of
tin alone would be preferable to an arseniate of peroxide of tin
as a mordant.   The result of comparative trials leads me to give
the preference to hydrated peroxide of tin alone, the various
shades being more brilliant and less liable to unevenness than
when arsenic acid is present.      It would be desirable to substi
tute in commerce a      purer  stannate of soda for that at present
sold, as well as for that containing arseniate of soda.
   These experiments were made in the laboratory of Harrison
Blair, Esq., near Manchester, who kindly afforded me every op
portunity for carrying out the same. They have led at least to
this practical fact, that the danger arising from the employment
of arseniates in stannates of soda may be obviated by the use of
a pure stannate of soda alone.

A FEW            simple alterations have greatly facilitated the em
        ployment of this instrument, and at the same time made
it considerably less liable to injury.         It consists, as will be recol
lected, of a little bottle of thin brass, into which the bulb of a
thermometer is introduced so as to              air-tight, and the neck

  In the use of this hygrometer, the person of the experimenter
can easily be kept at a sufficient distance from the condensing
surface; and in the ordinary mode of operating at an open win
dow whilst the little brass bottle is in the open air, the body of
the experimenter is of course in the room. Were it thought
necessary, a small telescope or opera-glass might be used to
observe the surface, whilst the handle of the piston-rod might
be lengthened so as to admit of still greater distance.

Experimental      Researches       in Electricity.  By Michael FARADAY,
   D.C.L., F.R.S. &c.             &c.  3 vols. 8vo.   London: Taylor and
   Francis.
        volumes of           Faraday's Experimental      Researches are now
THREE
   before the public.                  They embrace his contributions   to the
Philosophical Transactions, the Philosophical Magazine, and other
journals during a period of upwards of thirty years. The first of these
volumes opens with the celebrated memoir on Voltaic and Magneto
electric Induction. In the year 1820 Arago and Humboldt were
making experiments on terrestrial magnetism on the slope of Green
wich Hill: Arago observed that the magnetic needle came more
quickly to a state of rest when in proximity with certain bodies,
and following up this observation he founded upon it his so-called
magnetism of rotation.      The investigation of the force which pro
duced the rotation of the magnetic needle occupied for years the
attention of English and continental philosophers;              exact experi
ments were made and        explanations     given,          which,      all
                                                                      however,of

most important practical applications.
   There are men, who, having made great discovery—having passed
                                                   a

 those who dwell most upon Faraday's simplicity of expression are
 really aware of the effort sometimes required to understand him.
  Such a man is not to be skimmed over superficially; he cannot
 make his thoughts an alphabet for children, and those who would
 accompany him to the depths from which he speaks must be
 prepared to encounter difficulties in the way.                 Often indeed he
 speaks in a language not generally known even among scientific men.
 As Kant in the ‘Critic of Pure Reason” was almost necessitated
 to elaborate a new language for himself, so the incessant con
 tact with new truths which it has been Faraday's fortune to
 experience has rendered a divergence from the accredited forms of
 expression necessary to him.          He has seen theories fade before the
 stern realities which he has brought to light, and it is therefore im
 possible for him to make use of the language of those theories with
 the undoubting confidence of those who believe in them. An appa
 rent vagueness may sometimes be the result of this scepticism, but
 this is inevitable with the man, who, working on the boundaries of
 science, discerns the inadequacies of received notions, and has to
 cross a chasm of doubt and darkness in his transition from the
 defective to the true.
    The salient qualities of Faraday's scientific character manifest
themselves from the beginning to the end of these volumes,                      a
union of ardour and patience, the former prompting the attack, the
latter holding him to his subject until he has obtained complete

than,  or different from, the fact into the mind, and hence the possible
injury arising from their use. Faraday's constant effort has been

 others of a character so neutral that the thought shall be uninflu
enced    by the term. Passing over many minor papers we arrive at the
important memoirs on Static Induction, on Conduction, and on Induc.
 tion in Curved Lines. The latter idea reveals perhaps asclearly as any
 other the profound and subtle character of Faraday's mind. The ques
tion he proposes to himself is: “How is the electric power propa
gated P Does it act like the force of gravity at a distance without the
help of intervening matter, or does it act in virtue of such inter
vention?” He reflects thus: If it be a force acting at a distance, this
force will act in the straight line which unites each pair of active
points, but if it be a force which propagates itself by the agency of
material particles, there is every reason to suppose that it may act
in curved lines, as sound, for example, which depends on the atmo
sphere for its propagation, can turn round a corner, or waves of
water round a rock.        Reasoning in the inverse way, if it can be
established that the electric force propagates itself in curved lines, it
may certainly be inferred from this that it requires a material
medium for           its
                   propagation.     Faraday believes that his experiments
establish the latter point; others doubt it; but however this may be,
the profound and philosophic nature              the thought which guided
                                                                     of

to the present time the value of this discovery has been principally
suggestive; no new fact has been added to the subject since it left
the hands of Faraday. A connexion between light and magnetism
is here indicated which none of our theories would have enabled us
to predict. None of our hypotheses would have prompted us to

method of true scientific investigation is probably incommunicable;
it belongs to the individual rather than to the system, and our con
temporaries, we think, miss their mark when they point at Faraday's
researches as simply illustrative of the power of inductive philo
sophy. Faraday's researches are illustrative of the power of a strong

THE“Remarks   on the Rev. H. Moseley's Theory of the Descent     of
Glaciers.”  By James D.  Forbes, D.C.L.,  F.R.S.
  In a paper “On the Descent of Glaciers,” communicated to the
Royal Society on the 19th of April, 1855, and printed in their Pro
ceedings, the Rev. Henry Moseley has proposed an explanation of
that phenomenon.
   The first part of his paper contains a lucid description of the
gradual motion of a sheet of lead covering the roof of Bristol Cathe
dral, which he ascribes (I have no doubt justly) to the successive
expansions and contractions of the lead by atmospheric temperature.
He explains the influence of the slope of the roof and of the measure
of friction upon the motion with his customary precision and clear
ness. He also finds for the probable measure of the effect or creep
ing motion of the lead, a quantity which, considering the imperfect
nature of the data with regard to temperature, agrees sufficiently
well with observation.
   In the latter and shorter part of the paper is a transition to the
case of glaciers, whose motion over their beds may, he thinks, be
accounted for in the same way, namely, by the alternate contraction
and expansion of the ice by diurnal changes of temperature, and he
then enters into certain calculations founded principally on data
contained in my “Travels in the Alps of Savoy' in confirmation of
this view.
   Entertaining as I do the highest respect for Mr. Moseley's emi
ment attainments as a theoretical mechanician, it is with extreme
regret that I find it necessary, in maintenance of the views regarding
glacier motion which I have elsewhere advanced, and in the interest
of scientific truth, to show (as I believe I can) that Mr. Moseley
has been led, apparently by a sudden inadvertency, to uphold an
opinion completely indefensible.
  I  must first object to Mr. Moseley's description or definition of
a glacier, as calculated to mislead the inquirer: he says (p. 339),
“glaciers are, on an increased scale” [compared to the sheet lead
covering of a roof], “sheets of ice placed upon the slopes of moun
tains.” There are certainly some inconsiderable glaciers of the
second order to which this description might possibly apply, with
the exception of the small thickness inferred by the word “sheet;”
but the true glaciers, whose theory has been so often discussed
(which theory must evidently likewise include that of glaciers of the
second order), cannot fairly be called either sheets of ice or be
accurately described as lying on the slopes of mountains.      They are
vast icy accumulations whose depth bears a considerable proportion
to their breadth, and which    fillmountain ravines      or
                                                       valleys,

    Glaciers are very generally hemmed in by precipitous rocks which
 determine their contour or ground plan; they have often to make
their way through contracted gorges where the ice occupies (as in
the case of the Mer de Glace of Chamouni), within a short distance,
a channel but half as wide as it did before.                  Yet the glacier, pre
serving        its
                continuity         whole, expands

    But, it will be argued, if the ice be really acted on by heat and
cold as Mr. Moseley supposes, it is a vera causa of motion and can
not be neglected. And here we join issue respecting the physical
theory proposed.
    Mr. Moseley's explanation of the descent of the lead on a roof at
an angle much below that at which motion could take place by
gravity, friction being allowed for (the angle of repose), amounts
to this, that every increase of temperature of the mass by the heat

 gradational, can only be considered as distinguishing individuals.
 It thus follows that a very wide range of variation exists in this
 type; so that numerous forms which would be unhesitatingly
 accounted specifically different, if only the most divergent examples
 were brought into comparison, are found, by the discovery of those
 intermediate links which a large collection can alone supply, to be
 long to one and the same specific type.
    After noticing some curious monstrosities, resulting from an un
 usual outgrowth of the central nucleus, the author proceeds to                                                                 in
 quire into the essential character of the Orbitolite, and its relations
to other types of structure.     He places it among the very lowest
forms of Foraminifera; and considers that it approximates closely
to sponges, some of which have skeletons not very unlike the cal
careous net-work which intervenes between         fleshy segments.     Of                its

tion at right angles to it), passing through or proximate to the
centre of gravity of the iron material in such section.                   Thus every
ship should have a characteristic magnetic distribution, primarily,
dependent on her position whilst on the stocks; so that, being built
with the head north or south, the equatorial plane should appear
externally on the same horizontal level, the polar aris only being
inclined from the vertical, in correspondence with the direction of
 the axis of terrestrial magnetism (Magnetical Investigations, vol.                                                    ii.

    Glasgow, before making any experiment, there was found                       depart                        a
    ure from the ordinary regularity                the lines      of

    considerable downward bend.
       Towards the stern, the equatorial lines rose out and came above                          of

 the iron plating of the top-sides, about 40 feet from the tafrail;
 thus giving to the after-part of the ship a uniform northern polarity.
 The ship, consequently, had become a huge simple magnet—the
 north pole at the stern and the south at the head. The attractive
 power, as was expected, was highly energetic.         At the distance of
 50 feet, a compass on the level of the keel, at right angles to it
 abreast of the stern, was deviated to an extent of above 10°; at 100
 feet distance the ship's magnetism caused a deflection of about half
 a point; and at 150 and even 200 feet there was a very sensible
 disturbance 1
    In the case of the “Fiery Cross,’ built at Glasgow and launched
in January last (a case which I have elsewhere referred to), the lines
 of no-deviation, as taken for me by Mr. James Napier, were still
 more rigidly in accordance with theory,       the difference of elevation
 of the observed lines of no-deviation at the main-breadth section
agreeing with calculation, theoretically, to within an inch or two.
 In the other case, that of the ‘Elba,” a slight discrepancy as to the
 comparative level of the lines of no-attraction on the two sides, might,
perhaps, be satisfactorily explained by the proximity and somewhat
disturbing influence of another iron ship (advanced only to the
frames or angle irons) on the port side of her.
    In the case of the ‘Elizabeth Harrison,’ a large iron ship built at
Liverpool, the first I had carefully examined, the correspondence of
the magnetic polar axis and equatorial plane with those of terres
trial action was equally characteristic and conclusive.
    Hence we may perceive a sufficient reason for some of the pecu
liar phenomena in iron ships of the compass disturbances and their
changes.     We may see why a ship built with her head easterly or
westerly, and having the polar axis inclined over 18° or 20° to the
starboard or port side, should be particularly liable to compass
changes, if severely strained or struck by the sea with her head in
an opposite direction.    We see why the compasses of the ‘Tayleur'
should have been exposed to such a change as appears to have taken
place in her lamentable case.      We see in the case of the ‘Ottawa”
      I
(one have elsewhere referred to), why a heavy blow of the sea, with
the ship heeling and her head pointing eastward, would be likely to
produce a change in her magnetism, when her previous magnetic
distribution was solicited by terrestrial action in an angle of 30° or 40°
of difference.    And we see why the deviations of the compass in iron
ships should, differently from those of wooden ships, be sometimes
westerly and sometimes easterly in ships built and trading in home
latitudes; for here, whilst in wooden ships, where the iron work is
in detached masses, the ship can have but little, externally, of the
character of a true magnet, and can possess but small comparative
differences from the position of her head whilst building; in iron
ships, on the converse, where the ship is rendered by percussive
action a powerful and, retentively, true magnet, her deviating action
must be expected to be different, as the polarity of the head or stern
             * Where the compass suddenly changed two points.

    ON   THE RED DISPERSED LIGHT IN A SOLUTION OF CHLORO
            PHYLL.     BY THE PRINCE OF SALM-HORSTMAR.
    From the statements of Stokes it appears as though the red        di
spersion was only to be seen in directions perpendicular to the inci
dent ray; this, however, applies only partially to the phaenomenon.
I  have observed that the red light can be distinctly seen, even when
the test-glass containing the solution of chlorophyll is held so that
the flame of a lamp is placed nearly between the glass and the eye
of the observer. In order to avoid mistake, I put a piece of black
velvet into the fluid so as to prevent the hinder surface of the glass
from giving any reflexion; but the red dispersion remained as before.
The red light consequently radiates also in the opposite direction to
that of incidence.
    It is remarkable, however, that this fluid should also show the red
light in the opposite direction; that is to say, in the direction of the
incident ray, as soon as the solution is so concentrated that the
directly visible light becomes more obscured.
    As the so-called dispersed light promises to do much to elucidate
the phaenomena of light, the smallest circumstance deserves to be
kept in mind.
    From the well-known fact that the red dispersion is only seen
with the help of a burning-glass in the centre of the solution of
chlorophyll, it would seem that those invisible rays of sun-light which
are rendered visible by the chlorophyll are separated in the sun-light
by heterogeneous spaces, just as though they passed through a lat
tice, which only causes those atoms lying close to the surface to
become luminous, where it is permitted by the lattice, and complete
their course at that point.      Thus in the parallel state the red di
spersion is visible at the surface; in the converging state, also, in the
centre. The question then arises, whether this might not be em
ployed in measuring these parallel heterogeneous intervals       –Pog

          GENTLEMEN,                 -           Dublin, August 4, 1855.
        my paper on the Molecular Constitution of Crystals, which
 IN    appeared in the Philosophical Magazine for August, I repre
 sented Sir David Brewster as having said that the cleavage of cry
 stals arises from the unequal cohesion of the different poles of each
molecule.
    Quoting his words from memory, I erroneously considered them
to apply to the first system of crystals of which I was then speaking;

the only reparation in my power—that of acknowledging                                                         it.

XL.      On the Passage        of Electric Currents                through Rarefied         Air.
                                  By P. RIEss+.
A”       interesting observation has lately been made by M. Gau
        gain in Paris.      He allowed a magneto-induction current
to pass between metallic knobs enclosed in a glass receiver con
taining rarefied air, one of which knobs, with the exception of a
very small portion, was coated with an insulating substancet.
Besides the glass receiver, or electric egg, a galvanometer was
introduced into the circuit, the needle of which was strongly
deflected when the naked knob was negative, i. e. when the
current passed from the covered to the naked knob, but suffered
no deflection when the current was reversed.         Thus to the inter
ruption currentf of the induction apparatus was ascribed the
property of passing through the electric egg in one direction
only, that    is,from the coated         the naked knob, and
                                             to                     this                   on
account the egg was called              an
                                    electric valve.   The following                             in
vestigation will show that this conclusion          unfounded, and that
                                                                   is

   314       M. P. Riess on the Passage    of Electric Currents
   one, naked, at the end of a rod attached to the upper plate. To
   generate the magneto-induction current,         I  used a very efficient
   apparatus constructed by Siemens and Halske, and formerly de
   scribed by me”.    The induction coil of this apparatus was 2}
   inches long and 24 inches broad; the voltaic current in the pri
   mary coil, in which lay a bundle of loose iron wires, was closed
   and broken by means of the tongue invented by Wagner, and a
  long time ago introduced by Neef. The circuit of the induction
  coil was closed after introducing into it a galvanometer with an
  astatic system of needles, as well as the before-described glass
  cylinder, in which the air was rarefied to one line of mercury
  pressure.    By means of a commutator, the coated knob in the
  cylinder could be made positive or negative by connecting it
  immediately with the one or the other pole of the induction coil.
  That pole of the induction coil will be called positive which de
  velopes iodine when both poles are connected by a strip of paper
  moistened with a solution of iodide of potassium, and when the
  primary current is broken. This pole can be easily detected by
 first fixing two pointed elastic strips of metal with their points
  opposite one another, so that the distance between the points
 can be changed, and then fastening a strip of thin writing-paper
 between the points. When the points are connected with the
 poles of the induction coil, and made to approach one another
 until a continuous series of sparks ensues between the two, the
 sparks will be seen to pass on one side of the paper only, pro
 vided the latter is not perceptibly displaced.         It follows from a
 known property of positive electricity, that the point in contact
 with this side of the paper is connected with the positive pole of
 the induction coil. To set the induction apparatus in action,            I
 used one of Grove’s elements; but this current being too strong,
 I  found it necessary to pull the iron wire half-way out of the
 primary coil. When the coated knob in the cylinder was con
 nected with the positive pole of the induction coil, the needle of
 the galvanometer was instantly deflected towards a certain side,
 and remained oscillating about 30°. On the other hand, when
 the naked knob was positive, the needle remained for some mo
 ments motionless, and then moved to a few degrees on one or on
the other side of the zero of the scale.       Hence it really appeared
as if the interruption current passed easily and completely from
the covered to the naked knob; but not at all, or only partially
and with difficulty, from the naked to the covered knob. This
explanation of the experiment, however, was contradicted by the
light in the cylinder, which could be seen in both cases, and, in
full day with shaded cylinder, appeared to have the same form ;
further, in the case where the needle was deflected, the light

appeared more quiet and uniform than in the other case. After
wards       I
          examined the luminous phaenomena more minutely.
Before  having some experience with respect to the above phaeno
mena in the case of the simplest electric current, such as that
of a Leyden battery, it appeared to me useless to experiment
further upon that most complicated of     electric currents which       all
the induction apparatus furnishes.

periments are      complete harmony with this remarkable con
                         in
clusion. When the direction        the discharge current was from

the inferior plate, that is to say, when the negative electrode had
a sufficiently large superficial area, of the many partial discharges,
which, with decreasing density, constitute the discharge of the
battery, a part of the last, owing to their small tension, must
have passed as glimmering discharges, and thus have exercised
no heating effect. When, on the contrary, the direction of the
current was from the knob to the small platinum surface, the
negative electrode was limited in magnitude, and a part of the
glimmering must have been converted into discontinuous dis
charges, and thus become effective in heating the circuit. Hence,
in accordance with experiment, when the discharge passes from
the surface to the knob, the heat in the remaining part of the
  discharge circuit must be smaller than when the discharge has
an opposite     direction. It is evident that the number of the
  glimmering discharges which become effective by reversing the
  current differs according to the form and distance of the elec
 trodes.    Cases may present themselves where the difference in
  the heating effect is inappreciable; but wherever it does occur,
 it must be in favour of the stated direction; and this, without
 exception, I have found experiment to corroborate.       The expla
 nation above given is also supported by ocular evidence.       If the
 cylinder is placed in the shade, and observed during the time
 that the discharge passes from the knob to the surface, a brilliant
 light is noticed in the space between the electrodes, whilst the
 knob and rod are but feebly luminous. It may here be remarked,
 that this brilliant light between the electrodes consists of two
 dazzling colours; at the negative electrode it is reddish-violet,
 at the positive greenish-blue. When, on the contrary, the dis
 charge passes from the surface to the knob, a broad reddish
 light is observable, not only between the electrodes, but through
 out the length of the glass cylinder, and stretching over the
knob and rod. In the last case, the explanation supposes that
 a great part of the discharges are glimmering.
     In free air, when the discharge spark passes between a very
 small surface and a knob, no difference between the heating
 effects in the discharge circuit is observable when the direction
of the current is changed. We have yet to examine, therefore,
to what degree the rarefaction of the air must be carried in order
that this difference may be observable.       The glass cylinder was
screwed on to the     air-pump  and kept  in communication with the
barometer test, the foot and clamp of the cylinder were connected
with the discharge circuit of the battery, by means of long copper
wires, after the thermometer had also been introduced into          it.
The knob   in   the cylinder stood at   adistance  ofÉths of   aninch
from the small surface.    In  the following table the heating effects

    The increase of heat by reversing the discharge in the glass
cylinder, and thus making the knob the positive instead of the
negative electrode, decreases quickly with increasing pressure of
air, and is no longer perceptible at a pressure of 2% inches.  An
interesting corroboration of the theorem, that in these experi
ments two essentially different kinds of electric discharge are
involved, is presented by the circumstance, that, in the line A,
the greatest heat occurs when the air is most dense (34 inches
pressure), and, in the line B, when the air is least dense (1+ath
of an inch pressure).
    In fact, when the greater part of the partial discharges were
glimmering, the admission of air must have prevented the glim
mering, and thereby rendered these discharges effective in the
generation of heat. When, on the contrary, the majority of the
 partial discharges were discontinuous, the increased quantity of
 air had the effect of increasing the interval between the several
 partial discharges, and, consequently, of diminishing the heating
 effect.  Insomuch as, in reference to this heating effect, these
 opposite actions simultaneously took place in every experiment,
 it cannot appear surprising that sometimes the one, sometimes
 the other action was in excess. Thus, in order to explain the
 observation in the line A with ºths of an inch pressure, we
 must assume that by changing the pressure of air from                                                  Tºa

322        M. P. Riess      on the Passage           of Electric Currents
by pushing the bundle of iron wires further into the primary
coil, in order that the current might traverse the space between
the electrodes.    In both positions of the electrodes the deflection
was   normal,   but it was greater with the knob negative than
positive.   A smaller knob, ºrth of an inch in diameter, was
placed at a distance of ##ths of an inch from the small surface
in the cover.     When the knob was negative, the deflection
amounted to 60° and was normal; when positive, the deflection
was zero at the moment of closing the circuit, but passed into a
normal or an abnormal one of 10°. The knob was replaced by
a  horizontal brass disc, #4ths of an inch in diameter and 1% inch
 distant from the platinum surface.       The disc being negative, the
deflection was normal, and attained the maximum; when posi
tive, it was abnormal, and amounted to 20°. I varied these ex
periments in numerous ways, but the common result of               was,      all
that when the small platinum surface was positive, the deflection
of  the needle was always normal, and always occurred imme
diately after closing the induction circuit; when,                 on
                                                          the contrary,
that surface was   negative,  the deflection was  sluggish   and retro
grade.    That   in the last case the deflection        sometimes ab
                                                              is
normal, has been observed also                  by
                                          M. Gaugain, who, had                     he
taken the observation    sufficiently  into consideration, would not
have been led   to the erroneous conclusion which he has drawn
from his experiments.      For there are undoubtedly two oppositely
directed induction currents acting           these experiments: the
                                                     in
interruption current,       in
                           reference      which the poles
                                                to              the     of         in
duction coil have been defined; and the contact current,          refer  in
ence  towhich the names          of    the poles     of
                                                  the induction coil must
be  changed.   The actron             of the two opposite currents can             be
demonstrated     by   means      of   a    decomposing     apparatus    still more
successfully than      by the galvanometer.        Besides the galvano
meter and the     cylinder    of
                               rarefied  air,   which knob was placed
                                                     in      a
#ths  of    inch from the small surface, two platinum points were
           an
introduced into the induction circuit; they were about one inch
asunder, and stood      on   piece
                             a             of
                                        paper moistened with iodide                of
potassium. As before, the commutator changed the direction
of the induction current         the glass cylinder alone.
                                 in                            When the
small surface   in   the cylinder was connected with the positive
pole  of the induction coil, the stain           of
                                              iodine         in
                                                         seven successive
experiments appeared only under that platinum point which was
positive   inreference  to  the interruption current; when,           the    on
contrary, the surface was           communication with the
                                      in                         negative
pole, the stain  of  iodine     thirteen experiments appeared eight
                                 in
times under the other platinum point alone, and five times under
both points. The knob              the cylinder was next placed 11%
                                   in
inch distant from the small surface: when the latter was posi

                                 through Rarefied      Air.                                 323
tive, the iodine stain appeared five times under the above-defined
positive platinum point; when the surface was negative, four
times under the other point. When the whole current of a mag
neto-induction apparatus is transmitted through very rarefied air,
between   a very small and a comparatively great surface, the                              inter
ruption current alone traverses the space between the surfaces when
the small one, in reference to that current, is positive; when, on
the contrary, the small surface is negative with respect to the in
terruption   current, the contact current is also transmitted.
    It has long been known, that, on account of the small tension
possessed by the contact current, the interruption current is the
only one which can traverse a space of air. According to Poggen
dorff", this small tension of the contact current results from the
production of a closed conducting circuit in the neighbourhood
of the induction coil when the primary circuit is closed. Thus,
although M. Gaugain concluded from his experiments, that, with
a certain form of the electrodes, the interruption current did not
pass through very rarefied air, it follows from the present inves
tigation, that in reality both the contact current and the inter
ruption current are transmitted in this case. Consequently, if
the term valve is still applied to Gaugain's apparatus, it must be
considered as a valve for the contact current, and not for the
interruption current. A glance at the luminous phaenomenon
furnishes a corroboration of the above theorem,                  indeed, anyif,
were   required.        In
                        order that the     light    might     more sharply be
defined,  I  had the brass knob        the cylinder,
                                            in              well     the disc,
                                                                      as          as
stained black          so   as
                          not  essentially        injure
                                                       to the conduction                         at
their surfaces. When the small surface was positive, the lumi
nous phaenomenon was the same                 that which takes place be

quiescent.     When,         on

324       M. P. Riess        on the Passage         of Electric Currents
was only partially surrounded by a blue light, that is to say, it
extended only over the anterior hemisphere of the knob or the
anterior surface of the disc. When the current was increased, the
blue light was confined to a still smaller space, and was momen
tarily hidden by the broad reddish sheaf of light which extended
between the electrodes.     When these luminous phaenomena have
been once observed in the dark, it is easy to recognize them
in daylight by merely shading the cylinder, whatever connexion
the electrodes may have with the induction coil.
    The experiments with the Leyden battery serve to explain
the phaenomena of the induction apparatus.             It has been shown
that the electricity in the battery generates a less amount of heat
 in the discharge circuit when it is transmitted through rarefied
air from the small to the large surface.           The same takes place
with the interruption current of the induction apparatus.                 A
brass disc was    placed   in a  glass  cylinder   at a distance of 1 line
from the small surface in the cover, and the cylinder, together
with the delicate electric thermometer, introduced into the cir
cuit of the induction coil. The heat produced was in general
small, but considerably smaller when the direction of the inter
ruption current was from the small to the large surface. When
the large disc was negative, the liquid in the thermometer sunk
from 1 to 3 lines; when that disc was positive, from 5 to 6
lines.   I obtained a constant result by allowing the current
passing from the great to the small surface to continue for some
time, until the liquid in the thermometer attained                   lowest  its
position; the sudden reversion         of
                                        the current   immediately    caused
the liquid   to rise. By simultaneously introducing               galvanoa
meter into the circuit,       was found that the greatest heat was
                             it
produced when the deflection           of the needle was smallest, and
the smallest heat when the deflection was greatest. With the
Leyden battery     no                  be
                                        entertained that the change

verting the slow glimmering discharge into the much more
quickly completed discontinuous discharge.                  similar change

apparatus       assumed, the cause           the changed action will
the same, and that      of the passage       the contact current will
found.     From   experiments     with the   Leyden   battery,      knownit  is
that the conversion       of the   glimmering     into the discontinuous
discharge occasions     a less deflection     ingalvanometer introduced
                                                    a

substance    decomposed          the circuit. Whilst the       glimmering
discharge does not injure the electrodes, the discontinuous dis
charge tears parts      ofthem away, and scatters the incandescent

                                 through Rarefied          Air.                                325
particles in the space between the electrodes.              This space will
consequently conduct electricity better, and the contact current
can pass as a glimmering discharge.           That for the transmission
of this current a   perfect  conductor is not necessary, is proved by
the fact that the same can be transmitted through a long strip
of tolerably moistened paper. These premises being granted,
the observed actions of the induction current can be deduced
without difficulty. When the whole current of the induction
apparatus is passed through well-rarefied air, between a small
and a large surface, and the direction of the interruption current
is from the small to the large surface, this current alone is trans
mitted, and that as a glimmering discharge : in the discharge
circuit, therefore, only a small amount of heat will be generated,
a galvanometer will be strongly and constantly deflected in one
direction, and an electrolyzable substance will be decomposed in
the ordinary manner, so that a certain constituent of the same will
 be separated at a certain electrode. If the direction of the current
be reversed, so that the interruption current pass through the
 rarefied air from the great to the small surface, this current will
 suffer partial discontinuous discharge; hence a greater heat will
 be produced in the discharge circuit, the deflection in the galva
 nometer will be less, and a smaller quantity of the electrolyte
 will be decomposed.        These actions will be modified by the
 glimmering discharge of the contact current, which can now
 pass in consequence of the greater conductibility of the space,
 its heating action will           be
                               weak, the deflection and decomposition
                                   strong, and

allowed to pass in a luminous manner between two wires in free

paratus is allowed to pass with sparks between two equal wire
points in air, that wire only becomes incandescent and fuses

time this density was as low as 2 millims., at another as high as
50 millims.    In general, when the negative electrode presented
a large surface, and the thickness of the air traversed by the cur
rent was considerable, the period during which the intensities
increased was of great extent, and that during which they de
creased scarcely appreciable; on the other hand, when the surface
of the negative electrode was very small, the period during which
the intensities increased embraced only a small number of de
grees, that during which they decreased being greatly extended.
When the electric valve was employed, the intensity of current,
corresponding to the most perfect vacuum an ordinary machine
is capable of producing, was sensibly equal to zero; with tubes
containing electrodes of metallic wire, the intensity of current
corresponding to the most perfect vacuum was always a maximum,
but never zero, and in these cases the period during which the
intensities diminished was not well defined so long as the distance
between the electrodes was small.
   The manner in which Prof. Riess would view these results
is already known; the following explanation is proposed by M.
 Gaugain:-‘‘When an electric current traverses a space con
taining air, the resistance with which it meets ought to vary, as
in the case of liquids, with the mean section of the gaseous space
which serves to conduct the same. The dimensions of this
space cannot, it is true, be immediately ascertained, though it is
natural to suppose that they are closely related to those of the
sheaf of light which is observable.    This hypothesis being ad
mitted, we must conclude that when the negative electrode pre
 sents a large surface, the mean section of the current continually
increases with the increased rarefaction of the air, for experiment
proves that in this case the sheaf of light continually expands.
The result    is,
               that the increased section compensates,          certain
                                                             is in
                                                                 a
measure, for the diminution       ofconductibility, which        conse
                                                                   a
quence  of the diminution    of  the elastic force    the air. When,
                                                      of
 on the contrary, the surface         of
                                      the negative electrode       very
limited, the conducting space formed             by
                                                  the reunion        of is

elementary currents cannot dilate, nothing compensates for the
diminished conductibility, and consequently           this diminution
manifests itself.”
   After observing that     in the above explanation          assumed
                                                              it

riment   as   anadditional  justification    of the  assumption.    An
air-pump receiver was procured,        inthe upper part    of
                                                            which was
a copper rod sliding, air-tight,      in
                                       aleather box; after exhausting
the air under the  receiver,  the   plate   ofthe air-pump was con

                       of

tin was now placed between the electrodes, at a distance of 5 or
6 centimetres from each of them; the luminous appearance
within the receiver was completely changed.   When the current
traversed the cylinder from top to bottom, a cone of red light
descended from the copper rod, and the upper surface of the disc
was covered with a blue light; a second cone of red light de-.
scended from the lower surface of the disc, and a second covering
of blue light surrounded the exhausting tube of the air-pump.
Thus the             tin
              disc constituted    double pole,    exactly the same

                       By JAMEs D. DANA.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
      a communication to your Journal for August last, by Mr.
IN    R. T. Forster, the author makes a statement which I beg
the privilege of correcting.
   Mr. Forster says, speaking of my views on twin-crystals,
published in the American Journal of Science for 1836, that the
ideas “were directly borrowed from Sir David Brewster,” and
that the paper by Sir David, containing his views, “ was quoted
by Dana in the American Journal of Science, and formed the basis
of his investigations, without, however, being acknowledged.”
   At the time of this “quoting by Dana” in 1832, I was still
in my teens, and for fourteen years afterwards had no con           I
nexion with the American Journal, and was not in expectation
of any such connexion.   Instead of Sir David Brewster's paper
forming the basis of my investigations,              I
                                         had not at that time,
culpable though it may appear, perused his paper.    The con
clusions were mainly arrived at during a cruise at sea in the
years 1833 and 1834, when I had by me only a copy of Phillips's
‘Mineralogy,’ from the measurements of crystals in which ex
cellent work, not knowing at that time in my solitude what
had been done by others,           I
                                   devised also the Haüyan method of
crystallographic calculation. In my paper, published in 1836,
I  cite the opinion of Woltz as to the existence of three axes of
attraction in molecules, and obviously do not claim originality
on that point, the main one in which the theories agree.                  In a
                                                                                       of iv.

British Association               at   Glasgow.

On certain curious Motions observable at the Surface of Wine. 831
inside of the glass must very quickly become more watery than
the rest, on account of the evaporation of the alcohol contained
in it being more rapid than the evaporation of the water.
   That this part of the explanation is correct, or that these
motions of the film in the wine-glass are really due to evapora
tion, may be shown by a very decisive experiment.         a vial be                         If
partly filled with wine and shaken, and then allowed to rest, no
motion of the kind described will be found to occur in the thin
film wetting the inside, provided that the vial be kept corked.
On the cork being removed, however, and the air contained in
the vial, and saturated with the vapour of wine, being withdrawn
by a tube, so as to be replaced by fresh air capable of producing
evaporation, a liquid film is instantly to be seen creeping up the
interior of the vial with thick or viscid-looking pendent streams
descending from it like a fringe from a curtain.    These appear
ances are quite of the same kind as those met with in the open
wine-glass.
   Another experiment may be made to show, in a very striking
way, the phaenomenon of the more watery portion of the surface
of a mixed liquid drawing itself away from the more alcoholic
portion as follows:—If water be poured to the depth of about
a tenth of an inch or less on a flat silver tray or marble slab,
previously cleaned from any film which could hinder the water
from thoroughly wetting         surface; and its then little alcohol    if             a
or  wine       be
               laid           on

                                                        of
water will rush away from the middle, leaving             deep hollow               a
there, and indeed leaving the tray bare              liquid except      of    all                        an
exceedingly thin film       the spirit, which continues always thin

to the following conclusion:-that to Sir John Lubbock belongs
the merit of having in 1840 first proposed a formula containing
three constants only, which is capable of giving the pressures of
vapours with a near approximation to accuracy throughout the
whole range of existing experiments.

336               Colonel E. Sabine     on the        Magnetic Variation in
the view of introducing the use of these instruments more exten
sively in our mercantile marine,—an object which may be further
promoted by making Captain Klein’s opinion known to the
readers of the Philosophical Magazine.
   But the particular object of this communication is not so much
to give additional currency to the Captain's commendation of the
Kew barometer, as to notice a remark of his which occurs sub
sequently in the same printed letter, regarding maps of the mag
netic variation. The remark is as follows:—“It was surprising
to see how incorrect the variation charts are: my results differed
often greatly from Raper's approximations, and           should fre         I
quently have wavered had         not   I
                                      invariably  obtained the same
amount as was indicated by the last observations made on land.”
With respect to one of the authorities to which Captain Klein
refers, viz. “Raper’s approximations,”                     I
                                             have of course nothing
to say;       I
            am not myself acquainted with the work; but as being
myself the author of a recent Map of the Variation over the
North and South Atlantic Oceans,                      I
                                         could not but be solicitous,
on  reading   Captain  Klein’s remark,    to obtain a knowledge of
any inaccuracies within the limits of that map which might
appear to be substantiated by his observations; and having un
derstood that the observations had been placed in the hands of
Dr. Buys Ballot, Director of the Marine Meteorological Depart
ment in Holland,            I
                      wrote to that gentleman requesting him to
communicate to me any particulars contained in them which
might appear to be at variance with the variation lines in my
                       I
map, to which knew Dr. Buys Ballot had the means of referring.
     I
     may here notice, that as the accuracy of my map rests wholly
on the accuracy of the observations which were coordinated in
its  construction,     can have
                       I                   no
                                    motive whatsoever for not being

variance with the maps.         Dr. Buys Ballot writes          follows:–                            as
“It true that the corrections for local attraction are not applied
        is
(in the Dutch observations)          strictly due manner; but

persuaded myself that since the local attraction was very small
in  those two vessels, and did not exceed               any direction, this   4°   in
error could not affect the conclusions          any  appreciable        in
                                                                   manner:
therefore    think that really the maps give

   I a  could entertain the slightest doubt about the accuracy
the variation     given as   my map for the vicinity

       GENTLEMEN,
        the existence of the great law brought to light by the
OF      science of geology, that the various parts of the earth’s
surface are perpetually undergoing a change of level, there can
be now no reasonable doubt.       The observations made on land
marks on the coast of the   Baltic,+the   singular phaenomenon of
the columns of the temple of Serapis near Naples, although now
above the water-level, as they must have been when the temple
was built, and yet showing marks of having been below the sur
face, in the perforations of a kind of sea shell-fish at the present
day flourishing in the neighbouring waters,        and the original
researches and bold     generalizations of Mr. Darwin among the
ancient and recent coral formations of the South Seas, -combine
to establish the law in the most satisfactory manner.
   2. To assign a cause of this law may be more difficult than to
recognize           its
                existence.  Mr. Babbage, and others after him,
have attributed            it    to      the expansion          and contraction           of   masses
of rock beneath, caused                       by    accessions and withdrawals                 ofheat
through chemical agencies.                              Obscure    as   the origin        of   the law
may be, the importance                            its   discovery cannot      be   over-estimated,
          supplies                        an of   explanation     of
as   it                   so   clear                the wonderful alterna
tions     of   level which must have taken place        produce the phae to
nomena         of   fresh- and salt-water formations which geology brings
to   light.
      Satisfactorily               nature may have been made out,

   4. The mean ellipticity of the earth has been investigated by
both the Astronomer Royal and the late M. Bessel with great
care, by a comparison of arcs of meridian measured in various
parts of the earth; and although the methods were somewhat
different, they arrived at the same conclusion, one making
the ellipticity
appreciable.  Now this

that the table-land is supported by the buoyancy of a mass of
crust projecting downwards into the heavy fluid. This repre
senting the state of things, a mass ad rising above the surface
and attracting a distant station A, necessarily implies a corre
sponding deficiency of mass in the locality bc, causing an almost
equal negative attraction at A counteracting the former positive
attraction.
   9. There are some difficulties in the way of this ingenious
hypothesis which                  I
                       wish now to state.
   1st. On what physical principle can it be assumed that the
crust of the earth is lighter than the fluid immediately below it?
It might rather be imagined, that by the process of consolidation
in using heat it would become contracted and therefore heavier.
   2nd. If the result at which Mr. Hopkins has arrived in his
calculations on precession be correct, that the solid part of the
crust is at least 1000 miles thick, an enormous interval of time
must have elapsed since the crust was sufficiently thin for the
form of             its
              surface         affectedto   be

found in vegetable earth.     It was precipitated in a flocculent

it was left as a shining, black, friable mass.

tube. It swelled up, partially fused, gave off a dense white
vapour, which condensed into drops of a light yellow empyreu

could be perceived, nor were any white vapours produced by the
introduction of a rod moistened with hydrochloric acid into the

   The ashes partially dissolved in concentrated hydrochloric
acid, leaving only some grains of sand and insoluble silica.         The
liquid was thrown on        a  filter; the insoluble matter, collected,
washed and dried, weighed exactly 1-0 grain; consequently the
portion of the ash soluble in hydrochloric acid weighed 4.0 grains.
The filtered liquid yielded a copious, white, flocculent precipitate,
with solution of caustic potash; a copious, white, but not floccu
lent precipitate with oxalate of ammonia; a very slight turbidity
with chloride of barium ; a very slight flocculent precipitate with
caustic ammonia; a blue tinge, but scarcely a perceptible preci
pitate, with ferrocyanide of potassium; and a greenish-blue tinge
with ferridcyanide of potassium.
   The ash consisted then chiefly of carbonate of lime, with
traces of carbonate of magnesia; traces of sulphate of lime and

    The results of this analysis lead to the conjecture that the
 bottle was used for containing red wine; but as modern wines
 contain mere traces of resinous or waxy matter, it was necessary
 to refer to the customs of the ancients and their treatment of
 wines.     The ancients, not contented as we are in the present day
 with wine in its natural condition, were accustomed to flavour
 their wines with a variety of substances.       Dr. Smith 4 states that
 they were accustomed to throw into the vats or amphorae various
 condiments or seasonings (medicamina, conditurae), among the
 chief of which were sea-water, turpentine, pitch, tar or resin,
 gypsum, burned marble, calcined shells, aromatic herbs, spices
 and gums.      Another mixture called mulsum was composed of
 wine or must mixed with honey, in the proportion of four of the
 former to one of the latter. Honey contains wax, and it is by
 no means impossible that the residue in the Egyptian bottle was
 that of some one of these vinous compounds.          The large amount

   With reference to the subject of Prof. Buff's interesting

          may be permitted to say that I have never published
anything on the experiment of Leidenfrost, though I have taken
some pains to instruct myself as to the cause of this sin
gular phaenomenon.        At an early period of railway travelling,
Mr. George Stephenson conceived the idea of making his loco
motives rest on steam springs.         The steam within the boiler
formed an elastic cushion for the support of the boiler. My
                                                       in by
belief is, that the spring suggested      the great engineer      pre                            is

 half an inch or more in diameter, may be examined, and it will
 be found that the liquid is at no point in contact with the metal.
 While, therefore, I agree with M. Buff in rejecting the explana
 tion which attributes the phaenomenon to a propping-up of the
 drop by the calorific rays,                 I
                               think the facts justify the opinion
 that an interval exists between the liquid and the metal.      This
 interval, as proved by Poggendorff, is sufficient to interrupt
 an ordinary voltaic current; but being filled with vapour at a
 high temperature, it is quite conceivable, as surmised by M.
 Buff, that a small portion of a strong current may pass through
 it.  M. Buff's observation, that the phaenomenon not exhibited                    is
 except     by
            those liquids which are capable      furnishing the ne   of

 fact that good conductors, which quickly supply the heat neces
 sary for evaporation, show the phaenomenon better than good
 radiators which      not furnish this supply, appears

                  last Number of this
      a paper of H. Rose of  Berlin,  describing a method of pre
paring aluminium from kryolite.      Previously, at the suggestion
of Dr. Percy,              I
                 had made some   experiments   on the same subject
in the metallurgical laboratory of the School of Mines; and as
the results obtained agree closely with those of Rose, it may be
interesting to give a short account of them now, though no de
tailed description was published at the time, a small piece of
metal prepared from kryolite having simply been shown at the
weekly meeting of the Royal Institution (March 30, 1855), ac
companied with a few words of explanation by Faraday.
    Shortly after the publication of M. Deville's process for pre
paring the metal from chloride of aluminium, along with Mr.
Smith        I
           tried to make a specimen of the metal; but we found it
a much more difficult thing to do than Deville's paper had led us
to anticipate, and had to remain contented with a much smaller
piece than we had hoped to obtain.             It however, undoubtedly  is,

gently crushed in a mortar, and washed by decantation.     Two
or three globules of aluminium, tolerably large considering the
scale of the experiment, were obtained along with a great num
ber of very small ones.   The larger ones were melted together
under chloride of potassium.

considerable size remained in the melted     fluorides; the metal
seemed to alloy with the sides of the crucibles, which acquired a
colour like zinc. It is possible that this difference may have
arisen from using a higher temperature than Rose, as these ex-                                .
periments were made in the furnace, not over the air-blowpipe.
   Porcelain and clay crucibles were also tried, but laid aside after
a few experiments owing to the action of the fluorides upon them,
which in most cases was sufficient to perforate them completely.
   These remarks, it is hoped, may tend to draw the attention of
experimenters still further to kryolite as a source of this interest
ing metal; although the experiments which led to them were
carried only a short way towards the perfection which practice
would probably confer.

        GENTLEMEN,
                                                                                     -
           paperof the Rev. Prof. Galbraith in the August Number
THE     of your  Journal, relative to the composition of the fel
spars of the Dublin Mountains, shows that he entirely mistakes
the object of my remarks, which were to this effect: that when
an inference as to the composition of the felspar of a granite
mountain is to be made, the specimen analysed should par
take as closely as possible of the general lithological character of
the mountain. Now the specimen selected by Mr. W. Wilson of
the Geological Survey, and carefully analysed by Mr. Dugald
Campbell, is very similar in        its
                                   composition                to
                                                    those examined
by  Prof. England   and Mr. Foster (see Proc. Royal Irish Acad.
Feb. 28, 1853), whilst the analyses            of
                                          the Rev. Prof. Galbraith

   The difference in Prof. Galbraith’s and Mr. Campbell's ana
lyses is not owing, I presume, to any difference in the consti
tution of the felspars, but most probably to the Professor's not
having taken out                  all
                          the mica.

   SIR,-In the month of June last, the Lords of the Committee of
the Privy Council for Trade caused a letter to be addressed to the
President and Council of the Royal Society, acquainting them that
their Lordships were about to submit to Parliament an estimate for
an Office for the Discussion of the Observations on Meteorology, to
be made at sea in all parts of the globe, in conformity with the re
commendation of a conference held at Brussels in 1853; and that
they were about to construct a set of forms for the use of that
Office, in which they proposed to publish from time to time and to
circulate such statistical results obtained by means of the observa
tions referred              to,
                        might                         be

368                        Royal Society    —
   Replies in some degree of detail have been received from five of
these gentlemen", copies of which are herewith transmitted.
   The President and Council are glad to avail themselves of this
opportunity of expressing their acknowledgements to these gentle
men, and more particularly to Professor Dove, Director of the Me
teorological Establishments and Institutions in Prussia, whose zeal
for the advancement of Meteorology induced him to repair personally
to England, and to join himself to the Committee by whom the
present reply has been prepared. Those who are most familiar with
the labours and writings of this eminent meteorologist will best be
able to appreciate the value of his co-operation.
   The President and Council have considered it as the most con
venient course to divide their reply under the different heads into
which the subject naturally branches. But before they proceed to
treat of these, they wish to remark generally, that one of the chief
impediments to the advancement of Meteorology consists in the very
slow progress which is made in the transmission from one country to
another of the observations and discussions on which, under the
fostering aid of different Governments, so much labour is bestowed in
Europe and America; and they would therefore recommend that
such steps as may appear desirable should be taken by Her Majesty's
Government, to promote and facilitate the mutual interchange of
Meteorological publications emanating from the Governments of
different countries.
                                Barometer,
   It is known that considerable differences, apparently of a perma
ment character, are found     to exist in the mean barometric pressure
in different places; and that the periodical variations in the pressure
in different months and seasons at the same place, are very different
in different parts of the globe, both as respects period and amount;
insomuch that in extreme cases, the variations have even opposite
features in regard to period, in places situated in the same hemi
sphere and at equal distances from the equator.
   For the purpose of extending our knowledge of the facts of these
departures from the state of equilibrium, and of more fully investi
gating the causes thereof, it is desirable to obtain, by means of
barometric observations strictly comparable with each other, and
extending over all parts of the globe accessible by land or sea,
tables, showing the mean barometric pressure in the year, in each
month of the year, and in the four meteorological      seasons,—on land,
at all stations of    observation,-and     at sea,  corresponding    to the
middle points of spaces bounded by geographical latitudes and longi
tudes, not far distant from each other.
   The manner of forming such tables from the marine observations
which are now proposed to be made, by collecting together observa
tions of the same month in separate ledgers, each of which should
correspond to a geographical space comprised between specified

Maury of Washington; and M. Quetelet of Brussels.

          Report on Marine Meteorological Observations.          369
meridians and parallels, and to a particular month, is too obvious
to require to be further dwelt upon. The distances apart of the
meridians and parallels will require to be varied in different parts
of the globe, so that the magnitudes of the spaces which they
enclose, and for each of which a table will be formed, may be
more circumscribed, when the rapidity of the variation of the par
ticular phenomenon to be elucidated is greatest in regard to
geographical space.      Their magnitude will also necessarily vary
with the number of observations which it may be possible to collect
in each space, inasmuch as it is well known that there are extensive
portions of the ocean which are scarcely ever traversed by ships,
whilst other portions may be viewed as the highways of a constant
traffic.
   The strict comparability of observations made in different ships
may perhaps be best assured, by limiting the examination of the
instruments to comparisons which it is proposed to make at the Kew
Observatory, before and after their employment in particular ships.
From the nature of their construction, the barometers with which
Her Majesty's navy and the mercantile marine are to be supplied
are not very liable to derangement, except from such accidents as
would destroy them altogether.      Under present arrangements they
will all be carefully compared at Kew before they are sent to the
Admiralty or to the Board of Trade; and similar arrangements may
easily be made by which they may be returned to Kew for re-examina
tion at the expiration of each tour of service. The comparison of
barometers when embarked and in use, with standards, or supposed
standards, at ports which the vessels may visit, entails many incon
veniences, and is in many respects a far less satisfactory method.
The limitation here recommended is not, however, to be understood
as applicable in the case of other establishments than Kew, where
a special provision may be made for an equally careful and correct
examination.
   At land stations, in addition to proper measures to assure the
correctness of the barometer and consequent comparability of the
observations, care should be taken to ascertain by the best possible
means (independently of the barometer itself), the height of the
station above the level of the sea at some stated locality.   For this
purpose the extension of levels for the construction of railroads will
often afford facilities.
   It may be desirable to indicate some of the localities where the
data, which tables such as those which have been spoken of would
exhibit, are required for the solution of problems of immediate
interest.
   19. It is known, that, over the Atlantic Ocean, a low mean
annual pressure exists near the equator, and a high pressure at the
 north and south borders of the torrid zone (23° to 30° north and
 south latitudes); and it is probable that from similar causes similar
phenomena exist over the corresponding latitudes in the Pacific
 Ocean : the few observations which we possess are in accord with
this supposition; but the extent of space covered by the Pacific is

   370                         Royal Society:—
   large and the observations are few ; they may be expected to be
   greatly increased by the means now contemplated.          But it is parti
   cularly over the Indian Ocean, both at the equator and at the
   borders of the torrid zone, that the phenomena of the barometric
  pressure, not only annual but also monthly, require elucidation by
  observations.      The Trade-winds, which would prevail generally
   round the   globe  if it were wholly covered by a surface of water, are
  interrupted by the large continental spaces in Asia and Australia,
  and give place to the phenomena of monsoons, which are the indi
  rect results of the heating action of the sun's rays on those conti
  mental spaces.      These are the causes of that displacement of the
  trade-winds, and substitution of a current flowing in another direc
  tion, which occasion the atmospheric phenomena over the Indian
  Ocean, and on the north and south sides of that Ocean, to be
  different from those in corresponding localities over, and on either
  side of the equator in the Atlantic Ocean, and (probably generally
  also) in the Pacific Ocean.
     It is important alike to navigation and to general science to know
  the limits where the phenomena of the trade-winds give place to
 those of the monsoons; and whether any and what variations take
 place in those limits in different parts of the year.      The barometric
 variations are intimately connected with the causes of these variations,
 and require to be known for their more perfect elucidation.
     The importance, indeed, of a full and complete knowledge of the
 variations which take place in the limits of the trade-winds gene
 rally in both hemispheres, at different seasons of the year, has
 long been recognized.          On this account, although the present
 section is headed “Barometer,” it may be well to remark here, that
 it is desirable that the forms supplied to ships should contain
 headings, calling forth a special record of the latitude and longitude
 where the trade-wind is first met with, and where it is first found
to fail.
     20.   The great extent of continental space in Northern Asia
 causes, by reason     of the great heat of the summer and the ascending
 current    produced    thereby, a remarkable diminution of atmospheric
pressure in the summer months, extending in the north to the Polar
 Sea, and on the European side as far as Moscow. Towards the
 east it is known to include the coasts of China and Japan, but the
 extent of this great diminution of summer pressure beyond the
 coasts thus named is not known. A determination of the monthly
variation of the pressure over the adjacent parts of the Pacific Ocean
is therefore a desideratum ; and for the same object it is desirable
to have a more accurate knowledge than we now possess of the pre
vailing direction of the wind in different seasons in the vicinity of
the coasts of China and Japan.                   -

nished mean annual pressure, it is known that in certain districts in
the temperate and polar zones, such as in the vicinity of Cape Horn
extending into the antarctic polar Ocean, and in the vicinity of Ice
land, the mean annual barometric pressure is considerably less than

anomalous differences, also of considerable amount, exist in the
mean annual pressure in different parts of the arctic ocean. These

their intercomparability ascertained, by a competent and responsible
Authority;—and provided that no observations be used but those in
which careful attention shall have been given to the precautions
which it will be necessary to adopt, for the purpose of obtaining the
correct knowledge of the temperature of the external air, amidst the
many disturbing influences from heat and moisture so difficult to
escape on board ship.      In this respect additional precautions must
be used if    night observations are to be required, since the ordinary
difficulties are necessarily  much enhanced by the employment of arti
ficial light. Amongst   the instructions which will be required, perhaps
there will be none which will need to be more carefully drawn, than
those for obtaining the correct temperature of the external air under
the continually varying circumstances that present themselves on
board ship.
   In regard to land stations, Professor Dove's tables have shown that
data are still pressingly required from the British North American
possessions intermediate between the stations of the Arctic Expeditions
and those of the United States; and that the deficiency extends
across the whole North American Continent in those latitudes from
the Atlantic to the Pacific.      Professor Dove has also indicated as
desiderata, observations at the British Military stations in the
Mediterranean   (Gibraltar, Malta and Corfu), and around the Coasts
of Australia and New Zealand; also that hourly observations,
continued for at least one year, are particularly required at some
one station in the West Indies, to supply the diurnal corrections for
existing observations.

globe has thus been making progress, in respect to the mean annual

of the value of the conclusions to which this investigation is likely
to lead, it has been considered worth while to undertake the pro
digious labour of calculating the five-day means of the most reliable
existing observations during a century past. This work is already
far advanced; and it cannot be too strongly recommended, that at
all fixed stations, where observations shall hereafter be made with
sufficient care to be worth recording, five-day means may invariably
be added to the daily, monthly, and annual means into which the
observations are usually collected. The five-day means should always
commence with January 1, for the purpose of preserving the uni
formity at different stations, which is essential for comparison : in
leap years, the period which includes the 29th of February will be
of six days.
   In treating climatology as a science, it is desirable that some
correct and convenient mode should be adopted, for computing and
expressing the comparative variability to which the temperature in
different parts of the globe, and in different parts of the year in the
same place, is subject from non-periodic causes.         The probable
variability, computed on the same principle as the probable error of
each of a number of independent observations, has recently been
suggested as furnishing an index “ of the probable daily non-periodic
variation” at    the different seasons of the year; and           use     this                   its    in

depend in great degree on the intelligence,    as well as the interest
taken in them by the observers, it is desirable that the instructions
to be supplied with the meteorological instruments should contain a
brief summary of what is already known in regard to the principal
oceanic currents; accompanied by charts on which their supposed
limits in different seasons, and the variations in those limits which
may have been observed in particular years, may be indicated, with
notices of the particularities of the temperature of the surface-water
by which the presence of the current may be recognized.          Forms
will also be required for use in such localities, in which the surface
temperatures may be recorded at hourly or half-hourly intervals,
with the corresponding geographical positions of the ship, as they
may be best inferred from observation and reckoning.          For such
localities also it will be necessary that the tables, into which the
observations of different ships at different seasons are collected,
should have their bounding lines of latitude and longitude brought
nearer together than may be required for the ocean at large.
   In looking forward to the results which are likely to be obtained
by the contemplated marine observations, it is reasonable that those
which may bear practically on the interests of navigation should
occupy the first place; but, on the other hand, it would not be
easy to over-estimate the advantages to physical geography, of
general tables of the surface temperature of the ocean in the dif
ferent months of the year, exhibiting, as they would do, its normal
and its abnormal states, the mean temperature of the different
parallels, and the deviations therefrom, whether permanent, peri
odical, or occasional.     The knowledge which such tables would
convey is essentially required for the study of climatology as a
science.
    The degree in which climatic variations extending over large
portions of the earth's surface may be influenced by the variable
phenomena of oceanic currents in different years, may perhaps be
illustrated by circumstances of known occurrence in the vicinity
of our own coasts. The admirable researches of Major Rennell
have shown that in ordinary years, the warm water of the great
current known by the name of the Gulf-stream is not found to the
east of the meridian of the Azores; the sea being of ordinary ocean
temperature for  its                             every direction,
                                                                     of in
                     latitude  all seasons and
                              at                 in
the great space comprised between the Azores, and the coasts
Europe and North Africa: but Major Rennell has also shown that
on two occasions, viz. in1776 and  in  1821–1822, the warm water by
which the Gulf-stream   is characterised throughout   its
                                                       whole course
(being several degrees above the ordinary ocean temperature     in
                                                                the
same latitude), was found    toextend across this great expanse      of
ocean, and  in  1776 (in particular) was traced (by Dr. Franklin)

              Report         on   Marine Meteorological Observations.                                       377
quite home to the coast of Europe.      The presence of a body of
unusually heated water, extending for several hundred miles both in
latitude and in longitude, and continuing for several weeks, at a
season of the year when the prevailing winds blow from that quarter
on the coasts of England and France, can scarcely be imagined to
be without a considerable influence on the relations of temperature
and moisture in those countries. In accordance with this supposition,
we find in the Meteorological Journals of the more recent period
(which are more easily accessible), that the state of the weather in
November and December 1821 and January 1822 was so unusual in
the southern parts of Great Britain and in France, as to have excited
general observation; we find it characterised as “most extraordi
marily hot, damp, stormy, and oppressive,” that “the gales from
the W. and S.W. were almost without intermission,” “the fall of
rain was excessive ’’ and “the barometer lower than it had ever
been known for 35 years before.”
    There can be little doubt that Major Rennell was right in
ascribing the unusual extension of the Gulf-stream in particular
years to      its
              greater initial velocity, occasioned by           more than ordi    a

and masters of merchant vessels should be correctly and thoroughly
instructed in the methods of distinguishing in all cases between the
rotatory storms or gales, which are properly called Cyclones, and
gales of a more ordinary character, but which are frequently accom
panied by a veering of the wind, which under certain circumstances
might easily be confounded with the phenomena of Cyclones, though
due to a very different cause.  It is recommended therefore that the
instructions, proposed to be given to ships supplied with meteorolo
gical instruments, should contain clear and simple directions for
distinguishing in all cases and under      circumstances between these      all
two kinds     storms; and that the forms
                  of                                issued for recording               to   be

but they differ from ordinary lightning not only by their globular
shape, but by the length of time they continue visible, and by their
slow motion.    They are said to occur sometimes without the usual
accompaniments of a storm, and even with a perfectly serene sky.
Conductors are now so universally employed in ships, that it may
seem almost superfluous to remark that, should a ship be struck
by lightning, the most circumstantial account will be desirable of
the course which the lightning took, and of the injuries it occa
sioned; or to remind the seaman that it is always prudent, after
such an accident has befallen a ship, to distrust her compasses until
it has been ascertained that their direction has not been altered.
Accidents occurring on land from lightning will, of course, receive
the fullest attention from meteorologists who may be within con
venient distance of the spot.
                                     Auroras and Falling Stars.
   Auroras are of such rare occurrence in seas frequented by ships
engaged in commerce, that it may seem superfluous to give any par
ticular directions for their observation at sea; and land observa
tories are already abundantly furnished with such.      It       course,                           is,   of
desirable that the meteorological reports received from ships should
always contain        noticea the time and place where Auroras may

   “On a supposed Aérolite or Meteorite found in the Trunk of an
old Willow Tree in the Battersea Fields.” By Sir Roderick Impey
Murchison, F.R.S.
   In bringing this notice before the Royal Society, it is unnecessary to
recite, however briefly, the history of the fall of acrolites or meteorites,
as recorded for upwards of three thousand years, though I may be
pardoned for reminding my Associates, that the phenomenon was
repudiated by the most learned academies of Europe up to the close
of the last century. The merit of having first endeavoured to de
monstrate the true character of these extraneous bodies is mainly
due to the German Chladni (1794), but his efforts were at first
viewed with incredulity. According to Vauquelin and other men
of eminence who have reasoned on the phenomena, it was in 1802
only that meteorites obtained a due degree of consideration and some
thing like a definite place in science through the studies of Howard,
as shown in his memoir published in the Philosophical Transactions.
   Vauquelin, Klaproth, and other distinguished chemists, including
Berzelius and Rammelsberg, have successively analysed these bodies,
and the result of their labours, as ably brought together in the work
of the last-mentioned author,                is,
                                      that whilst they have great gene

the Museum     of Practical Geology, when          occurred   it Mr. Trenham to

                                                   the same    conclusion.     On

partially coated with         peculiar substance, the surmise
                              a                                                the          as   to

382                              Royal Society:—
meteoric nature of the imbedded material seemed to be rendered
much more probable.     Again, in looking at the wood which imme
diately surrounded that portion of the mass which remained, as it is
now, firmly inserted in the tree, a blackened substance was observed
to be interpolated between the supposed meteorite and the sur
rounding sound wood.      On the outside of this substance (which had
somewhat a charred aspect) we observed a true bark, which follows
the sinuosities of the wood wherever the latter appears to have been
influenced by the intrusion of the foreign mineral matter. [The spe
cimen is represented in the annexed wood-cut.]
   Seeing thus enough to satisfy our conjecture, if sanctioned by
other evidence, I desired Mr. Poole to bring       all
                                                  the fragments     of

wood   he had not  destroyed which surrounded this body. On placing
the ends    of
             some      of
                       these (also now exhibited)            on
                                                         the parts from
which they had been sawed off, they indicated that the space be
tween the mineral substance and the surrounding sound wood
widened upwards; the decayed wood passing into brown earthy
matter with      an
                 opening     cavity into which rootlets extended. On

visited by Dr. Shepard, Professor in the University College, Am
herst, United States, whose researches on meteorites are widely
known, and who has furnished an able classification of them by
which they are divided into the two great classes of stony and me
tallic. Having carefully examined the specimen, Dr. Shepard ex
pressed his decided belief that it was a true meteorite, and the next
day wrote to me the following account of it; at the same time re
ferring me most obligingly to a series of interesting publications on
the subject as printed in America and Europe”:—
   “Concerning the highly interesting mineral mass, lately found
enclosed in the trunk of a tree, and of which you have done me the

hesitation in   pronouncing     it to be a true meteoric stone.

384                                          Royal Society:—
 whether he knew of any examples of meteorites having struck trees
 in America, he replied as follows:—
     “I  think you will find in the volume I left with Mr. Reeks at the
 Museum, an account of the fall of Little Piney, Missouri, February
  13th, 1839; in which it is stated that the stone struck a tree and
 was shattered to fragments, it being one of a brittle character.              In
 the interior of the Cabarras county, N. Carolina, a stone (October
 31, 1849) I know struck a tree, and I found it was difficult, indeed
 impossible, to separate completely the adhering woody fibres from
 the rough hard crust of the meteorite.          The stone in this case is a
 peculiarly tough one, having a decidedly trappean character, render
 ing it as nearly infragile as cast iron.”
    Aware that some time must elapse before the precise analysis,
 which I wished to be made in the laboratory of Dr. Percy, could be
 completed, and that the last meeting of the Royal Society was to be
 held this evening, I announced the notice I am now communicating.
 At the same time I resolved to visit the locality where the tree stood,
 and to obtain on the spot                       all
                                    the details required.     Having done so,
 accompanied             by
                    Mr. Robert Brown, Sir Philip Grey Egerton, Pro
 fessor   J.Nicol, and Mr. Trenham Reeks, the information ultimately
 obtained was as follows:—

 the surface on one side (or the breadth of a large saw) by a very

    Since the Battersea phenomenon was announced, Professor Hens
low, to whom I had applied, wrote to me saying, that he possessed
a remarkable example of a stone which was found imbedded in the
heart of a tree, in sawing it up in Plymouth Dockyard; and he has
obligingly sent up the specimen, which is now also exhibited.               In
this case, judging from the mineral character of the rock, and                                                                   its

then have obtained proofs of the great circumspection required be
fore we assign a meteoric origin to some of these crystalline iron

nickel, cobalt and other elements, been supposed to be formed by

       Extract of a Letter from Professor Langberg of Christiania to
    Colonel Sabine, dated June 10, 1855.
       “Of all the important results from the discussions of the British
   Colonial Observatory, the discovery of the direct action of the sun
   on the magnetism of the earth is certainly a fact of the highest in
   terest, in opening quite a new field for investigation; and few modern
   discoveries in this branch of science have interested me more than
   yours of the annual variation of the diurnal variation of declination.
   It seems that M. Secchi of Rome has nearly touched at the same
   discovery, and I am indeed glad that the enormous quantity of cal
   culations, which you are superintending, did not prevent you from
  publishing your results before the ripening fruit was plucked by an
   other.    The first beautiful result of this annual variation is the ex
  planation of the fact, which you have deduced from the observations
  at St. Helena and the Cape of Good Hope, that the horary variation
  of declination does not vanish in passing from the northern to the
  southern magnetic hemisphere, but only changes signs at the equi
  noxes.     I think every physicist will agree with you, that no thermic
  hypothesis will be able to explain this annual variation, but as you
  say (Toronto,             xix),
                          ii.   p.         itobviously connected with, and de

  around which        itrevolves, as the diurnal variation           connected with
                                                                                 is

  how this different      position       its orbit can affect the magnetic condi

 approximately assume that the magnetic axis of both coincides with
 the axis of rotation, and compare their relative position during a
 whole revolution or annual period, with the magnetic variation in
 question.   Now, if a plane is laid through the sun's axis parallel
 with the axis of the earth, this plane intersects the ecliptic in two
 points, whose longitudes are 286° and 106°, and has an inclination
 of 83°2, both axes forming an angle of 25°8. Accordingly, the
 northerly prolongation of both axes will converge (as in 1 and 2)

when the longitude is 286°, or about seventeen days after the summer
solstice, and the southerly prolongation (as in 2 and 3) when the
longitude of the earth is 106°, or sixteen days after the winter
solstice.   About sixteen days after the equinores the axes are in the
position 2, and the radius vector forms the greatest angle with the
above-named plane, viz. 83°2.        It is therefore evident, that the
greatest magnetic induction takes place at the two solstices, but of
opposite character, as the north poles converge in one, and the south
poles in the other semiannual period: the change takes place six
teen days after the equinores, exactly as you have found by observa
tion, and I regard this circumstance as very important evidence for
my hypothesis, although you have shown that it could also be ac
counted for by the fact, that all magnetic induction takes some

ere it attains its maximum.
   “If  the sun's magnetic axis does not coincide with the axis of ro
tation, then I suppose we shall find, by more minute examination of
the observations, that there exists also a small magnetic variation
corresponding to the sun's geocentric rotation, or 27-68 days.
   “There seems also to be strong reason to suppose that Hansteen's
discovery about the annual periodic frequency of the aurora borealis,
which has a marked maximum at the equinoxes, and even a more
marked maximum at the solstices, is connected with the same
cause.”

   According to this, a difference of temperature and a resistance
of passage are only observed when heat passes from a better to
a worse conducting metal.      No such difference was observed in
the passage of heat from a worse to a better conductor, nor in
the passage through the place of contact of two metal rods of
the same material.
   These contradictions suggested some deficiency in the method
of observation.
   If the  thermo-electric element be applied to equally warm
points of   heated bars of different conductibilities, the heat of
the point  touched communicates itself to the element. Without
regarding   the difference which results from the difference in the
specific heats of both bars, more heat will pass to the part cooled
by contact with the thermo-electric element in the case of the
better than of the worse conducting bar.       The first, therefore,
will  appear  comparatively  warmer.    This error may cause the
differences at the places of contact noted in the above Table,
which are the more prominent the greater the difference between
the conductibilities of the two metals.      The warmer the place of
junction  is, the more these differences are seen,      which account  on
they scarcely appear         the passage
                            in                        of
                                              heat from     worse                 a            to
better   conducting  metal,    where the latter  ought,  properly,                          to a
 appear warmer than the former.
      his error can, however, exercise               no
                                             disturbing influence                             on
 the relative conductibilities        of
                                   the bars themselves.    For     the                  on
                                                                            of at do
 supposition that the conductibilities       the barsof    not vary                           at
 different temperatures, the changes                of
                                           temperature      the several
 points of  the same  bar, caused      the by
                                           application    the thermo
 electric element, must          proportional
                                 be                 the temperatures
                                                                 to
themselves.
   Hence the relative proportion            of
                                      the temperatures observed                               at
different parts   of
                   the bar remains    unchanged,   and this     alone                  is
decisive in calculating the relative conductibilities.
   It was necessary,     obtaining reliable results

but 265 millims. long, were ground plane at one end.                                        These
bars were then placed in a wooden frame with their polished ends
free, &c., and the arrangement made, that to the plane end of
each of the longer bars the plane end of one of the shorter was
firmly screwed.          At a distance of 2 millims. from the place of
contact, and thence at distances of 21.4 millims., holes of
0.9 millim. wide and 8 millims. deep were bored.                                  These holes
were filled with oil.             The end of each shorter bar was sur
rounded by a tin case, through which steam was passed for a
long time.          A screen protected the rest of the apparatus from
the rays of heat. The whole apparatus was placed in a tin vessel
surrounded by water, so that the loss of heat during the experi
ment should be as uniform as possible.                            After the apparatus
had been      constantly      heated for two or three hours, and the heat
in the joined bars had become constant, the temperatures were
determined by sinking the thermo-electric element in the holes.
The thermo-electric element was needle-formed, and consisted
of two wires of iron and german silver, 0.3 millim. thick, placed
together, but only soldered just at the end where they dipped in
the holes.           At the other ends copper wires were soldered,
which communicated with the spirals of the galvanometer de
scribed in an earlier treatiseºk.                     The whole of the thermo
electric   element,     with the      exception      of the points dipping in the
holes, was fastened in a glass tube with sealing-wax, which was
cemented in a vessel of water in order to keep the posterior ends                                 -
of the element at a constant temperature.
   The following are some of the results obtained with the appa
ratus. Under a the series of holes is given, beginning with that
nearest the place of junction.                 The holes corresponding to the
warmer bars, which are first in the list, are marked with +,
and the colder with —. Under t stand the corresponding tem
peratures.          Each series contains the mean of several successive

ance  of passage. When the conductibility of the united bars at
their place of junction is lessened by imperfect contact, or by the
insertion of a piece of paper, a considerable decrease of tempe
rature takes place at those points, by which a difference between
the temperatures of the two bars at the place of contact could be
easily explained.

     Inworking kelp upon the large scale, several saline products
are  obtained,  and among these there are two salts, containing
sulphate                    the predominating ingredient.

  very impure substance, being largely intermixed with sulphate
of asoda, common salt, carbonate           soda, sulphocyanide     ofpotas                                              of

   The luminosity of salts in the act of crystallizing, and espe
cially of sulphate of potash, both pure and mixed with various
salts of soda, has been made the subject of repeated experimental
investigation by several chemists.   The extended and interesting
researches  by  Rose+ must be     generally known.    In Gmelin's
*   Chemistry’ we have         a condensed but faithful account of the
results observed by different experimenters.               The subject is still
involved in considerable obscurity.
     I regret that I am as yet unable to give a satisfactory expla
nation of the phaenomena in regard to the salt now under con
sideration, having reluctantly been obliged, by an enforced re
laxation from           all

   The results of thesefeweyperiments, though affording very little
insight into the cause of the phaenomena, plainly indicate that the
emission of light takes place within a limited range of tempera
ture, and that actual contact of the crystals with the crystallizing
liquor is essential.   Agitation of the liquor with a rod produces
no effect.

     I have already stated that the composition of this salt is
remarkable. It has hitherto been viewed and described as a
peculiar form or variety of neutral sulphate of potash, and as
such it is regarded both by chemists and manufacturers. The
results of my analyses do not confirm this view of       composition.                      its

   These proportions correspond to the formula 3KO SO.", NaO -
SO°, as shown in the third column of the above statement.
   The presence of soda in the salt was easily established by
decomposing a known quantity with nitrate of baryta, and cry
stallizing the solution filtered from the precipitate.            Crystals of
nitrate of soda mixed with those of nitre were           abundantly      depo
sited. In another experiment, a known             quantity   of the salt dis
solved in water was decomposed by chloride of barium, and the
solution, separated from the precipitate by filtering, was evapo
rated to dryness; and the mixed chlorides, after treatment with
bichloride of platinum, were tested with the delicate and beautiful
process for the detection of soda proposed by Dr. Andrews at
the Meeting of the British Association in Belfast”.
    It will be at once remarked, that the composition of this salt
does not correspond to that of any other double salt of potash.

mine in so far as it is built upon the former. (You may per
haps find less ground for objecting to the speciality of such an
assumption, if you separate the simple fundamental conception,
which recommends itself particularly by a certain analogy of the
molecules to the heavenly bodies in space, from those additions
which Ampère was forced to make, in order to apply the mathe
matical methods at his command, and to make the subject one
of strict calculation. He was necessitated to reduce the case to
that of linear currents, which necessarily demand channel-shaped
bounds, if every possibility of a lateral outspreading is to be
avoided.)                                                         -
  To place my theory     of diamagnetic polarity in a truer light,                                      I
am anxious also to convince you that this theory is by no means
based upon new assumptions (hypotheses); but that it only rests
upon such conclusions as may be drawn from the theory of
Ampère, when the laws of voltaic induction discovered by Faraday,
and the laws of electric currents by Ohm, are suitably connected
with      it.affirm, that, even
                I                   Faraday had not discovered dia

but whatever the fact  may  be, the conclusion    scarcely warranted,      is
that therefore magnetized bismuth will repel bismuth. Supposing
it were asserted that magnetized iron attracts iron and repels
bismuth, while magnetized bismuth attracts bismuth and repels
iron, would there       anything essentially impossible, self-contra

   With regard               to
                     the mineral constitution          the granite rocks       of
of the Dublin and Wicklow          chain, the question       issue    that            at             is
which was raised about three years ago                Sir Robert Kane,     by
when        he
           stated      the Royal Irish Academy that the soda
                              to                                                                            in
these  granites  was      preponderant over the potash,
                                   so                                 lead                      as   to
to the conclusion that the potash should           referred      the mica be                to

    in the Granites of the Dublin and Wicklow Mountains.          421
which the granite contained, and that the felspar was an albitic
or soda felspar. Considerable doubts having been expressed as
to the accuracy of this statement,    I  undertook to search this
mountain chain for felspar crystals, and having selected seven
specimens from widely distant localities,     I submitted them to
analysis, and sent the results to your Journal, in the January
Number of which for the present year they were published; the
average ratio of the potash to the soda in these felspars was 4.5:1,
a result which differed so widely from Sir Robert Kane's state
              I
ment, that expressed my inability to conceive how the felspar
which entered into the constitution of the rock could be desti
tute of potash.    I have preserved the specimens, and shall have
great pleasure in allowing Mr. Jennings to examine them at any
time he chooses.
   With a view to the direct determination of this question,
Professor Haughton undertook the analysis of a series of rock
specimens selected from different localities in the range,
                                                                   and
arrived at a result totally at variance with Sir Robert Kane's
assertion; the average result of his analyses, as published in the
July Number of your Journal, gives for the ratio of the potash
to the soda in the rock specimens taken from the main chain,
4.822:2967, or in round numbers 5 : 3. Professor Haughton’s
analyses prove that the felspar, as found in large crystals,
                                                                   dif
fers from that which enters into the constitution of the rock in
this respect, namely, that while potash predominates in both cases
over the soda, the ratio in the latter case is less than in the
former.
   The single analysis furnished by Mr. Jennings, although it
does not fall in perfectly with Professor Haughton’s results,
must be pronounced to be equally inconsistent with Sir Robert
 Kane's statement, which requires us to believe that the felspar
of the rock is destitute of potash. This is a complete statement
of the question so far as facts have come to light; and am  I       in
clined to think that if Sir Robert Kane still remains silent, the
scientific public, unable any longer to withhold their judgement,
will pronounce this question to be settled against him. Why he
should maintain this reserve on a purely scientific question am  I
at a loss to understand, as he has had ample time to make good
the promise which he volunteered to the Royal Irish Academy
in February 1853. ,      I find, moreover, on referring to public
documents, that he has made considerable progress in this           in
vestigation. In the Report of the Museum of Irish Industry,
made 26th January, 1854, he says, “The chemical officers of the
Museum have been occupied with a very extensive series of ana
lyses (still in progress) of the felspathic and other
                                                         alkaliferous
rocks of the mountain ranges south of Dublin; of this investi

gation, twenty-four detailed rock analyses have been already
completed.”    In a return to an order of the House of Commons
on a motion made by Mr. George Alexander Hamilton, bearing
date 3rd May, 1854, I find the following statement:—“Con
siderable progress has been made with a very extended investi
gation into the composition of the felspathic and hornblendic
rocks of the county Wicklow ; the analytical portions of this
work, perhaps the most laborious and extensive of        kind ever                          its
undertaken, will include between 400 and 500 quantitative ana
lyses    rock specimens.”

                               [yourself] have made are demon
strable in every case without special experiment, . . . . . and are
absolutely incontrovertible, as well as incapable of verification, by
experiment or observation on diamagnetics.”
   Most of what I have to say upon this subject condenses itself
into one question.
   Supposing a cylinder of bismuth to be placed within a helix,
and surrounded by an electric current of sufficient intensity; can
  ou say, with certainty, what the action of either end of that cy
 inderwould be on an external fragmentof bismuth presented to it?
    Ifyou can, I, for my part, shall rejoice to learn the process by
which such certainty is attained: but if you cannot, it will, I think,
be evident to you that the verb “must’ is logically “defective.”
    We know that magnetized iron attracts iron; we know that
magnetized iron repels bismuth : this, so far as can see, is your                      I
only experimental ground for assuming that magnetized bismuth
repels bismuth, and yet you affirm that an action deduced from
this assumption “is demonstrated with as much certainty as the
parallelogram of forces.” Do not state the question fairly 7 I
I  can, at        all
               events, answer for my earnest wish          so.                         to   do

 424         Messrs. Price and Nicholson on the Influence of the Hot-blast
    Inthe present communication it is not our intention to enter
 upon the discussion of this subject generally, as we intend                                                                    re
 serving this for a future communication, but to limit our remarks
 to the consideration of the supposed influence of hot-blast in
 augmenting the quantity of phosphorus, an element of almost
 constant occurrence in pig-iron, and to the presence of which in
bar-iron the peculiar property of the metal known as cold short
ness is attributed.
    In a paper published in the Quarterly Journal of the Chemical
 Society”, and also in one read before the British Association in
 1849t, by Mr. Wrightson, several analyses of cast iron, the pro
duce of Staffordshire furnaces worked by hot, warm, and cold
blast, are given to prove that a larger amount of phosphoric acid
                                                              -
is reduced when hot-blast is employed.
    The increase in the per-centage of phosphorus in the iron
smelted with hot- over that with cold-blast is exhibited in the
following series of Mr. Wrightson's results:—            w

been said; in fact no mineralogist can dispute the great resem
blance of these minerals to those of terrestrial volcanoes, they
having only sufficient difference in association, to establish that,
although igneous, they are extra-terrestrial.     The source must
also be deficient in oxygen, either in a gaseous condition or com
bined as in water: the reasons for so thinking have been clearly
stated as dependent upon the existence of metallic iron in mete
orites; a metal so oxidizable, that in its terrestrial associations
it is almost always found combined with oxygen, and never in its
metallic state.
   “What then is that body which is to claim common parentage
of these celestial messengers that visit us from time to time 7
Are we to look at them as fragments of some shattered planet
whose great representatives are the thirty-three asteroids between
Mars and Jupiter, and that they are ‘minute outriders of the as
teroids’ (to use the language of Mr. R. P. Greg, in a late com
munication to the British Association) which have been ultimately
drawn from their path by the attraction of the earth 7 For more
reasons than one this view is not tenable; many of our most                di
stinguished astronomers do not regard the asteroids as fragments
of a shattered planet; and it is hard to believe if they were, and
the meteorites the smaller fragments, that these latter should
resemble each other so closely in their composition; a circum
stance that would not be realized if our earth was shattered into
a million of masses large and small.
   “If  then we leave the asteroids and look to the other planets,
we find nothing in their constitution, or the circumstances at
tending them, to lead to any rational supposition as to their
being the original habitation of the class of bodies in question.
This leaves us then but the moon to look to as the parent of
meteorites, and the more        I
                             contemplate that body, the stronger
does the conviction grow, that to it           all
                                          these bodies originally
belonged.”
   Dr. Smith then notices the similarity existing between the
respective densities      the moon and acrolites, but does not lay
                           of
great weight          on

                                              which the detached
masses were    subjected,  only  gave them new and independent
orbits around the   earth, that  may  endure for    great length  a        of

   “The various astronomers cited concur in the opinion, that
a  body   projected from the moon with the velocity of about
8000 feet per second, would go beyond the mutual point of
attraction between the earth and moon, and already having an
orbital velocity, may become a satellite of the earth with a modi
fied orbit.

    We cannot reasonably suppose that lunar volcanoes have
ejected enormous masses of iron, whether in a pure or oxidized
state, when iron occurs in such small quantity and so rarely as
the product of terrestrial voleanoes, and then most frequently de
posited by sublimation.        The density of the moon, as given by
Dr.   Smith,  is only  3-6,  while that of the earth is 5.6; this ren
ders it still more   improbable    that substances of greater density,
as the metals, are more abundantly ejected from the volcanoes in
the moon, than from those of the earth, the latter body having
the greater average density.                        I
                                        would also observe, that the

                                            known aérolites and iron

   It is not strictly true that no meteorite is known of any great
size, i. e. not larger than the well-known cannon-balls of granite
at the Dardanelles, for one or two of the larger meteoric iron
masses have been described by travellers as being 7 feet in
length and weighing 15 tons.         It would be improbable that
such a mass could be      projected  beyond  the mouth of either a
lunar or terrestrial volcano, much less reach a height of several
thousand feet.
   The following calculations will show that a mass of iron,
having a spherical form, and weighing 20,000 lbs., could not
reasonably have a greater velocity than 372 feet in a second if
projected   from a lunar volcano.   The
                                      -
                                         calculations are based on
the  following  premises.
   A stone having 5'6 inches in diameter, with a density of 30,
and weighing 10 lbs., is assumed to be projected from a lunar
volcano at the rate of 9000 feet in a second, i. e. with a velocity
more than sufficient, according to Dr. Smith and others, to allow
it to pass the limits of mutual attraction between the moon and
the earth.                          -
   Taking the sp. gr. of iron 8-0, and bearing in mind that the
areas are as the squares and the masses as the cubes of the dia
meters, we arrive at the following results.  A mass of iron (glo
bular) to weigh 20,000 lbs., sp. gr. 8, will be a little over 50.9
inches in diameter; found           thus:—

  have to be surmounted in realizing his ideal.       In order to form a
 fair estimate of the success of his undertaking, and to make these
 difficulties understood, it will be well to consider briefly what is
 required in such reading lessons.
      n order to suit all tastes, the subjects should embrace the several
  departments of literature, science, and art. The writers should be
 men of known ability, accustomed to original research in their several
  departments, so that what they write may be quickened by that
 peculiar freshness and vigour which a direct acquaintance with their
 subjects alone can give.       Each lesson should be a creation, and not
 a compilation.     Each author should strive by all possible means to
 arouse and maintain the interest of his reader; for this purpose he
 should avoid too much detail, and should be less anxious to increase
 the number of his facts, than to surround each fact with its own
 atmosphere of interest. All looseness of expression and insufficiency
 of explanation should be carefully avoided, their consequences upon
 boys being extremely disheartening and injurious.          The strictest
 accuracy in facts and expressions should be preserved, and all defi
 nitions should be as clear, decided, and concise as possible.
    The difficulty of Mr. Hughes's task will now be evident. To find
 a number of men to co-operate with him in the fulfilment of the
 above demands is not easy, and it will not, therefore, be surprising
 to find that the success which has crowned his efforts, though con
 siderable, is not complete. As far as this first book is concerned,
 however, we shall see that its success is certainly sufficient to encou
 rage him to persevere in his praiseworthy task; and we sincerely
 hope, that whilst preserving the many good qualities of the first,
 his forthcoming books will be free from its defects.
    This is not the place to speak much of the departments of litera
 ture and art. We shall merely remark, that the lessons on Mental
 Culture, by Mr. Edward Purcell, contain many sound thoughts and
 much good practical advice; they will be read by serious youths of
 more advanced age with profit and interest. The Biographies, which
 form an admirable feature in a boy's reading book, are on the whole
 well written. We know nothing more calculated to rouse a boy's
 faculties into activity, and induce him to be diligent and persevering,
 than well-written lives of men who have demonstrated by their
 works what diligence and perseverance can accomplish.             In the
 forthcoming books we hope to see this feature more fully developed,
The selections of poetry are not as well chosen as we could wish,
neither can we say that the lessons on Music and Fine Arts are likely
to prove quite successful. The chapters on English Literature by
Mr. George L. Craik are well written, and will find many readers.
Believing, as we do, that these lessons may do something towards
cultivating a love for English literature in boys, we shall not stop to
inquire whether the rival claims of English authors are there quite
justly stated; for it is far more important to develope in boys the
power of judging for themselves, than to furnish them with the
opinions of other judges.        Everybody knows the attractions which
natural    history possesses   for young people, and we doubt not that

Mr. Patterson will be fully appreciated by them. Want of space
will not allow us to do more than notice, that the departments of
Ethnology and of Animal and Vegetable Physiology are in the hands
of the well-known writers Latham, Mann, and Lankester. We
hasten to consider more carefully those parts of the book with whose
subjects we are more immediately connected.
   Mr. Hughes himself is the writer of the lessons on Physical Geo
graphy, and, as might be expected from the originator of the whole
scheme, has performed his task well. We wish we could say the
same of Mr. J. Beete Jukes, the writer of the pages on Geology, or
rather Mineralogy.       From a director of the Geological Survey of
Ireland one     naturally  expects to have interesting articles, or at
least, articles free from gross inaccuracies; but justice, and the very
fact of his high position, compel us to say that his productions are
neither interesting nor free from the most egregious blunders; indeed
the book would be considerably improved if his part of it could be
completely suppressed.        We are quite aware that a sentence so
severe as this should not be lightly pronounced, nor should it be
unaccompanied by proofs; no other consideration except this would
induce us to give greater prominence to errors which we feel sure a
careful perusal would have prevented.        The articles are uninterest
ing on account of their sterility, and of the almost entire absence of
that freshness and life which we believe to be indispensable.           The
uninteresting descriptions of minerals, unenlivened, as they to a
great extent are, by interesting associations, are far more calculated
to check than to awaken in the reader any love for the science.
    But the facts brought forward are themselves often inaccurate,
 and the author's ignorance or unpardonable carelessness will unfor
 tunately either confuse or misinform the attentive reader.              For
instance, on page 72 the reader is informed by Mr. Jukes, that

 chloric acid,” and on page 217, by Prof. Frankland, that it is formed
 by the combination of sodium and chlorine.        Which is he to believe
 Mr. Jukes calls fluor-spar a fluorate of lime. No such compound as
 the latter is known to chemists,       fluor-spar is fluoride of calcium.
 Iodine and bromine are      placed among    the seven substances which,
 according to Mr. Jukes, “when pure, are always found in the state
 of gas or acriform fluid;'' now every chemical book we have seen
 tells us that iodine is a dark-coloured solid having a metallic lustre,
 and that bromine is a liquid of a very deep brownish-red colour, and
 almost three times heavier than water.           Again, we are told that
 platinum “is the heaviest of          all
                                       metals except gold.”        Now the

 sentence. With the hope, therefore, that Mr. Jukes will either              be
 more cautious,    ordecline writing altogether       such books, we pass
                                                        in
 on  with pleasure  to  Professor Frankland’s lessons        on
                                                             Chemistry.
    These lessons have many good qualities, and from the spirited
and pleasant manner        in   which they are written, they will   no   doubt,

 as they deserve, have many admirers.               The facts are here accurate,
  and the manner in which          they are  introduced,   as well as the peculiar
  treatment of the whole        subject,  leave no doubt upon the mind that
  the author is     perfectly  at home,   and speaks from his own experience.
  It is only   as critics that we feel it to be our duty to draw attention
  to a  slight  absence of strictness and philosophic accuracy in some of
  the theoretical questions introduced; before doing so, however, let
 us admit that these defects diminish but little the value of the les
 sons; indeed, their general excellence suggests, in some measure,
 that closer examination which has led to the detection of what we
 deem to be faults.         For instance, great and, we think, undue stress
 is laid   upon   the elective character of the chemical force, by which it
 is  thought    to be distinguished from all other natural forces.           “If,”
 says the author, “we place a piece of silver and a piece of iron in a
 tumbler of water, we notice after the lapse of a few days that the
 iron has lost its lustre and become covered with rust, whilst the
 brilliant surface of the silver remains unchanged. Here one of the
 constituents of the atmosphere, oxygen, which was dissolved in the
 water, finding itself in the presence of silver and iron, made a selec
 tion between the two metals, and preferring the iron, united exclu
 sively with that metal.”          This is quite true, but it can scarcely be
 considered characteristic of the chemical force; for Professor Frankland
 knows quite well, that if a magnet were presented to the same two
 pieces of metal, it would manifest precisely the same preference, and
 make exactly the same selection. Again, the term elasticity is used in
 a rather obscure manner.           Let us suppose that the young reader has
 turned to the      very  useful  appendix   at the end of the book, and found
 elasticity defined, very properly, as “the property which some bodies
 have of recovering their form and dimension after the force which
 changed their shape and appearance is withdrawn,” and then imagine
his confusion when he reads the following sentences:—“Heat is the
 principle of elasticity.”—“Just as cohesion modifies chemical affi
nity, &c., so heat or elasticity produces analogous results by the
formation of volatile compounds, and their expulsion in the gaseous
form.”       Or lastly, “the mode of decomposition being here deter
mined      by  the elasticity of the carbonate of ammonia, which is ex
pelled from the mixture in the form of white vapours.”                  It may be
objected, that in chemistry the term elasticity has a different meaning
from the one above given; but if so, why has not Mr. Connon no
ticed it in his appendix to the article on chemistry? The fact         is,   how
ever, that the term has,     or     ought     tohave, but one meaning, and    in
the lessons   on    chemistry other words would certainly have conveyed
the author's      meaning     more distinctly.     These defects, however, are
not serious     ones,  and we are  of   opinion   that the lessonson   chemistry
are   amongst      the most successful        of
                                               the series: we    heartily  recom
mend them     to    the attention  of   allyoung readers.

written.

The explanations are usually clear, though there are some obscure
sentences. For instance,       the following there   surely some mis
print:—“The real motion                     of in                                        to is

                                                 the same direction.”         in
the following there must       some omission: “Since the ecliptic and
                                            be
equator are both great circles, that                              is,

more “completely separated from the petty cares and concerns                                                                of

 Mr. T. A. Hirst     on the Easistence              of a Magnetic Medium.          443
conclusion deduced by Professor Tyndall in a letter addressed by the
latter to Mr. Faraday and recently published in the Philosophical
Magazine. Professor Tyndall's conclusion was that, according to
the hypothesis of the existence of a magnetic medium in space and
of the identity of magnetism and diamagnetism, a compressed dia
magnetic cube ought to be less repelled when the magnetic force
acts on the line of compression than when it acts at right angles to
that line; a result which his own experiments have contradicted.
Against the legitimacy of this conclusion Professor Williamson
urges that “Dr. Tyndall seems to have assumed, that on the com
pression of an aggregate of particles of a diamagnetic substance, the
medium is not displaced by the particles in their change of posi
 tion.” We shall be better able to estimate the value of this objec
 tion by recalling the steps of Professor Tyndall's argument.
    A magnetic cube was taken which had already been compressed :
 its deportment before a magnet was experimentally examined, and
 deductions drawn concerning the changes that would occur in that
 deportment by merely conceiving the magnetic capacity of the
 material particles to be diminished, without in any way altering
 the distances between those particles, and consequently without
 in any way displacing the magnetic medium in the interstices of
 the body.
    Instead of the assumption attributed to Dr. Tyndall, he might,
 with greater justice, be accused of having disregarded the possible
 presence of the medium within the body; but in his own defence he
 may with perfect justice reply, that in Mr. Faraday's experiments,
 which originally gave rise to the discussion, no such interpenetration
 of two media existed.
    Admitting, however, that the interstices of a body are occupied
 by the medium, it may be interesting to inquire whether, from an
 argument similar to Professor Tyndall's, the same decided conclu
 sion could, with equal accuracy, be deduced. To answer the                        in
quiry, it must be remembered that the force of the argument in
question depends essentially upon the justness of the supposition
 that a diamagnetic cube may, theoretically, be produced from a
magnetic one by conceiving the magnetic capacity of the particles
of the latter to be sufficiently diminished.        It is evident that the
total attraction of the cube by a magnet will be equal to the sum of
the attractions of the material particles, and of the medium con
tained in    its
               interstices.   If this sum           be
                                               greater than the attracting
force upon the quantity                                                 its
                             is of
                                medium which the cube and           contents
displace, the substance         called magnetic, for        will   it    be
                                                                      drawn
towards the magnet;     if   less,   it called diamagnetic, for
                                          is                         will

repelled from the magnet.          But     our present knowledge
                                               in                         the of

   This is sufficient to show that, admitting the presence of the me
dium within the cube, the method of argument adopted by Professor
Tyndall would not be strictly applicable, unless the density of the
internal medium were subjected to limits which the advocates of its
existence might possibly be unwilling to grant.

446                      Royal Society:—
hypothetical properties of the internal medium be discarded as arti
ficial or inadmissible, then at present I see no way of escaping the
conclusion of Professor Tyndall's argument.
    With regard to the explanation given by Professor Williamson, it
will be observed that he pursues a path quite different from that of
Professor Tyndall, when he considers the effects produced by com
pressing a number of particles surrounded by a magnetic medium.
This compression, he states, may alter the attraction of the mass
by a magnet in two ways;–" first, by altering the density of the
 matter; secondly, by altering the density of the medium.”       By the
 term ‘density of matter’ is usually understood the relation which
exists between the quantity of matter which a body contains, and
 the volume of the space enclosed by its external surface.       But in
 the present case, where a comparison is instituted between the
matter of the body and the medium which is supposed to fill all its
pores, we must, I imagine, understand by the term ‘density of
 matter,’ the relation which exists between the sum of the masses of
 the particles, and the sum of their volumes; but if so, then, the par
ticles themselves being incompressible, it is clear that compression
 could not alter the density of matter.”
    As to the second effect of compression, viz. an alteration of the
 density of the medium, it may be quite conceivable, although I do
 not find that Professor Williamson has any where taken it into con
 sideration.   The effects of compression may, therefore, be more cor
 rectly described as either—first, a diminution of the interstices of
a body, without altering the density of the medium which fills
them; or secondly, a diminution of the interstices, accompanied by
 an alteration of the density of the medium within them.
    Let us assume, as Professor Williamson has virtually done, that
 the first of these effects takes place; then, if we admit that “in a
 cubical mass of carbonate of iron the material particles are more
 magnetic than the medium which they displace, and the force with
which it is attracted is proportional to this excess,” we can by no
 means admit that, because “it becomes more magnetic by compres
sion, we must conclude that the loss of magnetic medium from its
interstices is more than supplied by the magnetic matter which takes
its place;” for, according to what has already been advanced, the
 excess of the attraction of the material particles above that of the
 medium they displace is the same after, as it was before compression;
 inasmuch as compression merely changes the relative situations of
 the particles, by bringing them closer together, but does not in the
 least alter their volume, and consequently does not in the least alter
 the quantity of medium they displace.
    With respect to carbonate of lime, Professor Williamson's con
 clusion is,   ofcourse, untenable, becauseit   isbased upon the fore
 going one.     He says, “when these particles are brought closer
 together by   pressure, with diminutionof   the intervening spaces oc
 cupied by the medium, the mass becomes more diamagnetic, because
a  certain quantity of   the magnetic medium    is thus replacedby  the
less magnetic matter.”    It   is, however, manifest that exactly the

       Prof. Retzius        on the     Form      of the Cranium in      the   Embryo. 447
same quantity of magnetic medium is displaced by the less magnetic
matter after, as there was before compression. Why, then, should
diamagnetic action be increased by compression ?
   Lastly, with respect to the crystals of carbonate of iron and car
bonate of lime, Professor Williamson's explanation, although inge
nious, is liable to the same objections as those already mentioned.
It cannot, in fact, be said that the functions of matter predomi
nate most strongly over those of the medium they displace in any
one direction, merely because the particles may be closer together in
that direction; for, as long as each particle is surrounded by the
medium, the predominance of that function of the particles with
which we are concerned, i. e. their attraction, over that of the me
dium they displace will be the same, whatever may be the distances
of the particles asunder.
   From the foregoing remarks, therefore, it is manifest that, if Pro
fessor Tyndall has not yet succeeded in demonstrating that the
hypothesis of the existence of a magnetic medium and of the iden
tity of magnetism and diamagnetism is necessarily at variance with
experimental facts, meither has Professor Williamson succeeded in
proving that this hypothesis is in accordance with those facts. The
question of the existence of a magnetic medium is still an open one,
and will continue to be so until the many important principles which
it involves, but which have not been introduced into the present
discussion, have been further elucidated by new investigations and
new thoughts.

out a method for calculating the deflection of the plumb-line at sta

and of the vast regions beyond, with a view to the correction of the
astronomical amplitudes of the measured subdivisions of the arc
before they are applied to the determination of the ellipticity of the

   The same subject is taken up in the present paper, but in refer

a different method of calculating the attraction is given.
   The paper consists of three parts. In the first, the ellipticity of
the English arc is calculated without taking account of attraction.

Density of Table-lands supposed to be supported by a dense fluid or
semi-fluid mass; and the use he makes of his suggestions to remove
the discrepancy, pointed out in my first communication, between the
values of the deflection of the plumb-line in India, as determined by
calculating the attraction of the Himalayas, and as indicated by the
results of the Great Trigonometrical Survey.            The following diffi
culties occur to me in the way of this highly ingenious and philoso                                                              -
phical method of removing the discrepancy:—
    “1. It assumes that the hard crust of the earth is sensibly lighter
than the fluid or semi-fluid mass, imagined to be a few miles below
the surface. But I know of no law, except the unique law of water
and ice, which would lead us to suppose that the fluid mass in con
solidating would expand and become lighter.              One would rather
expect it to become denser, by loss of heat and mutual approxima
 tion of        its
              particles.

process, its rapidity, and the large amount of product it yields in
most cases, cannot fail materially to assist the study of the volatile
organic bases.
    During these experiments several observations were made, which
 I  beg  leave to bring under the notice of the Society.
     When employing about double the amount of iron which is recom
mended by M. Béchamp (2.5 instead of 1:2 of iron to 1 part of
 nitrobenzole), Mr. Alfred Noble found that the latter portion of the
 distillate solidified partly in the receiver and partly in the condenser.
 Washed with hydrochloric acid from adhering aniline, and once or
 twice recrystallized from boiling alcohol, the solid matter was ob
 tained in fine crystals of a yellowish-red colour, and fusing below
 the boiling-point of water. These crystals possessed all the proper
 ties of azobenzole, which was moreover identified by combustion.
     0.260 gramme of substance gave 0.755 grim. of carbonic acid
 and 0 134 grm. of water.
     The well-established formula of azobenzole, Cls H, N, requires the
 following values:—

     The azobenzole obtained in this manner is so readily purified that
 this process is greatly preferable to the action of alcoholic potassa
 upon nitrobenzole, since the latter process simultaneously produces
 several substances which can be separated only with difficulty from
  the azobenzole.
     A portion of the azobenzole obtained in the above process was
  converted by means of sulphuretted hydrogen into benzidine.             Of
  the beautifully crystallized compound, a platinum salt was made
  which was analysed by Mr. Noble.
     0.268 grim. of the salt left 0.088 grm. =32.88 per cent. of
 platinum.      The formula Cls H, N, HCl; Pt Cl, requires 33:09 per
  cent. of  platinum.
     Benzidine exhibits a very interesting deportment with nitrous
  acid; gently warmed in the gas of this acid, obtained by treatment
  of starch with nitric acid, it gives rise to a powerful reaction. The
  substance assumes an orange-red colour, and exhibits, after treatment
  with water, when recrystallized from alcohol, all the properties of
  azobenzole.
     The reproduction of this body from benzidine was moreover fixed
  in the following numbers:—
     0-215 grim. of substance gave 0.623 grim. of carbonic acid, and
  0.112 grim. of water.

   “On the Formation and some of the Properties of Cymidine, the
Organic Base of the Cymole Series.”            By the Rev. John Barlow,
F.R.S., Sec. R. Inst.
   The object of this memoir is to detail the process by which an
organic base, provisionally named Cymidine, was obtained from the
hydrocarbon, cymole, and to describe some of               properties, and  its
certain phaenomena attending its production.
   The substitution-product, nitrocymole, was procured by acting on
cymole    — strong nitric acid, both liquids being kept       the tempera         at
ture    by by
         1779 Cent. (0°Fahr.).       From nitrocymol, cymidine was ob

                                           Zinin's process, and results                                 of
analyses, made         by

a silver determination       the hydrochlorate, were found
                                of                                 coincide             to

hydrocarbon       substitution compound was derived, apparently iso

     The method of performing the experiment was to conduct                               a stream
of electrolytic            oxygen through            a compound               apparatus previously
weighed, which contained on one side an acid solution of iodide of
potassium, and on the other sulphuric acid; the former to decompose
the ozone, the latter to prevent the escape of moisture.  The increase
in weight of this apparatus gave the entire weight of the ozone; the
iodine set free, when reduced to      equivalent      its

  ON      THE HEAT PRODUCED BY THE INFLUENCE OF THE MAGNET

        magnetic
                 observed the remarkable fact of the attraction of
                needle by conducting bodies in motion. The phae
nomenon appeared very singular, and remained without explanation
until Faraday announced the important discovery of currents of in
duction.                It was then proved,                    that in Arago's experiments the motion
gave rise to currents, which, by reacting upon the magnet, tended
to associate it with the moveable body and draw it in the same direc
tion.   It may be said, in general terms, that the magnet and the
conducting body tend towards a state of relative repose by a mutual
influence.
        If,
      notwithstanding         this influence, the motion continue,          certain                          a

the apparatus at the surrounding temperature of 60°8 F., I saw the
thermometer rise successively to 68°, 77°, 86°, and 93°2 F.; but
the phaenomenon had previously become sufficiently developed to
ender the employment of the thermometer unnecessary, as the heat
produced had become sensible by the hand.
   If the experiment appears worthy of interest, it would be easy to
arrange an apparatus to reproduce and exaggerate this phaenomenon.
There is no doubt that by means of a machine properly constructed,
and composed only of permanent magnets, high temperatures might
be produced, so as to place before the eyes of the public assembled
in lecture rooms a curious example of the conversion of force into
heat.—Comptes Rendus, Sept. 17, 1855, p. 450.
