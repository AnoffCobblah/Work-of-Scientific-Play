I. Electromagnetic Induction in Conducting Sheets and Solid
   Bodies. By J. Larmor, M.A., D.Sc, Fellow of St. John's
   College, Cambridge, and Professor of Natural Philosophy in
   Queen's College, Galway*.
I. rilHE problem of electromagnetic induction in continuous
    JL conductors has often engaged attention. Maxwell
in 1871 (Proc. Roy. Soc, and 'Electricity and Magnetism')
gave the complete solution for the case of an infinite sheet, by
means of a moving trail of images of the inducing disturbance.
He refers to Jochmann (Crelle's Journal, 1866), who had
investigated the steady currents that would be set up in an
infinite plane or a spherical conductor, rotating uniformly in
a field of force, on the supposition that the effect of this ex
ternal field on the conductor is very great compared with that
of the system of currents excited. This, we shall find, pre
supposes a velocity of all tbe parts of the conductor in the
immediate neighbourhood of the seat of the disturbance which
must not exceed a certain moderate limit, or else a corre
spondingly great resistance.
     In the Philosophical Transactions for 1880 Professor
Charles Niven has developed a complete mathematical solution
of Maxwell's equations for infinite plane sheets and spherical
sheets of any thickness; but he has not fully discussed any of
the simpler cases. The generality of the solution necessarily
complicates his expressions; and in what follows we shall, to
                   * Communicated by the Author.

secure compactness and completeness, work out oh initio the
results that we require. The methods are chosen with a view
to deducing the results directly from consideration of the phy
sical quantities involved, with as little appeal to mathematical
transformations as possible.
   The solutions given below are all for cases that can be pre
sented in a simple form. A principal object in obtaining
them is to examine the circumstances of what may be called
electromagnetic screens.
   It has long been known that a plate of soft iron placed in
front of a magnet will partially screen the space on the other
side of the plate from the influence of the magnet, and that
the screening increases with the thickness of the plate. Sir
William Thomson bas applied the effect in recent times by
enclosing his marine galvanometer in a heavy soft-iron case
to protect it from the magnetism of the iron of tbo ship. And
lately Stefan has published a paper in Wiedemann's AnnaJen,
in which he investigates experimentally the diminution of the
strength of a magnetic field which is produced in the interior
of soft-iron cylinders, and compares the results with the indi
cations of Poisson's theory of induced magnetization.
   Now if we have a sheet of conducting matter in the neigh
bourhood of a magnetic system, the effect of a disturbance of
that system will be to induce currents in the sheet of such
kind as will tend to prevent any change in the conformation
of the tubes of force cutting through the sheet. This follows
from Lenz's law, which itself has been shown by Helmholtz
and Thomson to be a direct consequence of the conservation
of energy. But if the arrangement of the tubes in the con
ductor is unaltered, the field on the other side of the conductor
into which they pass (supposed isolated from the outside spaces
by the conductor) will be unaltered. Hence if the disturb
ance is of an alternating character, with a period small enough
to make it go through a cycle of changes before the currents
decay sensibly, we sball have the conductor acting as a screen.
   Further, we shall also find, on the same principle, that a
rapidly rotating conducting-sheet screens the space inside it
from all magnetic action which is not symmetrical round the
axis of rotation.
   The Earth considered as a rotating body comes under this
case ; for the upper strata of the atmosphere are conductors of
electricity, whether the conduction follows the law of Ohm or
not, and therefore these principles show that this layer must
more or less protect the interior from any external magnetic
action, not symmetrical round the earth's axis, that might exist
outside it. In the case of a spherical sheet conducting accord

              in Conducting Sheets and Solid Bodies.             3
ing to Ohm's law, we shall find that the screening action
depends upon the angnlar velocity multiplied by radius divided
by the resistance of the sheet, so that defect of conductivity is
fully made up for by a large radius.
   We shall also find expressions for the magnetic moment of
a copper sphere or spherical shell rotating in a magnetic field,
and for the expenditure of power required to keep up the
motion, and also for the rate of damping of the oscillations of
such a body.
   Finally, we shall show how solutions may be obtained for
the case of a rotating circular disk of conductivity not very
large by neglecting the mutual action of the induced currents.
   II. In the case of a conductor rotating steadily in a mag
netic field, which is that with which Jochmann deals, a steady
distribution of currents in space will ensue when the conductor
is symmetrical about the axis of rotation ; and the electromo
tive force along any line will be given, according to Faraday's
rule, by the number of tubes of force of this steady field that
are cut through by the line per second. Now when the mag
netic field is symmetrical round the axis of rotation, the
number of tubes enclosed in any closed moving circuit in the
conductor will not alter at all, so that there will be no curront
round any circuit, and therefore no induced current whatever:
the electromotive force along each open line will accumulate
a statical electric charge at one end of it, so that the conductor
will become electrified until the induced electromotive force
is exactly neutralized by the statical difference of potentials.
This conclusion holds whatever be the shape of the body.
   Taking cylindrical coordinates, if a, /S, 7 be the components
of the magnetic force at the point rOz in the directions of dr,
rdd, dz respectively, the electromotive forces between the ends
of these elements of length will be —etrydr, 0, mra-dz, where
» is the angular velocity, by Faraday's rule ; and thus the
electrostatic potential which neutralizes these will be
                     ifr=§((orydr — caradz)
                       = a§r(ydr—adz).
From this the electrification of the conductor may be deduced
at once. For example, taking a uniform field 7=y0 parallel
to the axis of rotation, we have
and therefore there is a uniform volume-density of electricity
                               B2

4         Prof. J. Larmor on Electromagnetic Induction
We must add the proper surface distribution: for instance, if
the conductor be a sphere, the outside potential which corre
sponds to the given value at the surface is
           ,    n a .         8 3cos2<£ — 1 ,       a3
                   P                °P               P
where p is the radial line, and <f> its inclination to the axis.
Thus the surface-density
                       _ J_/d±
                          4tt \dp ~~dj)
                       = ^a(-f + 5sin'*).
The arbitrary constant C allows us to superpose any free dis
tribution. If the charge of the body was originally zero, we
may give it such a value that the charge shall remain zero ;
but if the axis of rotation is uninsulated, the condition is that
C is zero. The above agrees with Jochmann's results.
    For the case of a flat disk rotating about an axis perpendi
cular to its plane in any uniform field of force, we may divide
the force into two components—one parallel to the plane of
the disk, which produces no induction, on account of the thin
ness of the sheet, and the other perpendicular to it, whose effect
has just been estimated. Thus Arago's rotations will not
occur in a uniform field.
    By connecting one terminal of a wire to the axis and
making the other terminal rub along the circumference, in
Faraday's manner, we utilize the difference of potential to pro
duce a current in the external circuit.
    Of course these static charges are of an exceedingly minute
character. We have found i/r in electromagnetic units ; and
to reduce to electrostatic units we must divide by the reducing
 factor v, which is approximately equal to the velocity of light:
the electric volume-density is therefore —            electrostatic
units, and the surface-density must also be divided by v to
reduce it to electrostatic units.
    III. We now proceed to the case of a spherical conducting
 shell at rest in a magnetic field.
    Let <I> be the current-function in the sheet : the value of <I>
 at any point will be the strength of the equivalent magnetic
 shell at that point. It is well known (Maxwell, art. 670) that
the magnetic potential in space not occupied by the sheet is

Laplace's equation for P can be written in the form
The given state of the external field we can express similarly
in terms of a function P0.
    The equations giving P, Q, R the components of the electro
motive force at a point are (Maxwell, art. 598)

where a is the radius of the shell. .
    These equations are satisfied by
                      E*=-a|(P + P0),                           (1)
without the intervention of any electrostatic potential y]r.
    To obtain a solution, let us suppose the external field to be
given by
                        P0=A0e-(:)"YB,
where Y„ is a spherical harmonic of the nth order, and

    Thus, taking real parts, we find, for a field of force oscil

   This solution represents a new and opposite field, with
strength reduced by the factor cos a, and phase of variation
retarded by the fraction « / 2ir of a complete period.
   For each harmonic term in the potential, the corresponding
induced currents flow along the level lines of that term: for
example, in a uniform field of force the currents circulate round
the axis of the field in circles, and produce the same external
effect as a simple magnet of moment ^Fa3 cos a cos (ict— a) at
the centre, with its axis pointing in the stable direction along
the lines of force, where F cos Kt is the strength of the indu
cing field, and tan « = 3R jAiraK.

             in Conducting Sheets and Solid Bodies.                7
   When the oscillations are produced by sound, as in the tele
phone, we find, on taking the number of vibrations as 350
per second, and n=2 to roughly represent the case, that the
values of p and k are equal for a thickness of^ centim. and a
radius of 3 centim. In this case half the original field is sup
pressed inside the shell, and a new field of the same intensity
as this half is added whose phase of oscillation is increased by
a quarter period. By increasing the radius or the thickness, we
soon make k the most important term; but if the area of the
original magnetic disturbance remain the same, n=2 will not
represent the circumstances when the radius is very large.
At any rate, if the number of vibrations per second or the
thickness of the sheet is increased, say fourfold, we have now
>c=4p, \f of the original field will be suppressed, and a new
field of    of the original with phase augmented by a quarter
period will be introduced.
   In the Phil. Mag. for 1882 Lord Bayleigh describes an ex
periment in which a coil conveying a current with a micro
phone-clock in circuit was placed close to another coil con
nected with a telephone, and the insertion of a thick plate of
copper between the coils very considerably diminished the
inductive effect in the telephone.
   IV. For the case of a solid sphere or a shell of considerable
thickness, the very remarkable conclusion holds that no ex
ternal magnetic disturbance whatever can induce currents
which do not circulate in concentric shells. In fact, it
appears that no difference would be produced if the sphere
consisted of concentric layers separated b}r infinitely thin non
conducting partitions. For, assuming such a distribution, and
replacing it for the instant by its corresponding lamellar
magnet of strength <3> at the point considered, we have for
outside space a corresponding magnetic potential fl = — (P**),
where P is the potential due to a distribution of matter whose
               <I>
density is — — throughout the shell. The components of the
outside vector potential

   In the case of a solid sphere, M=0, and L is to be deter

   Write                    Q!=CM,

of which the solution for this case, when Q, is to be finite at

   Remembering that the magnetic potential is ^(Pr), we see
that the effect of the sphere is to introduce a new varying
field with phase increased by a greater period, and which in
other respects bears the same relation to the old as the electro
static field produced by an uninsulated sphere of the same
radius bears to the inducing field, when the strength of the
former is diminished in the ratio -,—,      —W, . /a——^ . ^H!L_

   By combining the proper harmonic solutions, any possible
case can of course be represented.
   The form of the solution obtained in equation (4) suggests
another way of looking at the problem. The first term gives
a field equal and opposite to the inducing field at each instant;
the following terms represent its decay. Since V2P0=0,
that opposite field can only be due to a surface distribution of
currents. Thus, if at each instant we suppose a system of
currents to start in the superficial layer of the body which
neutralizes for internal space the effect of the outside changes,
the actual state of the body is that produced by these currents
soaking into it and decaying by their own mutual action. The
equation of decay (3) with P0 omitted is the same as the
equation for the diffusion of heat from the surface into the
body, though the boundary conditions are different; the cor
responding thermal diffusivity (conductivity divided by den
sity) will be <r/i7r. The value of this for copper is about
130; and as the actual heat diffusivity for copper is about 1*2,
we see that to have penetration into the solid of the same order
in both cases the oscillations must be about 100 times quicker
for the electrical case.
   V. We now proceed to consider the practically important
case of a conductor in motion in a magnetic field. If you
consider any closed circuit in the conductor, it is clear
that the electromotive force round it depends only on the
change produced by its motion in the number of tubes of
force that it encloses, and is therefore quite independent of
whether the relative motion of the conductor and the field be
ascribed to the conductor or to the magnetic field, or to both
conjointly. Therefore the currents induced in the body are
derived from the same equations, whether the axes are fixed,
 or are moving in any manner, uniform or not. But in the
 case of an unclosed circuit there is a difference introduced in
 the value of the electrostatic potential. In fact such an open
 lino which is at rest relatively to the moving axes is displaced
 across the field, owing to the motion of the axes : if you sup

 12       Prof. J. Larmor on Electromagnetic Induction
pose the ends of the line in its former position (1) and in a
near position (2) at a very short distance
 from it, to be connected so as to form a
 closed circuit, the number of tubes of
 force on the positive side of the lino will
be diminished by the number which pass
through this closed circuit supposed cir
culating in the direction of the isolated
arrows. The diminution is therefore
equal to the flux of the vector potential
along (2) minus its flux along (1),
together with its fluxes along the two
lines of motion of the ends of the open
line. Thus, when the line has moved from (1) to (2), we must
suppose the potential at each end diminished by the flux of the
vector potential along the line of motion of that end. There
fore in the equations for electromotive force we must include
terms for the change of the rate of variation of this flux as we
pass from point to point of the conductor ; that is, instead of
the true electrostatic potential     we shall get from our equa
tions <& + <!>', where & is the scalar product of vector potential
and velocity of the point supposed connected with the moving
system of axes, and is therefore
                    -(4>°I+=D-
We have thus deduced from first principles the result obtained
by Maxwell analytically by transformation from his equations
of the electromagnetic field.
   The method that we have adopted also brings before us very
clearly what it is on which the term W really depends. It
will have different values according as we take one or another
body in the system to be absolutely at rest; and as there is no
criterion of absolute rest at all, so far as matter is concerned,
we must conclude that the true value of <&' is that derived from
axes fixed with reference to some system or medium which
is the seat of the electromagnetic action.
   We conclude, then, that when a constant electromagnetic
system is moving through this medium in any manner, the
effect produced by the relative motion is an electrostatic
charge of the system of such character that its potential is <!>'.
This static charge, however, itself exerts a magnetic effect by
virtue of its motion ; but it is easy to see that this depends on
v2, and is therefore very minute. We know nothing of the
relation of this medium to ponderable matter : the motion of

             in Conducting Sheets and Solid Bodies.           13
the one probably affects that of the other, so that we could not
get the actual value of such an electrification, but it seems
that this electrification represents the total effect produced.
It is to be noticed that our argument is independent of axes
of coordinates altogether ; and that for any motion of a con
stant electromagnetic system, the value of ^ at any point is
the scalar product of the vector potential and the relative
velocity of the conductor with respect to the medium at the
point.
   We can now simplify the equations which give the electric
currents when the conductor is in motion, as we can reduce it
to rest, and solve the corresponding relative problem, where
motion across the lines of force is replaced by a variation of
the field itself.
   (1) Let us first take the case of a spherical shell rotating
with angular velocity co in a field given, as before, by the
function P0. We found for the case of the shell at rest the

   For moderate values of s, since R is large, p can be small
only by a and to or both becoming large. In particular, for a
copper shell ^ centim. thick, R=3 x 1640 about: thus, if in a
uniform field of force (s= 1, n = l)p is to be so small as we

thickness of shell = i centim., we find ^=1 nearly; and the
result is that inside the shell half of the field is rotated through
a right angle, the other half remaining as before. If the
thickness were 1 centim., we would have jo = 3, the field inside
would be diminished to fa, and a new field of fa of the former
turned through a right angle would be added on.

   VII. It is interesting to look back over the solutions, and
observe what part of the result is due to the mutual action of
the induced currents; we shall then be able to form an esti
mate of the cases in which their mutual action may be neglected.
Now the effect of neglecting this mutual action is merely to
drop P in the formation of the potential functions. In the
accurate solutions, for thin shells the part of the induced field
which is directly opposed to the original field will disappear.
This part is, for a solution of the nth order, the fraction
Airaicl (2«+ 1)R of the other component ; and the approximate
solution would hold to the first order of this small quantity.
In the case of thick shells, we would neglect \2 on the right-
hand side of equation (3), and the solution then will be
exactly the approximation to which we were conducted on
neglecting squares of the above small quantity, as may be
easily shown.

     In the Phil. Mag. for 1880 Professor Guthrie and Mr. C. V.
 Boys give details of experiments on the couples experienced
 by Arago's disks in a rotating magnetic field; and in a second
 paper is given an account of the determination of the relative
 resistances of polarizable liquids from the couples experienced
 by the containing vessel in a uniform rapidly rotating mag
 netic field. It would be very interesting to determine the
 absolute value of the couple for a copper sphere in a uniform
 rotating field of known strength, and to determine the log.
 decrement of its torsional oscillations due to induction in a
 stationary field, and to deduce thence, by approximation from
 the general formulae, two values for the specific resistance of
 its material at the given temperature in absolute units, which
 should be consistent with themselves and with the known
 value. For a uniform thin spherical copper shell the calcula
 tion would be very simple, and at the same time the tempera
 ture conditions uniform. No absolute quantitative experi
mental verification appears to have yet been made for induc
 tion-currents in continuous media.
    Since writing the above, I have found that H. Hertz has
 given solutions of problems of rotation to a considerable
 extent identical with those discussed here (Inaugural Dis
 sertation, Berlin, 1880, pp. 93). I have not yet been able to
 procure his paper ; but the results, so far as indicated in a
notice in Phil. Mag. Dec. 1880, agree with the above.

where R is equal to specific resistance divided by thickness,
so that p could be small, and therefore the screening nearly
complete with but a moderate amount of conducting-power in
the rarefied strata of the atmosphere.
   Although the sheet of air is very thick, yet it is still so thin
in comparison with the radius of the earth that the solution
applies to the problem by the principle of similarity, assuming
Ohm's law to hold for the current. Weighty evidence has
been brought together from different experimenters by Edlund
(Phil. Mag. 1880) in favour of the theory that much the
greater part of the resistance experienced by the electric dis
charge in passing through vacuum tubes occurs at the sur
faces of the electrodes, at which accordingly an opposing
electromotive force mav be supposed to act {ride C. F. Varley,
Proc. Roy. Soc. 1871; E. Wiedemann, Phil. Mag. 1880). That
being so, rarefied gases may well be fairly good conductors of
electricity, even when they refuse to allow a spark to pass
between electrodes, a view which is also adopted by Balfour
 Stewart in his theory of the magnetic variations mentioned
below.
    It is well known that disturbances of the terrestrial mag
netic force are largely connected with changes of the sun-
spots. There is also a daily variation in the magnetic elements
which follows the sun, but lags behind him by about 40°.
 Lloyd and Chambers have shown that this is of such a cha
 racter that it cannot be accounted for by a direct inductive
 magnetic action of the sun upon the earth, and in particular
that the lagging could not be so explained. Balfour Stewart
 {Encyc. Brit., Art. " Meteorology") gives reasons for assign
ing the magnetic variations to the effect of currents actually
 produced in the upper conducting strata of the atmosphere by
 the circulation caused by the sun's heating and tidal action.
 He also refers the large disturbances, amounting sometimes
 to -y^fl of the total force, to the same cause; and as any cause
 capable of such largo effects in a short time may also be
 assumed to be capable of producing the total magnetism of
 the earth (cf. W. G. Adams, B. A. Report, 1880), he is inclined
to look upon the earth's magnetism as the accumulated effect
of such action.
    Now, even leaving out of account its high temperature, we
could not suppose the matter of the sun to be so strongly mag
netized as to produce direct effects at the distance of the earth ;
but if the very considerable changes in the earth's magnetism
as well as in the long run its total amount, are to be referred
 to the effect of convection-currents produced by the sun's

              in Conducting Sheets and Solid Bodies.           23
radiation, we mnst be prepared to admit that, owing to the
enormous convection effects which take place in the sun,
combined with the great velocity at its surface due to its
rotation in 26 days, convective currents of electricity on an
enormous scale are possible in it whose magnetic effect might
be felt at the earth. It is easy to verify that, if the sun were
equivalent to a magnet with 13,000 times the earth's intensity
of magnetization (t. e. if it were magnetized rather more
strongly than we can magnetize steel), it could produce a
variation of yj^ of the earth's total force.
   Our object is to point eut the effect of the conducting
atmospheric layer on all such hypotheses. If its conduc
tivity is sufficiently high, it will screen off all such external
influences except the components parallel to the earth's axis
of rotation; and in any case it will partly screen them off,
and at the same time produce a lagging behind the sun of an
amount determined above. On the other hand, if, adopting
Sir C. W. Siemens's hypothesis, we were to suppose that the
outer part of this conducting stratum did not participate
fully in the rotation of the earth, currents would be induced
in it which would screen external space from the part of the
earth's magnetism which is not symmetrical round its axis,
and the reaction of these currents would tend to keep the
atmosphere rotating.
    The sudden and very brilliant outburst of light that was
 observed on the sun by Carrington in 1859 was shown to be
accompanied well within an interval of 15 seconds by a very
 sudden and well-marked disturbance of the magnetometers,
 which, however, went on increasing afterwards (vide Balfour
 Stewart, loc. cit.). Now the light took about eight minutes
 to reach the observer; and it seems therefore that we have good
 warrant for concluding that this magnetic disturbance was not
propagated from the sun directly and practically instanta
neously, as was shown long ago by Laplace to be the case with
gravitation; but that either (1) it was an immediate indirect
effect produced in the atmosphere by the sudden increase of
radiation, or (2) it was an effect propagated from the sun
with the same velocity as light.

  II. On the Purification of Mercury by Distillation in vacuo.
      By J. W. Clark, Demonstrator of Physics in University
      College, Liverpool*'.
            ' '                    [Plate I.]
THE usual processes for the purification of considerable
          quantities of mercury may be roughly classed as (i.)
chemical (e. g. treatment with dilute N02 (HO), Cr02 (H0)2,
Fe2CI6, S03(HO)2, and S02 (Hg02), &c); (ii.) mechanical
(e. g. shaking, filtering through wash-leather, &c.) ; and (iii.)
distillation. The last-named process may be conducted either
in vacuo or under the ordinary pressure.
     Of these processes distillation in vacuo is in all respects the
simplest and most satisfactory. Preparatory to distillation
the mercury may be advantageously filtered through a writing-
paper cone with a very small orifice at the apex ; and when
considerable quantities of lead or zinc are present, the distilla
tion in vacuo may be hastened by their previous removal by
one of the usual chemical methods. It is stated that the pre
sence of -njjflfi part of lead reduces the amount of mercury
distilled in a given time from 07 to 55f- Gold, iridium, silver,
copper, tin, nickel, cadmium, and arsenic do not influence the
rate of distillation f .
     The distillation of mercury under the ordinary pressure is
too inconvenient a process to be ordinarily used in laboratories;
not so, however, at a temperature of 180°-200° C. in vacuo.
The first apparatus for this purpose was described by Wein-
hold§, and since then Weber|| and A. W. WrightH have de
scribed other forms. The form shown in section in fig. 1
(Plate I.) differs from all the preceding chiefly in being sup
plied with the mercury to be distilled from a movable reservoir
(in the form of a constant level regulator, fig. 2), the raising
of which fills the distiller with mercury, which thus renders
a Sprengel-pump unnecessary to set it in action. It is hoped
moreover that its simplicity and efficiency and the ease with
which it can be made may render its description useful.
     The distiller consists of a lead-glass tube, a b (fig. 1), 36
inches long, and about | of an inch in internal diameter.
A bulb of about two inches diameter is blown two inches
from its closed upper end. The lower end passes air-tight
through a well-secured india-rubber cork which closes the top

  On the Purification of Mercury by Distillation in vacuo.     25
of the cistern d c, and terminates at b a little below the tube/.
The cistern (d c) is made from a piece of glass tube 1 inch
in diameter and from 8 to 12 inches long, with two short
pieces of quill-tubing, e and /, sealed into it. The lower end
is also securely closed with a cork through which passes a
piece of ordinary Sprengel-tube, i, 36 inches long, with a
piece of quill-tubing, h, about 24 inches in length fused
onto the upper end. The top of this tube is nearly in contact
with a. The internal diameter of the Sprengel-tube should
not much exceed 1 milliin., and the bend at its lower end is
best when not much more than one inch in radius. Instead of
india-rubber corks, ordinary corks soaked in melted paraffin
or covered with sealing-wax may be used, but the apparatus
then loses in flexibility.
   The base of the stand consists of a wooden tray, C D, from
which rises a stout board, D E, carrying a shelf, AE, perforated
in the centre with a hole of sufficient size to allow the glass
bulb to pass through it. In the Physical Laboratory of Uni
versity College the board DE which carries the distiller is
fixed to the wall over the mercury table. This renders the
tray C D unnecessary. A large cork, F, is bored with a hole
of rather less diameter than the tube a b, and the cork is cut
in halves. By placing the tube in the position shown in the
figure and twisting a piece of copper wire round the periphery
of the halves of the cork, the tube is firmly supported on the
shelf. The cistern is secured by string which passes through
holes in the projecting piece of wood, B. A block of wood
may be placed as a support for the end of the tube i. A tin
cylinder, slightly notched round the top and covered with a
flat tin plate, keeps the bulb surrounded with hot air, whilst
a mica window at the side allows the height of the mercury in
the bulb to be easily seen. The pipe of the brass ring-burner
passes through a hole in the tin case. The diameter of the
ring is about half an inch greater than that of the glass bulb,
and on the inner side it has a large number of very small holes.
   The constantJevel reservoir (fig. 2) is made from a large
bottle provided with a tubulure at the side. luto this passes
(through a cork if the tubulure be sufficiently wide—if not,
cemented in with sealing-wax) a glass tube, K, about 3 inches
in length and £ inch in diameter. Its outer end is closed,
and into the upper and under sides are sealed two pieces of
quill-tubing, I and j. The top of the upper one is open, but
the lower (j) is connected with the cistern of the distiller by
a narrow piece of india-rubber tubing, m m, about 3£ feet
long, enclosed in a canvas tube. By means of an india-
rubber (or paraffined) cork the thistle-funnel and small glass

26     On the Purification ofMercury by Distillation in vacuo.
stopcock are fitted air-tight into the neck of the bottle*.
Thus fitted, the reservoir is placed on an ordinary adjustable
table-stand on the shelf H (fig. 1). To set the distiller in
action, open the stopcock, S, of the reservoir and pour some
of the mercury to be distilled through the thistle-funnel, t,
into the reservoir, and with a short piece of india-rubber
tubing and glass rod securely close the tube e (fig. 1) at the top
of the cistern. Then raise the reservoir. The mercury gra
dually rises in the cistern, and by compressing the air in the
upper part is forced up the tube ab, and then filling the bulb
sprengels down the tube hi. The reservoir may then be
lowered on to its stand on H and the india-rubber stopper
removed from the tube e. The reservoir is set in action by
attaching a piece of india-rubber tube to the stopcock S and
sucking out air until, passing down the tube I, it bubbles up
through the mercury in the reservoir. Then close the stopcock,
and adjust the reservoir at such a height on its stand that the
mercury is nearly at the topt of the bulb in the distiller. If
needful, a little more air is sucked out of the reservoir as
before described. Thus set in action, the level of the mercury
in the cistern cd will be retained constant until almost the
whole of the contents of the regulating reservoir have been
distilled.
   To start the distillation, remove the tin plate which covers
the cylinder (H) and light the gas. Five to ten minutes later,
sufficient mercury will have distilled over to have entirely
displaced the impure mercury originally present in the narrow
Sprengel-tube i.
   The reservoir can be replenished with mercury without
interrupting the distillation. For this purpose it is only
necessary to place a screw pinchcock on the india-rubber tube
leading to the cistern of the distiller, open the stopcock S, and
pour the mercury into the reservoir through the funnel t.
Then suck a few bubbles of air out of the reservoir, as before
described, close the stopcock, and release the screw-clamp from
the india-rubber tube. The level of the mercury in the dis
tiller will remain as before.
   When it is desired to empty the distiller of mercury, air
   • So perfectly doe9 this form of constant-level cistern work, that it
seems probable that it may prove useful for other purposes—e. g. keeping
a Sprengel-pump in uniform action for many consecutive hours &c.
   t The vapour-tension of the hot mercury will depress the level in the
bulb. The extent of this depression is somewhat dependent upon the
height of the gas. On this account a simple form of gas-pressure regu
lator may be advantageously used with this apparatus. In another con
nection I hope to describe a pressure regulator of very convenient construc
tion for this and other purposes.

             On a Standard Tension- Galvanometer.           27
must be introduced into the bulb either by alternately sucking
and blowing through a piece of india-rubber tubing connected
with the end of i, or by disconnecting the india-rubber tube
leading from the reservoir, emptying the cistern cd, and
cautiously inclining the distiller until small bubbles of air
enter at the end of the tube a b and rise into the bulb. The
mercury then sinks into the cistern, and may be withdrawn
through the tube /.
   The Sprengel-tube i should be carefully cleaned and dried
before putting the apparatus together.
   The first time of using the distiller, it is interesting to
observe that, as the tube a b gradually becomes heated, the
surface air-film detaches itself from the glass and rises into
the bulb.
   The quantity of mercury distilled by an apparatus of the
size and form here described is about 2 lb. an hour: very
little gas is used, as the flames should be less than a quarter
of an inch high and never allowed to come in contact with the
glass bulb. For commercial purposes, an iron mercury-bottle
and iron gas-pipe might advantageously replace the glass bulb
and tube.
   It seems to be possible that the latter modification of the
method may be applicable to the distillation of some other
metals, such as zinc, magnesium, cadmium, arsenic, &c.
          III. On a Standard Tension-Galvanometer.
                    By E. H. M. Bosanquet.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       Gentlemen,
fTHENSION-galvanometers employ the small current flowing
 J- through a high resistance under a given difference of
potential as a measure of that difference of potential.
   In all cases, so far as I am aware, such instruments have
hitherto been standardized by comparison with normal voltaic
cells of some description, whose E.M.F. in volts is supposed
to be known ; such as Daniell's cell, or the cell of Latimer
Clark.
   This proceeding is liable to uncertainties, which may be
called gross when compared with other electrical measures.
    I propose to describe a form of tangent-galvanometer
for the measurement of tensions independently of any such
process of calibration. The accuracy depends only on the
usual measures of dimensions and the knowledge of the hori
zontal component of the earth's magnetism, as in the case of
the ordinary tangent-galvanometer, besides the measurement

 28                  Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on a
 of the resistance, a process capable of being executed with a
 very high degree of accuracy.
     The channel of the circle in the instrument I have con
 structed is exactly 1 metre in circumference, as measured by
 a thin wire lying close to the floor of the channel. In the
 channel 100 turns* of a very fine covered wire were wound,
 which was made to have a resistance of 10 ohms per metre (it
 is really somewhat more). The wire forms one layer and
 about half another. The thickness of the layer is very small,
 and it is assumed that the average length of each turn is
 exactly 1 metre. The resistance of the whole was compared
 with an old set of B.A. standards, and found to be 1175 B.A.
 units. For the present I use this number ; for purposes of
 great accuracy it would be reduced to ohms.
    The ordinary formula for the tangent-galvanometer gives
 for the current C,
                       C = ^tan0(in C.G.S.)                         (i.)
    Let V be the number of volts between the terminals,
         0 the number of ohms,
then

                       V = lO.O.?^tan0                            (iii.)
In the present case, putting

we find
                      log V =1-73136+ log tan 0;
whence a table can be constructed giving the number of volts
corresponding to a given deflection.
    For small deflections the number of degrees is somewhat
greater than the number of volts.
     Applying this standard galvanometer to determine the
 E.M.F. of two bichromate cells, whose resistance cm be prac
tically neglected, I found from 2'36 to 2-0 volts per cell,
according to the condition of the cells.
    The behaviour of a trough of nine Daniell's cells, when ex-
   * The turns were counted three times—once in winding on, once in

the process was begun again.

                 Standard Tension-Galvanometer.                  29
amined with the standard galvanometer, gave rise to a study
of some little interest, though the arrangement of the standard
is not specially suitable for the purpose.
    The cells in question are made up with sulphate of zinc and
sulphate of copper, and the porous cells are rather thick.
     When first made up, the tension between the poles was
                                   5*66 volts ;
after some hours,                  6-6      „

rose during the day to nearly 8              „
Then fell off, and for a day or two remained pretty constant
at about 6"6 volts.
     I now determined the resistance by Mance's method, and
the result was very singular. The resistance was variable,
increasing when the current flowed, from a minimum of a
 little less than 110 ohms to 250 and more. It required very
 quick action after making contact to test the resistance while
 below 110 ohms.
     I timed the change after the battery had rested some hours.
 It took 25 minutes for the resistance to rise to 200 ohms, and
 12 minutes more to reach 250. I then left the battery in
 action for two days, to see what the ultimate condition would
 be. The whole thing had then altered.
     Although the current had been flowing all the time, the
  resistance had diminished again, and was now about 95 ohms.
  It was apparently quite free from alteration.
      The following observations were made on successive days
  after the change. The E.M.F. had risen considerably. It
  appears probable that the sulphate of copper had penetrated
  into the zinc cell.

      The resistance had now become changeable again. It was
  less than 50 ohms when contact was first made, but increased
   and soon became greater.
      If we admit the Cambridge reduction of the B.A. unit to
  ohms, accepting the factor -987, the final numbers become
   somewhat reduced, the middle one becoming 1-114 volt per
   cell nearly.
      This last condition of the cells, after the sudden rise of

  30               Prof. Tait on Listing's Topologie.
  E.M.F. and fall of resistance, is the only one which appears
  to offer any constancy of conditions to speak of. It furnishes
  values which are not far from those generally accepted, but
  appears hardly to admit of sufficient certainty for a standard
  of tension.
             IV. Listing's Topologie. By Prof. Tait*.
                                [Plate II.]
  SOME of you may have been puzzled by the advertised
        title of this Address. But certainly not more puzzled
 than I was while seeking a title for it.
     I intend to speak (necessarily from a very elementary point
  of view) of those space-relations which are independent of
 measure, though not always of number, and of which perhaps
 the very best instance is afforded by the various convolutions
 of a knot on an endless string or wire. For, once we have tied
 a knot, of whatever complexity, on a string and have joined
 the free ends of the string together, we have an arrangement
 which, however its apparent form may be altered (as by
 teazing out, tightening, twisting, or flyping of individual
 parts), retains, until the string is again cut, certain perfectly
 definite and characteristic properties altogether independent
 of the relative lengths of its various convolutions.
    Another excellent example is supplied by Crum Brown's
 chemical Graphic Formulas. These, of course, do not pretend
 to represent the actual positions of the constituents of a com
pound molecule, but merely their relative connexion.
    From this point of view all figures, however distorted by
projection &c, are considered to be unchanged. We deal
with grouping (as in a quincunx), with motion by starts (as in
the chess-knightfs move), with the necessary relation among
numbers of intersections, of areas, and of bounding lines in a
plane figure; or among the numbers of corners, edges, faces,
and volumes of a complex solid figure, &c.
    For this branch of science there is at present no definitely
recognized title except that suggested by Listing, which I
have therefore been obliged to adopt. Geometrie der Lage has
now come, like the Geomdtrie de Position of Carnot, to mean
something very different from our present subject; and the
Geometria situs of Leibnitz, though intended (as Listing shows)
to have specially designated it, turned out, in its inventor's
hands, to be almost unconnected with it. The subject is one

of very great importance, and has been recognized as such by
many of the greatest investigators, including Gauss and others;
but each, before and after Listing's time, has made his sepa
rate contributions to it without any attempt at establishing a
connected account of it as an independent branch of science.
   It is time that a distinctive and unobjectionable name were
found for it; and once that is secured, there will soon be a
crop of Treatises. What is wanted is an erudite, not neces
sarily a very original, mathematician. The materials already
to hand are very numerous. But it is not easy (in English at
all events) to find a name for it without coining some alto
gether new word from Latin or Greek roots. Topology has a
perfectly definite meaning of its own, altogether unconnected
with our subject. Position, with our mathematicians at least,
has come to imply measure. Situation is not as yet so defi
nitely associated with measure; for we can speak of a situa
 tion to right or left of an object without inquiring Jiow far of.
 So that till a better term is devised, we may call our subject,
in our own language, the Science (not the Geometry, for that
 implies measure) of Situation.
    Listing^ to whom we owe the first rapid and elementary,
though highly suggestive, sketch of this science, as well as a
 developed investigation of one important branch of it, was in
many respects a remarkable man. It is to be hoped that
much may be recovered from his posthumous papers; for there
can be little doubt that in consequence of his disinclination to
 publish (a disinclination so strong that his best-known dis
 covery was actually published for him by another), what we
 know of his work is a mere fragment of the results of his long
 and active life.
    In what follows I shall not confine my illustrations to those
 given by Listing, though I shall use them freely ; but I shall
 also introduce such as have more prominently forced them
 selves on my own mind in connexion mainly with pure phy
 sical subjects. It is nearly a quarter of a century since I
 ceased to be a Professor of Mathematics; and the branches of
 that great science which I have since cultivated are especially
 those which have immediate bearing on Physics. But the
 subject before us is so extensive that, even with this restric
 tion, there would be ample material, in my own reading, for a
 whole series of strictly elementary lectures.
    I ought not to omit to say, before proceeding to our busi
 ness, that it is by no means creditable to British science to
 find that Listing's papers on this subject—the Vorstudien zur
 Topologie (Gottinger Studien, 1847), and Der Census raum-
 licker CompUxe (Gottinger Abhandlungen, 1861)—have not

yet been rescued from their most undeserved obscurity, and
published in an English dress, especially when so much that
is comparatively worthless, or at least not so worthy, has
already secured these honours. I was altogether ignorant of
the existence of the Vorstudien till it was pointed out to me by
Clerk-Maxwell, after I had sent him one of my earlier papers
on Knots; and I had to seek, in the Cambridge University
Library, what was perhaps the only then accessible copy.
   (1) Doum and Up are at once given us by gravity. They
are defined as the direction in which a stone falls, or in which
a plummet hangs, and its reverse. Even below-decks, when
the vessel is lying over under a steady breeze, and we " have
our sea-legs on," we instinctively keep our' bodies vertical,
without any thought of setting ourselves perpendicular to the
cabin-floor. And this definition holds in every region of space
where the earth's attraction is the paramount force. In an
imaginary cavity at the earth's centre the terms would cease
to have any meaning.
   East, in the sense ot "Orient," is the quarter in which the
sun rises; and this distinction is correct all over the earth
except at the poles, where it has no meaning. But if we
were to define South as the region in which the sun is seen at
midday, our definition would be always wrong if we were
placed beyond the tropic of Capricorn, and at particular seasons
even if we were merely beyond that of Cancer. Still there is
a certain consensus of opinion which enables all to understand
what is meant by South without the need of any formal defi
nition.
   But the distinction between Right and Left is still more dif
ficult to define. We must employ some such artifice as "A
man's right side is that which is turned eastwards, when he
lies on his face with his head to the north." For, in the lapse
of ages of development, one may perhaps be right in saying,
with Moliere's physician, "Nov* avons change" tout cela; and
men's hearts may have migrated by degrees to the other side
of their bodies, as does one of the eyes of a growing flounder.
Or some hitherto unsuspected superiority of left-handed men
may lead to their sole survival; and then the definition of the
right hand, as that which the majority of men habitually em
ploy most often, would be false.
   I will not speak further of these things, which I have intro
duced merely to show how difficult it sometimes is to formulate
precisely in words what every one in his senses knows per
fectly well; and thus to prepare you to expect difficulties of a
higher order, even in the very elements of matters not much
more recondite.

                   Prof. Tait on Listing's Topologie.                 33
     (2) But there is a very simple method of turning a man's
 right hand into his left, and vice versa, and of shifting his heart
 to the right-hand side, without waiting for the (problematical)
 results of untold ages of development or evolution. We have
 only to look at him with the assistance of a plane mirror
 or looking-glass, and those extraordinary transformations are
instantly effected. Behind the looking-glass the world and
every object in it are perverted (yerkehrt, as Listing calls it).
 Seen through an astronomical telescope, every thing is
inverted merely (umgekehrt). Particular cases of this distinc
tion, which is of very considerable importance, were of course
known to the old geometers. For two halves of a circle are
congruent ; one semicircle has only to be made to rotate
through two right angles in its own plane to bo superpo-
sable on the other. But how about the halves of an isosceles
triangle formed by the bisector of the angle between the equal
sides ? They are equal in every respect except congruency;
one has to be turned over before it can be exactly superposed on
the other.
    Listing gives many examples of this distinction, of which
the following is tbe simplest:—
        Inversion:—(English) V and (Greek) A.
        Perversion:—(English) Pi and (Russian) JT.
        Inversion and perversion:—(English) L and (Greek) T.
    He also gives an elaborate discussion of the different rela
tive situations of two dice wbose edges are parallel, taking
account of the points on the various sides.
    When we flype a glove (as in taking it off when very wet,
or as we skin a hare), we perform an operation which (not de-
scribable in English by any shorter phrase than " tumimj out
side in") changes its character from a right-hand glove to a
left. A pair of trousers or a so-called reversible waterproof
coat is, after this operation has been performed, still a pair of
trousers or a coat, but the legs or arms are interchanged ;
unless the garments, like those of " Paddius & Corko," are
buttoned behind*.
    (3) The germ of the whole of this part of the subject lies in
the two ways in which we can choose the three rectangular
axes of x, y, z; and is intimately connected with the kinema-
tical theory of rotation of a solid.
    Thus we can make the body rotate through two right angles
   * When a Treatise comes to be written (in English) on this science,
great care will have to be taken in exactly defining the sensos in which
such words as inversion, reversion, perversion, &c. are to be employed.
There is much danger of confusion unless authoritative definitions be
given once for all, and not too late.
   Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 17. No. 103. Jan. 1884.                 D

about one axis, so that each of the other two is inverted. Such
an operation does not change their relative situation.
    But to invert one only, or all three, of the axes requires that
the body should (as it were) be pulled through itself, a process
perfectly conceivable from the kinematical, but not from the
physical point of view. By this process the relative situation
of the axes is changed.
    When we think of the rotation about the axis of x which
shall bring Oy where Qz was, we see that it must be of oppo
site character in these two cases. And it is a mere matter of
convention which of the two systems we shall choose as our
normal or positive one.
    That which seems of late to have become the more usual is
that in which a quadrantal rotation about x (which may be
any one of the three) shall change Oy into the former 0~ (i. e.
in the cyclical order x, y, z), when it is applied in the sense in
which the earth turns about the northern end of its polar axis.
Thus we may represent the three axes, in cyclical order, by a
northward, an upward, and an eastward line. So that we
change any one into its cyclical successor by seizing the
positive end of the third, and, as it were, unscrewing through
a quadrant*.
    The hands of a watch, looked at from the side on which
the face is situated, thus move round in the negative direc
tion; but if we could see through the watch, they would appear
to move round in the positive direction. This universally
 employed construction arises probably from watch-dials having
 been originally made to behave as much as possible like sun
 dials, on which the hours follow the apparent daily course of
 the sun, t. e. the opposite direction to that of the earth's rota
tion about its axis.
     (4) This leads us into another very important elementary
 branch of our subject, one in which Listing (it is to be
 feared) introduced complication rather than simplification, by
 his endeavours to extricate the botanists from the frightful
 chaos in which they had involved themselves by their irrecon
 cilable descriptions of vegetable spirals. [He devotes a good
 many pages to showing how great was this confusion.]
     When we compare the tendrils of a hop with those of a
  vine, we see that while they both grow upwards, as in coiling
  themselves round a vertical pole, the end of the hop tendril goes
     • These relations, and many which follow, were illustrated by models,
  not by diagrams ; and the reader who wishes fully to comprehend them
  will find no reason to grudge the little trouble involved in constructing
  such models for himself.

 round vnth t/ie sun (secundum solem), that of the vine tendril
 against the sun (contra soleni).
    Thus the vine tendril forms an ordinary or (as we call it)
 right-handed screw, the hop tendril a left-handed screw.
    Now, if a point move in a circle in the plane of yz in the
 positive direction, and if the circle itself move in the direction
 of x positive, the resultant path of the point will be a vine-, or
 right-handed screw. But if the circle's motion as a whole, or
 the motion of the point in the circle, be reversed, we have a
 left-handed screw; while if both be reversed, it remains right-
 handed. Every one knows the combination of the rotatory
 and translator^ motions involved in the use of an ordinary
 corkscrew; but there are comparatively few who know that a
 screw is the same at either end—that it has, in fact, what is
 called dipolar symmetry.
    With a view to assist the botanists, Listing introduced a
 fancied resemblance between the threads of the two kinds of
 (double-threaded) screws and the Greek letters \ and S, for
 the latter of which he also proposed the long /used as a sign of
integration; thus A.WA. and 55SS, orffff-
   The first, which is our vino- or right-handed screw, he calls
from his point of view (which is taken in the axis of the screw)
laeotrop, the other dexiotrop. He also proposes to describe
them as lambda- or delta- Windungen. But it is clear that all
this " makes confusion worse confounded." Every one knows
an ordinary screw. It is right-handed or positive. Hence he
can name, at a glance, any vegetable or other helix.
   (5) A symmetrical solid of revolution, an ellipsoid for
instance (whether prolate or oblate), has, if at rest, dipolar
symmetry. But if it rotate about its axis, wo can at once
distinguish one end of the axis from the other, and there is
dipolar asymmetry.
   This distinction is dynamical as well as kinematical, as every
one knows who is conversant with gyroscopes or gyrostats.
   A flat spiral spring, such as a watch- or clock-spring, or
the gong of an American clock, if the inner coils be pulled
out to one side, becomes a right-handed screw; if to the other,
a left-handed screw. In either case it retains the dipolar
symmetry which it had at first, while plane.
   But when we pass an electric current round a circle of
wire, we at once give it dipolar asymmetry. The current
appears, from the one side, to be going round in the positive
direction; from the other, in the negative. This is, in fact,
the point of Ampere's explanation of magnetism.
   A straight wire heated at one end has dipolar asymmetry,

not only because of the different temperatures of its ends, but
because of the differences of their electric potential (due to the
"Thomson effect").
    The same is generally true of every vector (or directed)
 quantity, such as a velocity, a force, a flux, an axis of rota
tion, &c.
     (6) An excellent example of our science is furnished by
 the Quincunx, which is the basis of the subject of Pliyllotaxis
 in botany, as well as of the arrangement of scales on a fish.
     A quincunx (from the scientific point of view) is merely
 the system of points of intersection of two series of equidistant
 parallel lines in the same plane. By a simple shear parallel
 to one of the two series of lines, combined (if necessary)
 with mere uniform extensions or contractions along either or
 both series, any one quincunx can be changed into any other.
 Hence the problems connected with the elements of the sub
 ject are very simple; for it follows from the above statements
 that any quincunx can be reduced to square order. The
 botanist who studies the arrangement of buds or leaf-stalks
 on a stem, or of the scales on a fir-cone, seeks the fundamental
  spiral, as he calls it, that on which all the buds or scales lie.
  And he then fully characterizes each particular arrangement
  by specifying whether this spiral is a right- or left-handed
  screw, and what is its divergence. The divergence is the angle
  (taken as never greater than it) of rotation about the axis of
  the fundamental spiral from one bud or scale to the next.
      (7) It is clear that if the stem or cone (supposed cylin
  drical) were inked and rolled on a sheet of paper, a quincunx
  (Plate II. fig. 1) would be traced, consisting of continuously
  repeated (but, of course, perverted} impressions of the whole
  surface. Hence if A, Aj be successive prints of the same scale,
  B a scale which can be reached from A by a right-handed spiral,
  A B, of m steps, or by a left-handed spiral, Aj B, of n steps,
   these two spirals being so chosen that all the scales lie on n
   spirals parallel to A B and also on m spirals parallel to Aj B,
   we shall find a scale of the fundamental spiral by seeking the
   scale nearest to A A, within the space A B Ax.
      Here continued fractions perforce come in. Let            v be
   the last convergent to m / n. Then, if it be greater than m / n,
   count p, leaves or scales from A along A B, and thence v
   leaves or scales parallel to B A,, and we arrive at the required
   leaf or scale. If the last convergent be less than m/ n, count
   v leaves along Ax B, and thence fi parallel to B A. If the
   leaf, a, so found in either case, be nearer to A than to Aj, the
   fundamental spiral (as printed, i. e. perverted) is right-handed;
   and vice versa. Thus the first criterion is settled.

                   Prof. Tait on Listing's Topologie.              37
     To find the divergence, take the case of fi / v greater than
  m J n; and a, so found, nearer to A than to Aj. Draw a c per
  pendicular to A Aj, and let the spirals through a, parallel to
  B A and B Aj respectively, cut A A, in d and e. Then the
  divergence is 2irAc / AAX. This is obviously greater than
  27rArf / A Aj (%. e. 2irv / n), and less than 2irAe / A A1 (i. e.
  2irn/m); and can be altered by shearing the diagram parallel
  to A Ai, or (what comes to the same thing) twisting the stem
  or cone. To find its exact value, draw through B a line per
  pendicular to AAX (i. e. parallel to the axis of the stem or cone),
  and let C, the first leaf or scale it meets, be reached from B by
  r steps along B A, followed by s steps parallel to B Ax. Then
  the divergence is easily seen to be 2ir(/j.s + vr) / (ms + nr);
  and we have the complete description of the object, so far as
 our science goes.
     In the figure, which is taken from an ordinary cone of
 Pinus pinaster, we have w = 5, n=8; whence fi=2, v=3.
 Also r=3, «=2; and the fundamental spiral (perverted) is
 therefore right-handed, with divergence 2ir 13/34.
     Should m and n have a common divisor p, it is easily seen
 that the leaves are arranged in whorls; and, instead of one
 fundamental spiral, there is a group of p such spirals, forming
 a multiple-threaded screw. Each is to be treated by a process
 similar to that above.
    (8) The last statement hints at a subject treated by Listing,
 which he calls paradromie winding. Some of his results are
 very curious and instructive.
    Take a long narrow tape or strip of paper. Give it any
 number, m, of half-twists, then bend it round and paste its
 ends together.
    If in be zero, or any other even number, the two-sided sur
 face thus formed has two edges, which are paradromie. If
 the strip be now slit up midway between the edges, it will be
 split into two. These have each m/2 full twists, like the ori
ginal, and (except when there is no twist, when of course the
two can be separated) are m/2 times linked together.
    But if m be odd, there is but one surface and one edge ; so
that we may draw a line on the paper from any point of the
original front of the strip to any point of the back, without
crossing the edge. Hence, when the strip is slit up midway, it
remains one, but with m full twists, and (if m> 1) it is knotted.
It becomes, in fact, as its single edge was before slitting, a
paradromie knot, a double clear coil with in crossings.
    [This simple result of Listing's was the sole basis of an
elaborate pamphlet which a few years ago had an extensive
sale in Vienna; its object being to show how to perform (without

38              Prof. Tait on Listing's Topologie.
the usual conjuror's or spiritualist's deception) the celebrated
trick of tying a knot on an endless cord.]
   The study of the one-sided autotomic surface which is gene
rated by increasing indefinitely the breadth of the paper band,
in cases where m is odd, is highly interesting and instructive.
But wo must get on.
   (9) I may merely mention, in passing, as instances of our
subject, the whole question of the Integral Curvature of a
closed plane curve; with allied questions such as " In an
assigned walk through the streets of Edinburgh, how often
has one rotated relatively to some prominent object, such as
St. Giles' (supposed within the path) or Arthur's Seat (sup
posed external to it)?" We may vary the question by sup
posing that he walks so as always to turn his face to a
particular object, and then enquire how often he has turned
about his own axis. But here we tread on Jellinger Symonds'
ground, the won-rotation of the moon about her axis !
   But the subject of the area of an autotomic plane curve is
interesting. It is one of Listing's examples. De Morgan,
W. Thomson, and others in this country have also developed
it as a supposed new subject. But its main principles (as
Muir has shown in Phil. Mag. June 1873) were given by
Meistor 113 years ago. It is now so well known that I need
not dilate upon it.
   (10) A curious problem, which my colleague Chrystal re
cently mentioned to me, appears to be capable of adaptation
as a good example of our subject. It was to this effect :—
   Draw the circle of least area which includes four given points
in one plane.
   In this form it is a question of ordinary geometry. But we
may modify it as follows:—
    Given three points in a plane; divide the whole surface into
regions sxicli that wherever in any one of those regions a fourth
point be chosen, the rulefor constructing the least circle surround
ing the four shall he the same.
   There are two distinct cases (with a transition case which
 may bo referred to either), according as the given points A,
 B, C (suppose) form an acute- or an obtuse-angled triangle.
    (a) When ABC is acute-angled (fig. 2). Draw from the
 ends of each side perpendiculars towards the quarter where the
 triangle lies, and produce each of them indefinitely from the
 point in which it again intersects the circumscribing circle
    The circle A B C is itself the required one, so long as D
 (the fourth point) lies within it.
    If D lie hetween perpendiculars drawn (as above) from the
 ends of a side, as A B, then A B D is the required circle.

                  Prof. Tait on Listing's Topologie.             39
   If it lie in any other region, the required circle has D for one
extremity of a diameter, and the most distant of A, B, 0 for
the other.
   (8) When there is an obtuse angle, at C say (fig. 3). Make
the same construction as before, but, in addition, describe the
circle whose diameter is A B. All is as before, except that
A B is the circle required, if D lie within it ; and that if D lie
within the middle portion of the larger of the two lunes formed
the required circle is A B D.
   [In figs. 2, 3, 4, which refer to these two casos in order, and
to the intermediate case in which the triangle is right-angled at
C, each region is denoted by three or by two letters. When
there are three, the meaning is that the required circle passes
through the corresponding points; when there are but two,
these are the ends of a diameter. The separate regions are,
throughout, bounded by full lines; the dotted lines merely
indicate constructions.]
   (11) A very celebrated question, directly connected with
our subject, is to make a Knight (at chess) move to each square
on the board once only till it returns to its original position.
From the time of Euler onwards numerous solutions have been
given. To these I need not refer further.
   A much simpler question is the motion of a Rook, and to this
the lately celebrated American " 15-puzzlo " is easily reduced.
For any closed path of a rook contains an even number of
squares, since it must pass from white to black alternately.
 [This furnishes a good instance of the ext reme simplicity which
often characterizes the solutions of questions in our subject
which, at first sight, appear formidable.] And in the American
 puzzle every piece necessarily moves like a rook. Hence if an
even number of interchanges of pieces will give the required
result, the puzzle can be solved; if not, the arrangement is
irreducible.
   (12) A few weeks ago, in a railway-train, I saw the follow
ing problem proposed:—Place four sovereigns and four shil
lings in close alternate order in a line. Bequired, in four
moves, each of two contiguous pieces (without altering the rela
tive position of the two), to form a continuous line of four
sovereigns followed by four shillings. Let sovereigns be re
presented by the letter B, shillings by A.
   One solution is as follows:—
       Before starting:— . .ABABABAB
          1st move            BAABABA. .B
          2nd „               BAAB. .AABB
          3rd „               B. .BAAAABB
          4th „               BBBBAAAA . .

40              Prof. Tait on Listing's Topologie.
   If we suppose the pieces to be originally arranged in cir
cular order, with two contiguous blank spaces, the law of
this process is obvious. Operate always with the penultimate
and antepenultimate, the gap being looked on as the end for
the time being. With this hint it is easy to generalize, so
as to get the nature of the solution of the corresponding
problem in any particular case, whatever be the number of
coins. It is also interesting to vary the problem by making it
a condition that the two coins to be moved at any instant shall
first be made to change places.
   (13) Another illustration, commented on by Listing, but
since developed from a different point of view in a quite
unexpected direction, was originated by a very simple ques
tion propounded by Clausen in the Astronomische Nachrichten
(No. 4!)4). In its general form it is merely the question,
" What is the smallest number of penstrokes with which a
given figure, consisting of lines only, can be traced ? " No
line is to be gone over twice, and every time the pen has to be
lifted counts one.
   The obvious solution is:—Count the number of points in
the figure at each of which an odd number of lines meet.
There must always be an even number of such (zero included).
Half of this number is the number of necessary separate
strokes (except in the zero case, when the number of course
must be unity). Thus the boundaries of the squares of a chess
board can bo traced at 14 separate pen-strokes; the usual
figure for Euclid I. 47 at 4 pen-strokes; and fig. 5 at one.
   (14) But, if 2n points in a plane be joined by 3» lines, no
two of which intersect; so that every point is a terminal of
3 different lines, the figure requires n separate pen-strokes. It
has been shown that in this case (unless the points be divided
into two groups, between which there is but one connecting
line, fig. 7) the 3n lines may be divided into 3 groups of n
each, such that one of each group ends at each of the 2n points.
See fig. 6, in which the lines are distinguished as a, /3, or 7.
Also note that ct ft a ft &c, and ay ay &c. form entire cycles
passing through all the trivia, while (Sy fiy &c. breaks up into
detached subcycles.
   Thus, if a Labyrinth or Maze be made, such that every inter
section of roads is a Trivium, it may always be arranged so
that the several roads meeting at each intersection may be
one a grass-path, one gravel, and the other pavement. To
make sure of getting out of such a Labyrinth (if it be pos
sible) , we must select two kinds of road to be taken alter
nately at each successive trivium. Thus wo may elect to take
grass, gravel, grass, gravel, &c, in which case we must either

                 Prof. Tait on Listing's Topologie.           41
 come to the exit point or (without reaching it) return to our
 starting-point, to try a new combination. For it is obvious
 that, if we follow our rule, we cannot possibly pass through
 the same trivium twice before returning to our starting-point.
    (15) This leads to a very simple solution of the problem
 of Map-colouring with four colours, originally proposed by
 Guthrie, and since treated by Cayley, Kempe, and others.
    The boundaries of the counties in a map generally meet
 in threes. But if four, or more, meet at certain points, let
 a small county be inserted surrounding each such point; and
 there will then be trivia of boundaries only. These various
boundaries may, by our last result, be divided (usually in
many different ways) into three categories, a, /?, 7 suppose,
such that each trivium is formed by the meeting of one
from each category. Now take four colours, A, B, C, D, and
apply them, according to rule, as follows; so that
                a separates A and B or C and D,
                /S    „      A and C „ B and D,
                7     „      A and D „ B and C,
and the thing is done. For the small counties, which were
introduced for the sake of the construction, may now be made
to contract without limit till the boundaries become as they
were at first.
   The connexion between these two theorems gives an excel
lent illustration of the principle involved in the reduction of a
biquadratic equation to a cubic.
   Kempe has pointed out that four colours do not in general
suffice lor a map drawn upon a multiply-connected surface,
such as that of a tore or anchor-ring. This you can easily
prove for yourselves by establishing one simple instance. (This
is an example of a case of Listing's Cenms.)
    (16) From the very nature of our science, the systems of
trivia, as we described them in § 14, may be regarded as mere
distorted plane projections of pohjhedra which have trihedral
summits only. There are two obvious classes of exceptions,
which will be at once understood from the simple figures 7
and 8. Their characteristic is that parts of the figure con
taining closed circuits (i. e. faces of the polyhedron) are con
nected to the rest by one or by two lines (edges) only. The
lines are always 3n in number, and, excluding only the first
class of exceptions, can be marked in 3 groups a, y8, 7, one
of each group ending at each point (trihedral angle).
   Now in every one of the great variety of cases which I
have tried (where the figure was, like fig. 6, a projection of a
true polyhedron) I have found that a complete circuit of edges,

  42                Prof. Tait on Listing's Topologie.
  alternately of two of these groups (such as a/3 a/3 &c.) can be
  found, usually in many ways, so as to exhaust both groups
  and pass once through each of the angles. That is, in another
  form, every such polyhedron may bo projected in a figure
  of the type shown in fig. 9, where the dotted lines are sup
  posed to lie belew the full linos. But, in the words of the
  extraordinary mathematician Kirkman, whom I consulted on
 the subject, " the theorem .... has this provoking interest,
 that it mocks alike at doubt and proof"*. Probably the
 proof of this curious proposition has (§ 11) hitherto escaped
 detection from its sheer simplicity. Habitual stargazers are
 apt to miss the beauties of the more humble terrestrial objects.
     (17) Kirkman himself was the first to show, so long ago as
 1858, that a " clear circle of edges " of a unique type passes
 through all the summits of a pentagonal dodecahedron. Then
 Hamilton pounced on the result and made it the foundation
 of his Icosian Game, and also of a new calculus of a very
 singular kind. See figures 9, 10, 11, which are all equivalent
 projections of a pentagonal dodecahedron.
   At every trivium you must go either to right or to left. Denote
these operations by r and / respectively. In the pentagonal
 dodecahedron, start where you will, either r8 or Is brings you
 back to whence you started. Thus, in this case, r and I are
to be regarded as operational symbols—each (in a sense) a
fifth root, of + 1 . In this notation Kiikman's Theorem is
formulated by the expression
                         rlrlrrrlllrlrlrrrlll= 1 ;
or, as we may write it more compactly,
                 [(rOW]*=l, or [(/r)W]2=l.
It may be put in a great many apparently different, but really
equivalent, forms; for, so long as the order of the operations is
unchanged, wo may begin the cycle where we please. Also
we may, of course, interchange r and / throughout, in conse
quence of the symmetry of the figure.
    It is curious to study, in such a case as this, where it can
easily be done, the essential nature of the various kinds of
necessarily abortive attempts to get out of such a labyrinth.
Thus if we go according to such routes as (rVflrP, or r3/r3
(sequences which do not occur in the general cycle), the next
step, whatever it be, brings us to a point already passed through.
We thus obtain other relations between the symbols r and I.
We can make special partial circuits of this kind, including
any number of operations from 7 up to 19.

   All of these remarks will be obvious from any one of the
three (equivalent) diagrams 9, 10, or 11.
    (18) As I have already s:iid, the subject of knots affords
one of the most typical applications of our science. I had
been working at it for some time, in consequence of Thom
son's admirable idea of Vortex-atoms, before Clerk-Maxwell
referred me to Listing's Essay ; and I had made out for
myself, though by methods entirely different from those of
 Listing, all but one of his published results. Listing's re
marks on this fascinating branch of the subject are, unfortu
nately, very brief ; and it is here especially, I hope, that we
shall learn much from his posthumous papers. In the Vor-
studien he looks upon knots simply from the point of view of
screwing or winding ; and he designates the angles at a
crossing of two laps of the cord by the use of his A. and 8
notation (§ 4). Fig. 12 will show the nature of such cross
ings. Figs. 13, 14, and 15 show what he calls reducible and
 reduced knots. In a reducible knot the angles in some com
 partments at least are not all \ or all 8 (the converse is not
 necessarily true). In a reduced knot, each compartment is
 all \ or all 8.
     (19) My first object was to classify the simpler forms of
 knots, so as to find to what degree of complexity of knotting
 we should have to go to obtain a special form of knotted
 vortex for each of the known elements. Hence it was neces
 sary to devise a mode of notation, by means of which any
 knot could be so fully described that it might, from the de
 scription alone, be distinguished from all others, and (if
 requisite) constructed in cord or wire.
     This I obtained, in a manner equally simple and sufficient,
 from the theorem which follows, and which (to judge from
 sculptured stones, engraved arabesques, &c.) must have been
 at least jrraeticalhj known for very many centuries.
     Any closed plane curve, which has double points only, may
  be looked upon as the projection of a knot in which each portion
 of the cord passes alternately under and over the successive laps
 it meets. [The same is easily seen to hold for any number of
 self-intersecting, and mutually intersecting, closed plane
  curves, in which cases we have in general both linking and
  locking in addition to knotting.]
     The proof is excessively simple (§ 11). If both ends of
  one continuous line lie on the same side of a second line, there
  must be an even number of crossings.
     (20) To apply it, go continuously round the projection of
  a knot (fig. 16), putting A, B, 0, &c. at the first, third, fifth,
  &c. crossing you pass, until you have put letters to all.

 44             Prof. Tait on Listing's Topologie.
 Then go round again, writing down the name of each crossing
 in the order in which you reach it. The list will consist of
 each letter employed, taken twice over. A, B, C, &c. will
 occupy, in order, the first, third, fifth, &c. places ; but the
 way in which these letters occur in the even places fully charac
 terizes the drawing of the projected knot. It may therefore
 be described by the order of the letters in the even places
 alone ; and it does not seem possible that any briefer descrip
 tion could be given.
    To prove that this description is complete, so far as the
 projection is concerned, all that is required is to show that
 from it we can at once construct the diagram. Thus let it
 be, as in fig. 16,EFBACD. Then the full statement is
 AEBFCBDAECFD/A&c.
    (21) To draw from such a statement, choose in it two
 apparitions of the same letter, between which no other letter
 appears twice. Thus A E C F D / A (at the end of the state
 ment) forms such a group. It must form a loop of the curve.
 Draw such a loop, putting A at the point where the ends
 cross, and the other letters in order (either way) round the
 loop. Proceed to fill in the rest of the cycle in the same
 way. The figures thus obtained may present very different
 appearances ; but they are all projections of the same definite
 knot. The only further information we require for its full
 construction is which branch passes over the other at each par
ticular crossing. This can be at once supplied by a + or —
sign attached to each letter where it occurs in the statement
of the order in the even places.
    (22) Furnished with this process, we find that it becomes
 a mere question of skilled labour to draw all the possible
knots having any assigned number of crossings. The re
quisite labour increases with extreme rapidity as the number
of crossings is increased. For we must take every possible
arrangement of the letters in the even places, and try whether
it is compatible with the properties of a self-intersecting plane
curve. Simple rules for rejecting useless or impracticable
combinations are easily formed. But then wo have again to
go through the list of survivors, and reject all but one of each
of tho numerous groups of different distortions of one and the
same species of knot.
   I have not been able to find time to carry out this process
further than the knots with seven crossings. But it is very
remarkable that, so far as I have gone, the number of knots
of each class belongs to the series of powers of 2. Thus.:
             Number of crossings . . 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
             Number of distinct forms 1, 1, 2, 4, b.

                Prof. Tait on Listing's Topologie.             45
It is greatly to be desired that some one, with the requisite
leisure, should try to extend this list, if possible up to 11, as
the next prime number. The labour, great as it would be,
would not bear comparison with that of the calculation of ir
to 600 places, and it would certainly be much more useful.
   Besides, it is probable that modern methods of analysis
may enable us (by a single " happy thought " as it were) to
avoid the larger part of the labour. It is in matters like this
 that we have the true " raison d'etre " of mathematicians.
   (23) There is one very curious point about knots which,
so far as I know, has as yet no analogue elsewhere. In
general the perversion of a knot (i. e. its image in a plane
mirror) is non-congruent with the knot itself. Thus, as in
fact Listing points out, it is impossible to change even the
simple form (fig. 14) into its image (fig. 15). But I have
shown that there is at least one form, for every even number
of crossings, which is congruent with its own perversion.
The unique form with four crossings gave me the first hint
of this curious fact. Take one of the larger laps of fig. 17,
and turn it over the rest of the knot, fig. 18 (which is the
perversion) will be produced.
   We see its nature better from the following process (one of
an infinite number) for forming Amphicheiral knots. Knot
a cord as in fig. 19, the number of complete figures of
" eight " being at pleasure. Turn the figure upside down,
and it is seen to be merely its own image. Hence, when the
ends are joined, it forms a knot which is congruent with its
own perversion.
   (24) The general treatment of links is, unless the separate
cords bo also knotted, much simpler than that of knots—t. e.
the measurement of belinkedness is far easier than that of
beknottedne&s.
   I believo the explanation of this curious result to lie mainly
in the fact that it is possible to interweave three or more con
tinuous cords, so that they cannot be separated, and yet no one
shall be knotted, nor any two linked together.
   This is obvious at once from the simplest possible case,
shown in fig. 20. Here the three rings are not linked but
locked together.
   Now mere linkings and mere lockings are very easy to
study. But the various loops of a knot may be linked or
 locked with one another. Thus the full study of a knot re
quires in general the consideration of linking and locking
also.
   (25) But it is time to close, in spite of the special interest
of this part of the subject. And I have left myself barely

46                     Prof. R. Clausins on the
time to mention the very interesting portion of the Topologie
which Listing worked out in detail. You will find a brief
synopsis of a part of it prefixed to Clerk-Maxwell's ' Elec
tricity and Magnetism,' and Cayley has contributed an ele
mentary statement of its contents to the ' Messenger of Mathe
matics ' for 1873; but there can be no doubt that so important
a paper as the Census raumlicher Complete ought to be trans
lated into English.
   To give an exceedingly simple notion of its contents I may
merely say that Listing explains and generalizes the so-called
Theorem of Euler about Polyhedra (which all of us, whose
reading dates some twenty years back or more, remember in
Snowball's or Hymers' 'Trigonometry '), viz. that "if S be
the number of solid angles of a polyhedron, F the number of
its faces, and E the number of its edges, then
                            S + F=E + 2."
   The mysterious 2 in this formula is shown by Listing to
be the number of spaces involved ; i. e. the content of the
polyhedron, and the Amplexum, the rest of infinite space.
   And he establishes a perfectly general relation of the
form
                          V-S + L-P=0,
where V is the number of spaces, S of surfaces, L of lines,
and P of points in any complex ; these numbers having pre
viously been purged in accordance with the amount of Cyclosis
in the arrangement studied. But to make even the elements
of this intelligible I should require to devote at least one
whole lecture to them.
   Meanwhile I hope I have succeeded in showing to you
how very important is our subject, loose and intangible as it
may have at first appeared to you; and in proving, if only by
special examples, that there are profound difficulties (of a kind
different altogether from those usually attacked) which are to be
met with even on the very threshold of the Science of Situation.

that it has been attempted to express by mathematical for
mulae the processes which take place in them. The formulae
hitherto applied do not seem to me quite to fulfil this object:
either they rest on a theoretically imperfect basis, or they are
too incomplete to account for all the circumstances which are
to be taken into consideration. In what follows I venture to
give a somewhat more complete theoretical explanation.
       § 1. Essential parts of Dynamo-electrical Machines.
    The dynamo machines which have hitherto been constructed
are very different in their external forms, but in principle
they vary little from each other; and I think, that of the
machines for direct currents, those of Gramme and Siemens
may be regarded as typical. These also are so similar to each
other in their action, that in so far as concerns the develop
ment of the fundamental formulae they need not be treated
 separatel}', but may be comprised in one common treatment.
    To the essential parts belong, first of all, a fixed electro
 magnet with large pole-pieces, or a combination of several
 fixed electromagnets whose like poles are joined by pieces of
 iron, and are thereby provided with common pole-pieces. In
 considering the question, it is not necessary to discriminate
 between the cases in which the magnets have only one, from
 those in which they have several electromagnets; and wherever
 one fixed electromagnet is spoken of in the sequel, we under
 stand that it also applies to a combination of several fixed
 electromagnets.
     In the space between the poles of the fixed electromagnet
 is the rotating electromagnet. In Gramme's machine this
 has the form of the ring originally devised by Pacinotti, and
 consists either of a solid iron ring, or, what is now usual, one
 formed of iron wire, round which the insulated conducting
 wire is coiled in a spiral. In Siemens' machine it consists of
 an iron drum, on the surface only of which the conducting
 wire is coiled. We will consider separately the two parts, the
  wire coiled and the iron core. It is essential for the former
  that it shall rotate, and we shall speak of it as the rotating coil
  (drehbare Umicickelung); and the latter, which need not rotate
 with the coil (which is better so far as the action is concerned,
  though more difficult to effect in ¦practice), we shall speak of
  as the iron core of the rotating coil.
     The rotating coil is divided into several portions in conduct
  ing communication with each other, which is effected by con
  necting the end of one and the beginning of the next division
  with a metal strip. These metal strips are so placed near each
  other that, without being in metallic contact, they form together

 48                   Prof. R. Clausius on the
  a cylinder which rotates with the rotating coil ; on this press
  two contact-springs or brushes, which form the beginning and
  the end of that part of the conductor which comprises the coil
  of the fixed electromagnet and the outer circuit. By means
 of the brushes the rotating coil is divided in each position into
  two halves which form two branches of the whole circuit ; so
  that the electric current, which passes through the rotating
 coil from one brush to the other, divides into two halves, which
 bifurcate from the one brush and unite again at the other.
     The iron core of the rotating coil is magnetized in a twofold
 manner. On the one hand it forms between the poles of the
 fixed electromagnet an armature which does not quite touch
 the poles, though it comes very near; and by the action of the
 fixed electromagnet it is so magnetized that to each pole of
 the fixed electromagnet the opposite pole of the iron core is
 presented. In order briefly to express the latter, we may say
 that the axis of the magnetism produced in the iron core is in
 the opposite direction to the axis of the fixed electromagnet.
 On the other hand, the iron core is magnetized by the electric
 current which flows from one brush to the other. The brushes
 are so arranged that the axis of the magnetism produced by
 this force is approximately at right angles to the axis of that
 which is produced by the first magnetism. A magnetism
 results from the combination of those two actions, the axis of
 which is oblique in reference to the directions just mentioned.
 If the iron core rotates, its poles retain a fixed position in
 space, while in the iron core they continually change their
direction.
    The inductive action which takes place in the rotating coil
during the rotation is of a threefold character. In the first
place, the fixed electromagnet acts inductively upon the rota
ting coil. In the second place, the magnetized iron core of
the rotating coil, whose poles retain their position in space as
long as the coil rotates, exerts an inductive action upon the
latter. And, lastly, the current in the coil, which changes its
direction in those parts which pass by the brushes, exerts at
any rate a partially inductive influence on the coil.
                      § 2. Law of Induction.
    In order to establish the law of induction which we shall
apply in the sequel, we must consider somewhat more closely
the currents and conductors with which we are dealing.
    The rotating coil, and that of the fixed electromagnet, con
sist of several windings; and these windings are so close that
it makes little difference for each individual winding, and for
each group of windings, if we suppose that their end, instead

of being connected with the beginning of the following wind
ing, or of the following group, is connected with its own
beginning. The rotating coil and the fixed circuit may ac
cordingly be regarded as systems of closed conductors. In
respect of the magnetism of the masses of iron, we may, as is
well known, consider the electrodynamic action of magnets as
made up of innumerable small closed currents, and can deter
mine their action. We are therefore only concerned with tlie
actions of closed currents on closed conductors, by which the
discussion is greatly simplified, and at the same time rendered
more certain ; for the laws of induction which hold for closed
currents and conductors may be regarded as being firmly
established, while differences of opinion still prevail as to the
action exerted by unclosed portions of currents on unclosed
portions of conductors.
   The statement of the law of induction is greatly simplified by
applying the electrodynamic potential of the effective currents
on the conductors supposed to be traversed by the unit of cur
rent. Given a system of closed currents which exist in the
conductors s, «j, s2, &c, and are of the strengths ?', fj, i2, and,
further, a closed conductor which we suppose traversed by
unit current. Suppose, then, that ds is an element of any
one of the conductors s, «x, s2, &c, that dcr is an element of
the conductor a, while (scr) is the angle between the directions
of the two elements, and r their mutual distance, the electro
dynamic potential W of the given system, on the current of
unit strength in the conductor <r, is defined by the equation
                     W-fp2^A*;                                  (1)
in which one integral is to be extended to the series of con
ductors s, s-i, s2, &c, and the other to the conductor cr.
   It is presupposed in this expression for W that the currents
are measured in electrodynamic or electromagnetic measure.
In order to apply electrostatic measure the expression must
be divided by K2, where K is tho critical velocity of electricity
which is approximately eijnal to 30 quadrants of the meridian.
   If, now, any motion of the conductor, and at the same time
a change in the strengths of the currents i, tj, i2, &c, takes
place, the electromotive force e thereby induced in the con
ductor is defined by the simple equation

       § 3. Application of the Equation to the Rotating Coil.
    In applying the previous equation to the electromotive
force which is induced in the rotating coil, in consequence of
its motion, by the currents in the other conductors and by
the magnets, we will select for consideration any one of the
positions in which the coil is divided, and which shall stand
for the above-mentioned conductor ar.
    If we follow this portion of the conductor through a whole
turn, we have to deal with a series of changes of position, by
which that division of the conductor reverts to its original
fosition, so thai the final value of \V is equal to the initial value,
  t would result from this that if the direction in which the
electromotive force is to be regarded as positive, were always
the same in that portion of the conductor, the electromotive
force induced in it during an entire revolution would be partly
positive and partly negative, and in the mean would be null.
Ihe state of things is, as a matter of fact, different. As stated
above, the entire rotating coil is divided by the two brushes
in each of its positions into two halves, which form branch
circuits between the brushes. The direction in which the
electromotive force is to be considered as positive does not
traverse the whole coil in the same direction ; but it is in dif
ferent directions in the two halves which we get if we suppose
ourselves to start from one brush, and to proceed through
both halves to the second brush. It follows from this that, for
each separate portion of the conductor, the direction which we
regard as positive changes at each half turn ; at the moment,
that is to say, at which the portion in passing the brush goes
from one half of the coil into the other. When the brushes
are properly adjusted, this happens at those places in which
the electromotive force changes, so that the sign of this elec
tromotive force is always the same.
    As the inducing action is equal during the two halves of the
circuit, then, in order to determine the average electromotive
force, we need only consider half a turn—that is, the motion
of the division in question from one brush to the other. At
the beginning of this half revolution, at the time t', let W
have the value W'j and at the end (that is, at the time t' + |-t,
in which t is the time of revolution) let W have the value W";
then, for the determination of the average electromotive force,
we get from (2) the following equation :—
        1 r*'+ir           1 C'+irdW           1
        PX      edt=-hi             f <a=£(W'-W")..(3)
    From this expression, which applies to only one portion of the

             Theory of Dynamo-electrical Machines.             51
rotating coil, we can easily get the corresponding expression
for the entire rotating coil, if we multiply by the total number
of such portions. In defining this number, it is to be observed
that the electromotive forces induced in the two halves of the
rotating coil must not be added, but only counted as single;
for the two halves are not in series in the whole circuit, but
form two branch circuits at rest. If therefore the total num
ber of portions of the rotating coil is n, the average electromo
tive force of one portion needs only to be multiplied by - to
obtain the electromotive force of the entire rotating coil.     If
we denote the latter by E1; wo get

and (4) passes thereby into

  § 4. Reaction of the Moving Conductor on the Stationary one.
    In the previous paragraphs we only dealt with the electro
motive force which the current in the fixed conductor and the
magnetism of the masses of iron induces in the moving con
 ductor. The question now arises whether the current in the
 moving conductor also induces an electromotive force in the
 stationary conductor.
    Wo shall again select for consideration a separate portion of
 the moving conductor (that is, of the rotating coil), which, as
 above, shall be designated by cr. Let the current traversing
 it be denoted by j ; in reference to which it is to bo observed
 that, during each rotation of a, it changes its direction twice.
 Let us suppose the stationary conductor to bo traversed by
 unit current, and form under these circumstances the electro-
 dynamic potential of a upon *, which we will call ii, and
 which is represented by an expression of the same form as
 that given in (1 ) ; that is to say,
 With the help of this magnitude we may define the electro

   52                    Prof. R. Clausius on the
   motive force e, induced at the time t in the stationary con
   ductor, by the following equation, which corresponds to (2):—
                                       dn
                               6        dt
      In order to deduce from this the mean electromotive force,
   we must again perform an integration in respect of the time,
  and divide the integral by the time. As the positive direction
  of the electromotive force does not alter in the stationary
  conductor, we may in this case extend the integration over
  the entire time of rotation t (i. e. from any given time t' to
  the time t' + t), and thus obtain the equation
            1 Ce+r           1 /"'+T dfL          1
            i      edt=--\           ^±dt = -([l'-n");
  in which £1' represents the initial value, and D," the final value
  after a complete turn. But after a complete revolution, both
  the position of the portion of the conductor and the direc
  tion of the current, which has changed twice during this time,
  are again the same as at the outset; from which it follows
 that LI" is again equal to fl', and thus the preceding expression
 is equal to null. This holds also for all portions of the con
 ductor, and we arrive therefore at the conclusion that in the
 stationary conductor no electromotive force is induced ; that is to
 say, that the electromotive force induced by the motion and
 that by the reversal of the current mutually neutralize each
 other.
     § 5. Inductive Action of the moving Conductor, in which a
                   current it circulating, on itself.
     It remains to consider the inductive action which the cur
 rent in the moving
itself.               fe conductor exerts on the moving conductor
     In this respect we must first of all observe that the conductor
 in question (that is, the rotating coil) only moves as a whole,
so that any two portions of it retain their relative positions.
It follows from this that the motion can produce no reciprocal
action.
    Hence we need only consider the change of current (that is
to say, the change of direction which takes place twice in each
revolution) to decide whether an effective induction can result
from this. The subject has already been discussed by Max
well* and by Joubertj, and I can assent to the principle
applied by these authors in their explanations, if not to the
special execution of the calculations.

     The inversion of the current when one of the portions of the
  conductors passes by a brush takes place as follows: —Up to a
  certain time this division of the conductor belongs to one
  half of the rotating coil. A short time then elapses, during
  which both ends of that portion of the circuit are in contact
  with the brush, and the portion of the conductor is thereby
  momentarily closed. After the expiration of this time this
  portion of the conductor belongs to the other half of the rota
  ting coil. From the circumstance that the division of the
  conductor is closed, though for ever so short a time, it cannot
  be assumed that it enters the second half of the rotating coil
  with the same current which it had in the first half ; but it
  must be remembered that one part of the change of current
  takes place in the interval, and only the rest after its entrance
  into the second half.
     Each of these two successive changes of current has, as a
  consequence, a double induction—in the first place, the induc
  tion of the portion of the conductor in consideration, which
  we will briefly call self-induction, and, secondly, the induction
  upon the other portions of the rotating coil.
     We may first of all consider that part of the change of cur
  rent which takes place in the interval. The self-induction
  which occurs in this time need not be taken into account; for
  the portion of the conductor is closed in this interval, and
  therefore does not belong to the entire circuit, for which we
  have to determine the induced electromotive force. In regard
  to the induction on the other portions of the rotating coil, it is
  to be observed that these portions lie symmetrically on each
  side of the portion of the conductor in question, so that on
  each side equal electromotive forces are induced. But as the
  positive direction is different in the halves on each side of the
  rotating coil, the electromotive forces induced in them are of
  opposite signs, and therefore neutralize each other as regards
  the entire circuit. The change of current which takes place
  in this interval produces no induction of electromotive force
  effective for the whole circuit.
     We must now consider that portion of the change of cur
  rent which takes place after any portion of the conductor has
  entered the second half of the rotating coil.
     The self-induction caused by this change of current must
   be taken into account, for our portion of the conductor now
  belongs to the entire circuit. And the induction on the other
  portions of the rotating coil is now different from before. The
  halves on each side formed of those portions are not quite like
" each other ; for on the one side one portion of the conductor
  is bounded by such a portion of the conductor as is just closed

 54                 Prof. R. Clausius on the
by tho brush, and therefore does not belong to the whole cir
 cuit, while on the other side it is bounded by a portion of the
 conductor which does so belong. Hence in this case the elec
 tromotive forces induced on each side do not neutralize each
 other completely, but there is an excess of the electromotive
force induced on the last-named side which, like the electro
motive force resulting from self-induction, is opposed to the
direction of the current.
    To determine this excess we must form the electrodynamic
potential of the portion in question on a branch circuit, con
 sidering the former to be traversed by the actual current and
the latter by the unit of current ; and to determine the elec
tromotive force arising from self-induction, we must form the
electrodynamic potential of the portion in question on itself,
in considering it as traversed once by the actual current and
once by the unit of current. From the change in the poten
tial, occasioned by this change in the strength of the current,
we got the induced electromotive force. In doing this we
must not take into account the whole change of current, but
only that portion of the change of current which takes place
after our portion of the current has entered the second half of
the rotating coil. It cannot be stated in general how great
the portion is, for this depends on the construction of the
machine and on the position of the brushes. We shall there
fore content ourselves with giving an expression which con
tains an undefined factor, and adding an explanatory remark.
   In any case the electromotive force, which may be called
E2, due to tho inducing action of the moving conductor on
itself, is proportional to the current-strength, which in the
two halves is together equal to t. It must, moreover, be pro
portional to the number of turns v, for on this the number of
changes of direction depends. Hence, remarking at the same
time that tho electromotive force is negative, we may put
                          E„= —piv,                         (7)
in which p is that undefined factor.
   This factor has a remarkable property by which a charac
teristic difference arises between the magnitude E2 and the
magnitude Ej, previously determined. We will imagine that
tho number, n, of portions into which the rotating coil is
divided is changed, by which of course the length of the indi
vidual portions is changed also, and indeed in the inverse
ratio, and wo will ask ourselves the question, what influence
this bas on the magnitudes E1 and E2.
    In determining E, we are dealing with the potential of the
fixed curront, and of the magnet, on a portion of the rotating

             Theory of Dynamo-electrical Machines.             55
coil. This potential is proportional to the length of the por
tion, and therefore approximately proportional to the fraction
- ; and as in the course of the calculation a multiplication by
n occurs, we acquire for E2 an expression which is almost in
dependent of n.
   In determining the value E2 we are dealing with the poten
tial of a portion on itself, and the potential of one portion on
another. With the exception of a member occurring in the
former, which is independent of the length, these two poten
tials are proportional to the square of the length of a portion,
and are therefore approximately proportional to the fraction -5;
and as a multiplication with n is necessary to determine the
total action, a value of Es must result which is approximately
proportional to the fraction -¦
   Hence, between the magnitudes El and E2 there is this differ
ence—that by changing the number n of divisions into which
the rotating coil is divided, the former is but little, while the
latter is very considerably affected, and so that E2 decreases
with an increase in n. Now as E2 is negative, and thus repre
sents a loss of electromotive force, it is advantageous to make
the number n as large as possible.
   After we have got expressions for the electromotive forces
Ei and E2 acting in the entire circuit, in the equations (6)
and (7), by adding them we obtain an expression for the
whole electromotive force E, and thus arrive at the expression
                     E = n(W-W")v-,piv                        (8)
  § 6. Work done by the Electromotive and the Ponderomotive
                               Forces.
   In order to express the work which is done in unit time by
the electromotive force E previously determined, we must
multiply the latter by the strength of the current which
flows through the two halves of the rotating coil—that is,
bv J. If we use, then, for E the previous expression, we get
                    Ei=n(W'-W")iv-pi?v                        (9)
   This work may be compared with another expression for
work. The coil traversed hy the current experiences from the
other parts of the system, to which the magnets also belong,
a ponderomotiveforce, the work of which we will also determine.
    If we consider a single portion of the rotating coil which is

ming that the system does not change its position, and that all
current-strengths are constant, the work of this ponderomo-
tive force in the time dt is expressed by
                             i dW
                             %-dTdt
From this we get for the time of half a rotation the work

                                                    T
and as the duration of half a rotation is equal to ^, we have for
the work referred to the unit of time the expression
                          i(W"-w)ii

 or, what is the same thing,
                         i(W"-W)v.
    Since there are n such portions of the conductor, the work
 T for unit time of the whole ponderomotive force of the rota
 ting coil is defined by the equation
                         T=«(W"-W'>V                          (10)
    If this work is compared with the work of the electromotive
 force expressed in (9), we see that it only differs from that by
 the sign, and by the expression —p?v, which represents the
 work of that electromotive force which is induced in the rota
 ting coil by the current itself on it. We can thus write,

     § 7. Determination of the Magnetism in the Electromagnets
                   in Dynamo-electrical Machines.
     In order to give the results hitherto obtained in a form
  more suited for further calculations, we must obtain an ex
  pression for the strength of the electromagnets in dynamo-
  electrical machines.
     First of all we have to deal with the fixed electromagnet.
  Its magnetic moment, on which depends the force which it
  exerts in the space between its poles, is not proportional to the
  strength of the current which traverses its coil, but follows
  another law. For a small strength it increases approximately
  in the ratio of the current-strength ; but as the strength of the
  current increases it increases also, but more slowly, and with

                Theory of Dynamo-electrical Machines.                    57
 a very great current-strength it approaches a limiting value.
 This ratio is expressed by Frolich* by an equation which, with
 some non-essential changes in the notation, is as follows :—
 in which M is the magnetic moment, and A and a are
 constants. I do not think that the ratio of the magnetic
 moment is hereby presented in the best manner ; but for our
 immediate purpose, in which, owing to the many accessory
 circumstances which refuse to lend themselves to an exact
 determination, only approximately correct results can be ob
 tained, it seems to me admissible to apply this equation, which
 is remarkable for its simplicity.
    For a very small current-strength the remanent magnetism
 present in the iron, and arising from the previous magnetiza
 tion, has to be taken into account. This is of no importance
 for calculations referring to machines at full work; but it is an
 essential requisite for the first production of the current in the
 starting of the machine, and for this reason we shall return to
 it. For the present we may disregard it, and simply retain
 equation (12).
    We must now consider further the magnetism of the iron core
 of the rotating coil. This magnetism is more complicated for
 the determination ; for, as already mentioned in § 1, it results
from two magnetic forces, which are exerted by the fixed elec
 tromagnet and by the current which traverses the rotating
coil.
    The first force is proportional to the magnetic moment M
 of the fixed electromagnet, and if it alone acted, would pro
 duce in the iron core a magnetic moment that could be repre
 sented by the expression
                                  CM
in which 0 and 7 are constants ; an expression quite cor
responding to that by which we represented the magnetic
moment in the fixed electromagnet resulting from the current i.
The second force, whose direction is perpendicular to the first,
would, if it alone acted, produce a magnetic moment which must
be also represented by an expression of the form just given.
We must, however, replace M by another magnitude which
stands in the same relation to the magnetizing force exerted by
the current in the coil on the iron core, as does the magnetic

moment M to the magnetizing force exerted by the fixed elec
tromagnet upon the iron core. We will call this magnitude
N, and define it by the fact that we represent the magnetic
moment which the current in the rotating coil would by itself
produce in the iron core, by the formula
                             CN
                           T+W
The magnitude N thus defined must obviously be proportional
to the current-strength in the rotating coil, which in the two
halves is together equal to i, so that we can put
                            N=Bi,                           (13)
in which B is a constant for each machine.
   If, now, both those magnetizing forces act simultaneously on
the iron core, a more powerful magnetism must be excited in
it. In order to express the magnetic moment P of this mag
netism, we must first of all form the resultant of M and N,
which is represented by «/ M2 + N2. If we form an expression
quite analogous to the above expression, this magnitude must
be used both in the numerator and denominator instead of the
values M and N, by which we should get
   Now it has been remarked above, that the expression by
which, on Frolich's plan, we have represented the depend
ence of the magnetic moment on the effective magnetizing
force, can only be regarded as approximate, and this holds
particularly for the form of the numerator. As now the
occurrence of the root */M2 + N2 in the numerator makes the
expression somewhat inconvenient for calculation, it may be
permitted somewhat to simplify the numerator. Of the two
magnetizing forces one is exerted directly by the current, and
is therefore simply proportional to the current-strength i. The
other is also exerted indirectly by the current ; for this pro
duces the magnetism of the fixed electromagnet, which in turn
exerts the force in question. Hence the degree of accuracy
of the expression will not be appreciably diminished if, instead
of that root which represents the force, we introduce a value
proportional to the current-strength i in the numerator of the
fraction, and thereby give this the same form as the numerator
of the fraction occurring in equation (12). The equation,
then, which serves to determine P is as follows :—

   The axis of this magnetic moment P has the same direction
as the resultant of the magnetizing forces exerted by the fixed
electromagnet and by the coil. Hence if we denote the angle
of this axis with the two directions of the force at right angles
to each other, the former of which is the opposite direction of
the axis of the fixed electromagnet, by <j> and ~ —       we have

VI. A new form of Roller for the Disk-and-Roller Integrator.
              By Frederick John Smith, B.A.*
THE disk-and-roller integrating apparatus as used to
       register the results in an ergometer, or as applied in
Ashton and Storey's steam-power indicator, has been objected
to because of two defects. Ihe first is that the roller in contact
with the disk has a grinding action, and it has this because,
while its edges have the same linear velocity, they have to
travel in paths which are concentric circles on the disk by
'which the roller is driven. The second defect is that, since
the roller has to be moved with its axis parallel to a radius of
the driving-disk, its edge has to be scraped across the disk.
The result of this is that, while a certain amount of friction is
required to ensure good rolling contact, this very friction

prevents the roller from being easily moved with its axis
parallel to a radius of the driving-disk.
   The author of this communication has devised and used (in
connexion with an ergometer, described in the Philosophical
Magazine, vol. xv. p. 87) the following arrangement, whereby
the difficulties now mentioned are removed. Instead of the
roller being solid, the edge or face of it is notched in a dividing-
engine with a circular saw ; each notch so formed carries a
little disk, the edge of which is rounded to the curvature of
the circle CB, fig. 2 ; a ring of steel piano-wire forms the
axis of all the little disks placed round the circumference of
the roller R (only two of the little disks, d and d', are shown
in fig. 2). In fig. 1 D is part of the large driving-disk
which drives the roller R, YY' is. the axis of the disk D, XX'

that of the roller R. A roller so constructed is found to
move with the utmost freedom in the two directions required,
and it will do so, without any " slip," whether the motions are
simultaneous or not so. By making the number of little disks
round the roller large, and facing tho disk D very carefully,
tho action even at a high speed is quite smooth and free
from vibration.

        VII. On Rainbows.     By John Tyndall, F.R.S.*
THOUGH the following brief communication contains
       nothing new in principle, its novelty from an experi
mental point of view, and its possible utility to the teacher as
a means of illustration, induce me to publish it in the ' Philo
sophical Magazine.'
   At 9 p.m. on Thursday, September 27th, I opened one of
the doors of my cottage in the Alps. It was a very dark
night, and the air outside was filled with fog and drizzle. In
the corridor behind me hung a small lamp, and as I stood in
the doorway the shadow of my body was cast upon the fog.
Such a shadow I had often previously seen, but on this occa
sion it was accompanied by an appearance that I had not seen.
At a considerable distance from the shadow, and far beyond the
illuminated portion of the fog, a well-defined luminous circle,
of which my head was the centre, was projected upon the dark
background. Various changes in the position of the light
and of my body were made, with a view of enhancing and
examining the effect. On walking forward from the doorway
into the fog both shadow and halo went in advance of me. A
more powerful lamp produced a brighter circle ; but a single
 candle sufficed to render it visible. On the 29th, the atmo
 sphere being in the same condition, the circle was well ob
 served from another door. On the 18th of November, and
 subsequently, I observed the same phenomenon from the door
 of my hut upon Hind Head.
    On first observing the shadow and circle combined, I
 thought the effect a reproduction, on a small scale, of the
 spirit of the Brocken, and wrote to Professor Stokes to this
 effect. Having no means of measuring accurately the angle
 subtended by the diameter or radius of the luminous circle, I
 placed two crossed laths in such a position that the prolonga
 tions of both intersected the circle at the opposite ends of the
 same diameter. The angle measured in this rough way was
 clearly under 90°, though not much under it. Between the
 luminous circle and the shadow I could see no trace of colour.
    These and other facts caused me to suspect that the circular
 band was really a rainbow ; and on my return from the Alps
 I tried to reproduce the effect. A cylindrical copper boiler,
  16 inches high and 12 inches in diameter, was charged with
 water, which had its temperature raised by gas-burners till a
 pressure of 20 lbs. was obtained. On opening a valve the
  steam, carrying droplets of water mechanically along with it,
                  * Communicated by the Author.

and condensing above to droplets of a similar kind, was blown
violently into the atmosphere. A combination of fog and drizzle
similar to that observed in the Alps was thus obtained. A
few trials sufficed to bring the luminous circle into view, and
by a little practice its light was greatly enhanced.
   In these experiments the light passed from one room
through a doorway into another room, in which the boiler
was placed. The naked limelight and the naked electric light
produced, as might be expected, etfects more vivid than those
of an ordinary oil- or gas-lamp. But the maximum brilliancy
was obtained when the electric light was placed in a camera,
with a condensing lens in front, the beam being rendered suf
ficiently divergent to leave a luminous area round the shadow
of the head cast upon a distant black screen. The circular
bow was then extremely vivid, its convex circumference being
distinctly red, and its concave circumference distinctly blue.
Outside the primary, the corresponding secondary bow was
seen, with the colours of the primary reversed. By mea
surement with a theodolite, I found the angle subtended by
the radius of the most luminous primary circle to be 42°, its
position being therefore identical with that of the rainbow.
   Showers of liquids other than water were next examined,
various methods of forming spray being more or less success
fully tried. Probably different liquids will require different
spray-producers to bring out their best effects. For the pro
duction of water-spray, the most convenient arrangement was
found to be that employed to moisten the air in the Houses of
Parliament, and, I believe, employed also in the washing of
gas. It is a modification of a well-known experiment of
 Savart. From a narrow orifice a jet of water, under high
pressure, is caused to impinge upon a small metallic disk :
the liquid spreads laterally, and breaks up into extremely fine
droplets. My assistant reminded mo of this spray-producer ;
and Mr. Tylor was good enough to borrow the little instru
 ment for me from Mr. Pim. Fixed near the ceiling of our
laboratory, and connected with the water-pipes of the Insti
 tution, on turning on a cock a very fine shower falls down
wards. The electric light being placed, as stated, in an ad
jacent room, and the lens being so arranged that the beam
embraces the head leaving an aureole round its shadow, effects
 of great beauty are obtained. The circular primary bow
comes out with extreme vividness, and may be looked at for
 any length of time*. The secondary bow is also obtained as
 a complete circle surrounding the primary.
    The manner in which the spray is formed renders the drops
        * Waterproof clothing is desirable in these experiments.

which constitute the shower of sensibly uniform size. The con
sequence is that within the primary we have a surprising dis
play of supernumerary bows*. I have counted six concentric
circles thus formed by interference within the primary. Round
the convex circumference of the secondary bow a series of paler
supernumeraries is also to be seen. By properly managing
the illuminating-beam these effects may be rendered extremely
sharp and beautiful. The light from a Siemens dynamo
machine produces very fine effects; while the light of the vol
taic battery is particularly suitable when steadiness, sharp
ness, and vividness are sought to be combined.
   To obtain the spray of liquids other than water, the following
arrangement is made :—A cylindrical iron bottle, used for the
storing of liquefied carbonic acid, is filled with the liquid to
be experimented on. Through a brass cap, which can be
firmly screwed on to the top of the bottle, passes a metal tube
t which ends close to the bottom ; to the outside end of this
tube is attached the spray-producer. A second tube passes
also through the cap, and ends immediately underneath it.
This tube is united by a long and flexible compo-tube to a larger
iron bottle containing compressed oxygen, hydrogen, or air.
Hoisting the small bottle to a convenient height, the tap of
the larger bottle is carefully opened : the gas passes through
the compo-tube to the smaller bottle, and exerts its pressure
upon the surface of the liquid therein contained. The liquid
is forced upwards through the tube t, and passes to the spray-
producer, from which it falls in a fine rain. A great many
liquids have been tested by this arrangement, and very re
markable effects have been produced.
    Spirit of turpentine, forced thus from the iron bottle, and
caused to fall in a fine shower, produces a circular bow of ex
traordinary intensity. With paraffin oil a similar effect is
obtained. I have also tried bisulphide of carbon, tet rachloride
of carbon, chloroform, benzol, pentane, and other liquids, in
cluding various mineral solutions ; but to those who wish to
make the experiment in a cheap, an easy, and an effectual
way, I would recommend the sprays of spirit of turpentine
and of petroleum.
   I asked myself whether, in the case of a composite shower
(that is to say, a shower produced by the spray of two or more
different liquids) the beam would be able to analyse the
shower and, by the production of two or more distinct pri
maries, reveal its constituents. This was found to be the case.
From the principles which underlie the formation of the rain-
   * Professor Stokes reminds me that the angular smallnesa of the source
of light also contributes to this effect.

bow, it follows that the higher the refractive index of the
liquid, the smaller will be the diameter of the circular bow
 produced by its drops. Thus, the refractive index of spirit of
turpentine being greater than that of water, its circle ought
to be formed within that of water. Having produced the
extremely vivid bow of the turpentine shower, the water was
turned on. Its spray fell, mingled with the turpentine, and,
instantly, round the turpentine bow the larger water-bow was
swept through the darkness. The corresponding secondary
bows of both liquids were at the same time visible. For this
experiment water and petroleum are particularly handy liquids;
and I doubt whether among the phenomena of the laboratory
anything more beautiful is to be seen.
    Biot and Brewster proved the light of the ordinary rainbow
to be polarized. As might be expected, in the artificial bow
the light is also polarized. It is transmitted when the long
diagonal of a nicol is tangent to the bow ; it is quenched
when the short diagonal is in this position.
    I have mentioned the " doorways " in the Alps and at Hind
Head as if they contributed to the effect. They did so by
limiting the portion of fog illuminated, thus enabling the
eye to project the bow upon the dark surrounding space.
This action of the eye is physiologically interesting. When
a camera and lens are used, the beam from which the eye re
 ceives the rays producing the bow may not be more than
a foot in width ; while it is easy to obtain from these rays a
 circular bow with an apparent diameter of fifteen or twenty
 feet. By varying the position of the head, the position and
magnitude of the bow is caused to undergo corresponding
alterations.
    I need not say that caution is necessary in dealing with in
flammable liquids. Explosive mixtures might readily be pro
duced. It is therefore well to isolate by a plate of glass or
 otherwise the room in which the light is placed from that in
which the spray is produced ; taking care, moreover, to avoid
in the latter the ignition of matches, or the introduction of
any other light.
    The action of mineral sohttions is well illustrated by chlo
ride of ammonium. Forming the water-bow first, and then
permitting the spray of the solution to descend, the liquids
do not coalesce to form a weaker solution. Within the water-
bow, but not much within it, the smaller bow of the solution
appears.

 VIII. On tlie Change in the Volumes and Refractive Indices of
    Fluids produced by Hydrostatic Pressure. By Professor G.
    Quincke*.
 TN order to determine the compressibility of a liquid, the
      apparent decrease in the unit volume was measured which
 the liquid showed at 0° and at a mean temperature of t° when
 the pressure on the liquid was increased by an amount mea
 sured by means of a mercury-manometer, the liquid being
 contained in a glass vessel provided with a capillary tube
 under the receiver of an air-pump. The change in volume of
 the containing glass vessel was determined by separate expe
 riments, and added to the apparent change in volume of the
 liquid so as to determine the absolute decrease in volume of
 the liquid. Both of these changes were found nearly propor
 tional to the increase in pressure. From these data we obtain
 the actual decrease of unit volume of the liquid for an increase
 in pressure of one atmosphere, or the compressibility of the
 fluid at 0° and at t°.

A Treatise on the Motion of Vortex-Rings, By J. J. Thomson, M.A.
     (Adams Prize Essay.) London: Macmillan and Co., 1883.
  A BAMS Prize Essays, like University Prize Poems, are neces-
       sarily of very unequal merit. There cannot always be among
the younger members, even of a great university like Cambridge, a
mathematician of strikingly original power ; it would be much less
surprising, though still hardly to be expected, that there should be
always an embryo Macaulay or a fledgling Tennyson. Besides,
while a youthful rhymester, full of confidence and " go," can usually
manage to hammer out in fair metre the requisite number of lines,
whatever be the subject prescribed, some of the subjects proposed
for the Adams Prize have found no one daring enough to venture
an attack on them.
    The essay before us is much above the average in point of merit.
Xo very striking originality (such, for instance, as burst forth in
Clerk-Maxwell's essay ' On the Stability of Saturn's Eings ') has, so
far as we have seen, been manifested, but a great deal of really
skilled hard labour has been usefully devoted to the clearing up of
an exceedingly important and excessively difficult question. And,
if Mr. Thomson's work serves to show rather the inadequacy of
our present weapons, and the absolute necessity for more powerful
ones, than the real nature of the impact between two vortex-rings,
it is none the less valuable on that account. Borne was not built in
a dav, is a saying quite as important as it is trite ; nor could it be
expected that the Vortex Theory (which, as we shall see, may con
tain the complete solution of every physical problem, leaving nothing
to be explained except the nature of the wonderful fluid in which
the vortices exist) is to be more than, as it were, nibbled at in any
number of Adams Prize Essays.
**¦ Vortex motion, as a branch of hydrokinetics, we owe to Von
Helmholtz, of whose many splendid scientific achievements it is
perhaps the most brilliant. Cauchy and Stokes had done much to
pave the way ; but the exact nature of fluid motion where there is no
velocity-potential was unknown till the appearance of Von Helm-
holtz's paper in Crelle's Journal (1858). It was shown that, in a
frictionless incompressible fluid, of infinite extent, the rotating part
consists for ever of the same portions of the fluid, and that the axes
of rotation of successive elements are tangents to closed curves, or
rings. A group of such vortex-lines, passing through each point of
a very small closed curve, forms a vortex-tube or filament, a doubly-
connected space which continually encloses the same portion of
fluid. Von Helmholtz's treatment of circular vortex-filaments was
limited to the case in which there is one only, or of two or more
whose planes are parallel, and intersected at right angles by the
straight line in which the centres lie. Even with this restriction,

 70                 Notices respecting New Books.
 some extraordinary consequences were deduced, and these were
 easily verified by experiment.
    This magnificent investigation shortly afterwards led to the
 construction of apparatus by which very large visible vortex-rings
 could be produced with certainty, and their mutual effects thus
 directly demonstrated in the case of oblique as well as direct impact.
    Sir William Thomson, who had for years been trying to get rid
 of the inadmissible postulate of infinitely hard particles (or atoms)
 as the basis of material structures, and to account for their elasticity
 by some species of motion, did not form his theory of Vortex Atoms
 till the instant that he saw two of these large vortex-rings rebound
 from one another after a collision, each quivering from the effects of
 the blow. So that the theory was based by Sir W. Thomson, not
 directly on Von Helmholtz's splendid mathematics, but upon a
 physical reproduction of their results, which indicated properties
 not yet treated by mathematical processes.
    With remarkable rapidity he developed his theory, and commu
 nicated it in outline to the Eoyal Society of Edinburgh, to which
 he has since given several other papers on the subject. These con
 tain, in some cases, extensions of the theory ; in others, modes of
 meeting various difficulties as they arose. Several of these isolated
 results of Sir W. Thomson's appear as verifications, in the course of
 Mr. Thomson's work ; and it is obvious that the selection of this
 subject for the Adams Prize Essay is due directly to the interest
 excited by the theory of vortex atoms.
    Clerk-Maxwell, in a very remarkable essay (article Atom in the
 new edition of the Encyc. Brit.), has brought prominently forward
 the more salient points of this theory. He says :—" The greatest
 recommendation of this theory, from a philosophical point of view,
 is that its success in explaining phenomena does not depend on the
 ingenuity with which its contrivers ' save appearances,' by introdu
 cing first one hypothetical force and then another. When the
 vortex atom is once set in motion, all its properties are absolutely-
fixed and determined by the laws of motion of the primitive fluid,
which are fully expressed in the fundamental equations. The
disciple of Lucretius may cut and carve his solid atoms in the hope
of getting them to combine into worlds ; the follower of Boscovich
may imagine new laws of force to meet the requirements of each
new phenomenon ; but he who dares to plant his feet iu the path
opened up by Helmholtz and Thomson has no such resources. His
primitive fluid has no other properties than inertia, invariable den
sity, and perfect mobility, and the method by which the motion of
this fluid is to be traced is pure mathematical analysis. The diffi
culties of this method are enormous, but the glory of surmounting
them would be unique."
    Now Mr. Thomson's essay does not attempt any such investi
gation as this. With him the diameter of the cross section of a
vortex-ring is always small in comparison with the diameter of the
ring itself ; and the mutual effect of two rings is treated only when
they do not approach within a distance exceeding many-fold the

                         Geological Society.                     71
diameter of either. This limitation is, of course, imposed by the
immense mathematical difficulties of the subject. But, within his
restricted limits, Mr. Thomson has done really good work, work
which enables us to have at least a glimpse beyond these limits.
   The latter portion of the essay, where chemical ideas of valency
&c. are introduced, is by no means so satisfactory as that which
precedes. Mr. Thomson is evidently far more at home among
symbols than among dyads and chemical molecules.

   The following communications were read :—
    1. " On the Cambrian Conglomerates resting upon and in the
vicinity of some Pre-Cambrian Rocks (the so-oalled intrusive masses)
in Anglesey and Caernarvonshire." By Henry Hicks, M.D., F.G.S.
    The author stated that as he and others who had asserted tha'j
some of the great rock-masses marked as " intrusive " on the maps
of the Geological Survey in Anglesey and Caernarvonshire were
 really of Pre-Cambrian age, had been charged in the last edition of
 the Geological Survey Memoir on North Wales with having done so
 on purely theoretical grounds, he had found it necessary to obtain
 the additional evidence which he now brought before the Society.
 He felt this to be the more incumbent upon him as the present
 Director-General had recently stated that his predecessor would not
 ac'mit the existence of any Pre-Cambrian rocks in the Principality,
and had further asserted that the author, " with the most complete
 disregard of the evidence by which the officers of the Survey were
led to regard certain rocks as intrusive " in Cambrian and Silurian
 strata, had simply made these rocks into metamorphic and volcanic

72                        Geological Society:—
Pre-Cambrian masses, without giving any detailed statement of the
evidence in support of so great a change. The author said that he
was prepared to bring forward conclusive evidence of the correct
ness of his views from all the areas referred to, and he offered the
present paper as a first instalment of the detailed criticism demanded
by the Director-General.
   In a former paper he had maintained that there was no evidence
to show that the so-called intrusive granite in Anglesey had altered
the Cambrian and Silurian rocks in its immediate vicinity, or that
they had been entangled in it as described, but that it seemed to be
a rock of metamorphic origin, varying much in its general appear
ance at different points. He contended that, instead of being an in
trusive granite, as supposed by the ofiicers of the Survey, it was in
all probability the oldest rock in Anglesey. The basal Cambrian
conglomerate in contact with it is in an unaltered condition, and
at Llanfaelog contains an extraordinary proportion of well-rolled
pebbles, identical in mineral composition with the so-called granite
immediately below. Fragments of all the varieties of rock found
in the granitoid axis are recognizable in the conglomerate, and in
precisely the same condition as in the parent rock. Fragments of
the various schists of the area were also present ; so that he thought
there cannot be the shadow of a doubt that the so-called granite
and the metamorphic schists are older than the conglomerate, and
therefore Pre-Cambrian. The view maintained by the Survey that
the schists are altered Cambrian and Silurian strata, and the granitoid
rock an intrusivo granite of Lower Silurian age, is consequently
quite untenable.
   In Caernarvonshire equally conclusive evidence was obtained from
many areas. Fragments of the Dimetian (Twt-Hill type) occurred
abundantly in the basal Cambrian Conglomerates at Dinas Dinorwig,
Pont Rothel, Moel Tryfane, and Glyn Llifon. Quartz-felsite
pebbles in every respect identical with the varieties found in the
so-called intrusive ridges between Bangor and Caernarvon, and to
the north and south of Llyn Padarn, were found on the shores of
the Menai Straits, in the railway-cutting at Bangor, at Llandeiniolen,
Dinas Dinorwig, Llyn Padarn, and elsewhere. This evidence, sup
plementary to that previously furnished by Prof. Hughes, Prof.
Bonney, and the author, is conclusive as to these areas, since the
basal Cambrian conglomerates, which are in contact with these
supposed intrusive masses, are composed almost entirely of rocks
identical with the latter ; and this could not possibly be the case if
the granitoid masses had been intruded among the conglomerates
after their deposition.
   2. " On some Rock-specimens collected by Dr. Hicks in Anglesey
and N.W. Caernarvonshire." By Prof. T. G. Bonney, D.Sc, F.E.S.,
Sec.G.S.
   The author stated that pebbles in the blocks of conglomerate
collected by Dr. Hicks to the north of Llanfaelog were practically
undistinguishable macroscopically and microscopically from the

  Post-glacial Ravines in the Chalk- Wolds of Lincolnshire. 73
granitoid and gneissic rocks which occur in situ between that place
and Ty Croes, and that the matrix contained smaller fragments,
probably from the same rock, with schist bearing a general re
semblance to members of the group of schists so largely developed
in Anglesey, and with grits, argillites, &c. Pebbles of granitoid
aspect in the Cambrian conglomerate near Dinas Dinorwig &c. bear
a very close resemblance to the Twt-Hill rock, and are associated
with abundant rolled fragments of rhyolite resembling those already
described from the Cambrian conglomerate and the underlying con
glomeratic beds and rhyolites. Two pebbles of rather granitoid
aspect in the Cambrian conglomerate by the shore of the Menai
Straits, near Garth, prove to be spherulitic felsite, somewhat re
sembling that already described by the author from Tan-y-maes.
He pointed out that the evidence of these specimens collected by
Dr. Hicks, added to that already obtained, led irresistibly to one of
two conclusions :—either that, when the Cambrian was formed,
an area of very ancient metamorphic rock was exposed near Ty
Croes and in the Caernarvonshire district, or that the rhyolitic vol
canoes were so much older than the Cambrian time that their
granitic cores were already laid bare by denudation. Hence, in
either case, the existence of Archaean rock in North Wales was
proved. To one or other of these conclusions he could see no pos
sible alternative, and he considered the former to be (even if some
of the granitoid rock were granite) far the most probable.
   3. " On some Post-glacial Ravines in the Chalk-Wolds of Lincoln
shire." By A. J. Jukes-Browne, Esq., F.G.S.
   In a former paper the author stated that of the valleys inter
secting the Chalk Wolds some were older and some were newer
than the formation of the Boulder-clays (Hessle and Purple Clays).
He now described some cases where the modern watercourse, after
flowing for some distance along the line of an ancient (pre-Boulder-
clay) valley, suddenly deserts that valley and passes through a
ravine excavated entirely out of the Chalk.
   These ravines are very different from the other parts of the valley
traversed by the same stream, being deep and narrow cuts or
trenches with steep wooded sides, and exhibiting more the scenery
of Derbyshire vales than that of ordinary Chalk valleys.
   In accounting for the origin of these ravines, the author pointed
out that the whole district in which they occur must once have been
completely covered by the Boulder-clays ; and he supposes that at
certain points where the ancient valleys were blocked with high
mounds of Drift, the streams found it easier to cut new channels
through the flanking ridge of Chalk than through the obstacles in
front of them.

            A CLASSIFICATION OF THE NATURAL SCIENCES
                    BY T. STERRY HUNT, LL.D., F.R.S.
 rPO frame a rational classification of the natural sciences, and
        to define their mutual relations, has often been attempted.
 The present writer, in an essay read before the National Academy
 of Sciences in 1881, and published in the Philosophical Magazine
 for October of that year under the title of " The Domain of Phy
 siology," suggested the basis of such a scheme, and now, at the
 suggestion of some of his readers, ventures to embody in a concise
 and tabulated form the views then and there enunciated, in the hope
that other students may find it not unworthy of their notice.
    The study of material nature, or of the physical universe (for the
 terms natural and physical are synonymous), constitutes what the
 older scholars correctly and comprehensively termed Physics, and
presents itself in a two-fold aspect ; first, as descriptiv e, and second
as philosophical—a distinction embodied in the terms Natural
History and Natural Philosophy, or, more concisely, in the words
Physiography and Physiology. The latter word has, from the time
of Aristotle, been employed in this general sense to designate the
philosophical study of nature, and will be so used in the present
classification.
    The world of nature is divided into the inorganic or mineralo-
 gical and the organic or biological kingdoms ; the divisions of the
 latter into vegetable and animal being a subordinate one. The
 natural history or physiography of the inorganic kingdom takes
 cognizance of the sensible characters of mineral species, and gives
 us descriptive and systematic mineralogy ; which have hitherto
 been restricted to native species, but in a wider sense include all
 artificial species as well. The study of native mineral species, their
 aggregations, and their arrangement as constituents of our planet,
is the object of geognosy and physical geography. The physiography
 of other worlds gives rise to descriptive astronomy.
    The natural philosophy of the inorganic kingdom, or mineral
physiology, is concerned, in the first place, with what is generally
 called dynamics or physics ; including the phenomena of ordinary
 motion, sound, radiant energy, electricity, and magnetism. Dy
namics in the abstract regard matter in general, without relation
to species ; chemism generates therefrom mineralogical, or so-called
chemical species ; which, theoretically, may be supposed to be
formed from a single elemental substance or materia prima.
Dynamics and chemistry built up the inorganic world, giving rise
to the science of geogeny and, as applied to other worlds, to
theoretical astronomy.
    Proceeding to the organic kingdom, its physiographic study

leads us first to organography and then to descriptive and sys
tematic botany and zoology, two great subdivisions of natural
history. Coming now to consider the physiological aspects of or
ganic nature, we find, besides the dynamical and chemical activities
manifested in the mineral kingdom, other and higher ones which
characterize the organic kingdom. On this higher plane of existence
are found portions of matter which have become individualized, ex
hibit irritability, the power of growth by assimilation, and of repro
duction, and moreover establish relations with the external world
by the development of organs ; all of which is foreign to the
mineral kingdom. These new activities are often designated as
vital, but since this term is generally made to include at the same
time manifestations which are simply dynamical or chemical, I have
elsewhere proposed for the activities characteristic of the organism
the term biotics (Greek fiuoriKos, pertaining to life).
    The physiology of matter in the abstract is dynamical ; that of
mineral species is both dynamical and chemical ; while that of
organized forms is at once dynamical, chemical, and biotical. The
study of the biotical activities of matter leads to organogeny and
morphology ; while the relations of organisms to one another, aud
to the inorganic world, give rise to physiological botany and
physiological zoology. We thus attain to a comprehensive and
simple scheme of the natural sciences, which I have endeavoured
to set forth in the subjoined table :—

DETERMINATION OF MOMENTS OF MAGNETISM BY THE BALANCE.
                         BY H. VON HELMHOLTZ.
    The experiments to be described have hitherto only been made
with a good chemical balance, which, however, was not quite free
from particles of iron. The influence of permanent magnetization

76           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
of any pieces of steel may be eliminated by repeated weighings
with reversed direction of the magnets ; but the suspicion that tem
porary magnetization, by the influence of the magnets used, came
into play could not be altogether set at rest. I hope shortly to
repeat these measurements with a balance quite free from iron,
and arranged for reading by reflection. Hut even preliminary
experiments show, that in this way values can be obtained which
are constant, and accurate to within | per cent., in which we are
quite free from disturbances due to the incessant changes in the
terrestrial magnetism. This latter I consider as the most essen
tial advantage of the method.
   A control whether magnets of suitable size undergo any change
of their moment, a question which comes into play in many
magnetic measurements, can be effected by means of this method
with any sufficiently fine balance, even though it is not quite free
from iron. Three nearly equal magnetic bars are required for
complete determination. Those which I used were hollow tubes
10 centim. in length and 1*3 centim. in diameter. This form of
tube is convenient, for they can be easily suspended, and retain com
paratively powerful magnetization. In making the measurements,
two of the bars are placed in suitable supports and suspended by
hooks from the upper bend of the hook which supports the pans.
One of the magnets, V, hangs vertically, and the other, H, horizon
tally, and so that the prolongation of its axis cuts the centre of V.
When H turns its north pole to V, whose north pole is upper
most, the north pole of H repels that of V upwards, while it
draws up the south pole of V. The south pole of H is conversely
driven down, and with it the second pan of the balance. For the
same load in both pans, V rises therefore and H sinks. The
converse is the case when one of the magnets is inverted. The
difference of the load which must be applied, the position of H
being unchanged, in order to keep the balance in equilibrium,
when the north pole of V is first turned upwards and then down
wards, is four times the vertical force with which the magnets act
on each other. By inverting H and repeating the weighing, we
can eliminate the actions of the permanent magnetization of the
steel parts of the balance. We may finally suspend the vertical
magnets horizontally and conversely : the same result is then ob

appreciably vary.

of their centres, which is equal to the distance of the terminal
knife-edges (30 centim. in the balance which I used), the difference
of weight G reduced to absolute units of force, when one of the
magnets is inverted, is given by the expression

correctly with careful weighing. Of course when the magnets are
inverted, they must only be touched with tongs or with clean
gloves. By means of the balance specially constructed, I hope to
get another place of decimals.

The ratio m, : m1 was also determined by means of the bifilar
magnetometer of F. Kohlrausch. The value found by weighing
agreed well with the mean of the magnetometrical values, but the
latter varied far more than the former.
   With the dimensions of the balance and of the magnets, the
higher members of the expression cannot be altogether neglected.
Let the x axis be placed in the axis of the horizontal magnet, and
the y axis vertical, let H and V be the moments of the magnets in
question, and put

If these magnitudes x and y are determined, the calculation of
the force is best made on the supposition that all magnetism is
concentrated in the points in question, and comes out then very
simple.
   If the magnetic moment of a magnet is then accurately deter
mined in absolute value, and can any time be accurately controlled,
then by means of magnetoruetrical methods all other magnetic
moments and all current-strengths may be easily reduced to them.
Magnetic moments alter indeed ; but with steel not quite recently
magnetized and well hardened, changes occur such as the earth's
magnetism experiences sometimes in five minutes. Hence we get
a far more certain absolute determination of current-strengths,
when we compare their magnetic strengths with the moment of a
well-hardened steel bar, than when we reduce them by means of the
tangent galvanometer to the terrestrial magnetism, which, from the
concealed masses of iron in our buildings, may show a quite
different value at a distance of a few feet from the place of obser
vation.—Silzungsberichte der Ahademie der Wissensehaften zu Berlin,

    ON AN INDUCTION MAGNETIC COMPASS.            BY M. MASCART.
   Weber's inductometer enables us to determine the magnetic in
clination by measuring the currents induced in a conducting frame,
which is first turned through an angle of 180° about a horizontal
axis starting from the horizontal plane, and then about a vertical
axis starting from a plane perpendicular to the magnetic meridian.
Such is the method in use in many observatories.
   If the apparatus is so arranged that the axis of rotation of the
frame is in any direction in the magnetic meridian, and if we seek
by trial for two directions such that for an angular rotation of
180° the needle of the galvanometer experiences equa1 impulses in
opposite directions, the line bisecting these two directions will give
the position of equilibrium of a dipping-needle. This second
method has recently been proposed by M. Wild.
   It is c'ear that the induced currents must be zero, when the
axis of rotation of the frame is exactly parallel to the direction of
the magnetic force.
   With the ordinary method of observation, which consists in
turning the frame through 180°, we obtain the same degree of
exactitude as by measuring the angles of throw ; but the null method
enab'es us to dispense with any measurement of the throw, as well
as any regulation of the initial and final positions of the movable
frame. We have in this the advantage that, if we are near the
wished-for direction, we may, by alternate movements of the frame
of the same period as that of the oscillations of the needle, multiply
the angles of throw, and thus demonstrate the existence of a deflec
tion which in itself would have been inappreciable. The accuracy
of the method is thus considerably increased ; we may then greatly

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.               79
diminish the dimensions of the rotatory frame, and it is convenient
to use a galvanoscope of suitable resistance to which the maximum
of sensitiveness is imparted.
   I have for some years tried to realize this experiment by means
of an apparatus which can be readily carried about. It consists of
an azimuthal circle on which moves an arrangement which supports
a ring movable about a horizontal axis ; the angle which this ring
makes with the vertical is measured by a vertical circle ; the frame,
which is only 0-12 metre in diameter, is supported by the ring and
can turn about an axis perpendicular to that of the ring. The
dimensions of the instrument do not exceed those of an ordinary
dip-needle.
   By a series of systematic trials we can first find the angle of the
ring at right angles to the magnetic meridian ; by a second series
the axis of rotation of the frame is brought into the direction of the
dipping-needle. With the inversions necessary to eliminate the
errors of reading, the entire observation does not take half an hour :
this is scarcely the time required to determine the inclination by the
dipping-needle.
   As regards the accuracy of the results, it does not appear to be
leas than that of the dip-circles, the handling of which is so delicate.
I will give as an instance some observations recently obtained by
M. Morneaux at the observatory of the Pare Saint-Maur.

If it be remembered that the observations were not made simul
taneously, and that the results given by dip-needles of different
patterns, observed at the same time, scarcely agree better, it will
be seen that it is difficult to give any good reason for preferring
one method to the other.
   The reading for the magnetic meridian is sufficiently accurate to
allow us to determine the declination to within a minute ; hence
 by adding a telescope we get a true magnetic theodolite.
   I may add that the dimensions of the frame may be still further
diminished by introducing soft iron. The induced currents are thus
made far stronger without any inconvenience, for the changes of
magnetization would still be null for any rotation about the direc
tion of the terrestrial force.—Comptes Hindus, Nov. 26.

          ON HALL'S PHENOMENON.           BY M. AUG. KIGHI.
   Researches on this important phenomenon have led me to two
results, which I think may at once be usefully made known,.
   The first result is in reference to the Bhape of the electrodes.
Instead of being in the form of a cross with four electrodes, it
may have any shape whatever, and has three electrodes. The cur
rent enters or leaves by one of the electrodes, and leaves or enters
by the other two. The two partial currents circulate in an opposite
direction in the two circuits of each of the coils of a Wiedemann's
galvanometer: a suitable resistance introduced, or two other coils
traversed by the same total current, enable us to keep the needle
at zero, or nearly so. The instrument shows opposite variations
in the strength of the two partial currents as soon as we close the
circuit of the electromagnet, between the poles of which the plate is
placed. The direction of the deviation shows that the equipoteutial
lines are turned in a direction opposite that of the magnetizing
current for gold and the other metals in which Hall's phenomenon
has the same direction, and in the same direction as the magne
tizing current for iron. By changing the direction of the current
which traverses the plate, we obtain galvanometric indications
which show that the phenomenon cannot be ascribed to a direct
action of magnetism on the current. All this will be explained in
a subsequent memoir.
   This mode of working enables us to obtain plates of very small
dimensions and irregular in shape, provided that they are thin
enough.
   The second result refers to Hall's phenomenon in bismuth, in
which metal it had not been previously studied, possibly owing to
the difficulty of getting it in plates sufficiently thin or sufficiently
large. By the preceding method I have discovered that Hall's
effect may be obtained with bismuth in the same manner as with
gold, but with extraordinary intensity, about 5000 times that of
gold. Thus, with the same strength of the current and the same
dimensions, a plate of bismuth of 0*079 millim. in thickness gave
deviations five or six times as great as a gold-leaf 0-000087 millim.
in thickness. Hall's effect may be obtained in bismuth even when
a simple steel bar is substituted for an electromagnet.
   I have lately succeeded in constructing very thin bars of bismuth
regular enough to give them the ordinary form of the cross. When
one or the other pole of a small bar-magnet is brought near the
plate, the Hall effect is obtained powerful enough to produce a
deviation of half a metre of the scale, and which is permanent if
the magnet is left in its place. I am working now at the produc
tion of very thin plates of bismuth, and I am convinced that I
shall succeed in obtaining Hall's effect by the action of terrestrial
magnetism alone.—Journal de Physique, November 1883.

 XII. Examination o/Mt. Alfred R. Wallace's Modification of
    the Physical Theory of Secular Changes of Climate. By
    James Ckoll, LL.D., F.R.SS
 ON the publication of ' Island Life,' upwards of three years
        ago, the author kindly favoured me with a copy. He
at the same time wrote to me stating that the volume contained
some modifications of my theory of secular changes of climate,
to which he had been led by a careful consideration of the
subject, and that he would be glad to have an expression of
my opinion in regard to his results. Deeply interested as I,
of course, felt in the matter, I was however compel'ed, owing
to the state of my health, to leave the volume unread till
within the last few months. This fact will account for the
appearance of the following remarks at this somewhat late
date.
   I have read the chapters relating to Geological Climate with
the greatest amouut of interest and pleasure, and have to thank
the author for his very clear and able exposition and defence
of the main points of my theory. It appears to me, however,
that what Mr. Wallace regards as modifications are in some
cases really necessary parts of the theory. These may not,
it is true, have been in all cases expressed by me, but they
are nevertheless implied in the theory. Other points, again,
regarded as modifications are simply facts lying altogether
outside of the theory, which can in no way affect it. With

82              Dr. J. Croll on the Physical Theory
much that Mr. Wallace has advanced in explanation of geolo
gical climate I fully agree ; but I am, nevertheless, wholly
unable to perceive that any of his arguments or considera
tions do in reality materially affect the theory advocated in
' Climate and Time.' This I hope presently to show.
    Before proceeding, however, to examine in detail Mr. Wal
lace's modifications of the theory, it may be as well to consider
one or two minor points on which I differ from him, as this
will save the necessity of referring to them when we come to
discuss his main argument.
    Effect of Winter Solstice in Aphelion.— At page 126 (' Island
Life') he says:—"We may therefore say generally, that during
our northern winter, at the time of the glacial epoch, the
northern hemisphere was receiving so much less heat from the
sun as to lower its surface-temperature on an average about
35° F., while during the height of summer of the same period
it would be receiving so much more heat as would suffice to
raise its mean temperature about 60° F. above what it is now."
In a footnote he adds that " the reason of the increase of
summer heat being 60° while the decrease of winter cold is
only 35°, is because our summer is now below and our winter
above the average."
   There is surely a confusion of ideas here. It is of course
true that, as our summer at present occurs in aphelion and our
winter in perihelion, the temperature of the former is below
and that of the latter above the average ; but this can afford
no grounds for the result Mr. Wallace attributes to it unless it
be assumed (for which there are no astronomical grounds)
that our summer is 25° furtlier below the average than our
winter is above it.
    On the Storage of Cold.—In a section on the Effects of Snow
on Climate, Mr. Wallace points out the different effects pro
duced by water falling as a liquid in the form of rain and as a
solid in the form of snow. The rain, however much of it may
fall, runs off rapidly, he states, without producing any perma
nent effect on temperature. But if snow falls, it lies where it
fell, and becomes compacted into a mass which keeps the earth
below and the air above, at or near the freezing-point. When
the snow becomes perpetual, as on the summits of high moun
tains, permanent cold is the result ; and however strong the
sun's rays may be, the temperature of both the air and the
earth cannot possibly rise much above the freezing-point.
"This," he says, "is illustrated by the often-quoted fact that
at 80° N. lat. Captain Scoresby had the pitch melted on the
one side of his ship by the heat of the sun, while water was
freezing on the other side owing to the coldness of the air."

                  of Secular Changes of Climate.                83
 Doubtless this is perfectly correct ; but on page 502 he states
 that he has pointed out with more precision than has, he
 believes, hitherto been done, the different effects on climate of
 water in the liquid and solid states. This is a somewhat
 doubtful statement; for in chapter iv. ' Climate and Time,' in
  Phil. Mag. March 1870, and in other, places, will, I think,
 be found all that this section contains. In fact the influence
 of snow and ice as a permanent source of cold is one of the
 main factors of my theory. The three great factors are
 (1) the influence of snow and ice, (2) the influence of aqueous
 vapour, and (3) the influence of ocean-currents. How per
 sistently has it been urged as an objection to my theory that,
 during the glacial epoch, the great heat of the perihelion
 summer would more than counterbalance the effect of the
 aphelion winter. But I have maintained that the summers,
 notwithstanding the intensity of the sun's rays, instead of
 being warmer than at present, would in reality be far colder;
 for this reason, that the temperature of a snow-and-ico covered
 country can never rise much above the freezing-point. As an
 example of this I pointed out that, ' were it not for ice, the
 summers of North Greenland would be as warm as those of
 England (whereas in point of fact they are colder than our
 winters) ; and that were India covered with an ice-sheet, its
 summers would be colder than those of England.'
    " Another point," he says, "of great importance in con
nexion with this subject is the fact, that this permanent
storing-up of cold depends entirely on the annual amount of
snowfall in proportion to that of the sun- and air-heat, and
not on the actual cold of winter, or even on the average
cold of the year." This, I have shown (American Journal
of Science, Oct. '1883 ; Phil. Mag. Oct. 1883) at considerable
length, is one of the most widespread and fundamental errors
within the whole range of geological climatology. Perpetual
snow, instead of being due " entirely " to the annual amount
of snowfall in proportion to the quantity of heat received by
the snow, is in most cases not oven mainly due to this cause.
Overlooking the fact that in the conservation of snow the
temperature of the snow is one of the main factors has been
a fruitful source of error.
    High Land and Heavy Snowfall in relation to the Glacial
Epoch.—According to Mr. Wallace, " high land and great
moisture " are essential to the initiation of a glacial epoch.
Undoubtedly high land and great moisture are the most favour
able conditions for bringing about a glacial state of things ;
but I can hardly agree with him that they are necessary and
indispensable.
                                Cx2

8-1             Dr. J. Croll on the Physical Theory
    As to the second of these conditions, great moisture is evi
dently necessary only in order to produce a great snowfall ;
a great snowfall is necessary only in order that the snow may
become permanent; and the permanent snow in turn is neces
sary only in order to have permanent glaciation. But it has
already been shown* that we frequently have permanent snow
with a very light snowfall, even where the direct heat of
the sun is excessive, as on the summits of lofty mountains.
 Greenland, for example, has but a very small snowfall, and
yet the snow and ice are perpetual. What is necessary is,
that the small amount which falls should not all melt. If
 this be the case, the ice will accumulate year by year, and a
glacial condition will ultimately result.
    Suppose that the annual precipitation of snow on a conti
 nent is equivalent to only 10 inches of ice, and that at the end
 of each summer one inch remains unmelted, then, in this case,
 the ice will continue to accumulate year by year until the
quantity annually discharged by the outward motion from the
 centre of dispersion equals that annually formed. But in
 the case of a continent, this condition can be attained only
 when the sheet at the centre becomes of enormous thickness.
 Whether high land be necessary to a glacial epoch or not,
 it is evident that a heavy snowfall is not an indispensable
 condition.
    As to the second of these conditions, namely High Land,
 it must be borne in mind that the question is not, Could the
  causes which are now in operation bring about a glacial con
  dition of things without high land ? but, Could those physical
  agencies brought into operation during a high state of eccen
  tricity produce a glacial state of things without high land ?
  Mr. Wallace's answer is that they could not. But I am not
  satisfied with the grounds on which he bases this opinion. A
  necessary condition to a glacial epoch is, of course, the exist
  ence of perpetual snow; for without perpetual snow there
  could be no permanent land-ice. The question then is, Could
  not those physical agencies brought into operation during a
  high state of eccentricity cover lowlands with perpetual snow
  without the aid of highlands ? Mr. Wallace replies, " Per
  petual snow nowhere exists on lowlands." Supposing this
  were true (I have endeavoured to show it is notf), still it does
  not follow that perpetual snow may not have existed on low
  lands, or that, when the present condition of things changes, it
  may not yet exist. It is not difficult to conceive how, under

                   of Secular Chanpes of Climate.                        85
 certain conditions, the snow-line may in some places have
 been brought to the sea-level. In arctic, or even in subarctic
 regions, an excessively heavy snowfall, followed by piercingly
 cold winds from the north, during the whole of the summer
months, would keep the snow at a low temperature, and cer
tainly prevent it from disappearing. Keep- the surface of the
snow at or below the freezing-point, and melting will not take
place, no matter how intense the sun's rays may be. A strong
wind below the freezing-point will cool the surface of the snow
more rapidly than the sun can manage to heat it. Another
cause which would tend to keep the snow at a low temperature
would be that, along with a cold northerly wind, there is
usually a great diminution of aqueous vapour, thus allowing
the surface of the snow to radiate its heat more freely into
stellar space. For were it not for the aqueous vapour in the
atmosphere, the snow-line, even at the equator, would descend
to the sea-level*.
    Perhaps it is owing to the warm southerly winds of the
two midsummer months that Siberia, even with its incon
siderable snowfall, is not at the present day covered with per
manent snow and ice. Mr. Wallace mentions that " in Siberia,
within and near the Arctic circle, about six feet of snow covers
the country all the winter and spring, and is not sensibly
diminished by the powerful sun so long as northerly winds
keep the air below the freezing-point, and occasional snow
storms occur. But early in June the wind usually changes
to southerly, and under its influence the snow all disappears
in a few days." But what would be the consequence were
these northerly winds to continue during the whole of June
and July ? It would probably be that the snow of autumn
would begin to fall before that of spring had disappeared.
Were this to result, the country would soon become covered
with permanent ice. Matters would be still worse if these
southerly winds, instead of ceasing, were simply to change
from June and July to December and January, for then, in
place of producing a melting effect, they would greatly add
to the snowfall.
    Such a condition of things may never have obtained on the
plains of Siberiaf; but I have shown in my paper on the Ice
of Greenland and the Antarctic regionsj that there are cer
tainly good grounds for concluding that during the glacial

   f Phil. Mag. for November 1883.

8(5            Dr. J. Croll on the Physical Theory
epoch, and even at a date more recent, permanent ice must
have begun to accumulate on lowlands, which could not have
been the case had not the ground been previously covered
with perpetual snow.
    The only Continental Ice on tlie Globe probably on Loic-
lands.—The only two continents on the globe covered by
permanent ice and snow are Greenland and the Antarctic.
But are these continents to be regarded as high lands or as
low lands ? Mr. Wallace maintains that they are high lands.
" It is," he says, " only where there are lofty mountains or
elevated plateaus, as in Greenland &c, that glaciers accom
panied by perpetual snow cover the country. The north
polar area is free from any accumulation of permanent ice,
excepting the high lands of Greenland and Grinnell Land."
And in regard to the Antarctic continent he says, " The much
greater quantity of ice at the south pole is undoubtedly due
to the presence of a large extent of high land." Were it not
for these extensive highlands and lofty mountains, Greenland
and the Antarctic regions, according to Mr. Wallace's theory,
would be free from permanent snow and ice. He, however,
 nowhere, so far as I can find, offers any proof for the conclu
 sion that those regions possess extensive highlands, elevated
plateaus, and lofty mountains sufficient to account for these
 icy mantles. In the paper just referred to (Phil. Mag. No
vember 1883) I have discussed this subject at considerable
length, and have arrived at conclusions diametrically the
 opposite of those advocated by Mr. Wallace, viz. that Green
 land and probably the greater part of the Antarctic regions
 consist, of land probably not much above sea-level, and that
 the mass of ice under which they are buried must be due to
 some other cause than elevation of the land.
       Mr. Wallace's Modification of the T/ieory Examined.
    Mr. Wallace's chief, and, I may say, only real modification
 of my theory is this. I give it in his own words:—
    " The alternate phases of precession—causing the winter of each
 hemisphere to be in aphelion and perihelion each 10,500 years—
 would produce a complete change of climate only where a country
 was partially snow-clad ; while, wheneter a large area became
 almost wholly buried in snow and ice, as was certainly the case with
 Northern Europe during the glacial epoch, then the glacial con
 ditions would be continued, and perhaps e\cn intensified, when the
 sun approached nearest to the earth in winter, instead of there
 being at the time, as Mr. Croll maintains, an almost perpetual
 spring."—P. 503.
    " When geographical conditions and eccentricity combine to

                  of Secular Changes of Climate.                    87
produce a severe glacial epoch, the changing phases of precession
have very little, if any, effect on the character of the climate, as
mild or glacial, though it may modify the seasons ; but when the
eccentricity becomes moderate and the resulting climate less severe,
then the changing phases of precession bring about a considerable
alteration and even a partial reversal of the climate."—P. 153.
   Again,— " It follows that towards the equatorial limits of a glaci
ated country alternations of climate may occur during a period of
high eccentricity, while near the pole, where the whole country is
completely ice-clad, no amelioration may take place. Exactly the
same thing will occur inversely with mild Arctic climates."—
P. 154.
   I have, on the contrary, maintained that the more severe
the glacial condition of the one hemisphere, the warmer and
the more equable would necessarily be that of the other; for
the very same combination of causes which would tend to
cool the one hemisphere would necessarily tend to warm the
other. The process to a large extent consists of a transfer
ence of heat from the one hemisphere to the other. Conse
quently the one hemisphere could not be heated without the
other being cooled, or the one cooled without the other being
heated. The hotter the one, the colder the other, and the
colder the one, the hotter the other. It therefore follows
that the more severe the glacial conditions, the warmer and
more equable must be the interglacial warm periods. But,
according to Mr. Wallace, there could be no warm inter
glacial periods, either in temperate or polar regions, except
during the commencement and towards the close of a glacial
epoch.
   Before, however, proceeding to examine in detail the steps
by which he arrives at this modification of my theory, it will
be as well that the reader should have a clear and distinct
knowledge of what that theory really is, and what it professes
to explain. These I shall now briefly state in the most
general terms, for misapprehension in regard to the main
features of the theory lie at the root of most of the objections
which have been urged against it.
   General Statement of the Theory.—1st. It is not professed
that the theory will account for the condition of climate during
all past geological ages. It treats mainly of the cause of
Glacial Epochs; and one of its essential elements is that these
epochs consist of alternate changes, to a greater or less extent,
of cold and warm periods; or, in other words, that glacial
epochs must consist of alternate glacial and interglacial
periods. The chief, though not the sole, aim of the theory is
to account for geological climate in so far as such epochs are

88              Dr. J. Croll on the Physical Theory
concerned. Although it could be satisfactorily shown, for
example, and this has certainly not yet been done, that during
some past geological age, such as the Miocene, the Eocene,
or the Cretaceous, the climate was throughout uniformly warm
or subtropical, this would not prove that the theory was wrong,
unless it could at the same time be shown that the necessary
conditions demanded by the theory did then exist. But in
stead of this supposed condition of climate during Secondary
and Tertiary periods being inconsistent with my theory, the
fact is, as we shall see by and by, that this theory affords
the only rational explanation of such a state of things which
has yet been given.
    2nd. The theory is not that a high state of eccentricity will
necessarily produce a glacial epoch. No misapprehension
has been more widespread or more difficult to remove than
this. From the very commencement I have maintained that
no amount of eccentricity, however great, could produce a
glacial condition of things; that the Glacial Epoch was the
result, not of a high state of eccentricity, but of a combina
tion of Physical Agencies, brought into operation by means
of this high state *. As an example of this misapprehension,
how frequently has the present condition of the planet Mars
been adduced as evidence against the theory. The eccentri
city of Mars's orbit is at present greater than that of the
Earth's even when at its superior limit; and its southern
winter solstice is not far removed from aphelion. It is there
fore maintained that, if my theory of the cause of the glacial
epoch be correct, the southern hemisphere of Mars ought to
be under a glacial condition, and the northern enjoying a
perpetual spring—and this, as is well known, is not the
 case. Here it is assumed that, according to the theory, eccen
tricity alone ought to produce a glacial epoch, irrespective of
the necessary physical conditions. We know with certainty
that those physical conditions which, according to the theorjr,
were the direct cause of the glacial epoch on our globe, can
 not possibly exist on the planet Mars t- Just take one ex
ample : either the properties of water on the planet Mars or
 the conditions of its atmosphere must be totally different from
 those of our earth; for were our earth removed to Mars's dis
 tance from the sun, our seas would soon become solid ice and
 we could have neither snow nor rain, ocean-currents, nor any
 of the necessary conditions for secular change of climate.
 This is doubtless not the present state of Mars; but the reason
 of this can only be that the physical and meteorological con-
    * For this reason I prefer to term the theory the Physical Theory
 rather than the Eccentricity Theory, as it has been called by some writers,
   t See ' Climate and Time,' p. 79.

                 of Secular Changes of Climate.                89
ditions of the planet must be wholly different from those of
the earth.
   When we reflect that a very slight change in the properties
of aqueous vapour, or in the condition of our atmosphere,
would effectually prevent the possibility of a glacial epoch
occurring on our earth, notwithstanding a high state of eccen
tricity, we need not wonder that the planet Mars is not in a
state of glaciation. But the eccentricity of Mars, though
high, is still far from its superior limit, and the planet may
yet, for any thing which we know to the contrary, pass through
a glacial epoch.
   3rd. Another prevailing misapprehension is the supposition
that the theory does not recognize the necessity for geogra
phical conditions. In reading ' Island Life ' one might be
apt to suppose that one of the chief points of difference be
tween Mr. Wallace and myself is that he regards geographical
distribution of sea and land as an important factor in a theory
of geological climate, whereas I entirely ignore this condition.
Nothing could be further from the truth than such a suppo
sition, lean boldly affirm that the necessity for geographical
conditions is as truly a part of my theory as of Mr. Wallace's
modification thereof.
   One of the most important agencies, according to my view,
is the enormous amount of heat conveyed from equatorial to
temperate and polar regions by means of ocean-currents, and
the deflection of this heat, during a high state of eccentricity,
from the one hemisphere to the other. But all this depends
on ocean-currents flowing from equatorial to polar regions;
and the existence of these currents in turn depends, to a large
extent, on the contour of the continents and the particular
distribution of sea and land. Take, as one example, the Gulf-
stream, a current which played so important a part in the
phenomena of the glacial epoch. A very slight change in
geographical conditions, such as the opening of communica
tion between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific, would have
greatly diminished, if not entirely destroyed, that stream. Or,
as I showed on a former occasion, a change in the form or
contour of the north-east corner of the South- American con
tinent would have deflected the great equatorial current, the
feeder of the Gulf-stream, into the Southern Ocean and away
from the Carribean Sea. One of the main causes of the ex
treme condition of things in North-western Europe, as well as
in eastern parts of America, during the glacial epoch, was a
large withdrawal of the warm waters of the Gulf-stream; and
this was to a great extent due, as I stated in my very first
paper on the subject *, to the position of Cape St. Boque,
                    • Phil. Map. for August 1864.

 90            Dr. J. Croll on the Physical Theory
 which deflected the equatorial current into the Southern Ocean.
 That a geographical distribution of land and water permitting
 of the existence and deflection of those heat-bearing currents
 is one of the main factors in my theory is what must be
 obvious to every reader of ' Climate and Time.'
    The difference between Mr. Wallace and myself is this:—
 I maintain that with the present distribution of land and
water, without calling in the aid of any other geographical
conditions than now obtain, those physical agencies detailed
in ' Climate and Time ' are perfectly sufficient to account
for all the phenomena of the glacial epoch, including those
intercalated warm periods, during which Greenland would pro
bably be free from ice and the Arctic regions enjoying a mild
climate ; while Mr. Wallace, on the other hand, maintains
that without assuming some change in the geographical con
ditions of our globe those physical agencies will not account
for that state of things, at least in so far as the disappearance
of the ice in Arctic regions is concerned.
   To narrow the field of inquiry, and bring more prominently
before the mind the real question at issue, I shall state the
main points on which Mr. Wallace and I appear to agree.
   Points of agreement.—1. Mr. Wallace agrees with mo that a
high state of eccentricity could never directly produce a glacial
condition of climate; that the glacial epoch was the direct
result, not of a high state of eccentricity, but of a combination
of physical agencies brought into operation by means of this
high state.
    I. He agrees with me also in regard to what these physical
agencies really were; for the agencies to which he refers in
his ' Island Life ' are almost identically those which I have
advanced in ' Climate and Time ' and elsewhere.
   3. Mr. Wallace agrees with me in regard to the mutual
reactions of the physical agents. He maintains with me that
these physical agencies not only all lead to one result—the
accumulation of snow and ice—but that their efficiency in
bringing about this result is strengthened by their mutual
reactions on one another. At pp. 137-139 he gives a variety
of examples of these mutual reactions, and says that they
" produce a maximum of effect which, without their aid,
would be altogether unattainable."
   4. As has already been shown, we both agree as to the
necessity of certain geographical conditions for the produc
tion of the glacial epoch. For although that epoch was
mainly brought about by the physical agencies, yet these
agencies could not have produced the required effect unless
the necessary geographical conditions had been supplied,
these being necessary for their effective operation.

                     of Secular Changes of Climate.                      91
    5. Mr. Wallace admits, of course, that the necessary geo
graphical conditions existed during the glacial epoch ; for,
unless this had been the case, no glacial epoch could have oc
curred. Therefore all that was required to produce glaciation
was an amount of eccentricity sufficient to set the physical
agencies into operation. Be it observed, it did not require, in
addition to the physical agencies, some changes in the geo
graphical conditions, or some new conditions ; for the geogra
phical conditions being existent, all that was then required to
bring about the glacial epoch was the operation of the physical
agencies. The overlooking of this fact has led to much con
fusion. For example, 210,000 years ago, with winter in
aphelion, "the problem to be solved," says Mr. Wallace,
" is, whether the snow that fell in winter would accumulate to
such an extent that it would not be melted in summer, and
so go on increasing year by year till it covered the whole of
Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, and much of England. Dr.
Croll and Dr. Geikie answer without hesitation that it would.
Sir Charles Lyell maintained that it would only do so when
geographical conditions were favourable " (p. 136). Here
we have a complete misapprehension of the relation between
Sir Charles LyelPs views and mine ; for I would certainly
maintain (and, I presume, Dr. Geikie also) as emphatically
as Sir Charles could do, " that it would only do so when
geographical conditions were favourable." For undoubtedly,
according to the theory advocated in ' Climate and Time,' no
glacial epoch could result without geographical conditions
suitable for the operation of the physical agencies ; and this
is virtually what Sir Charles maintains. The glacial epoch
resulted during the last period of high eccentricity because
the geographical conditions suitable for the effective operation
of the physical causes then existed.
     6. It is assumed in ' Climate and Time ' that, with the excep
tion of those resulting from oscillations of sea-level, afterwards
to be considered, the general distribution of sea and land,
and other geographical conditions, were the same during the
glacial epoch as they are at present*. Consequently, in ac
counting for the glacial epoch I had only to consider the
    * Prof. J. Geikie, however, believes that during early Postglacial times
a considerable change in the physical geography of tlie North seas took
place (see ' Prehistoric Europe,' chap. xxi.). In'order to account for the
 floras of Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands, he thinks a land
connexion must have existed between these places and Scandinavia. For
reasons which will be stated on a future occasion I am somewhat doubtful
on this point. There is, I think, an important agent overlooked in
the question of the distribution of Arctic flora and fauna. Prof. Geikie,
however, does not believe that the climatic condition of that period was
in any way due to this change.

effects resulting from those physical agencies called into
operation by an increase of eccentricity. To have speculated
on hypothetical geographical conditions different from those
which now obtain, and on the influence which these may have
had in bringing about the glacial epoch, would have been on
my part perfectly absurd, as I knew we had no evidence of
the existence of any such conditions. Besides, my aim was
to account for that epoch from known and established facts
and principles without the introduction of hypothetical causes.
I fear that the fact of my making little or no allusion to
geographical conditions in my explanations may have unfor
tunately led Mr. Wallace and others to conclude that I alto
gether ignore, or, at least, undervalue their importance, which
is certainly not the case.
   Although Mr. Wallace so frequently alludes to the impor
tance of geographical conditions, I am not sure if he believes
that during the glacial epoch those conditions differed mate
rially from what they are at present, or that glaciation could
have been greatly influenced by any difference which did
exist.
   7. Mr. Wallace alludes to one or two geographical condi
tions which, if they had existed during the glacial epoch,
would have greatly aided glaciation : as, for example, if a
land-barrier had extended from the British Isles, across the
Faroe Islands and Iceland to Greenland, cutting oft' from
Northern Europe the warm waters of the Atlantic, including
the Gulf-Stream. " The result," he says, " would almost
certainly be that snow would accumulate on the high moun
tains of Scandinavia till they became glaciated to as great an
extent as Greenland."
   It would be easy to multiply cases of this kind where a
distribution of land and water different from the present might
have been more favourable to glaciation than the present ;
but the question is, Did any such difference favouring glaci
ation actually exist during the glacial epoch ? 1 have never
been able to find any evidence that it did. Many a change
in geographical conditions has taken place during Tertiary
times, some of which were doubtless favourable to glaciation ;
but have we any evidence that during the glacial epoch the
geographical conditions were more favourable than they
are at present ? Unless this can be shown to be the case,
there is no necessity for referring to a difference in geogra
phical conditions during that epoch as a cause of glaciation.
This being so, it does not follow, because in my explanation
of the cause of the glacial epoch I may not, like Sir Charles
Lyell and others, have speculated on the effects which might

                of Secular Changes of Climate.                 93
have resulted had the distribution of land and water been
different from what it is now, that I ought on this account to
be charged with undervaluing the importance of geographical
conditions.
   Mr. Wallace refers to one case of a difference in geogra
phical conditions which he thinks might have aided glacia-
tion. Prof. Dana has expressed the opinion that, during the
height of the glacial epoch, North-eastern America was con
siderably elevated, bringing the wide area of the banks of
Newfoundland far above water. This, Mr. Wallace thinks,
would reduce the southward-flowing Arctic currents, causing
the icebergs to hang about the American shores, chilling the
air so as to produce constant fogs and clouds with almost
perpetual snow-showers, even at midsummer. But Prof.
Dana has also shown tbat during the glacial epoch North
eastern America was depressed as well as elevated. Now the
point is, whether the elevation was contemporaneous with the
cold, or with the warm periods of the glacial epoch ? Mr.
Wallace himself admits that depression, not elevation, of
the land accompanied the increased coid ; and he quotes
Mr. Searles V. Wood, jun., approvingly as holding the same
opinion (p. 115). It was quite natural for Prof. Dana to
suppose that the elevation to which he refers occurred at the
time the country was buried under ice ; for when he wrote
he believed the glacial epoch was chiefly due to elevation of
the land caused by the lateral pressure resulting from the
shrinking of the earth's crust. It is now, however, pretty
well established that the continental or elevated periods of
the glacial epoch, when our island was united to the main
land, were warm periods ; for it was then that this country
was invaded by tropical and subtropical mammalia. Had the
climate at that time been cold, and the country even partially
covered with snow and ice, these animals would not have
made their appearance. It is therefore probable that the
elevation to which Prof. Dana refers may have taken place
during some of those warm periods. But be this as it may,
even were it proved that during the glacial epoch geographical
conditions were more favourable for the formation ot ice than
the present, this would not affect the general conclusion at
 which I wish to arrive.
    Trusting that these preliminary considerations may tend to
 remove the partial confusion in which this somewhat complex
 subject has been involved, I shall now proceed to examine Mr.
 Wallace's main argument. I shall consider it, first, in rela
 tion to physical principles, and, secondly, in relation to geolo
 gical and palaeontological facts.

94              Dr. J. Croll on the Physical Theory
   I. Physics in relation to Mr. Wallace's Modification of the
                               Theory.
    The grand modification, that during the height of the glacial
epoch the snow and ice would not disappear when precession
brought the winter solstice round to perihelion, I have already
given in Mr. Wallace's own words. As the reasons which he
assigns for this modification are very briefly stated by him, I
may here give them also in his words.
   After describing the state of North-eastern America and the
North Atlantic, to which I have already alluded, he says :—
   " But when such was the state of the North Atlantic (and, how
ever caused, such must have been its state during the height of the
glacial epoch), can we suppose that the mere change from the
distant sun in winter and near sun in summer, to the reverse,
could bring about any important alteration—(lie physical and geo
graphical causes of glaciation remaining unchanged ? For, certainly,
the less powerful sun of summer, even though lasting somewhat
longer, could not do more than the much more powerful sun did
during the phase of summer in perihelion, while during the less
severe winters the sun would have far less power than when it was
equally near and at a very much greater altitude in summer. It
seems to me, therefore, quite certain that whenever extreme glaci-
ation has been brought about by high eccentricity combined with
favourable geographical and physical causes (and without this com
bination it is doubtful whether extreme glaciation would ever occur),
then the ice-sheet will not be removed during the alternate phases
of precession, so long as these geographical and physical causes
remain unaltered. It is true that the warm and cold oceanic cur
rents, which are the most important agents in increasing or dimi
nishing glaciation, depend for their strength and efficiency upon
the comparative extents of the northern and southern ice-sheets ;
but these ice-sheets cannot, I believe, increase or diminish to any
important extent unless some geographical or physical chauge first
occurs."—P. 150.
   Again, —" It is quite evident that during the height of the glacial
epoch there was a combination of causes at work which led to a
large portion of North-western Europe and East ern America being
buried in ice to a greater extent even than Greenland. Among
these causes we must reckon a diminution of the force of the (4ulf-
Stream, or its being diverted from the north-western coasts of
Europe ; and what we have to consider is, whether the alteration
from a long cold winter and short hot summer, to a short mild
winter and long cool summer would greatly affect the amount of
ice if tfte ocean-currents remained the same. The force of these
currents is, it is true, by our hypothesis modified by the increase
or diminution of the ice in the two hemispheres alternately, and
they then react upon climate ; but they cannot be thus changed

                  of Secular Changes of Climate.                       95
till after the ice-accumulation has been considerably affected by
other causes."—P. 148.
    There are some further reasons assigned, which will be
considered as we proceed.
    From what has already been shown, it will be seen that the
causes which led to the glacial epoch may be classed under
three distinct groups :—(l)the astronomical, (2) the physical,
and (3) the geographical. This threefold division is dis
tinctly recognized by Mr. Wallace in the above quotations,
as weir as in all his reasoning on the subject of geological
climate.
    In the astronomical group the main elements are the two
following :—1st. A high state of eccentricity producing, on
the hemisphere whose winter solstice happens to be in aphe
lion, a long and cold winter with a short and hot summer,
and on the other hemisphere, whose winter solstice, of course,
at the time is in perihelion, a short and mild winter with a
long and cool summer: 2nd. Precession, transferring these
conditions from the one hemisphere to the other alternately
every 10,000 or 12,000 years. The physical elements are,
of course, the influence of snow and ice, ocean-currents,
aqueous vapour, clouds, fogs, and a host of other things
which have already been discussed at length* ; while the
geographical consist of the particular distribution of land
and water, elevations or depressions in the sea-bottom, con
tour of the sea-coast, and other geographical conditions influ
encing the flow of ocean-currents.
    It is to the influence of physical agencies, however, that
the glacial epoch is more directly due. The main function
of the astronomical agents is to set and keep the physical
agencies in operation, and also to determine the character of
their operations. For example, the position of the winter
solstice in relation to the aphelion or to the perihelion, during
 a high state of eccentricity, determines whether the physical
 agencies will produce on a given hemisphere a glacial or a
 warm condition of climate ; while precession determines which
 of the two hemispheres shall be the glaciated and which the
 warm.       In one respect wo may say that the astronomical
 causes produce glaciation by means of the physical agencies.
    The geographical conditions, however, cannot properly be
 considered to be causes in the sense in which the astronomical
 and physical are. They are more properly conditions to the
 production of a glacial epoch than causes. They cannot be
    » ' Climate and Time,' chap. iv. ; ' American Journal of Science,' Oct.
 1883; Phil. Mag. Oct. 1883.

 96            Dr. J. Croll on the Physical Tlieory
said to act in the production of glaciation. They are rather
permanent and passive conditions enabling the active causes
to produce their required effects. Had the glacial epoch
 resulted from elevation of the land, as some geologists sup
pose, then this elevation might properly be said to have been
the cause of the glacial epoch ; but the glacial epoch was
produced by no such means, nor by any change in the phy
sical geography of the globe. A certain geographical condition
of things was, of course, requisite in order to the effective
operation of the astronomical and physical causes. This
condition existed at the time of the glacial epoch ; and it is
only in this sense that that epoch can be referred to any thing
geographical.
    It is true that a cause, as Sir William Hamilton states,
may be defined as " all that without which the effect would
not happen ;" but this is far too general an expression of
cause for practical purposes. We therefore fix on the parti
cular antecedent or antecedents, through the activity of which
the event is mainly brought about, and term them the causes
of the event, and the others the necessary conditions.
   I cannot help thinking that the way in which geogra
phical conditions are spoken of as causes of the glacial epoch
has tended to confusion.
    During the glacial epoch there were frequent submergences
and elevations of the land, or rather oscillations of sea-level,
and these, it is true, would produce a change in the relative
extent of sea and land. But whether we suppose it to have
been the sea which rose and fell in relation to the land, or the
land in relation to the sea, it equally follows that the geo
graphical change resulting therefrom could not possibly have
been a cause of the glacial epoch. It is now a well-esta
blished fact that submergence accompanied glaciation'; the
glaciation may have been that which led to the submergence ;
but it could not possibly have been the submergence which
led to the glaciation. An elevation of the land would have
favoured glaciation, but submergence would not. Its ten
dency would rather be in the opposite direction. It is now
also established, that during the continental period, or period
of elevation, the climate was warm and equable ; for it was
then, as has been remarked, that this country was invaded b}r
tropical and subtropical animals. Now it is equally plain
that the elevation could not have been the cause of the neat.
Elevation of the land might produce cold, but it could not
have been a cause of the heat. It follows therefore that the
geographical change resulting from submergence or elevation
of the land canuot be regarded as a cause of the glacial epoch ;

                  of Secular Changes of Climate.               97
  for its effect on climate, if it had any, was in opposition to
  that of the astronomical and physical agencies. It would
  prove a hindrance, not a help.
     Referring now to Mr. Wallace's argument : When glacial
  conditions in the North Atlantic attained their maximum
  development, " can we suppose," he asks, " that the mere
  change from the distant sun in winter, and near sun in
  summer to the reverse, could bring about any important
  alteration—the physical and geographical causes of glaciation
  remaining unchanged ?" Here, to begin with, we have an
 impossible state of things assumed. It is assumed in this
 question that it is possible for the winter solstice to pass
 from aphelion to perihelion, and the physical causes to remain
 unchanged. It is assumed as possible that the astronomical
 conditions might be reversed without a reversal of the physical.
    When the winter solstice is in aphelion it sets in operation
 many physical causes, the tendency of which is to produce
 an accumulation of snow and ice ; but when the solstice-
 point moves round to the perihelion, the tendency of these
 causes is reversed, and they then undo what they had previ
 ously done—melt the snow and ice which they had just pro
 duced. Now, what Mr. Wallace asks is this : When, owing
 to the winter solstice being in aphelion during a high state
 of eccentricity, a glacial condition of things is produced, will
the fact of the solstice-point being moved round to perihelion
remove the glacial condition, if thephysical causes remain un
changed in t/ieir mode of operation ? My reply is, it certainly
would not. Here it is assumed that the physical causes are
working in opposition to the astronomical ; that when the
solstice is in perihelion the action of the physical causes,
instead of being reversed, as it should be according to theory,
still continues to produce and maintain a glacial state of
things, the same as it did when the solstice-point was in
aphelion ; and he asks, will the astronomical causes in this
struggle manage to overpower the physical and produce a
melting of the ice? I unhesitatingly reply, no ; for the
physical causes are far more powerful than the astronomical.
The astronomical causes, as we have seen, are perfectly unable
to produce a glacial state of things without the aid of the
physical. How, then, could we expect that they could re
move this glacial state if the physical causes were actually
working against them ?
   In thus setting the physical causes against the astronomical,
Mr. Wallace is basing his argument for the nondisappearance
of the snow and ice on a state of things which cannot possibly
under the circumstances exist. His question, to have con-
   Phil. Mug. S. 5. Vol. 17. No. 104. Feb. 1884.         H

08            Dr. J. Croll an the Physical Theory
sistency, should be this :—When glacial conditions were at
their height &c, " can we suppose that the mere change from
the distant sun in winter and the near sun in summer, to the
reverse, could bring about any important alteration—the geo
graphical causes of glaciation remaining unchanged ?" If the
question is put thus, and it is the only form in which it can be
put to be consistent with the theory which Mr. Wallace him
self advocates, then my reply is, that the change from the
distant sun in winter and near sun in summer to the near
sun in winter and distant sun in summer, aided by the change
in the physical causes which this would necessarily bring
about, would certainly be sufficient to cause the snow and
ice to disappear without any change in the geographical
condition of things. The combined influence of the astro
nomical and physical causes, when the winter solstice is in
perihelion, is perfectly sufficient to undo all that they had
previously done when the solstice was in aphelion. When the
action of the causes is reversed, the effects will be reversed.
   Had the glacial epoch been produced by geographical
causes, then it is probable thai the ice would not have dis
appeared till these causes were changed. Had the ice, for
example, been simply due to an elevation of the land, as some
have argued, then it would not probably have disappeared till
the land became lowered. But it was the result ot no such
cause. It was due, not to an elevation of the land, but to a
number of physical causes, brought into operation by a high
state of eccentricity. This Mr. Wallace fully admits and
maintains. A certain geographical state of things was, of
course, necessary to enable the astronomical and physical
causes to produce the required effect ; and this was really all
that geographical conditions had to do in the matter. Let
this be observed, however, that the same geographical condition
of things which favours the accumulation of ice when the
winter solstice is in aphelion, favours its disappearance when
the solstice is in perihelion. This is obvious, because the
same combination of physical agencies which makes the
hemisphere in aphelion cold, makes the one in perihelion
warm. The heating of the one is, to a large extent, the re
sult of the cooling of the other. It is the transference of heat
by ocean-currents from the hemisphere in aphelion to the
one in perihelion which is a main reason why the former is
cold and the latter warm. Hence a change in geographical
 conditions is unnecessary for the disappearance of the ice on
 the hemisphere with the perihelion winter, whether that hemi
 sphere be the northern or the southern.
   The tendency of the combined influence of all the causes—

                   of Secular Changes of Clivuxte.            99
astronomical, physical, and geographical—is to cool the one
hemisphere and to warm the other, to accumulate the ice
on the one and remove it from the other. Consequently
 the same total combination of causes which will produce an
accumulation of ice on either hemisphere when the winter
 solstice is in aphelion will produce a melting of that ice when
 the solstice moves round to the perihelion.
    Another Impossible Condition assumed.—" What we have to
consider," says Mr. Wallace, " is whether the alteration from
a long cold winter and short hot summer, to a short mild
winter and long cool summer, would greatly affect the amount
of ice if tlie ocean-currents remained the same."   Here, again,
we have an impossible state of things assumed. It is assumed
that, nothwithstanding the change from an aphelion to a peri
helion winter, the ocean-currents would still remain the same.
And it is asked, would the astronomical causes in this case
remove the glaciation ? I would be disposed to say that they
would not.
   " The force of these currents," he adds, " are, it is true, by
our hypothesis modified by the increase or diminution of the
ice in the two hemispheres alternately (they depend for their
strength and efficiency upon the comparative extent of the
northern and southern ice-sheets), and they then react upon
climate ; but they cannot be thus changed till after the ice-
accumulation has been considerably affected by other causes."
   What, then, are the other causes which affect the ice-
accumulation and thus lead to a change in the ocean-currents ?
"These ice-sheets cannot, I believe," says Mr. Wallace,
" increase or diminish to any important extent unless some
geographical or physical change first occurs." The first thing
required to affect the ice-accumulation is thus a geographical
or a physical change. But we have just seen that the cha
racter of the physical causes depends upon the astronomical.
A change from a long cold winter and short hot summer to a
short mild winter and long cool summer would reverse the
operations of the physical causes and lead to a melting of the
ice. The physical causes therefore offer no barrier. What
more do we still require ? This we have in the following foot
note at page 150 :—" The ocean-currents are mainly due to
the difference of temperature of the polar and equatorial areas
combined with the peculiar form and position of the conti
nents, and some one or more of these factors must bo altered
before the ocean-currents towards the North Pole can be in
creased."
    One of these factors—change in the form and position of the
continents—may be left out of consideration; for we have no
                                  H2

  100             Dr. J. Croll on the Physical Theory
  evidence of any such change during the glacial epoch, except
  one, which, as has been already proved, could have had no effect.
   We must therefore look to a change in "the difference of tempe
  rature of the polar and equatorial areas " for any increase in the
  currents towards the north pole. And in order to bring about
  this change, " the only available factor," Mr. Wallace states,
  " is the antarctic ice; if this were largely increased, the north
  ward-flowing currents might be so increased as to melt some
  of the arctic ice. But without some geographical change the
  antarctic ice could not materially diminish during its winter
 perihelion, nor increase to any important extent during the
  opposite phase. We therefore seem to have no available
  agency by which to get rid of the ice over a glaciated country,
  so long as the geographical conditions remained unchanged and
 the eccentricity continued high."
     According to Mr. Wallace, the only available factor to
  produce a difference of temperature between the south-polar
  area and the equator, so as to increase the north-flowing
 currents and thus melt the arctic ice, would be an increase of
 the antarctic ice; but this he considers impossible without
 some geographical change. Without such a change, the ant
 arctic ice, he maintains, would neither be increased nor dimi
 nished. Hence it follows that without this change there is,
 according to Mr. Wallace's theory, no possibility of getting
 quit of our northern ice during interglacial periods.
    This sweeping conclusion seems to bo based on two as
 sumptions, both of which appear to me to be erroneous. First,
 that the " only " factor available is the antarctic ice ; and,
 secondly, that the antarctic ice can neither be increased nor
 diminished without some geographical change.
    A Geographical Change not necessary in order to remove the
 Antarctic Ice.—In reference to the first, that the antarctic
 ice is the " only " available factor, I shall presently show that
 there are other causes affecting the northward-flowing currents
 as powerfully as the antarctic ice. As to the second, that the
 antarctic ice can neither be increased nor diminished mate
 rially without some geographical change, this is an assumption
 based, no doubt, on the opinion which he holds that the ant
 arctic ice is due to the elevated nature of that continent. Of
 course if this opinion be correct, then, without a lowering of
 the land, the ice can never disappear or be greatly changed in
amount by astronomical or physical causes. But from what
has already been stated in a former article * in reference to
the condition of the Antarctic regions, I think it likely that
   * " The Ice of Greenland and the Antarctic Continent not due to Ele
vation of the Land," Phil. Maff. November 1883.

                   of Secular Changes of Climate.              101
they probably consist of low dismembered land or of gronps
of flat islands little elevated above sea-level, but all fused
together by one continuous sheet of ice. In fact, it seems
highly probable that a very large portion of the ice rests on
a surface which is under the sea-level. Victoria Land is, of
course, certainly elevated and mountainous, but the character
of the Antarctic icebergs shows that this state of things must
be the exception and not the rule in those regions.
   If this be the case, the antarctic ice is just in the condition
admitting of its being easily modified by warm currents from
equatorial regions. In fact at the very present day, as Dr.
Neumayer has shown, the slight southward deflections of the
warm westerly drift-current caused by the projecting land-
masses of Australia, Africa, and South America, cut notches
in the ice. When the southern winter solstice was in peri
helion during the glacial epoch, it is probable that the greater
part of the ice then disappeared.
   In fact this is a result which would be even still more likely
to occur were the views held by Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker
and some others as to the nature of the antarctic ice proved
to be correct. Sir Joseph thinks that much of the Antarctic
ice-sheet, thousands of feet in thickness as it is, was formed
by the successive accumulations of snow year by year on pack-
ice. The snowfall in the Antarctic regions he believes to be
enormous both during summer and winter; and as but a very
small portion of it melts, the accumulated snow is perfectly
sufficient to form such a sheet. He does not consider that
there is land enough in the south-polar area to supply the
astounding number and gigantic size of the icebergs that
infest the ocean between lat. 50° and 70°. If this theory
of Sir Joseph's be correct, and immense masses of the ice
are really afloat, we can easily understand how the whole
might, during a southern interglacial period, be broken up,
dispersed, and melted by an inflow of equatorial water.
   I think, however, that the whole of that enormous sheet
from which the icebergs are derived must be resting on the
ground, although it is very likely, as has been shown on a
former occasion *, that a very large portion of it may be on
the sea-bottom. The weight of evidence seems to favour
the assumption that probably the greater part of the Antarctic
regions, as has just been stated, consists of low flat groups of
islands separated by broad and shallow seas which have all
become filled with solid ice. It is quite possible that the ice
filling these seas may have originated in pack-ice, which ulti
mately became converted into a solid and continuous sheet by
                * Phil. Mag. November 1883, p. 357.

102               Dr. J. Croll on the Physical Theory
long ages of successive snowfalls. As layer after layer, con
 verted into ice, was being heaped upon it year by year, the
 mass would gradually sink till it rested on the sea-bottom *.
 After this it would assume all the characteristics of continental
 ice. Tn fact we have a condition of things exactly similar in
 the North Sea during the height of the glacial epoch (see
 ' Climate and Time/ p. 449).
     If such be the condition of the antarctic ice, we can readily
 understand how it might all soon disappear under the influ
 ence which would be brought to bear upon it were the eccen
 tricity high and the southern winter solstice in perihelion.
 The warm and equable conditions of climate which would then
 prevail, and the enormous quantity of intertropical water
 carried into the Southern Ocean, would soon produce a melting
 of the ice. Layer after layer would disappear off the surface,
 and as soon as the weight of the sheet became less than that
of the water which it had displaced, the sheet would float.
After this it would no doubt shortly break up and become
dispersed.
     Other Causes than Antarctic Ice affecting the Northward-
flowing Currents.—Tf we consider the effect which the present
 amount of eccentricity, small as it is, has on the climatic
condition of some parts of the southern hemisphere, we shall
readily understand how, during the glacial epoch, the warm
water of this hemisphere may have been impelled northward,
even independently of the influence of the Antarctic ice. In
order to show the present effect of eccentricity on climate I
cannot do better than quote Mr. Wallace's own words on the
subject. Referring to its effects on south temperate America,
he says:—
    " Those persons who still doubt the effect of winter in aphelion
with a high degree of eccentricity in producing glaciation, should
    * In this opinion I am glad to find that Sir Joseph to a certain extent
concurs, for in a letter to me on the subject he says :—" I cannot doubt but
that the icebergs have originated from the ice of the gTeat southern barrier ;
and what I suspect is that much of this barrier-ice originated in pack-ice
over very shallow bays, increased by successive snowfalls. The quantity
of snow that falls in summer is enormous south of latitude oOo-GO3. Cer
tainly it fell on half the days of each .summer month during the three
seasons we spent in those seas, and I think in one month snow fell every
day. There is no summer melting of snow and ice in the Antarctic as
 there is in the Arctic regions. It is the only region known to me where
there is perpetual snow on land at sea-level."'
    Now if the snow which falls in the Antarctic regions at the sea-level
 does not all melt, but some of it remains year by year, then permanent
 ice formed at the sea-level, whether it be on frozen pack or on the ground,
 must be a necessary consequence. If this be so, it cannot be true, as Mr.
 Wallace affirms, that there is no permanent ice formed but on high land.

consider how the condition of south temperate America at the
present day is explicable if they reject this agency. The line of
perpetual snow in the southern Andes is so low as 6000 feet in the
same latitude as the Pyrenees ; in the latitude of the Swiss Alps,
mountains only 6200 feet high produce immense glaciers which
descend to the sea-level ; while in the latitude of Cumberland,
mountains only from 3000 to 4000 feet high have every valley
filled with streams of ice descending to the sea-coast and giving
off abundance of huge icebergs. Here we have exactly the con
dition of things to which England and Western Europe were sub
jected during the latter portion of the glacial epoch, when every
valley in Wales, Cumberland, and Scotland had its glacier ; and to
what can this state of things be imputed, if not to the fact that
there is now a moderate amount of eccentricity and the winter
of the southern hemisphere is in aphelion ? The mere geogra
phical position of the southern extremity of America does not seem
especially favourable to the production of such a state of glaciation.
 The land narrows from the tropics southwards, and terminates
 altogether in about the latitude of Edinburgh ; the mountains are
 of moderate height ; while during summer the sun is three millions
 of miles nearer, and the heat received from it is equivalent to a
 rise of 20° F. as compared with the same season in the northern
 hemisphere."—P. 142.
     In a similar glacial condition are the islands of South
  Georgia, South Shetland, Graham Land, Enderby Land,
  Sandwich Land. There can be little doubt that the present
 extension of ice in the Antarctic regions is to a considerable
  extent due also to the influence of eccentricity.
     Let us now glance for a moment at the influence which this
  state of things has at present on northward-flowing currents.
  One result is that the south-east trades are stronger than the
  north-east, and as a consequence blow over on the northern
  hemisphere ten or fifteen degrees beyond the equator. This
  has the effect, as has been shown (' Climate and Time,' chap
  ters v. and xiii., and other places), of impelling the warm
  surface-water of the southern intertropical regions over on
  the northern hemisphere. It is possible that the greater
  strength of the south-east trades may to some extent be due
  to the preponderance of ocean on the southern hemisphere ;
  bnt there can be little doubt that it is mainly the effect of
  eccentricity.
     The result of this transference of water from the southern
  to the northern hemisphere is that the intertropical waters of
  the northern hemisphere are between three and four degrees
   warmer than those of the southern. Another result which
   follows, as has also been shown, is that the great equatorial
   currents are made to lie at some distance to the north of the

104               Dr. J. Croll on the Physical Theory
eqnator ; hence when they are impelled against the American
and the Asiatic continents, and become deflected northwards
and southwards, the larger portion of the water goes to the
north, and thus raises the temperature of the northern hemi
sphere. Now if all this results as a consequence from the
present small amount of eccentricity, how much greater must
have been the effect during the glacial epoch, when the
eccentricity was more than three times its present value and
the southern winter also, as now, in aphelion ! All those effects
which we have just been considering would then have been
magnified far more than threefold.
     Climatic Conditions of the two Hemispheres the Reverse
 10,000 or 1 2,000 years ago : Argument from.—Ten or twelve
thousand years ago, when our northern winter solstice was
 last in aphelion, the climatic conditions were in all probability
 the reverse of what they are at present. There appears to be
 pretty good geological evidence that such was the case. This,
under the present small amount of eccentricity, shows not
 only to what an extent climate is affected by eccentricity, but
also (and with this we are at present more particularly con
 cerned) that its tendency is to cool the one hemisphere and
warm the other, to accumulate the snow and ice on the one
and melt them on the other. And this result, to a large ex
tent, is doubtless brought about by its influence on ocean-
currents.
     There are good reasons for concluding, as Prof. J. Geikie
has fully shown *, that at a very recent date (during the time
 of the formation of the 40-feet raised beach and the depo
 sition of the Carse-clays) the climate was much colder than
 it is at present. The seas surrounding our Island appear to
have had a lower temperature than they have at present; and
 our Highland valleys seem to have been occupied by local
glaciers t-
     The Carse-clays of Scotland are best developed in the
valleys of the Tay, the Earn, and the Forth. These deposits
 cpnsist of finely laminated clays and silt. " Now and again,"
 says Prof. J. Geikie, " the deposits consist of tough tenacious
 brick-clay, which does not differ in appearance from similar
 brick-clays of glacial age." The clay is usually free from
 stones, but occasionally blocks of six inches or a foot in
    * ' Prehistoric Europe.'
    t In a paper " On the Obliquity of the Ecliptic,'' read before the Geo
 logical Society of Glasgow in 1807, 1 concluded that at the time of the
 deposition of the Carse-clays the mean winter temperature was probably
 10° or 15° lower than at present, and the Gulf-stream considerably re
 duced. See also ' Climate and Time,' pp. 403-410.

                 of Secular Changes of Climate.               105
 diameter are fonnd in it; and Prof. J. Geikie mentions
 having seen one four feet in thickness. Stones of this size
 in a fine laminated clay evidently indicate the presence of
 floating ice. But, as Prof. J. Geikie remarks, " it is rather
 the general character of the clays themselves than the
 presence of erratics which, indicates colder climatic con
 ditions. The fine tenacious brick-clays are not like the dark
 sludge and silt which now gather upon the estuarine bed ot
 the Tay, but resemble and in some cases are identical in
 character with the laminated clays of true glacial age with
 Arctic shells." These Carse-clays, as he further remarks,
 appear in a large measure to be made up of the fine " flour
 of rock " derived from the grinding action of glaciers which
then occupied the Highland valleys, and from which muddy
waters escaped in large quantities in summer owing to the
melting of the snow and ice. In short, these Carse-clays
appear to coincide with the most recent period of local glaciers.
   During that period some of the glaciers, as Prof. J. Geikie
has shown, appear to have even reached the sea-level. For
example, at the mouth of Glen Brora, in Sutherland, there is
a well-marked moraine with large blocks resting upon, and
apparently of the same age as, the deposits of the raised
beach *. Mr. Robert Chambers also observed moraine matter
resting upon the 30-feet beach at the opening of Glen Iorsa,
in Arran. In many of the Highland sea-lochs, says Prof. J.
Geikie, glaciers appear to have come down to the sea and
calved their icebergs there. This, he thinks, is probably the
reason why the 40-50-feet beach is not often well seen at the
heads of such sea-lochs. The glaciers seem in many cases to
have flowed on for some distance into the sea, and thus pre
vented the formation of a beach and cliff-line.
   The greater magnitude and torrential character of the rivers
of that period were no doubt due to the melting during
summer of great masses of snow and ice. The presence of
the large Greenland whale, found frequently in the Carse
deposits, would seem to indicate a somewhat colder sea than
now surrounds our island. A decrease of temperature of the
sea is what would necessarily occur from a slight diminution
in the volume of the Gulf-stream, arising from the greater
deflection of equatorial water into the southern hemisphere.
   Another circumstance deserves notice here, as it seems to
indicate that the climatic conditions of the two hemispheres
were at the period of the Carse-clays the reverse of what they
are at present. During that period the sea stood higher in
                   * 'Prehistoric Europe,' p. 411.

106              Dr. J. Croll on the Physical Theory
relation to the land than it does at the present time. To this
circumstance alone no great importance can be attached; but,
when we consider in addition that submergence has almost
invariably accompanied glaciation, we may regard it as
highly probable that the submergence at the period in ques
tion was the result of a greater amount of ice on the northern
hemisphere and a less amount on the southern, than now.
This probability is further increased by the fact that during
the growth of the ancient Forest, which immediately under
lies the Carse-clays, and indicates a condition of climate even
more warm and equable than the present*, the sea stood
not only higher in relation to the land than it did during the
time of the deposition of the Carse-clays, but somewhat
higher than it does at present. The buried Forest doubtless
belongs to the period 10,000 or 12,000 years prior to that of
the Carse-clayst, when the winter solstice was in perihelion;
and at this time, owing to a somewhat greater amount of
eccentricity than at present, the quantity of ice on the southern
hemisphere might be expected to be greater, and that on the
northern less, than now.
    Thus when the northern winters were last in aphelion there
was a rise of sea-level, resulting doubtless from a preponde
rance of ice on the northern hemisphere; but when the buried
Forest nourished, 10,000 or 12,000 years prior, the winters
were in perihelion, and there was a fall of sea-level, due in all
likelihood to the preponderance of ice on the southern hemi
sphere. But this is not all : the strata which underlie the
buried Forest bear witness to another rise of sea-level.
    These changes of climatic conditions and oscillations of sea-
level, which took place during the latter part of the Postglacial
period, are just what should have taken place on the suppo
sition that they were the result of those astronomical and
physical agents which we have been considering. Thus,
immediately preceding the Present period we have that of the
25- and 40-feet % raised beaches and the Carse deposits, which
indicate that the climate was then more severe and the sea
somewhat colder and standing at a higher level than at
present. Now during this Recent period our northern winter
  * Those who doubt the equable and warmer character of the climate of
the submarine Forest-bed period should study the mass of evidence on
this point given in ' Prehistoric Europe.'
   + For the probable dates of the Carse-clays and the submarine Forest-
beds see Appendix.
   X At one time I thought (' Climate and Time,' p. 409) that the 40-foet
beach might belong to a period 50,000 years prior to the Carse-clays ; but
I am now satisfied that the two beaches both belong to the period of the
Carse-clays, as Prof. J. Geikie has shown.

                  of Secular Changes of Climate.              107
 solstice was in aphelion, and the condition of things is exactly
 what, according to theory, we ought to expect.
    Preceding the period of the Carse- clays comes that of the
buried Forest, when the climate was even more genial and
equable than at the present day, the Gulf-stream larger and the
sea at a lower level than now. Now during this period the
winter solstice was in perihelion and the eccentricity some
what greater than at present; and here again we have exactly
that condition of things which, according to theory, we ought
to expect. It would be very singular indeed were there no
physical connexion between these conditions and the causes
to which I have been attributing them. It would certainly
be singular were all these coincidences purely accidental.
These changes have all been so recent, geologically speaking,
and so general and widespread in their character, that they
cannot reasonably be attributed to any known geographical
changes. If we admit, then, that they were the result of
those astronomical and physical agents to which I have
referred them, we must also admit that those agents were as
efficient in producing a warm and equable climate as in pro
ducing a cold and severe one. We must further admit that,
with a very small amount of eccentricity, widely marked
differences of climatic conditions are brought about on the
two hemispheres; that, when the winters are in perihelion,
the melting of the snow and ice and the increase of the
Gulf-stream and other northward-flowing currents are as
necessary a result as were the formation of the snow and ice
and the decrease of the Gulf-stream and those currents when
the winters were in aphelion. And if this holds true in refer
ence to recent and postglacial times, when the eccentricity
was small, it must, for reasons which will presently be stated,
hold true in a higher degree in reference to the glacial epoch,
when the eccentricity was more than three times its present
value.
    The Mutual Reaction of the Physical Agents in relation to tlie
Melting of the Ice.—When the winter solstice is in aphelion it
sets in operation, according to theory, as has been shown, a
host of physical causes the tendency of which is to produce an
accumulation of snow and ice ; but when the solstice-point
moves round to perihelion the tendency of these causes is
reversed, and they then undo what they had previously done—
they melt the snow and ice which they had just produced.
The action of the causes being reversed, the effects are reversed.
But it must be observed that the greater the amount of the
eccentricity, the greater will be the effect resulting from the
combination of these physical agents, whether that effect be

 108           Dr. J. Croll on tlie Physical Theory
the production of snow and ice on the cold hemisphere, or the
melting of them on the warm,—whether it be their production
when the winter solstice of a hemisphere is in aphelion, or
their melting when that solstice is in perihelion.
   We have, however, to take into account not merely the
action of the physical agents, but their Mutual Reactions on
one another. The effect of this mutual reaction is very stri
king. Not only do the physical agents, in their actions, all
lead to one result, viz. an accumulation of snow and ice when
the winters are in aphelion, but their efficiency in bringing
about this result is actually strengthened by their mutual
reactions on one another. To illustrate this effect I quote the
following from a former article :—
   " To begin with, wo have a high state of eccentricity. This
leads to long and cold winters. The cold leads to snow, and
although hear is given out in the formation of the snow, yet
the final result is that the snow intensifies the cold : it cools
the air and leads to still more snow. The cold and snow bring
a third agent into play—-fogs, which act still in the same
direction. The fogs intercept the sun's rays, this interception
of the rays diminishes the melting-power of the sun, and so
increases the accumulation. As the snow and ice continue to
accumulate, more and more of the rays are cut off; and on the
other hand, as the rays continue to be cut off, the rate of accu
mulation increases, because the quantity of snow and ice
melted becomes thus annually less and less. In addition, the
loss of the rays cut off by the fogs lowers the temperature of
the air and leads to more snow being formed, while again the
snow thus formed chills the air still more and increases the
fogs. Again, during the winters of a glacial epoch, the earth
would be radiating its heat into space. Had this loss of beat
simply lowered the temperature, the lowering of the tempera
ture would have tended to diminish the rate of loss ; but the
result is the formation of snow rather than the lowering ot the
temperature.
   " Further, as snow and ice accumulate on the one hemi
sphere they diminish on the other. This increases the strength
of the trade-winds on the cold hemisphere and weakens those
on the warm. The effect of this is to impel the warm water
of the tropics more to the warm hemisphere than to the cold.
Supposing the northern hemisphere to be the cold one, then,
as the snow and ice begin gradually to accumulate, the ocean-
currents of that hemisphere, more particularly the Gulf-Stream,
begin to decrease in volume, while those on the southern or
warm hemisphere begin pari passu to increase. This with
drawal of heat from the northern hemisphere favours the

                 of Secular Changes of Climate.                109
accumulation of snow and ice, and as the snow and ice accu
mulate the ocean-currents decrease. On the other hand, as
the ocean-currents diminish, the snow and ice still more accu
 mulate. Thus the two effects, in so far as the accumulation
 of snow and ice is concerned, mutually strengthen each other."
    With all this Mr. Wallace seems fully to agree ; for at
 pp. 137-140 (' Island Life ') he gives a very clear statement
 of the effect of these mutual reactions in the production of
 glaciation, and says that were it not for them it is probable the
astronomical and other causes would not in our latitudes have
been sufficient to produce glaciation. In short, he concludes
that these reactions "produce a maximum of effect which,
without their aid, would be altogether unattainable." Mr.
Wallace thus does full justice to these mutual reactions in so
far as the production of glaciation is concerned ; but I am
convinced that he must have underestimated their importance
as regards the removal of the glaciation. He, however, recog
nizes the fact that these mutual reactions produce an opposite
effect on the warm atmosphere whose winters are in perihelion.
" These agencies," he says, " are at the same time acting in a
reverse way in the southern hemisphere, diminishing the
supply of the moisture carried by the anti-trades, and increa
sing the temperature by means of more powerful southward
ocean-currents ; and all this again reacts on the northern
hemisphere, increasing yet further the supply of moisture by
the more powerful south-westerly winds, while still further
lowering the temperature bv the southward diversion of the
Gulf-Stream."
   Now if, during the glaciation of the northern hemisphere,
these mutual reactions produce the opposite effect on the
southern hemisphere, it is evident that they must produce this
same opposite effect on the northern hemisphere when its
winter solstice is in perihelion. Their effect then would be to
increase the temperature and melt the ice. When the winter
solstice is moving towards the aphelion, the physical agents
begin to act and also to react on one another, and this action
and reaction go on increasing in intensity till the solstice-
point reaches the aphelion ; but an exactly similar thing is
going on in the other hemisphere, only the effects are the
reverse. While the actions and reactions leading to an accu
mulation of ice are increasing in intensity, we shall suppose,
on the northern hemisphere, the same increase is taking place
on the southern hemisphere ; but the result is a melting, not
an accumulation of the ice. The same process is undoing on
the southern hemisphere what it is doing on the northern.
Similarly, of course, when the northern winter solstice begins

110     On the Physical Tlieory of Secular Changes of Climate.
to move towards the perihelion, the mutual reactions of these
physical causes will be reversed and will go on with increasing
intensity till the perihelion is reached, melting the very ice
which they had previously produced.
   We have already seen that the greater the extent of the
eccentricity, the greater is the effect resulting from the actions
of the physical causes, whether this effect be the production of
ice on the cold hemisphere, or its removal from the warm. It
is evident that the same thing must necessarily hold true in
regard to the mutual reactions of the physical causes. Conse
quently if the mutual actions and reactions of the physical
causes, brought into operation during a high state of eccen
tricity, led at the glacial epoch to the great accumulation of
ice when the winters were in aphelion, they must have led to
an equally great melting and dispersal of that ice when pre
cession brought the winters round to perihelion. These causes
would be as efficient in the removal of the ice as they were in
its production. In so far as the physical and astronomical
causes were concerned, the greater the amount of ice formed
during the cold periods the greater would be the amount
melted during the warm interglacial periods.
   Another Reason assigned why the Ice does not Melt.—Mr.
Wallace assigns the following as an additional reason why the
ice does not disappear during the interglacial periods when
the eccentricity is high:—
   " When a country is largely covered with ice, we may look
upon it as possessing the accumulated or stored-up cold of a
long series of preceding winters ; and however much heat is
poured upon it, its temperature cannot be raised above the
freezing-point till that store of cold is got rid of—that is, till
the ice is all melted. But the ice itself, when extensive,
tends to its own preservation, even under the influence of
heat ; for the chilled atmosphere becomes filled with fog, and
this keeps off the sun-heat, and then snow falls even during
summer, and the stored-up cold does not diminish during the
year. When, however, only a small portion of the surface is
covered with ice, the exposed earth becomes heated by the hot
sun, this warms the air, and the warm air melts the adjacent
ice. It follows that, towards the equatorial limits of a gla
ciated country alternations of climate may occur during a
period of high eccentricity, while nearer the pole, where the
whole country is completely ice-clad, no amelioration may
take place."—P. 154.
   For the past nineteen years I have been maintaining that,
when a country is covered with ice, it becomes a permanent
source of cold; and however much heat may be received from

              On the Constant of an Electro-dynamometer.        Ill
  the sun, the temperature of the surface can never be raised
  above the freezing-point while the ice remains ; and, again,
  that such an ice-covering tends to its own preservation, because
  it chills the air and increases the snowfall. In short, I have
  all along maintained this to have been one of the chief causes
  which led to the country being so deeply covered with ice.
  In fact, had it not been for some such conservative power in
  the ice, a glacial epoch resulting from the causes which I have
  been advocating would not have been possible. This conser
 vative tendency certainly renders it more difficult for the
 physical agencies to get rid of the ice during interglacial
 periods; but we evidently have no grounds for assuming that
 it will defy their melting-powers.
     I shall next consider Geological and Palseontological Facts
in relation to Mr. Wallace's modification, and also his theory
as to the cause of Mild Arctic Climates.

XIII. On a Method of determining experimentally the Constant
       of an Electro-dynamometer. By A. P. Chattock*.
THE practical importance attaching to the accurate mea
          surement of electric currents is daily increasing with
the extended use of electricity. For this reason I venture to
hope that the following account of some experiments on the
calibration of an electro-dynamometer will prove interesting.
    The twisting moment with which the fixed coil of an electro-
dynamometer acts on the suspended coil is proportional to the
product of the strengths of current flowing through the two
coils respectively, and to a factor which depends on their geo
metrical relations.
    If a current bo sent through the fixed coil and the suspended
coil be allowed to rotate, an E.M.F. is set up in the latter
which is at any instant proportional to the speed of rotation,
to the strength of the current in the fixed coil, and to a factor
depending on the geometrical relations of the two coils.
    By allowing the suspended coil to rotate about its axis of
suspension, and by making the geometrical factor during
rotation the same as afterwards, when the coil is suspended in
its place, I have determined the constant of the instrument
upon the table.
    It is the method I employed in doingthis which I have the
honour of bringing before you to-day. The diagram shows the
arrangement of the apparatus.
    • Communicated by the Physical Society, having been read Novem
ber 24, 1883.

 112     Mr. A. P. Chattock on determining experimentally
    F, F are the fixed coils of the dynamometer; S the revolving
 coil to be afterwards suspended within them, and which makes
 contact once in every revolution with M and N; B a battery
 sending a current C through the coils F by the commutator L.
 G is an astatic mirror-galvanometer of about the same resist
 ance as the coil S; and R is the resistance between M and N,
 adjustable by the slider M.
    Let i be the intensity of the magnetic field, at the place
 where S revolves, due to unit current in the fixed coils F;
H the horizontal intensity of the earth's magnetism at the
same place; a the effective area of the coil S; and k a factor
depending on the relative positions of the two coils when the
revolving coil is in contact with M and N through G. iak is
then the geometrical factor referred to above.
   Suppose the coil S rotates with an angular velocity &>, while
a current of strength C flows through the fixed coils. An
E.M.F. is set up in S equal to
                          Giawk + Hacoi/.
If the resistance R between M and N be now adjusted till no
current flows through G, this E.M.F. must be equal to the
difference of potential between M and N due to the current,
viz. CR ; that is,
                     Cio-tok + B.aak' = CR.
Commutating the current at L and adjusting R, we get
                   - Cwak + Haawf = - CR';
and from these two equations,
                            iak a R+R'

                the Constant of an Electro-dynamometer.          113
   If, as is desirable, the instrument is set up so that the term
  depending on the earth's magnetism vanishes, we have simply
                              Cwra>A=CR;
  and the value of iak being obtainable from one reading, there
  is no error due to variation of the current.
      Having thus obtained the value of iak, the coil S is sus
  pended within the coils F so that its axis of suspension coin
  cides with its previous axis of rotation; and by means of sights,
  properly adjusted, it is brought into the same position relatively
  to 1 as it occupied when making contact with M and N.
     If now an unknown current C be made to flow through the
 instrument, and the electrical turning moment of the sus
 pended coil be opposed by an equal and opposite mechanical
 moment T in the suspension-springs, we have
                         T=C2zV/fc + HC<7/fc';
 and on commutation of the current,
 from which
where T0 is the moment due to unit twist on the springs, and
t the actual twist on them.
     Here, as before, the instrument can be set up so that HCo-A'
vanishes, and a value of the current can be obtained in one
reading.
    The absolute value of T0 can, of course, be found accurately
by taking the time of vibration of a mass of known moment
of inertia when suspended in the place of the coil S; and thus
the constant, K, of the instrument can be determined.
    There are two points in the practical carrying out of this
method which require special attention—the prevention of
thermal and other extraneous currents in the circuit of the
revolving coil, and the keeping its speed uniform throughout
each revolution. Success in both these cases depends chiefly
on the manner of making, contact between the revolving coil
and the points M and N.
    In my first experiments with the instrument I allowed the
two ends of the revolving coil to touch, in passing, two fixed
wires in connexion with M and N. After calculating a con
stant, I compared the instrument with the very accurate tangent-
galvanometer belonging to University College, and found a

     Thinking that this discrepancy might be due to the speed
  at the moment of contact being greater than the average speed
  (which was all that could be measured), and that this difference,
 again, might be due to the friction of the contact (as well as of
 another contact used for counting the revolutions), I substituted
 contact-rollers with platinum rims for the fixed wires. The
  axles of these rollers were vertical, and were furnished at their
 upper ends with mercury-cups into which dipped the wires
 connected with M and N. This was to avoid thermal currents.
  The rollers were pressed against the rim of an ebonite disk,
  fixed coaxially to the revolving coil. Into this rim were let
 two pieces of platinum, connected with the ends of the coil
 and making contact with the rollers as they passed them. The
 result of this alteration was that the difference between the
 readings of my instrument and the tangent-galvanometer was
 reduced to 1*5 per cent.
     I have not been able to experiment further in this matter ;
 but I believe that, by substituting for the rollers an arrange
 ment of light levers, by which a bent wire could be lifted in
 and out of two mercur}--cups with each revolution of the coil,
 thereby making and breaking contact, a still greater degree of
 accuracy should be attainable. The addition of a fly-wheel to
 the coil while revolving would also tend to keep the speed
 uniform.
    A partial explanation of the disagreement of the two instru
 ments may be found, too, in the fact that mine is home-made,
and therefore not so well finished as it otherwise might be.
    With the aid of a tangent-galvanometer of known con
stant, the dynamometer can be calibrated to give a conve
nient absolute measure of the horizontal intensity of a magnetic
field. For this purpose the axis of the suspended coil must,
be at right angles to the direction of the magnetism.
    The instrument is first sot up in such a position that on
sending a current through the suspended coil alone, no deflec
tion is produced. It is then turned bodily through a right
angle by means of a graduated foot, and in this position it is
connected in series with a tangent-galvanometer and battery.
    Let H be the strength of the field at the place where the
dynamometer stands, and H' the same where the tangent-
galvanometer stands. Then, for a current C sent through both
instruments and commutated, we get from the dynamometer
the two following equations:—

                       T=C2{o-i + HCo-,

and from the tangent-galvanometer we have
                        C _tanfl
                        H'~ i! '
   Interchanging the two instruments and repeating the expe
riment, we obtain two similar equations with H and H' inter
changed. From which
                  a= ^-r^lT -T')(T"-T"') tan 6 . tan ff,
where every thing is known, the values of C and C being
determinable by the dynamometer from the same readings.
<r being once known, the horizontal intensity of a magnetic field
is determinable by simply setting up the dynamometer so that
the axis of its movable coil is at right angles to the meridian,
as described above, and then sending the same current through
it successively in both directions, the equation being
                          T_Ti            t_ti
    A somewhat different use of the dynamometer for the same
 purpose is given by Kohlrausch in his 'Physical Measure
 ments,' p. 180.
     In conclusion I wish to thank Prof. Foster for his kind
 ness in allowing me to test my instrument in the Physical
 Laboratory at University College. My thanks are also due to
 Mr. W. S. Grant for many valuable hints on the construction
 of the instrument.

           Order. By Thomas Muir, M.A., F.R.S.E.*
 1.   I TNDER the above title, in the ' Quarterly Journal of
             Mathematics,' xiv. pp. 23-25, there is a paper by
 Professor Cayley, the object of which is to find from the
 equation

                     * Communicated by the Author.

116           Mr. T. Muir on the General Equation of
an expression for u, in terms of «i and u0. Professor Cayley
calculates in succession the required expressions for !<3,m4,m6, m6,
and thus by induction arrives at a simple and elegant law of
formation, by means of which one is enabled to write down
the coefficients of ux and w0 m these expressions with great
ease.
   The object of the present note is to establish rigorously
Professor Cayley's law; to connect it with a class of functions
(first dealt with in the Philosophical Magazine*), and so give
it a wider sphere of usefulness; and to indicate in what direc
tions and with what profit Professor Cayley's result may be
generalized.

   If now we use Professor Cayley's own theorem regarding
the expansion of a determinant according to products of the

 and so on.
    The coefficient of b0u0 manifestly follows the same law.
    3. The importance of this rale of Professor Cayley's is not
 to be measured by viewing it in the special connexion in which
 it is found enunciated. It is a general rule for the evaluation
 of continuants, and is sure to bo of good service wherever these
 functions make their appearance.
    4. When no insertions follow the omissions referred to in the
 rule, we obtain the development of a simple continuant—in the
above example we should find the development of K(ata4a3rt2a1).
 It must be noted, however, that the rule as thus reduced has
been long known, probably since the time of Euler.
    5. But now suppose that the given equation of differences
is in the more general form
and we employ the same method as above. It is easy to see
that, on solving this time for w6, we shall obtain
          «8=       Of bt              C4

It is readily made manifest, however, that the last determi

lot us take the equation of differences,

to which we are led in trying to find the number (mx) of
arrangements of a set of x things, subject to the conditions
that the first is not to be in the last or first place, the second
not in the first or second place, the third not in the second or
third place, and so on,—a problem which turns up in Professor
Tait's well-known investigations in the Theory of Knots
(Trans. Roy. Soc. of Edinb. xxviii. p. 159).
   Putting, in the first place,
                  ux=xvx_, + {-\)z-\x-2), ....(«)
we find, after the requisite reductions, the simpler equation of
the same kind,
                  =        1>i-2 + «i-3+( — 1)*(« — 3).
The general result applied to this gives

+ l.K(4,5,...,*-l)-2K(5,6,...,*-l)+... + (-l)'(«-
But it is at once evident from the statement of the problem
that m2 = 0 and w3=l; so that, bearing (a) in mind, we must
put vt = 0 and ^ = 0. The desired solution thus is
      M,=xK(4, 5, . . . , x-l)-2xK(5, 6, . . . , x 1)
           + 3xK(6, 7, . . . , »-!)-. . . + ( - Y)*(a?-lx + 2).
For example,
           m6 = 6K(4, 5)-12K(5) + 14= (126-60) + 14,
              = 80,
as it should be (see Proc. Roy. Soc. of Edinb. ix. pp. 382-
391; xi. pp. 187-190). .
   7. Clearly the method is applicable to equations of the third
and higher orders ; the resulting determinants, however, must
then be more numerous and less simple in form.

 § 8. Work of the Ponderornotire and Electromotive Force for the
    Case in which the Iron Core of the Rotating Coil is at rest.
 AFTER having expressed the magnetic moments, we may
         determine the work done by the ponderomotive force
 when the machine is in action.
    We will make an assumption, which is not indeed realized
in the machines of ordinary construction, but the results of
which may bo readily transferred to these machines, and which
 facilitates the investigation. We will assume that the iron
 core of the rotating coil does not share the rotation of the
latter, but is fixed, and that therewith the rotating coil rotates
alone, in which it is subject to a double force, the force of the
magnet acting from without, and the force of the magnetic
iron core acting inwards*.
    The ponderomotive force which the fixed electromagnet
exerts on the rotating coil, is proportional, on the one hand,
to the magnetic moment M of the fixed electromagnet, and,
on the other hand, it must be proportional to the magnetic
moment of the current in the coil, and therewith be propor
tional to the above-mentioned magnitude N. We can there
fore represent the work done by this force in unit time, which,
moreover, is proportional to the number of turns v, by the pro
duct of the value MNr into a constant factor. But in the direc
tion of that rotation which we must impart to the machine in
order to produce a current, and which we will assume to be
the positive direction of rotation, the work of the pondero
motive force is negative; for it acts in opposition to such a
motion, and must be overcome by an extraneous force. It is
therefore convenient to express this by affixing the minus sign
to the constant factor, and it may accordingly be denoted by
— h. The expression which thus determines this work is then
                                  -AMN?>.
    The other ponderomotive force which the rotating coil expe
riences from the magnetic iron core in it is, like the former,
proportional to the magnitude N. It depends, moreover, on
   * Strictly speaking, two forces must be distinguished in reference to
the fixed electromagnet—that is to say, first, the force exerted by the
magnetic iron mass of the fixed electromagnet, and, second, the force
directly exerted by the current which traverses the coil of the fixed elec
tromagnet. But since in the dynamo machines at present constructed
the latter force is very small in comparison with the first, we will nuglect
this difference, nnd only consider the Maiforce of the fixed electromagnet.

the magnetic moment of the iron core. We must distinguish
between this magnetic moment and the components mentioned
at the end of the previous paragraphs. The component P2,
which represents a magnetic moment whose axis coincides
with the axis of N, has no moment of rotation which acts
upon the rotating coil. The component Pj, on the contrary,
which represents a magnetic moment the axis of which is at
right angles to the N axis, gives a moment of rotation which
is proportional to the magnitude P^ Accordingly the work
effected by this ponderomotive force in the rotation, which, like
the previous work, is also proportional to the number of turns,
and is negative for a positive rotation, may be represented by
                            -/fcNP^,
in which k is a fresh constant.
   By adding together the two expressions which represent
the separate ones for the work, we obtain an expression for
the whole work done by the ponderomotive force in the time
T, that is to say,
                     T= -AMNv-yfeNPit'                      (17)
   From this work of the ponderomotive force the work of
the electromotive force may be deduced by the aid of equa
tion (11), that is to say,
                    EiWiMNv + AOT^-piV            . . . (18)

at the conclusion of the preceding paragraph, we obtain
                    T=-MN(/t + T^),, ....                   (19)

§ 9. Work of the Ponderomotive and Electromotive Force for
   the Case in which the Iron Core shares in the Rotation of the
   Coil.
   In previous determinations it was assumed that the iron core
of the rotating coil was at rest, and only the coil rotated. In
the machines in actual use the iron core is usually rigidly
connected with the coil and rotates with it. The question
arises whether, and in how far, a change is thereby produced
in the action.
   When the iron core rotates, the poles of the magnetism
worked in it constantly change their position in the iron itself,
but they retain it in space. It follows from the latter fact
that the individual windings of the coil, although in the com
mon motion they retain their position unchanged in respect of

              Theory of Dynamo-electrical Machines.           121
the individual particles of iron, do nevertheless continually
change their position relatively to tJie poles.
   With slow rotation it may be assumed that the poles of the
iron core have the same position in space and the same strength
as in an iron core at rest. With more rapid rotation this is
no longer the case, but deviations result in respect of the
position and strength of the poles; these deviations, however,
we will neglect for the present, reserving their consideration
until later, when we shall also deal with another accessory
action which occurs with rapid rotation. We will for the
present assume that in the rotating iron core the poles liave
the same position in space and the same strength as in an iron
core at rest.
   The induced electromotive force is due to the fact that the
windings of the rotating coil change their position relatively
to the poles, and accordingly, under the supposition we have
made as to the unchanged position in space, and strength of
the poles, it must also remain without change. Hence to
determine the work done by the electromotive force we may
apply the equations (18) and (20) above deduced for the case
of an iron core at rest, also for the case in which the iron core
rotates with the coil.
   But as regards the work done by the ponderomotive force,
the state of affairs is not quite so simple, for according as the
motion is different, different forces come into play in such a
manner as to produce mechanical work. The force which
the magnetic iron core exerts on the rotating coil through
which the current is passing, and which, when only the coil
moves, does the work we have previously determined ; this
force, when the iron core forms with the coil a rigidly con
nected system, which can only move as a whole, is neutralized
by the equal but opposite force which the current in the coil
exerts upon the magnetic iron core. Another force, on the
 contrary, that which is exerted by the stationary electromagnet
on that magnetic core, and which could do no work when the
iron core was fixed, will act so as to do work when the iron
core rotates. The question therefore is to compare the mag
nitude of this work with that which we have previously
determined.
   This results from a simple consideration. For this purpose
we will temporarily assume that only the iron core rotates,
while the position of the coil as well as of the fixed electro
 magnet is not changed. If now the iron core is magnetized
by the combined action of the fixed electromagnet and of the
 current in the coil, it is subject to moving forces from these
 two, but does not move, as follows from the fact that it has the

122                 Prof. R. Clausius on the
shape of a rotating body the axis of which coincides with the
axis about which it turns. But if the two moving forces do
not set the core in motion, it follows from this that they have
equal and opposite moments of rotation. As, now, the latter is
again equal and opposite to the moment of rotation exerted by
the iron core on the coil, it follows further that the moment of
rotation exerted by the fixed electromagnet on the iron core is
equal and in opposite direction to the moment of rotation exerted
by the iron core on the coil.
   Hence the work which, in the case where the iron core also
rotates, produces the force exerted by the fixed electromagnet
on the iron core, has the same value as the work previously
determined which, when the iron core is at rest, produces the
force exerted by it upon the coil.
   In the mathematical representation of these two magnitudes
we arrive at expressions which are apparently different. The
latter magnitude must, as expressed in the former paragraph,
be proportional to the magnitudes N and Px, and we have
expressed them by
in which k is an undefined constant. The former, on the con
trary, must be proportional to the magnitudes H and P3, and
may therefore be expressed in a corresponding manner by
                              -/fMP2i>,
in which k' may for the present be regarded as a second
undefined constant. These expressions seem externally very
different ; but if we replace in them for Px and P2 their values
as given in (16), they change into
                      ,CMN           ,  ,,CMN
                    —k z      p f and — k q -~ . v,
                       l+fh               l+/3» '
and from this it appears that it is only necessary to make the
constant kf , which was previously introduced as a second un
defined constant, equal to k, in order to bring iuto agreement
the two expressions which, from the foregoing considerations,
represent equal magnitudes.
    That part of the work of the ponderomotive force, in deter
 mining which it is alone important to consider whether the
 iron core does or does not rotate, has thus been shown to be
equal ; it follows thence that the entire work done by the pon
deromotive force is the same in both cases, and hence, under
 the supposition we have made as to the position and strength
 of the poles, we may use the expression deduced (19) for the
 determination of T also for the case in which the iron core
 likewise rotates.

    § 10. Modification which the foregoing Results undergo with
                          rapid Rotation.
    It has been assumed in what precedes that the magnetism
 evoked by the combined action of the fixed electromagnet and
 of the current in the coil on the rotating iron core is the same
 as in that at rest. When the rotation is slow this is approxi
 mately the case ; but with a more rapid rotation it follows,
 from the inertia which the iron has in reference to changes in
 its magnetic condition, that the strength and position in space of
 the poles in the rotating core are somewhat different from what
 they are when at rest. So far as I know, this circumstance has
 not hitherto been determined in dynamo-electrical machines.
    As to the position of the poles, that is the direction of the
 magnetic axis, the angle <f> in § 7 which the magnetic axis of
 the stationary iron core forms with the opposite direction of
 the axis of the fixed electromagnet, that is defined by the equa
 tions (15). If the iron core rotates rapidly, it can be assumed
 that its magnetic axis is thereby displaced in the direction of
 the rotation by a small angle which is proportional to the
 velocity of rotation. Hence if <f>' is the angle which the
 altered direction of the iron core forms with the opposite
 direction of the axis of the electromagnet, we may put
                          <t>' = <l> + ev,                    (21)
in which e is a small constant.
    The strength of the poles must be somewhat less in a rota
ting than in a stationary iron core. No considerable error is
made, if it be assumed that the changed magnetic moment is
 as great as the change in the components of the original mag
 netic moment which fall in the altered direction, and which
we have called P, and defined by equation (14). Hence if P'
 is the magnetic moment in the rotating iron core, we may put
                         P' = Pcosev                          (22)
    If we decompose this magnetic moment P', as we have
previously done with the magnetic moments P, into the two
components which fall in the opposite direction of the axis of
the fixed electromagnet, and the direction at right angles
thereto, and which may be called P/ and P2', we have to put
              P/ = P' cos       = P cos ev . cos (<£ + ee),
              P2' = P' sin <f>' = P cos ev . sin (<f> + ev).
If we develop these expressions in powers of ev, and from the
smallness of the coefficient e neglect the members of ev which

124                   Prof. R. Clausius on the
are higher than the first order, we get
                    P/=P (cos <£— evsin <f>),
                    Ps' = P (sin <f> + ev cos $) ;
and if in this we also put for the products P cos <f> and P sin <f>,
their values given in equations (16), we get
                    p'-r+^<N+wM)-)
   In that direction of working of the machine in which it
furnishes an electrical current when mechanical force is ap
plied, the members affected by the factor e have, as a conse
quence, an increase of work and diminution of the current ;
and in that direction in which it furnishes mechanical work
by the application of an electrical current, those members
have as a consequence an increase of the current and a dimi
nution of the work. Hence under all circumstances the
magnetic inertia of the rotating iron core has a deleterious
influence on the duty of the machine. By altering the posi
tion of the brushes, with a more rapid rotation, this influence
may be somewhat lessened, but it cannot be altogether elimi
nated.
   Besides this action, which depends on the magnetic inertia
of the iron, another action may take place in the rotating iron
core which is also detrimental to the working of the machine
—that is to say, the induction of electrical currents in the iron
core itself. Such currents are now often called Foucault's
currents, for Foucault made an experiment which demon
strated their existence in a most striking manner; it must,
however, be mentioned that these currents had been known
long before Foucault's experiment, and had also been cor
rectly interpreted*.
    If the iron core rotates under the influence of the fixed elec
tromagnet, electromotive forces will be induced in it as in any
conductor which is in a state of motion relatively to a magnet.
    As the rotating iron core is also under the influence of the
current in its coil, the question further arises whether an
inductive action is exerted upon it also by this. The conduc
tor of this current rotates in common with the iron core, and
   * In connexion with this I will mention that the rotating motion which
a magnetic needle acquires over a rotating metal disk, and the damping
action which a copper envelope exerts on the vibrations of a magnetic
needle, depend on the same currents ; and both these phenomena were
known at that time, and there was no doubt as to their cause.

             Theory of Dynamo-electrical Machines.             125
is, relatively to it, at rest, and induction can therefore only be
due to alterations in the current itself. Such changes do as a
matter of fact occur in certain positions, particularly in those
portions of the conductor which pass by the brushes, where
the direction of the current is reversed, and these continually
repeated inversions of the current must necessarily have an
inductive action on the core.
    But it can be easily shown, from considerations like those
 in § 9, that the electromotive forces induced in the rotating
 iron core, in the case in which the coil shares in the rotation
 while at the same time those changes of direction occur in it,
must be the same as in the case in which the coil does not take
part in the rotation but when also changes of current do not take
place. In order to determine the induction, we may suppose
that the rotating core is under the simultaneous influence of
 the fixed electromagnet and of an invariable current in the
fixed conductor. We thereby arrive at the result that the forces
 which act inductively upon it are the same as those which act
 magnetically upon it ; and we know with regard to the latter
that they have a resultant whose magnitude, apart from a
 constant factor, may be represented by \/ Ma + N2, and whose
 direction is given by the angle <j> defined in equation (15).
    By the electromotive forces induced in the iron core closed
 currents may be formed which circulate in the iron core itself.
 The formation of these currents may, however, be completely
 hindered if the iron core is suitably split up into parts in such
 a manner that the electricity cannot circulate among them,
 which in Gramme's machine is obtained by using a ring made
 up of iron wire instead of a massive iron one.
    In the cases in which these currents occur to any appreciable
 extent their action is a twofold one. In the first case these
 currents have themselves a magnetic moment, which must be
 taken into account like other magnetic moments ; and in the
 second place they exert a magnetizing action upon iron, and
 thereby alter the existing magnetism of the iron core.
    The strength of the currents induced in the iron core, and
 thus also the magnitude of their magnetic moment, is propor
 tional on the one hand to the inducing force and therefore to
the magnitude s/ + N2, and on the other hand to the velo
city of rotation v. This moment can therefore be expressed
by the product
                             Wms+K5,
 in which -n is a small constant. In determining the moment
 of the magnetism produced by these currents in the iron, it
 must be remembered that the iron in which these currents

126                 Prof. R. Clausius on the
act is already magnetized by other far stronger forces, which
is of great influence on the numerator of the desired expression.
In accordance with the expression given in § 14 for the mag
netic moment P, we have for the moment in question the
expression
                             l+(3i      '
in which D is a constant corresponding to the constant C
which occurs in (14). As both the moments previously de
termined have a common direction of their axes, we may
combine them by addition, and thus obtain a moment of the
magnitude of
   The direction of the axis of this magnetic moment, which is
due to induction, is at right angles to the direction of the force
which the induction produces, so that in determining it wo must
use the angle 0 + ir/2 instead of the angle <f>, which defines the
direction of the force. Hence if we wish to decompose this
moment into components which are in the same directions as
the components Pt and P2 of the moment P, we must multiply
the moment by cos(<£ + 7r/2) and sin (0 + it/2), or, what is the
same thing, by — sin and cos <£. We thus obtain in the
direction of Pt the components
and in the direction of P2 the components
                  nvs/W+W (l+                   cos^.
If we replace in these sin $ and cos $ by their values given in
(15), the expressions of the two components are
           -^N(1+i^)>              ^M(1+TT^>
    We must add these two magnitudes to the magnitudes P,'
and P/, which are derived from P, and P2, by taking into
consideration the magnetic inertia of the iron, in order to
allow for the induction in the iron core. The values of the
components of the whole magnetic moment which is produced
in the iron core may be called P/' and P2", and we may then
put

    These equations we will use as the more general ones instead
 of equations (23). For those machines in which the currents
 induced in the iron core are too insignificant to be taken into
 account, we need only put ^ = 0, and therefore e/ = e, in order
 again to arrive at equations (23).
 § 11. Application of the previous Equations to determining the

    We now return to equations (17) and (18), which we have
given in § 8 for determining the work of the ponderomotive
force and electromotive force for the case in which the core is
at rest, and of which the former must, according to § 9, be
 changed by replacing the product NPj by the product MP3.

   If the outer circuit by which the conductors belonging to
the machine itself are closed contains no further electromotive
force, but the electromotive force E induced in the rotating

if R is the total external resistance, we may from Ohm's law

 if we eliminate from this equation the factor i which occurs
on both sides, and then transfer the mombers on the right
side, which have no denominator, to the left, we have

    We can determine by this equation the strength t of the
current produced by the machine. If we multiply the equa
tion by a + i and b + i, and arrange the members in powers
of i, we get
   i2— (pw— Xvw— a— b)i— (pb + q)w + \avw + abs=0 ; (35)
and by solving this quadratic equation we obtain
                      i=^(pw—\vw — a— b)

    Of the signs before the root the top one is the only one ap
plicable. For the other one would give negative values of i
for all values of v, which would be opposed to the meaning of
the magnitude i defined by this equation. For this equation
is derived from equation (34), where i only occurs in the deno
minators ; and these denominators must be understood to have
the meaning that the sign t in them signifies the absolute value
of the current-strength, and is therefore an essentially positive
magnitude. Using the upper sign we get positive values of
i for all the greater values of v, which must be looked upon as
valid; and only for small values of v which are below a

certain limit do we get negative values of i. This latter
interval we will tor the present disregard, as we shall come
back to it.
    The previous form may also have the following form:—
                       i = ±(pw— Xow— a— b)
        + iV{pw—\vw + a—bf + i(q—pa+pb)w. . . (37)
In this we will introduce two signs for the purpose of simpli
fication; that is,
                                         V--V1
                    '-^-^"K+ifc* *                       •  •   (38)
                   c = g—pa+pb,                                 (39)
by which the equation acquires the following very compen
dious form:—
            i=$(j>w'—a—b)+$V(pw,+a—by+4ew.                  .  (40)
    In order to gain some idea of the magnitude defined by this
equation, we may make the following considerations. The
constant c defined by (39) may be positive or negative accord
ing to the construction of the machine, and may therefore
possibly have the value null. In this case, by the disappear
ance of the sign of the root and eliminating the magnitude a,
there is a great simplificat'on in the form of the equation,
since it passes into
                              i=pw'—b                           (41)
 If we represent the values of i graphically by taking uf as
 abscissa and i as ordinate, we get a straight line, which cuts
 the abscissa-axis in the point at which the abscissa is equal to
 b/p, and rises from here with increasing abscissa under an
 angle the tangent of which is equal to p.
     If c is not equal to null, then if the value it) is referred to
 to', and we thereby consider i to be expressed as a function of
 «/ alone, wo obtam a curve by graphical representation, which
 differs the more from that straight line the greater the absolute
 value of c; the difference being such that its point of intersec
 tion with the abscissa-axis is in a different position, and that it
 is curved in one direction or the other according to the sign of
 c. The curvature, however, is not considerable, and decreases
 with increasing value of «/.
     If the current-strength t is to be directly referred to the
 number of turns v, we must substitute for w and v/ their values
 given in (38). It is particularly significant of these expres
 sions that they have the magnitude K in the denominator, from

              Theory of Dynamo-electrical Machines.            131
which the dependence of the current-strength on the conduc
tivity is apparent, and that on account of the members affected
by the factors p, <r, and X, they increase more slowly than w,
which is important with high values of v.
                § 13. The Starting of the Machine.
   It has been pointed out in the previous paragraphs that the
equation (36), even by using the upper sign, and in corre
spondence therewith the equation (40), for no values of v, gives
negative values oft, which are inadmissible. But this cannot
be understood to mean that the chief equation from which
we have starred (that is II. a) gives untrustworthy results for
small velocities of rotation. We must rather remember that
this equation gave us first the equation (31), from which, only
on dividing by i did we arrive at the equation of the second
degree, the solution of which is given in (36). If we had not
divided by i, we should have had, instead of an equation of
the second degree, one of the third degree, which, besides the
roots given in (36), would have had the root i=0. We must
consider this value null of i as a value satisfying the chief
equation ; and it is this which we must apply in the interval in
which the two other values are untrustworthy.
    Hence, if even with small velocities of rotation we wished to
hold rigidly to the chief equation given in (II. a), we should
arrive at the following results. For small velocities of rotation
the machine gives no current, but its action begins at a certain
velocity of rotation; and now as this increases, there is an in
crease in the current-strength which is in a finite ratio to the
 differences of the velocity. This corresponds in fact to expe
 rience with such approximation that the interval in which the
 machine is inactive has received a special name, the first few
turns having been called the dead turns.
    It must not, however, be regarded as strictly correct to apply
 equation (II. a) even with small velocities of rotation, but, at
 any rate with velocities in which that equation would indicate
 no current, we must take into account the remanent magnetism
in the iron of the fixed electromagnet arising from the previous
magnetization.
    In deducing the above chief equations we have defined the
 magnetic moment of the fixed electromagnet by the equation
                                 Ai'
                           M=
                                1+ai'
 For small values of i this equation would give correspondingly
 small values of M, and for i=0 the value M=0. Bui if a
          magnetization is present in the iron before the action

132                 Prof. R. Clausius on tlie
of the current, this must of course be taken into account in
determining the magnetization which occurs with weak cur
rents. It would be difficult to say how this should be done
in order to attain the greatest accuracy; nor does it concern
us for the present purpose, for we may content ourselves
with an approximation. This will be as follows:—Let p be
the moment of the remanent magnetism, assumed to be small;
we will first define the value of i, for which the above ex
pression for M has the value (i. Thus, if ii is the correspond
ing value of t, we must put
                                1 + «ix'
from which follows
                          h=T^—                              (42)
    From this determination we will settle that for all values of
i, which are smaller than ij the equation
                              M=/i
shall be applied for determining the magnetic moment M;
and for all values of i which are greater than the equation
                           M       M
                                  1 + a.i
    We thus arrive at a method which is to be applied during
the starting of the machine. At the outset we must consider
the magnet as a magneto-electrical machine, the fixed magnet
of which has the small value p. Such a machine acts as a
 current-producer even with small velocities of rotation, and
 the current increases with an increase in the velocity of rota
 tion; but from the smallness of p this increase can only bo
 very slow. But when the velocity of rotation has become so
 great that the strength of the current has become i„ the
 machine acts as dynamo-electrical machine in which the
 fixed electromagnet has then also the moment ft, and gives a
 current of the same strength; and from this period we apply
 the principal equation, II. a, deduced for the dynamo machine,
 in order to determine the current-strength.
    The question now arises, what is that velocity of rotation, in
 which the machine gives as dynamo machine the same current
 as the magneto-electrical machine, that is the current of
 strength iv In determining this value of t>, which may bo
 called vu we have to put t] (40) in place of i. We will at
 the same time denote the values of w and w/, corresponding

                Theory of Dynamo-electrical Machines.           133
  to the value vx of v, by wi and wx'. We thus obtain
          h = a (P^i —a—b) + %\/{pwi! + a—b)'i + ±cwl,
  from which follows
             (a + i^pwi +cw1=(a + il)(b + i1)                  (43)
  In this we have to determine for wx and v>i their expressions
  from (33) and (38),

 in order to determine vv
    We will make this determination here only approximately.
 For since the members containing the factors X and a only
 need, from their smallness, be considered with great velocities,
 we may with the velocities in question reject them without
 hesitation. We have then to put

still further. From the smallness of the magnetic moment
p, of the remanent magnetism, the strength of current t\ is
very insignificant compared with that which occurs when the
machine is in full work; and hence, as already mentioned, it
is usual to disregard the currents which occur with small velo
cities of rotation, and which only slowly rise to the strength {,
and to consider that the production of the current only takes
place with a certain velocity of rotation. From this point of
view we have to assign a limiting value to the corresponding
velocity which it acquires when p., and therefore also i, ap
proaches zero. If this limiting value of i\ be called v0, we
have, from the previous equation,

INSULATING supports consisting of rods rising through
        the necks of glass jars containing concentrated sulphuric
 acid, for tho purpose of absorbing moisture which otherwise
 would condense upon the glass, appear to have been first intro
 duced in practice by Sir William Thomsonf. Similar devices
 have been more recently designed by Mascartf, by Professor
 Clifton §, and by Professors Ayrton and Perry. The apparatus
 of Mascart differs only from tho original design of Sir W.
 Thomson in having the central support of glass solidly fused
 to the bottom o" the jar which holds the acid, and in having
 the jar formed with a narrow neck instead of a wide one. This
 construction, though convenient in point of portability and
 solidity, renders necessary the addition of a tubuluro at the
 side of the vessel by which to introduce the acid. The cost of
 the apparatus, which cannot be made except by a professional
  glass-blower, is consequently considerable.
     Such supports are, in spite of their cost, of so great utility,
 especially in a humid climate, that a cheaper substitute of
 equally high insulation is a desideratum. In the electrical
 laboratory of University College, Bristol, insulating supports
  of the type about to be described are found of very great use.
      A piece of combustion-tube, about 20 centim. long and 1*4
  centim. diameter, is fused together at one end, and the closed
  end is slightly enlarged by blowing, and then slightly flattened
  at its extremity. This tube, which forms the central support,

is placed upright in a wide-mouthed bottle of hard white flint-
glass about 10 centim. high and 5*5 centim. diameter, in which
about 50 to 70 grammes of paraffin-wax have been melted.
When the paraffin solidifies it contracts greatly ; but if the
bottle be not too large, holds the stem firmly in its place. To
keep out the dust a lid, formed from a disk of gutta-percha
about 2 millim. thick, softened by dipping into boiling water,
is placed loose-tight on the stem. The arrangement is shown
in fig. 1. The upper end of the central tube is open, and
 affords a convenient means of placing on the support various
 different objects, such as a metal ball fixed on a metal rod, or
 a flat metal plate on which to stand any object that is to be
 insulated. For carrying wires over a table in experiments
requiring high insulation, rods of flint-glass of 25 to 30 centim.
length, curled at the top in the form of a crook or other hook-
 form, as shown in figs. 2 to 5, are placed in the central tube
 of the insulating support, and the wires are slung in them.
 The insulation-resistance of these supports is many hundreds
 of megohms even in damp weather. Should a film of dust
 accumulate on the surface of the paraffin in consequence of any
 neglect in lowering the gutta-percha cap, the insulator only
 requires to be warmed to the melting-point of paraffin to
 restore the lost insulation. For work requiring very special
 insulation, sulphuric acid is poured over the top of the paraffin;
 and in some cases solid stems of glass have been used instead
 of glass tube. Hitherto there has been no trouble from yield
 ing in the paraffin, which was feared at the outset as a possible
 fault. A good hard paraffin has been used ; and as the flat
 tened form given to the basal enlargement of the glass tube
 constitutes in itself a foot to the central support, there is little
 or no tendency for the paraffin to bend under the weight that
 may be placed for a few hours on tho top of the support. To
 add stability to the apparatus, the bottle is let into a wooden
 foot. The total cost of the apparatus is less than one tenth of
 the price charged for the apparatus of Mascart.
    XVII. On the Reduction of Observations. By F. Y. Edge-
    worth, M.A., Lecturer on Logic at King's College, London*.
 IN an article on the Method of Least Squares which lately
        appeared in this Journalf I attempted to answer two
 questions—first, why is one mode of reducing observations to
 be preferred to another, and, secondly, what is the preferable
 mode in certain important cases. The answer to the first
                    * Communicated by the Author,
                   i; November 1883.

13fi                Mr. F. Y. Edgeworth on the
question was that the most advantageous value is to be pre
ferred to the most probable; the answer to the second question
was in great part a statement of most probable values. The
connexion between principle and practice was not very clearly
indicated. I now attempt to supply this deficiency.
   In reducing observations, whichever end, the most probable
or most advantageous, we propose, there are two methods of
pursuing it—according as the first step of our investigation
is determined only by considerations of convenience, or is
expressly directed to the end. The former method begins by
assuming that the qucesitum is some simple function of the
observations (in particular the weighted arithmetic mean), and
goes on to calculate the constants so that the value obtained
may be either that which is most frequently right, or that which
is most advantageous, account being taken not only of the
frequency but also the seriousness of error. The latter pur
sues the same ends without any initial step in the dark ;
making choice, not from a particular family, but from the
whole world, of functions. The former method is described
by Laplace as applicable to " observations non faites encore "*;
the latter to " observations deja faites." DeMorganf repeats
this distinction. It must not be inferred that, as DeMorgan's
 expressions suggest, the latter method has over the former the
 superiority of a posteriori probability over a priori. In pur
 suing the former method we do not act like him who, having
 to infer the contents of an urnj, falls back upon the a priori
 probability that one constitution is as likely as another, with
 out availing himself of the result of drawings from the urn.
 We do not propose to ignore the observations, or what is
 known of their generation, when we seek a workable formula
 of reduction expressed in terms of the observations. Such
 a formula might be supposed framed after, as well as before,
 the observations are made ; just as the more perfect formula
 might be framed before as well as after. You must of course
 first catch your hare before you can cook it, whether plainly
 or elaborately ; but you may write out the receipt for either
 culinary process as \vell before as after the capture. Accord
 ingly 1 venture to suggest that the distinction under consi
 deration might be more safely expressed by the terms relative
 and absolute. Both methods seek a maximum; the former
 subject to a condition, the latter not. The absolute method
 would generally be allowed to be more perfect theoretically ;
 the relative method has hitherto been supposed to be the only

one on a large scale practicable. We started with the relative
method* lately ; we shall now pursue the absolute.
    As before, let us follow in the footsteps of Laplacef, merely
diverging from him in this respect—that whereas he employs
a definite function, a " representative particular," as Berkeley
 might call it, to express the detriment of error, we shall em
ploy the general undetermined function F. Let us suppose
 with Laplace the facility-curves for all the observations iden
 tical and known, say <£. Let
where *7Tj j tTg • • • III'' ' the observations. Let I be the sought,
most advantageous, value. Let us put for the detriment in
curred by taking / for the real point, when it really is a/, not
with Laplace the particular function l—x1, but the general
function F(Z — j/). Integrating the detriment incurred in
the long run, we find by steps indicated by Laplace (remem
bering that F(0) = 0) that the most advantageous value is
given by the equation
              J "F(Y-%W=J' ¥(l-^)i/aW,
where + oo are used to denote the extreme limits of the facility-
curves. The solution of this equation is the central pointj of
the curve i/; if, as Laplace argues, we may regard that curve
as capable of being represented by
                                    He-M-p*J.
Laplace's argument is in effect that, in integration, a factor of
the expression to be integrated may be neglected, when for
small values of the variable the factor is nearly unity, and for
large values factor and multiplicand each nearly zero. Now
this is the very argument which is employed to prove§ the
exponential law of error as valid in general ; the argument
which is questioned by Mr. Glaisher[|, and which, if our
remarksl! on the law of error are correct, is proved, not only
by theory but example, not to hold universally. I submit
therefore, with great deference, that Laplace's argument holds
(at least is known to hold) only in two cases, precisely those
for which the exponential law of error holds: first, where
the facility- curves are of the family named "Probability";
secondly, when the facility-curves, however irregular, have
limits indefinitely small relatively to the number of observa-

 138                  Mr. F. Y. Edgeworth on the
 tions*. For (1) in the general case let the facility-functions first
 be symmetrical. And, according to the usual proof of the law
 of error, multiply each by cos ax, and integrate with regard to x
 between extreme limits, and multiply together the reciprocal
 functions so obtained. The resulting function in a, say 0( ),
 will, in general, differ from the type *Hs*2a2 (where 1? is the
 mean square of error) by a remainder R which is of the form
r1a4 + r2et6+ &c, where ru r2, &c. are not, in general, known
to vanishf. Therefore the law of error will differ from the
 exponential type by a remainder ^ R cos axda, which is not
 in general known to be insensible. For example, if the facility-
 functions are of the general reproductive type symbolized
 below on page 140, when t is sensibly different from 2, the law
 of error employed in the method of least squares is sensibly
erroneous. And at the same time it appears that the absolute
method falls along with the relative. For if the y of Laplace
could in general be regarded as a probability-curve, then, con
sidering the reciprocals of the facility-curves, we see that their
0(a) is of the form e-0"'; their law of error must bo expo
 nential, which has been shown not to be in general true.
A fortiori in the case of unsymmetrical functions:—(2) In
the particular case where the limits of the facility- functions
are indefinitely small, let them first be symmetrical of the
form A— C.r2, powers of the variable above the second being
neglected. Then, according to the absolute method, the quae-
situm is rightly given by the equation
                  ^(^-^)+§(-r-.r2) + &c.=0,
                                   Q
where it is easily seen that          is proportional to the inverse
mean square. And at the same time it appears that the expo
nential law of error employed in the relative method (the
method of least squares) is in this case correct. For in this
case 6(a) must be of the required type; R must be zero, since
the inverse mean powers are negligible. When the functions
are not symmetrical, say A — Bx— Cx2, where the origin is
taken so that S -j = 0, the preceding statements still hold good ;
except that ^ no longer is proportional to the inverse mean
square. Thus, ifeither of the two conditions is fulfilled, Laplace's

 reasoning may be extended to facility-curves not identical. It
 will be found that the absolutely most advantageous coincides
 with the absolutely most probable values. This is the weighted
 arithmetic mean, where the weight of each observation is the
 inverse mean-square-of-error ; which is also the relatively
 both most advantageous and most probable value. Thus our
four guides, though theoretically and in general divergent, do
 in a particular but doubtless very extensive case all lead to
  the same point.
     In general, where neither of the conditions above stated is
 known to be fulfilled, the absolutely most advantageous, ac
 cording to us the supreme end, becomes lost to view. Some
 indications as to its whereabouts may be suggested by the
 secondary end, the most probable value, and confirmed by the
 relative method. Unfortunately not much is likely to be
 known about the facility-functions on which the calculation
 of the absolutely most probable value depends ; and the rela
 tive method has not been extended, as far as I know, to (the
determination of the constants in) other means beside the
arithmetical. A few general remarks may here be offered.
    (a) Suppose it is known that the facility-curve for each
observation is of the form <p(.v, c), where c may have any
value between indefinitely wide limits ; then the most probable
value is obtained by differentiating Laplace's y1, not only
with regard to a/, but also with regard to each constant.
(/3) Another general remark is, that the most probable value
is not necessarily a continuous function of the observations.
For instance, let there be two observations, X\ and x2, each
generated by the curve - ^         ^.    The most probable value is
-^2~^¦} provided that —           — < 1.    But for higher values of
the distance between the observations, the mean is a position
of minimum probability. The (absolutely) most probable
value is
                        +     ±                   h
This incident is illustrated by the theorem in the relative
method, that in the case supposed* there is no advantage in
taking in, including in our arithmetic mean, an additional
observation. (7; The preceding example shows that tho
mean of two observations is not, as has been saidf, the (abso-

  It need not be in any sense. It may be a position ofminimum
 probability for all values of the distances between the obser
 vations. The most probable value afforded by two or more
 observations may be, not any intermediate point, but any one
 of the observations. This incident is illustrated by the relative
 theorem that for some species of facility-curves we obtain a
 worse result by taking in additional observations. For in
 stance, if the facility-curve* is of the form
                          -1   e~* cos ah.v act
 (a not changing sign), the multiplication of observations di
 minishes probability and advantage if t is less than unity ; the
 weightedf arithmetic mean g-ixl^-gix2 + &,c-T-^>g is the posi
 tion of minimum advantage and probability. (8) Generally
 speaking, the absolutely most advantageous value is not out-
 sidej, though it may be coincident with, the outmost observa
 tions ; and is most likely to be in the neighbourhood of those
 observations which have mostweigJit—which flow from sources
 known by previous experience or by deduction to yield obser
 vations least divergent from the real§ value.
     I propose now, in the light of this additional theory, to
review the practical rules which were stated in a former essay.
Adopting the classification there given || , and beginning with
 symmetrical curves, we see that the solution of species (1) in
 Class I. is not only, as universally admitted, the absolutely
most probable value, but also, according to Laplace's reasoning,
the absolutely most advantageous. Species (1) of Class II.
is now raised to the same level of certainty. Where Laplace's
method of " observations non faites encore " is applicable to
this case, there his method of " observations deja faites " is
also applicable. The necessity of an initial step in the dark
under which the Method of Least Squares has hitherto laboured
is done away with. Species (3) of both classes is, I think,
raised to the same level of certainty. The solution of species
(4) which I have suggested*! has not perhaps the highest
certainty of the absolutely most advantageous value, but such
certainty as the most probable value affords**; that is as much

  as most people have ever thought of asking for. When the
  observations are indefinitely numerous, that is in general in
  Class II., then an approximate treatment of the equation of de
  gree n— 1* incidental to this case becomes appropriate. With
  regard to unsymmetric curves, the doubts which were before t
  thrown out as to the application of the Poissonian analysis
  to the solution of this case are confirmed, since the " abso-

  identical with the weights assigned by the " relative " analysis,
  the inverses of Mr. Todhunter's h* (' Hist. Prob.' Art. 1002,
 p. 565).
     There remains over the class of facility-curves which are
 not known to possess either of the conditions required equally
 by the absolute and relative method. In this case we must
 fall back upon the general remarks above offered ()3, y, 8).
 Many of the applications of Probabilities to the social sciences
 belong to this category. In balancing Testimony numerical
 precision, as Mr. Venn has justlyf insisted, is out of the ques
 tion. But we may obtain what the same writer, in reference
 to the theory of belief, calls a " logical foothold," by perceiving
 that the problem of Testimony may be regarded as a degraded
 case of the problem of observations; in which, instead of an
indefinite number of degrees presented by the continual varia
tion of our scale (the abscissa x), we have only two degrees—
Truth and Falsehood. The measurement of the Useful in
general (including the Beautiful) is more like the problem of
physical observations in respect of number of degrees ; but it
 differs more from it in this respect—that in the moral mea
 surements there is never an objectively real value ; and there
fore that the weight of authorities cannot even conceivably be
tested in this case, as in physics, by their divergence (in pre
vious experience) from an objective real point. For us, how
ever, who hold that the divergence of a source of observations
does always, even in Physics, theoretically involve§ a subjec
tive estimate of advantage, the difference in question is not of
paramount importance. But this is not the place to pursue
these reflections.

   XVIII. On some Points in Climatology. A Rejoinder to
               Mr. Croll. By Simon Newcomb*.
IN the Philosophical Magazine for October 1883, page 241,
      Mr. CroU publishes a reply to certain criticisms of mine
urged seven years ago against his theory of the cause of glacial
epochs (American Journal of Science, vol. xi. p. 263, May
1876). The pleasure and interest with which I have read
Mr. Croll's paper induce me to reply to it, notwithstanding
a'want of confidence on my part in the value of anything
short of a purely mathematical investigation of the subject.
It will be well to begin by examining the nature of the ques
tion, and stating in a broad way what seems to me unsatisfac
tory in the foundation of Mr. Croll's method.
   What we are concerned with is the inference that at some
former epoch in geological history the mean temperature of
the northern hemisphere was much lower than it is now.
Assuming this as the basis of discussion, the question is, what
was the cause of this " glacial epoch"? To speak more accu
rately, since we can only take the causes relatively, Why was
tho northern hemisphere any colder then than it is now ? This
question Mr. Croll endeavours to answer from purely astro
nomical causes, combined with elementary considerations
respecting the motion of heat and its relation to meteorolo
gical phenomena. His conclusion is that a great eccentricity
of the earth's orbit, combined with a position of tho perihelion
near the northern solstice, will cause a great annual fall of
temperature in the northern hemisphere, which in such a case
would have a short perihelion summer and a long aphelion
winter.
   To this my reply is, that too little is known of the laws of
terrestrial radiation of heat through the atmosphere to justify
the establishment of any theory of the glacial epoch, and that,
taking the case up exactly as Mr. Croll does, he fails to show
sound reason why the mean temperature should be different at
the supposed periods. At the same time my verdict would be,
not that Mr. Croll's thesis was false, but that it was not proven.
I do not deny the possibility that, when the laws of climate
become thoroughly known, it may be found that epochs of
great eccentricity are always glacial epochs. All I claim is
that if such should be proven to be the case, it will be through
the action of causes different from those adduced by Mr. Croll.
   In fact, without going any further, we have at hand a vera
causa acting in this direction which has not been considered
                  * Communicated by the Author.

                  On some Points in Climatology.               143
  by Mr. Croll at all. Experiments on radiation, commenced
  by Dulong and Petit, tend to show that Newton's theory of
  the proportionality between temperature and radiation is not
  well founded, and that, as temperature rises, radiation increases
  in a much higher ratio. To speak more exactly, if we take a
  series of temperatures in arithmetical progression, the corre
  sponding rates of radiation of heat will not be in arithmetical
  progression, but in a series of which the differences continually
  increase. An immediate inference from this general law is
  that, if an isolated body receive a given amount of radiant
  energy per annum, its mean annual temperature will be a
  maximum when this radiation is uniform, and will be lower
  the more irregular the reception of heat.
     Now it is well known that the total amount of heat received,
  not only by the earth as a whole, but by each hemisphere, is
  constant, notwithstanding the change in the earth's eccen
 tricity; but in virtue of the law just stated, any portion of the
 earth's surface on which a large portion of the annual supply
 of heat is delivered during a short summer will have a lower
 mean temperature than the hemisphere on which the heat is
 distributed more uniformly. But Mr. Groll does not, so far as
 I have ever noticed, adduce this law at all. On the contrary,
 he assumes Newton's law of radiation proportional to tempera
 ture, under which the cause would not act in the way suggested.
    One great source of inconclusiveness in Mr. CrolPs results
 seems to me to be a lack of quantitative precision in his
 language. Though he may use numbers wherever it seems to
 him they are applicable, one can hardly fail to notice that the
 quantitative terms he most uses are such as " great," " very
 great," "small," "comparatively small," and these without
 any statement of the units of comparison relatively to which
 the expressions are used. Now I deem it not improbable that
 the difference between a cold and a hot epoch may be duo to
 the very small preponderance of one or the other of several
antagonistic causes ; and, if so, quantitative precision is neces
sary to lead to any reliable conclusion.
    1 shall now enter into some details. Mr. Croll suggests that
I may have forgotten the researches of Pouillet and Herschel
into the temperature of space. I reply that I regard the con
clusion that the temperature of space is —239° as having no
sound basis. To speak with greater quantitative exactness, it
has precisely the same value as a photometric estimate of the
intensity of starlight, founded on observations of the sky
made in full day, with an attempt to eliminate the light
reflected by the sky so as to find what residue comes from the
stars. The fact is, that no observations of radiant heat from

 144                 Mr. S. Newcomb on some
 stellar spaces at large can be made below the uppermost limits
 of the earth's atmosphere, owing to the intervention in lower
 regions of the radiation from the atmosphere itself. Mr. Croll
 concludes, using Newton's law of radiation, that the heat
 received from the stars is to that received from the sun as 222
 to 299. I wonder that he did not see in this a reductio ad
 absurdum either of the results of Pouillet and Herschel, or of
•the law of radiation which he assumes. Photometry shows that
 the combined light from all the stars visible in the most
 powerful telescope is not a millionth of that received from the
 sun, and there is no reason for believing that the ratio of light
 to heat is incomparably different in the two cases.
    In considering the question of the heat conveyed by aerial
 currents, Mr. Croll quotes from my former paper so fully and
 fairly that I do not see any necessity to repeat my views at
 length. I can only say that while I now see more plainly than
 before some reason why a body at the upper region of the
 earth's atmosphere should, on the average, be colder than at
 the surface, I do not see that we have data for fixing the fall
 of temperature at 5° or 100°. If the degree of cold is greater
 than that due to expansion, then Mr. Croll is right in main
 taining that the aerial current would not carry to the poles all
 the heat with which it left the equator. But, even granting
 this condition, I see no ground for supposing the quantity of
 heat conveyed insignificant.
    I shall now consider some of Mr. Croll's reasons why the
 ocean should be warmer than the land. His assumed law that
 a body transparent for heat-rays would become warmer under
 solar radiation than an opaque body, I passed over in my
 former criticism as too much opposed to the fundamental laws
 of thermodynamics to need much consideration. He now
 adduces, in support of his thesis, the fact that water is more
 transparent to the solar rays than the rays which it would
 itself radiate ; and that the upper layers of water would act
 like the glass of a greenhouse, and thus allow the water to
 stand at a higher temperature than it would otherwise do.
 This addition to the modus operandi seems to me quite sound,
 and therefore to show one true cause why water might rise to
 a higher mean temperature than the land, though I am unable
  to say whether the increase would be measurable with an
 ordinary thermometer. But I am sorry to find that, notwith
  standing his addition of a sound cause, he adheres to views so
  diametrically opposite to what I supposed to be the funda
  mental laws of thermodynamics, that I feel compelled to state
 the case more fully. His first reason why the ocean should
 be warmer than the land is in the following words:—

                        Points in Climatology.                   145
     "First.—The ground stores up heat only by the slow process of
  conduction, whereas water, by the mobility of its particles and its
  transparency for heat-rays, especially those from the sun, becomes
  heated to a considerable depth rapidly. The quantity of heat stored
  up in the ground is thus comparatively small, while the quantity
  stored up in the ocean is great."
     As just remarked, Mr. Croll substitutes a sound reason for
  this utterly bad one, but still seems inclined to hold on to the
  latter. The confusion of ideas which pervades it can best be
  shown by making some attempt to put the statements into
  quantitative language, using numbers, lengths, &c, instead of
  the qualifying words " slow," " considerable," " rapidly,"
  " comparatively small," and " great." His statement would
 then read something in this shape : —The ground stores up
 heat only by the process of conduction which admits of only
 10 calories per square metre being absorbed in a day, whereas
 water, by the mobility of its particles &c, becomes heated to a
 depth of thirty feet at the rate of 1° Fahr. per hour (day or
week as the case might be). Thus only 1000 units of heat
are stored up in a cubic metre of earth, while 5000 units per
cubic meter are stored up in the ocean.
    When stated in this form, the question how hot the ocean
would get at the end of x days, weeks, or years under the
supposed law of heating, and how the number of units of heat
stored up respectively in the ground and the ocean would fix
their respective temperatures, would at once have arisen in
Mr. Croll's own mind and showed him the utter failure of his
reasoning ; but by using instead of numbers the qualifying
phrases 1 have quoted he confuses integral quantity of heat,
rate at which heat is radiated in a unit of time, heat stored
up, and temperature, without destroying the apparent sound
ness of his argument in the mind of the uncritical reader.
    The second reason is in the following words:—
   " Second.—The air is probably heated more rapidly by contact
with the ground than with the ocean ; but, on the other hand, it is
heated far more rapidly by radiation from the ocean than from the
land. The aqueous vapour of the air is to a great extent diather-
manous to radiation from the ground, while it absorbs the rays
from water and thus becomes heated."
    Here, again, the fallacy of the reasoning will be seen by
giving the respective number of degrees, or any quantitative
statement of the rate at which the air was heated by radiation
from the ocean and from the land respectively. The fact I
suppose to be that there is no rapidity of heating in question,
but that the question is simply one of stationary temperature

146                 Mr. S. Newcomb on /some
to bo ultimately reached. I must repeat that I know not the
slightest authority for the statement in the last sentence
quoted, and can gain no clear idea from what Mr. Croll says
on the subject.
    In considering the third reason, which I need not quote, but
which is found in Mr. Croll's reply, I suggested in my former
paper what I supposed to be a reductio ad absurdum of Mr.
Croll's method of reasoning, by pointing out the apparent con
clusion that two bodies could heat each other up by their
mutual radiation. I supposed he would disclaim this conclu
sion and try to show that I had misunderstood his premises in
 drawing it, but he apparently accepts its possibility as a logical
 result of Provost's well-known theory of exchanges.
   The fourth reason may be summarily disposed of in the
same way as the preceding ones. Let the reader take it up as
presented by the author ; let him substitute quantitative state
ments at pleasure for the words " more freely," " greater,"
" greater difficulty," " more rapidly," " of higher mean tem
perature," &c, and let him also bear in mind that it is stationary
temperatures and not quantities of heat with which we are
ultimately concerned, and the inconclusive character of the
reasoning will be at once apparent.
    I shall next pass to the question of the non-melting of snow
during a short perihelion summer, in which, as I stated in my
former review, calculating temperatures by Mr. Croll's formula,
we should have a mean temperature ranging from 100° to
150° Fahr. I had to acknowledge some embarrassment from
Mr. Croll's causes producing their effects through the two
diametrically opposite modes of operation, to wit :—
   1st. By making the air exceedingly transparent, and thus
permitting radiation into space.
   2ndly. By filling the air with fogs, and thus preventing the
solar heat from reaching the ground.
   His reply to this is that ho did not suppose the fogs and the
clear atmosphere to exist at tho same place and at the same
time, but that in either case an inability on the part of the sun's
rays to melt the few inches of snow which could have fallen
during winter would have resulted.
    1 seo no use in arguing this point, for the simple reason
that 1 do not know enough about the relations of temperature
to the aqueous vapour in the atmosphere to admit of my saying
any thing of value on tho subject. I would merely remark
that I cannot see in Mr. Croll's reasoning the slightest ground
for admitting that tho perihelion summer radiation would
produce any other effect than it does now.
   I am surprised that Mr. Croll should have been willing to

                     Points in Climatology.                  147
  resent reasoning so obviously inconclusive as that in which
  e endeavours to show that my objection to the reliableness of
his dates for glacial epochs, on account of the insufficiency of
the fundamental data for the secular variations of the planetary
orbits, falls to the ground. My objection and his statement
in reply I can leave to the judgment of the reader who chooses
to refer to them.
    I conceive that some general remarks on the nature of the
problem will be of more value than a further analysis of Mr.
Croll's reasoning. It is an observed fact that we now have a
glacial epoch at a comparatively moderate height in the atmo
sphere, and on the tops of most high ranges of mountains far
removed from the equator. It is evident that if, at any former
epoch, the state of things at the surface of the ground was the
same that it now is at the height of two or three miles in the
atmosphere, there must have been a glacial epoch. To what
causes are we to attribute the cold of the upper regions of the
air? There are two known causes, but we cannot assign an
exact quantitative effect to each.
    I. The passage of air from the lower to the upper regions is
accompanied by expansion, and the reverse motion by com
pression, which would naturally result in the upper regions
being colder than the lower : the exact amount of cooling,
supposing no disturbing cause to come into play, is readily
computed, and has, I think, been assigned by Professor Sir
William Thomson and others ; but I need not now refer to
the results.
    II. Researches on radiant heat seem to show that the atmo
sphere absorbs the exi-reme rays of the spectrum, especially
those of greatest wave-length, more powerfully than the rays
of mean wave-length. The rays radiated by the earth are of
longer wave-length than the great mass of those received by
the sun. The natural result of this selective absorption would
be to make the temperature of the earth higher than if there
 were no atmosphere, or if the atmosphere exercised no selective
 absorption on heat-rays. It seems probable that this selective
absorption is due veiy largely, if not entirely, to aqueous
vapour in the air. If this be so, an epoch of dry air would be
a glacial one.
    A crude test of the efficacy of the first cause might be de
vised. In order that it may act, it is essential that there shall
be a continuous interchange of air between low and high
altitudes. Now if there are any high table-lands so extended
that, in their central portions, the air has not during several
days an opportunity to be replenished from lower regions, such
air should be warmer than that at an equal height on isolated

mountains. Probably the conditions for such an observation
do not exist on the earth's surface.
    In conclusion, I may be allowed to express my regret at
not being able to make a contribution of positive value to the
investigation of this subject. The state of the question is about
this :—A well-founded theory of terrestrial temperature can
be built only upon an accurate knowledge of the laws of
emission and absorption of radiaut energy of different wave
lengths, especially in the atmosphere, and tho result will
appear as a numerical calculation, more or less exact, of the
temperature resulting from assigned conditions, and not as the
conclusion of an argument to show one thing or another.
                XIX. Note on the White Rainbow.
                   By John Tyndall, F.R.S.*
 THE highest portion of Hind Head Moorland, which is
        close to tho spot where I now write, is about. 900 feet
 above the sea. Over this high plateau, at the present season
 of the year, mist and fog frequently settle. This has given
 me of late frequent opportunities of observing, on dark nights,
 the white circular bows described in my last brief communi
 cation to the Philosophical Magazine. All fogs are not able
 to produce these circles. What is usually known as " Scotch
 mist " appears eminently suitable for this purpose.
     Last Christinas Day was heralded by mist and fog of a very
 dense character. Both, however, became thinner as the day
 advanced ; and finally a blue sky overarched the moorland.
 Accompanied by my wife I walked out upon the common.
 When facing the sun we noticed the air alive with small
 glistening specks. They were an obvious residuum of the fog,
 produced probably by the coalescence of its smaller particles to
 minute drops. My previous experience led me to infer that these
 specks or globules must be able to produce some kind of rain
 bow. The inference was immediately verified. Turning my
  back to the sun, and looking across the Devil's Punch Bowl,
  a well-defined white bow was seen spanning that remarkable
  basin. The sky above us was blue at the time, tho fog had
  disappeared, and nothing which could be properly called rain
  existed in the atmosphere.
     Circular bows are sometimes seen on looking from the edge
  of a precipice into an abyss filled with fog. But the precipice,
  though useful, is not necessary, as the following observation
  shows. Standing upon the common, with a perfectly level
  area of dark heather in front of us, and watching with the

   keenest interest the weird phenomenon before us, my wife
   suddenly announced that she saw the bow continued to a circle
  at her feet. Almost at the same moment, I saw the circle
  myself. With the dark heather as a background, the floating
  globules between us and it were able to send us sufficient light
  to render the completion of the band visible. M. Cornu has
  recently communicated to the Paris Academy of Sciences an
   account of a white bow observed by himself. This leads me to
  hope that the phenomenon observed at Hind Head may possess,
  for scientific men, sufficient interest to justify some notice of
  it in the Philosophical Magazine*.
      Looking since last month into the literature of the rainbow,
  I find, thanks to Professor Dewar, that an interesting series
 of experiments on showers derived from liquids other than
 water has been executed by Dr. Hammerlf, who, however,
 made use of solar instead of artificial light, and could, there
 fore, hardly have obtained the effects described by me. An
 inspection of Sir John Herschel's Table of refractive indices
 suggests, among others, spirit of turpentine, petroleum, and
 a solution of chloride of ammonium as suitable liquids for rain
 bows ; and with these liquids both Dr. Hammerl and myself
 have experimented—he first, and I afterwards. Dr. Hammerl's
 paper leads me to express the hope that he may have the oppor
 tunity afforded him of continuing uis investigations.
     I have also to refer to an interesting analysis of the
rainbow published by the Abbe Eaillard as an Appendix to
his translation of my 'Notes on Light.' In the Comptes
Rendus, M. Raillard combated with great ability the notion
(which never took root in England) that fog was composed of
little bladders or vesicles, instead of full droplets; and in his
appendix he lays particular stress on that portion of Dr.
Young's theory which refers to the smallness of the drops.
He also mentions certain experiments executed by M. Salles-
Girons, an account of which I have been unable to find.
M. Salles-Girons is described as the inventor of a " pulverizer
of liquids," which must be similar to those employed in the
Houses of Parliament. It is, as I have already said, a modi
fication of an arrangement used by Savart. Rainbows were
produced from the spray thus obtained ; and the finer the
water-dust the less colour was shown by the rainbow. The
steam-boiler referred to in my last communication, as com-
    • The white rainbow was first observed by Ulloa on the mountain
Pambamarca in Peru, and described in a work published under the
auspices of the King of Spain in 1 7-1h. The French translation consulted
by me was published in Amsterdam and Leipzig in 1752.

pared with other modes of producing a shower, yields instruc
tive results of this nature.
   Ur. Hammerl has pointed out the great difference in the
angular distance of the primary and secondary bows produced
by a small change of the index of refraction. The distance
between primary and secondary I find to be much greater in a
shower of sal-ammoniac solution than in a shower of water.
With paraffin the secondary is thrown so far back that some
practice is required to bring its circle into view. Extremely
beautiful effects are produced by liquids whose globules diminish
by evaporation while suspended in the air. The whitening of
the primary and the widening of the supernumerary bands
are, in these circumstances, highly instructive to observe.
Young's conclusion that the white rainbow is due to the small-
ness of the falling drops, and not, as Bravais supposed, to the
hollowness of the drops, is fully borne out by these expe
riments.
XX. On E(]uilibrium in Salt-Solutions. By W. W. J. NiCOL,
    M.A., B.Sc, F.R.S.E., F.C.S., Lecturer on Chemistry,
   Mason College, Birmingham*.
THE following paper is a continuation of one I had the
       honour of communicating to the Chemical Society some
time ago, entitled " The Volume Alteration attending the mix
ture of Salt-Solutions "f. In that paper I gave examples of
the way in which the volume-change on the mixture of salt-
solutions might be applied to the solution of the questions
connected with the mode of arrangement of the salts after
mixture. I have since been able to investigate more fully
Case II. in my previous paper, and I hope to be able to
throw some light on the changes in arrangement which take
 place when solutions, capable of double decomposition, are
mixed. Such solutions contain different metals and different
Rait radicals : if the two salts be represented by ME and M'R',
then one of the following three states of equilibrium will
prevail:—

   Cases (1) and (2) are essentially the same, being comple
 mentary to one another. Case (3) is usually referred to as
 the Law of Berthollet ; and though long regarded as a correct
statement of the facts of the case, lias been recently shown by
 Berthelot to be untrue in certain instances ; the general con
clusion to be drawn from his work being that, when a salt of
a weak acid and a strong base is mixed with a salt of a strong
acid and a weak base in solution, then Case (2) holds good,
complete double decomposition ensuing ; the cause which
determines the course of the reaction being the superior affi
nity of the strong base and the strong acid for one another,
which together with that of the weak acid for the weak base
produces a development of heat greater than that required for
the decomposition of the original salts. This is in strict
agreement with the principle of maximum work. Berthelot's
experiments * in support of the above comprised salts of
(NH4), Na, K, Fe,Zn, &c. with CI, (C2 H3 Os), (NO,), (S04),
(C03), &c., and are numerous enough to guarantee the general
truth of his conclusions. With regard, however, to the state
of equilibrium existing betwjen two strong acids and two
strong bases, he readily enough admits the inefficiency of the
thermal-change method of investigation to solve the problem,
but inclines to a belief in the general truth of Berthollet's
law, and believes it probable that all four salts exist ready
formed in the solution. This conclusion is based partially on
the fact that when a concentrated solution, of two salts of dif
ferent acids and bases, is exposed to varying temperatures, it
may deposit now one salt and now another.

   In my former paper I gave the results of experiments on

NaCl + KN03 is always formed, to the probable total exclusion

 152                  Mr. W. W. J. Nicol on
 of the other. My experiments were, I was fully aware, open
 to the charge that they were made with equal volumes of solu
 tions of the same molecular constitution, and that therefore
 the solutions mixed, though containing the same number of
 salt molecules in proportion to the number of water molecules
present, did not contain an equal number of molecules of
 either water or salt. In order to avoid this slight source of
 error and at the same time to give my results a more definite
 value, I have, in all my recent experiments, regarded not the
 volumes of the solutions referred to water, but their molecular
volumes. Thus the quantities with which we have to deal
express the volume in cubic centimetres of the unit of the
solution expressed in grammes (1 gramme of water at the
given temperature being considered equal to 1 cub. centim.).
The volume is given by the formula
                        ,     ,    .rm + 1800
                     Mol. vol.=          s     ,
                                        o
where # = the number of salt molecules (m) (in grammes) dis
solved in 100H2O = 1800; S=specific gravity of the solution.
    By mixing the solutions in the proportions of their mole
cular weights         + 1800), mixtures were obtained which
should possess a molecular volume equal to the sum of the
molecular volumes of the two solutions before mixing. But
I have already shown {loc. cit.) that a slight change in volume
follows the mixture of salt solutions which cannot act on one
another, and that this change is a contraction. A slight dimi
nution in the molecular volume is therefore to bo regarded
merely as the result of tho dilution of one solution by the
other. This change of volume never reaches "01 per cent.,
even in solutions containing as many as 5 molecules of salt to
100II2O. And even this slight source of error is eliminated
b}- the method of experiment.
    I have shown in a previous paper* that the volume of a
metal in a solution of its salt is independent of the salt radical
with which it is combined, and vice versa, if the solutions ore
sufficiently dilute. Almost perfect density neutrality , as well
as thermal neutrality, exists in dilute solutions (less than -5 of
an equivalent of a salt in 100 H20); but dealing with stronger
solutions, we find that density neutrality ceases to exist owing
to tho varying solubility of the various salts that may be
formed, and that we have a tendency to form a system of salts
whose solutions have the smallest molecular volume; or if near
the saturation-point of any of the possible salts, that salt is

formed to the partial or total exclusion of other salts contain
ing either of its constituents. The quantities, therefore, with
which we have to do are comparatively small, and depend on
the different solubility of the various salts in the way I have
described in the paper cited above.
   My method of experiment is as follows:—
   Having prepared solutions of allfour salts of the same mole
cular composition, I determine their specific gravities, and
from these calculate the molecular volumes. Representing
these volumes by a, b, c, d, we have
                  (1)   MR +M'R'=a + 6=A.
                  (2)   MR' + M'R=c+d=B.
   A and B are the molecular volumes of the first and second
couples of salts respectively if no change of volume occur on
mixing the two solutions. Next, the molecular volumes of
(1) and (2) after mixture are determined, and found to be V,
the same in each case. In all my experiments I have met with
no case in which A=B; nor, if the solutions be not too
concentrated, any in which V is greater than A or B. If
now V < A and A < B, then there can bo none of B, the couple
with the larger molecular volume, present in the solution, and
of course, conversely, V < B and B < A, then no A is present.
The fact that the molecular volume V is the same in each case,
shows that rearrangement has taken place in one case or the
other, while V, being less than the lesser of the two theoretical
volumes, appears to me to prove the entire absence of the
couple which has the larger molecular volume.
   Table I. contains the results I have obtained with various
salts in solutions of different strengths. These solutions con
tained almost exactly the correct quantities of the salts; and
that this was the case may be seen by the very close agree
ment of the molecular volumes of the mixtures, although the
number of weighings for each set of four salts amounted to at
least thirty. In Table II., on the other hand, are given the
results of similar experiments with solutions not so accurately
prepared: as a necessary consequence the molecular volumes of
the two mixtures do not agree so closely as those in Table I.;
but in the cases given such disagreement is of no importance,
as the differences between A and V, or B and V, are too great

   Considering the solutions in Tables I. and II., we find that
in every case the former of the two conplos of salts is decom
posed more or less completely into the second.

The decomposition is, however, complete on dilution, as shown

   I may here add a few words on the well-known experiments
of Malaguti*, who attempted to solve the question of the
arrangement of salts in solution by adding alcohol to the solu
tion of two salts and then determining the nature and quantity
of the salt precipitated. For instance :—" When one equiva-

  lent of Pb (N03)2 in aqueous solution is mixed with a solution
  of an equivalent of KC9 H3 03, A^j of it are decomposed to
  KN03, which may be precipitated by adding alcohol, while
        of it remained unchanged " (Storer's ' Dictionary of
  Solubilities '). Such a mode of experiment is of necessity
 powerless to give any idea whatever of the equilibrium exist
 ing in the solution, for that is at once destroyed by the addi
 tion of alcohol. Equally fallacious is any argument from the
 fact that now one salt and now another crystallizes out from
 a solution ; for here, too, the equilibrium is being incessantly
 disturbed by the gradual removal of the water, or the changes
 of temperature to which the solution is subjected.
    I may sum up my results as follows :—
    When the salt-solutions are mixed, the tendency is to form
 the system which will occupy the smallest volume (state of
 stable equilibrium); only two salts will then be present in the
 solution. Under certain conditions, however, when the solu
 tions are strong, or where from any cause one of the four
 possible salts is near its saturation-point, the above may not
 hold good ; but then a certain amount of the least soluble (or
 most soluble) salt will bo present in the solution, necessitating
 the presence of all four salts.

             ON THE PROPERTIES OF WATER AND ICE.
                         BY OTTO PETTERSSON.
rPIIE above is the title of a valuable paper by Dr. Pettersson, taken
     from volume ii. of the results of the Vega Expedition. It is de
voted to a discussion of the physical properties of water in the liquid
and solid states at the temperatures to which water and ice are exposed
in the Arctic Sea, as between —20° C. and + 15° C. The special
subjects investigated were the change of heat and volume of (1)
pure water, (2) brackish water, and (3) ocean-water of ordinary
saltness ; but before detailing the results of his experiments the
author states briefly the results reached by others, and then in
detail the instruments employed by him and his methods of obser
vation. In regard to the experiments with pure water, a series of
tables gives the results of the experiments on the expansibility of
pure water (ice) at the different temperatures employed. The most
important point brought out in them is this—that the volume of
ice, even the purest which can be tested, decreases with a rise in
temperature when n( ar the melting-point, and this is the more
marked as the amount of salt contained in the water increases. In
regard to this the author remarks that " it is impossible to decide

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             157
if absolutely pure water would be entirely free from this weakness
or not, since we cannot assume that water, which has boiled for a
quarter of au hour or more in a glass vessel, is absolutely free from
minimal quantities of foreign substances, an e.g. sodium salts, silica,
etc. Yor my own part I am rather inclined to think that absolutely
pure water, if it could be tested, would show an absolutely iixed
melting-point . . . ." In connexion with this point the author
remarks upon the plasticity of ice, which has been observed near the
melting-point, while at lower temperatures it is brittle. The author
 shows that the irregularity in expansion is connected with the de
 gree of rigidity of the ice : at a sufficiently low temperature every
 kind of ice is hard and brittle, and in this state it expands regularly
 with increase of temperature ; the commencement of the thawing
 is entirely dependent upon the amount of salt, etc., present, and
 the softening before melting is connected finally with a contraction
 in volume : thus ice from ordinary distilled water begins to contract
 at —0°-25 C. ; a sample containing 0-015 p. c. chlorine at —4° C. ;
 and ice formed by the sudden freezing of ocean-water begins to
 contract at —20° C. or below. Asa consequence of this it is added
 that it must be acknowledged " that the ice-masses of the glaciers
 are liable to contraction at temperatures below their melting-point."
     In the investigation of the chemical changes in the composition
 of sea-water caused by freezing, the author reaches the conclusion
 that ice formed from sea-water is not, as has generally been sup
 posed, essentially pure, owing its saltness to mechanically enclosed
 brine : the result reached is the same as that obtained in a different
 way by Dr. Buchanan of the ' Challenger.' Dr. Pettersson concludes
 that ocean-water is divided by freezing, not into pure water and
 a more or less concentrated solution of ordinary sea-salt, as was
 formerly believed, but into two saliniferous parts, one liquid and
 one solid, which are of different composition. Thus the formation
 of sea-ice is chemically a selective process—some of the elements of
  salt water are more fit than others to enter into the solid state by
  freezing ; those which are rejected by the ice will preponderate in
  the brine, and vice versa : for example, as regards the relation of
  CI : S03, the ice is richer in sulphates, the brine in chlorides. The
  extraordinary variation both in saltness and in chemical composition
  of every individual specimen of sea-ice and sea-brine depends upon
  a secondary process or the metamorphosis of the ice, due to the
 combined influences of time and variation of temperature. The
 concluding chapter is devoted to a discussion of the latent heat of
  fresh and salt water ; the important point brought out in it is this,
  that the latent heat developed by the freezing of sea-water is
  " extraordinarily inferior to that of pure water." The author adds,
  that the freezing process, however, from a thermic point of view,
  ia not entirely concluded with the solidification of the sea-water,
  by which it is divided into ice, solid cryohydrates, and liquid brine
  containing dissolved salts ; for on further sinking of the temperature,
  still unfrozen cryohydrates will be solidified and develop heat until

 the whole mass, at a sufficiently low temperature, is a solid rock of
crystallized matter. At. the rise of temperature these substances
 will melt one by one and absorb heat in so doing.—SLUiman's

ON THE TEMPERATURE OBTAINED BY OXYGEN IN A STATE OF
    EBULLITION, AND ON THE SOLIDIFICATION OF NITROGEN. BY
    M. S. WROBLEWSKI.
    Of all the gases formerly regarded as permanent, hydrogen alone
showed no sign of liquefaction at the temperature of —136° C.
Even when this gas is submitted, at the above temperature, to a
pressure of 150 atmospheres, and the pressure is then suddenly
removed, no mist is formed in the tube containing the gas. Evi
dently, in order to liquefy hydrogen, we must employ a lower
temperature than the minimum obtainable by means of liquid
ethylene allowed to boil in a vacuum. Of the gases which are
more difficult to liquefy than ethylene, and which might be used
for the production of a much more intense cold, oxygen appeared
to me to be the most serviceable.
    The conditions under which the liquefaction of oxygen takes
place being already ascertained by my previous researches, it fol
lows that this gas can, at the present time, be liquefied in consider
able quantities with great ease. Numberless processes and appa
ratus are conceivable which would allow of this liquefaction being
effected in such a manner that the commercial production of liquid
oxygen, if I may so express myself, is only a question of material
means at the service of the experimenter. Thus since the begin
ning of October I have used liquid oxygen as a refrigerating agent.
   When liquefied in large quantity and allowed to evaporate briskly
by the sudden removal of the pressure, oxygen does not solidify
like carbonic acid, but it leaves a crystalline residue on the bottom
of the vessel in which it was contained in the liquid state and upon
the object to be cooled, plunged in the oxygen. I cannot say
whether this residue is composed only of crystals of oxygen or
whether it arises from possible impurities, since the oxygen which
I use in these experiments is prepared from a mixture of potassium
chlorate with manganese peroxide. This residue disappears as the
temperature commences to rise. If the object to be cooled is con
tained in a glass tube, the thin layer of this opaque residue is
often very troublesome to the observer.
   Another circumstance which renders it very difficult to employ
liquid oxygen as a cold-producer, is the necessity of using closed
apparatus capable of great resistance. Hitherto I have not been
able to obtain oxygen in a stable liquid condition under the pressure
of one atmosphere. I have had, in consequence, to place the objects
to be cooled in the apparatus, which 1 fill with liquid oxygen, and
I can only avail myself of the cold which the boiling oxygen pro

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.           159
  duces at the moment when the pressure is removed. As these
  apparatus are in part constructed of glass, great inconvenience
  results owing to the constant danger of serious explosions. After
  several accidents had occurred during these experiments, my assist
 ants and myself, in order to obviate the danger, never worked
  without masks. But the greatest difficulty to contend with is the
  short duration of the ebullition of the oxygen, and consequently
  the too short duration of the cold.
     I have attempted to measure the temperature which the boiling
 oxygen produces. For this purpose I have adopted a method of
 thermo-electric measurement which, in addition to being highly
  sensitive, allows us to record all the sudden changes of temperature
  of the medium. The indications of the apparatus employed have
  been compared with those of a hydrogen-thermometer between
  + 100° C. and —130° C. The nature of the function connecting
 these indications admits of an extrapolation being made. Reserving
 the description of my method for a future communication, I give
 here one hundred and eighty-six deyrees below zero ( — 186° C.) as
 the first approximation to the temperature which is produced on
 the liberation from pressure of liquefied oxygen.
    I have submitted nitrogen successfully to the action of this cold.
 This gas compressed, cooled in boiling oxygen, and then slightly
 released from pressure, solidifies and falls like snow in crystals of
remarkable size.— Comptes Rendus, December 31, 1883.
A NEW DEVICE FOR MEASURING POWER. BY C. F. BRACKETT,
    PHYSICAL LABORATORY OF THE COLLEGE OF NEW JERSEY.
    The following account of a method of measuring the energy
expended on or rendered by a dynamo or a magneto-machine will
be of interest to those who have to do with the production of elec
tricity in the large way in which it is now employed in the enterprises
of the day.
    The machine is so supported, on uprights, that it can freely turn
through a small arc of a circle whose centre lies in the geometrical
axis of the armature. The support may be effected by means of
knife-edges or by means of smooth cylindrical bearings, attached
directly to the machine or to a cradle on which the machine rests.
In the latter case the cradle is made adjustable so that the bottom
or floor can be raised or lowered, thus permitting machines of
different construction, when placed thereon, to be brought into
proper positions as regards axis of revolution and points of support.
When the machine, thus mounted, is set in rotation, with closed
circuit, the mechanical couple set up between the armature and field
magnets tends to make the latter revolve in the same direction with
the armature. The value of the couple, thus operative, and which
we desire to know, will be known if we know the value of the couple,

 160          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 equal and opposite in direction, which is required to hold the machine
 iixed in its position of equilibrium. A lever-arm is fixed to the
 machine or cradle in a horizontal position and provided with a sliding
 weight of known value, sufficient to hold the machine fixed in its
 position of equilibrium when in the performance of its duty. The
couple required can thus be known in terms of lever-arm and weight.
 We then ouly need to know the number of revolutions in a unit of
time, when we have all the data needed in order to compute the
energy.
    If W denote the weight, L the lever-arm, and n the number of
 revolutions in a minute, we shall have : Energy =2 irWL n, as in
 the case of the well-known Prony brake.
    For purposes of accurate scientific inquiry, the field-magnets alone
 may be mounted and balanced on knife-edges, so as to turn freely
like the beam of a common balance. By this plan all useless work
is excluded from the account. Friction at the bearings and at the
brushes do not in this case have any tendency to make the field-
magnets revolve.
    In the P.iysical Laboratory of this institution there are several
machines having the construction here pointed out. They leave
nothing to be desired iu point of sensitiveness or accuracy in their
indications. —Silliman's American Journal, January 1884.

   In reference to the article on the Ergometer, by Mr. Frederick
John Smith, B.A., in your last number of the Philosophical Maga
zine, wherein he describes an arrangement devised by himself for
overcoming some frictional difficulties iu the iutegratiug apparatus
of Ashton and Storey's Power Meter, I beg to state that I devised
precisely the same arrangement seven or eight years ago, but the
rapid wear and tear of the small friction-disks or rollers rendered
the cure worse than the disorder, so of course I never brought it
into notice. 1 have, however, patented, and shall shortly have
before the public, an integrating arrangement having a rolling con
tact with a positive and not a frictional connexion, whereby a
positive motion is given to the recording indices.

   XXII. On the Condensation of Carbonic Acid on Smooth Glass
                     Surfaces. By R. Bunsen*.
                               [Plate V.]
  THE thickness of the layer of carbonic-acid gas condensed
         on glass surfaces is, as is known, so small that a very
  extensive surface is necessary to allow of its exact estimation.
  The material best adapted for giving such an extension of
  surface in the least possible space is the extremely fine spun
  glass which is used in glass-weaving. The threads made use
  of in the following experiments were of such fineness that
 150 grms. only occupied a space of 100 cub. centim., and cor
 responded to a length of 62 geographical miles, giving a
 surface of 23 square metres. The composition of the glass

    The estimation of the specific gravity of the thread enters
 into the computation of its surface, and was made as follows:—
 A number of grammes were weighed out in a platinum dish
which was filled with well-boiled water and kept boiling till
the last traces of air were removed ; when cold the dish with
its contents was suspended by a hair in boiled water at a con
stant temperature and weighed ; in the same way the loss of
weight was estimated when the glass threads were removed,
the weighing being made in water, as before, at constant
temperature.

162           Prof. R. Bunsen on the Condensation of
   Three experiments, at temperatures varying between 130-7
and 14°, gave for the specific gravity required,
      2-5063, 2-5059,       2-5057,          Mean 2-50596.
The threads showed under the microscope a perfectly bright
and smooth surface, and the section at right angles to the
axis was circular; the diameters of the threads, varying from
 •00589 to -0295 millim., showed a very gradual decrease, a
difference being perceptible only at points far removed from
one another.
   To estimate the surface-area of n such threads the diameter
must be found.
   If we put du d2, . . . dn for the diameters in micrometer-
divisions of the microscope, and the value of a division of the
micrometer-scale in millimetres is a, then the mean diameter
d required is expressed in millimetres by
                      d=?(d1 + d3 + ...dn)                    (1)
   The means by which the micrometer-measure of 1000 of
these could be effected with sufficient accuracy and in a rela
tively short time were the following. On the stage of a Che
valier's microscope a plate of mirror-glass was cemented, and
over this another glass plate, admitting of easy removal, with
etched ordinate rulings. On this removable glass plate were
spread out a hundred glass threads, as nearly parallel as
possible, lying loosely, and successively brought into the field
of view by gently moving the upper plate. By turning the
micrometer-eyepiece each thread to be measured was placed
parallel to its graduations, and a gentle tap on the lower fixed
glass plate with a rod then brought the edge of a thread into
coincidence with a division on the scale, and the reading of
the other edge was taken. In this way were measured the
diameters of 1000 separate threads, which were drawn from
eleven different bundles.
   The mean of each ten diameters measured is given in the
following Table:—

    The value of a was 0-002945 millim. The value of d from
 Table I. deduced from the equation (1) is
                        d= 0-015907 millim.
 In order to see whether the value already found for n=1000
 can be taken as constant, 1000 threads out of fifteen other
 bundles were measured. The following Table contains the
 mean values of each ten of these measurements :—

    The numbers of this Table give for d,
                        d=0-016136 millim.,
a value which varies little from that deduced from Table I.
The mean of both is
                       d=0-0160215 millim.,
 and may be taken as very near the true value. For n threads
 of diameter d and length h the sum of the surface-areas M is
                              M = nhird.
 This formula gives for 1000 threads of 1000 millim. long a
 surface of
                      0-050335 square metres.
   Where, as in the following observations, the surfaces of
hundreds of thousands of such threads is required, counting
them is impracticable. We take therefore, instead of the
number, the weight as the basis on which to calculate the
surface-area. To do this the measurements from which the
diameters in Tables I. and II. were derived are arranged in
the following Table in groups of like diameter. The column
d gives the diameter, the column n the number of threads of
this given diameter.

   Then it follows from equation (2) that the 2000 threads in
Table III., taken at 1 metre long, weigh 1-0653 grm., and
that the sum of both end-surfaces of the whole 2000 only-
amounts to 0"00000085032 square metre. Putting together
the foregoing data, we arrive at the following result.
   1877-4 threads of the spun glass, 1 metre long, go to a
gramme, which amounts altogether to
          a surface-area of 0-09450 square metres,
          a cross section of 0'0000007982 squnre metres,

For a check on these results from the diameters of the threads,
five skeins were drawn from a stock of about 500 grms. of the
spun glass in different parts, cut to lengths of 2 metres, weighed ;

  of the skeins cut off, gave for 2483 threads of 2 metres length
  a weight of 2"6529 grms. The following comparison of the
  number deduced in this way and that arrived at independently

     In previous investigations on the condensation of gases on
  the surface of glass, as well as in researches with other solid
  bodies, it has been taken for granted that this condensation
  became quite stationary in a few hours or days. If then this
 supposition is erroneous, the value of all the results deduced
 from such investigations will be called into question; and so it
 appeared to me necessary to determine the dependence of the
 condensation of gas on time more correctly than had yet been
 done. For this purpose I have made use of the apparatus repre
 sented in PI. V. fig. 1. This consists of a wide measuring-tube,
 provided with an etched millimetre-scale throughout its whole
 length, closing air-tight with a stopcock at its upper end, and
 communicating with a wider vessel, A, for the reception of the
 glass threads. In the upper part of this vessel is the stopper C,
 ground in air-tight, and communicating with the outer air by
the glass stopcock, c. The whole of the joints, made tight with
 a very consistent mixture of wax and grease, were proved to be
 perfectly impervious by observations extendiug over three
 years. The measuring-tube B was carefully calibrated and
 the error of meniscus estimated ; the capacity V of the empty
 vessel A, from the closed stopcock b to the stopcock c, was
 measured with mercury, as well as that of the passages in the
stopcocks. The volume V is diminished in the experiments
 by that of the enclosed glass-threads. Take Sg as the specific
gravity of the threads contained in the vessel A, and p as their
weight, then the space remaining unoccupied by them, viz.
                            V.=V-f          :                  (4)
    In order to be able to alter the pressure in the apparatus
during the experiment, the mercury-trough had fitted into it
a tube of such a depth as to allow the measuring-tube to be
sunk in for its whole length. The filling of the apparatus
and the observations were made in the following way :—The

166           Prof. R. Bunsen on the Condensation of
 as used in the experiments is passed in a perfectly dry con-
 ition from the exit-tube, fitted on by an india-rubber stopper,
to the end B of the measuring-tube; and this is continued for
a considerable time until that passing out by stopcock c proves
to be quite pure. As soon as this is the case, the india-rubber
stopper as well as the stopcocks b and c are closed, and the
instrument placed in the mercury-trough for reading off the
level, in such a way that the lower level of the mercury in the
tube stands somewhat higher than that in the trough. To
accomplish this, a short thick glass rod of such a size as to
displace the necessary amount of gas is placed in the tube
beforehand and attached to the india-rubber stopper by means
of a thread ; then, on the removal of the cork from the tube
under mercury, the rod will be drawn out and the necessary
displacement effected. Whilst the stopcock b remains closed
the vessel A is put in communication with a mercury-pump
and exhausted as far as possible: and after closing the stopcock c
the pressure and temperature of the gas remaining behind in
A is estimated. The total weight of the gas still present in
the apparatus is in three separate parts—(1) the part in the
closed space A, (2) that in the passage of the stopcock b,
and, lastly, (3) that contained in the closed measuring-tube.
Measured in cubic centimetres, millimetres, and centesimal
degrees, we have :—
    va, that of the space in A not occupied by the glass threads;
   Vm, the space occupied by gas in the measuring-tube ;

      in V„;

of     the pressure Paiul temperature t, to which the gas in the
instrument is exposed, be estimated and the volume of gas V

for the time T, as the following observation shows. The
weight of the gas in the apparatus is now in four parts—viz.
that in vessel A, in the measuring-tube B, in the passage of b,
and the weight g which is condensed on the glass threads in
time T. Thus we have

The surface of the spun glass, 1 metre long, enclosed in the
apparatus amounted to
               0-09450 p= 13*623 square metres.
The experiments were performed in a gas-analysis room spe
cially set apart for the purpose, whose temperature varied

168           Prof. 1{. Bunsen on the Condenmt'wn of
only a few tenths of a degree during a whole day. The obser
vations on the apparatus filled with carbonic acid were com
menced on the 20th of April, 1880. By the 8th of August of
the same year the condensation of gas had so far advanced
that the 600 millimetres of the measuring-tube threatened to
be insufficient for further readings. To allow of a continuance
of the readings it was necessary to add fresh carbonic acid to
that still present. This may be carried out without interrupting
the series of observations already commenced in the following
way :—After the volume of gas vx condensed on the threads
in the time T has been estimated, the stopcock b (fig. 1)
is closed. In the closed vessel A, the known pressure P„
and temperature ta, at which the estimation of        was made,
still holds. Let, then, the requisite volume of dry gas be added
to that already present by passing it directly into the mea
suring-tube dipping under mercury, and, after the equilibrium
of temperature and pressure has been established, let the
volume of carbonic-acid gas Vm now present in the measuring-
tube and its pressure Pm and temperature tm be noted.
    From these observed values, which were as follows, a new
constant Aj can be obtained by means of equation (5) : —
   V„ =112 397 cub. cent.,      ta =18°-2 C,    P„ = 0'3091 ;
   V„=       0-0478     „       <»=18°-2C.,     PA=0'3091;
   Vm= 83-265           „       f„=170-3C.,     P„=0-7278.
                    ^ = 33-009;   A1= 117-863.
The observations taken after the 8th of August, 1880, were
calculated according to the equation
        „= 117 863 - 0^6-(T^ 0-003660 <112'445 + V">
This gives the volume in cubic centimetres of carbonic acid at
0° C. and 0*76 metre pressure, which was condensed from the
time of closing the stopcock b when the additional volume of
carbonic acid was passed in. If we add now to the constant
 117-863 the volume i'! = 33-009 of carbonic acid already con
densed up to the time of closing the stopcock, the equation
then gives the volume v which has been condensed from the
 commencement of the experiments.
    In Table IV. are summed up the results attained with dry
carbonic acid. The first numbers are the means of many ob
servations taken hourly, then daily ; the numbers represented

    The curves show:—
    (1) That a limit of condensation is by no means reached in
a few hours or days, or even after several years.
    (2) During the three years' continuance of the experiments,
notwithstanding the sudden and gradual changes of tempera
ture and pressure, no perceptible detachment of the condensed
carbonic acid took place from the surface of the glass.
    (3) Sudden variations of pressure of 0*3521 metre to
0*5696 metre, of 0*545 metre to 0*7171 metre, of 0*7168 metre
to 0*5355 metre, of 0*4431 metre to 0*5248 metre, gave no sign
of discontinuity in the progress of the condensation.
    (4) Between the intervals of temperature +23° C. and
 — 0°*8 C. an acceleration of condensation occurred with rising
temperature, a diminution with falling temperature.
    (5) Including the inner surface of the apparatus, amount
ing to 0*005 square metre, the glass surface had taken up
of carbonic acid up to the end of the
       First year, 42*91 cub. centim. at 0° and 0*76 metre,
       Second year, 57*94             „            „             „

that is, in the first year 42*91 cub. centim., in the second year
15*03 cub. centim., in the third year 12*04 cub. centim.
    There were condensed on 1 square metre of surface of the
glass in three years 5*135 cub. centim.* at 0° and 0*76 metre.
    We see that these results, deduced from three years' obser
vations, are in direct contradiction to those of experiments
which have previously been undertaken with the same object.
The manner in which the earlier experiments have been car
ried out easily explains the disagreement. They have been
conducted on the assumption that a maximum of condensa
 tion is attained in a few hours or days, without previously
 removing all doubt as to the correctness of this assumption
 by means of observations extending over a longer period. If
 we start from the supposition which has been proved to be
 erroneous, at any rate in the case of carbonic acid and glass,
the accumulations of gas would appear to be a function of
pressure, whereas in reality they were a function of the time.
With those experiments in which the spaces of time between
each observation have not been strictly taken into account, no
correct inferences can be drawn as to the dependence of gas-
condensation on temperature or on the magnitude of the sur
faces of condensation.
    The phenomena which the condensation of carbonic acid
   * The gas still adhering to the glass threads at a pressure of0-90 millim.
is disregarded in this estimation.

             Carbonic Acid on Smooth Glass Surfaces.             171
on smooth glass surfaces gives rise to, go far to support the
supposition that it is not due to simple adhesion, but that
we have to deal with a chemical decomposition of the glass,
and consequently that glass is a substance which might be
quite unfit for such investigations. Such a supposition,
however, loses its force when we take into consideration the
following facts:—That at the temperature we are considering
anhydrous carbon dioxide gas is an acid so weak that it
is not even capable of expelling the water contained in per
fectly anhydrous potassium hydroxide; whilst, on the other
hand, silica possesses such a powerful affinity for the bases
present in glass, that it not only expels completely at white
heat the carbonic acid from potassium and sodium carbonates,
but also sets free the acid of these salts at lower temperatures
on boiling their aqueous solutions.
    That the chemical affinity of anhydrous carbonic acid
towards the anhydrous bases of glass should, in the absence of
 water, be able to exceed that of silica, is the less plausible since
 such a decomposition would be resisted by the mass-action of
 the silica, which in the glass used amounted to almost five times
 that of the acid contained in a neutral silicate.
    The only view that remains is, therefore, that the carbonic
acid itself as such, occurs on the surface of the glass without
 having been transformed into a chemical compound. As a
 solid or fluid mass solely under the influence of gravity be
 comes surrounded by an atmosphere of gas of diminishing
 density, so must the accumulations of gas of diminishing den
 sity take place on the surface of solid or fluid bodies in con
 sequence of capillary attraction. According to Quincke's
 researches this attraction can still be perceived up to a
 distance of 0"000005 centim. from the surface; so that 5*135
 cubic centim. of carbonic-acid gas at 0° C. and 0*76 metre pres
 sure, condensed in three years on a surface of 10,000 square
 centim. of glass, must have occupied a space of 0-05 cub.
 centim., and have undergone a condensation of at least from
 5*135 to 0'05 cub. centim. Such a condensation corresponds,
 however, to a pressure of 102" 7 atmospheres. Now carbonic-
 acid gas at the temperature of the experiments, 19° C, even
 under a pressure of 57*5 atmospheres, is fluid, so there can be
 no doubt that the surface of the glass was covered with a
 layer of liquid carbonic acid.
    If the whole of the 5*135 cub. centim. of gas be present
 in the fluid state, then, since the specific gravity of liquid
 carbonic acid at 19° C. is 1*137, the thickness of this fluid
 layer under a pressure of 1 atmosphere would only amount
 to 0*00000888 millim. It is easy to understand, however,

 172    Condensation of Carbonic Acid on Smooth Glass Surface*.
 that in reality the layer can never increase beyond that limit
 in which the capillary pressure, diminishing with the distance,
 becomes equal to the vapour-tension of liquid carbonic acid,
 and that outside this limit an atmosphere of carbonic acid
 of diminishing density must be present. These considera
 tions, it is true, explain the condensation observed, but not
 its extended continuance for years. Moreover theory requires,
 in agreement with experience, an instant adjustment of equi
 librium in gases under the influence of pressure. The long
 duration of the condensation is then scarcely comprehensible
 otherwise than on the assumption that the glass is not per
 fectly impenetrable, and that the particles of liquid carbonic
 acid on being pressed into the molecular interstices of the
 glass have to overcome a resistance which, as the observed
 course of the condensation shows, rises in a proportion increas
 ing with the time.
    Only by further prosecution of the experiments can it be
decided whether a point of time can be found when the
forcing of the fluid carbonic acid into the glass is indefi
nitely small. If such a point is attainable and attained,
then must the processes of condensation become essentially
different. The thickness of the layer of liquid carbonic acid
would then no more continually diminish by its being forced
into the glass, nor would the overlaying gaseous stratum of
carbonic acid undergo simultaneous diminution. With the
increasing thickness of the fluid layer in course of conden
sation, that of the atmosphere of carbonic-acid gas would con
tinually diminish, and hence also the pressure which this
atmosphere exerts on the surface of the fluid, until a surface-
tension is reached equal to that exerted by the carbonic-acid
vapour at the prevailing temperature. The moment this point
is reached, as long as the conditions remain the same, no
further condensation or vaporization of the liquid layer of
carbonic acid can take place; but it must set in again directly
there is an alteration of pressure or temperature. When a
rise of temperature ensues, gas will escape from the fluid
layer; and as soon as a state of equilibrium has been restored,
the diminution of thickness brought about in this way can be
calculated by measuring the volume of gas set free.
    Thus it appears, if not very probable, at least possible to
determine for a series of temperatures a series of differences
of thickness of the particular levels at which the carbonic acid
has come to rest, and to obtain, in terms of the vapour-tension
of carbonic acid corresponding to the temperature, a mea
sure of the capillary attractions which were exerted at these
differences of thickness. How far this conclusion is allowable,

  and to what extent we may expect information on capillary
  action at a distance, will depend also on the question whether
  the same phenomena by which chemical attractions are accom
  panied play a part also in capillary forces. If this be the
  case, we shall not be justified in assuming the same force of
  tension with the layer of liquid carbonic acid on the glass as
  occurs with the carbonic acid not exposed to such molecular
  attractions, any more than it would be permissible to take the
  vapour-tension of pure water as that of an aqueous solution
  of a salt. It may be mentioned that atmospheric air behaves
  similarly towards smooth glass surfaces as-carbonic acid does;
  that, on the contrary, the accumulations of gas become sta

 directions by molecular interstices in a relatively short time.
 XXIII. On Melting-point and Boiling-point as related to Che
   mical Composition. By Edmund J. Mills, D.Sc., F.R.S.*
 1. TN considering the relation between melting-point and
     JL boiling-point as related to chemical composition, two
 lines of investigation lie before us. We may conceive a sub
 stance to consist of parts definitely arranged and in definite
acts of motion, and then infer on mechanical principles under
 what contingencies the crises referred to must necessarily
make their appearance. This is the internal method; but it
is so encumbered with hypotheses, in themselves most difficult
to verify, that a long time must elapse before any hope can
 be entertained of its successful employment. The external
method, on the other hand, proceeding by way of tentative
effort and analogy, is more simple and direct, and must be
jndged mainly by its results. It appears to me that the time
has arrived for an application of this latter method, to which
 I have been specially induced to have recourse by the fact
that a number of series of organic bodies are now known
whose boiling-points and melting-points are sufficiently well
established to supply data for calculation.
    2. It has been long customary to regard what we term heat
as a mode of motion. In a memoir communicated to this
Magazinet I took occasion to show that matter as known to
as is also a mode of motion, differing from energy only by its
more concrete or isolable character. The suggestion naturally
presents itself, that heat may be a chemical reagent. This
suggestion, in fact, lies at the basis of the greater part of

174              Dr. E. J. Mills on Melting-point and
practical chemistry, it being well known not only that heat
may modify the rate of a given chemical change, but may
altogether alter the character of the change, and produce the
same effect as the presence, in the system of reacting sub
stances, of a certain reacting substance.
    3. The most general law known to me of chemical change,
considered with respect to the mass of the reagents, is, that
cltemical effect is directly proportional to the product of the active
masses, and inversely proportional to the sum of their residues.
This law has been expressed* in the equation
where a is a factor depending on the conditions of the expe
riment.
    In order to adjust this equation to meet the case of melting-
point and boiling-point as related to chemical composition, we
have to suppose that a practically inexhaustible means of
raising temperature has been placed at our disposal. On the
other hand, the series to be considered in this memoir have
all the general formula pK ¦ xCH3. The application of heat
to the members of these series has for its effect the event
which is measured as a melting-point or boiling-point. If / be
the number of degrees C. corresponding to CH2, /S a constant
of condition, and y the resulting effect thus measured,
                                 =
 Inasmuch, however, as x is in any given case necessarily
constant and = xT, and the difference between t and tr is a
negligibly small quantity, the equation may be written,
                                      0tx

    The origin of most organic series is an ideal quantity, such
as Hs 0, H2, C, &c, which in the mathematical representa
 tion of melting-point or boiling-point requires the insertion of
 a new constant, linearly modifying x. The complete equation
 thus becomes

where c is the value of x to which 0° C. in either case corre
sponds.
   4. If in this equation we make x exceedingly large, the
value of y will become -, a definite quantity, being the melt
ing-point or boiling-point of the infinite olefine of the series.
   In a memoir on Cumulative Resolution * I have already
pointed out that the only series in which Kopp's, or the linear,
law of boiling-point can have any chance of rigorously hold
ing good is in that of the defines. It will be found in the
sequel that that law does not in fact hold good for the only
actual olefines at present admitting of sedation as to boiling-
point. As is, however, common with the points at infinity
 of chemical curves, the infinite olefines are characterized by
great simplicity in their physical relations; not only their
 boiling-points, but their melting-points also are multiples by
 whole numbers of certain fundamental constants.
    In the following sections reference is made to those series
 alone which end in infinite olefines. For this reason various
 aromatic series (which as a rule terminate with infinite methyl)
 are not considered.
    5. The work of actual calculation of the numerical con
 stants in the equations adduced below calls for no special
 remark. It may, however, save trouble to subsequent com
 puters if I point out the means of obtaining the important
 constant c. This is often reasonably obvious on inspection.
 A value thus surmised is accordingly substituted for c, a new
 constant a added to the numerator of the equation; and, from
 three or more points, the values of a., ft, and 7 are determined.
 The numerator is next equated to 0, and the value of x thus
 found is used instead of c in a second approximation.
    Three or four approximations are in general sufficient to fix
 the value of c, thereby reducing that of a to zero.
    When it is hardly possible by inspection to frame a pre
 liminary opinion as to the position of c, Taylor's series will
 be found very useful in starting the approximation.

    The above numbers lead to some interesting conclusions,
among which the following seem of greatest importance:—
    (a) The general (mean = 8'8767) value of B tends to be about
 one half the general (mean = 16'676) value of t, or -. From
                                             1               *y
 these means the first values of B and - have been excluded,
                                             y
 on account of the evidently peculiar character of the series to
 which they belong.
     (b) The series of odd normal paraffins and odd ketones end
 probably in the same olefine. The series of even normal
 paraffins, even ketones, and even ketates A end probably in
 the same olefine.
     Thus, on the whole, there have been traced the melting-
 points of six infinite olefines.
     (c) The melting-points of these infinite olefines are all inte
 gral multiples of a fundamental constant, which may be
 termed the " modulus of melting-point " in the fatty series.
 The direct mean of the nine determinations of this modulus is
 6*6885, the geometric 6'6883. The probable error of a single
 determination of the latter is '038349; of the result of nine
 determinations, "012783. Thus the modulus is established

•with a satisfactory degree of certainty. From this point of
view, nothing can he more obvious than the periodicity of
infinite defines. The differences between consecutive values
of yx seem to show that the modulus is not a sub-multiple of
the value ju3t assigned.

   13. Since - =n modulus, where n is a whole number and
               7
easily found by a few trial approximations, we are in a posi
tion to calculate the melting-points of series with greatly in
creased accuracy. Putting /3=7 n modulus, and 70= A, the
equation becomes
         y + yx(y—n modulus) — A (y — n modulus) = 0,
by means of which the values of 7, h (and thence c) may be
deduced from any pair of experiments. We have thus a ready
practical means for correcting, inter se, a given series of melt
ing-points.

 preface, to pass on to a consideration of boiling-point.

    As diminished pressure increases stability, the values of ya
 in these two latter series are naturally greater than those ob
 tained from the two former under ordinary or atmospheric
 pressure. It is interesting also to note, as regards the value
 of y a in the two latter series, that they differ by a quantity
 nearly identical with what will hereafter be termed the
 "modulus of boiling-point."

 chlorides, especially those in which x is large, distil with some
 decomposition (and therefore a lower boiling-point) under the
 ordinary pressure. This property is very beautifully indicated
 in the values of y„, which are lower by about 14° than they
  should be on the hypothesis that they are (369°= about) six
 times the fundamental modulus.

  about twice that of - ; whereas it will be remembered (§ 12)

        Boiling-point as related to Chemical Composition.      185
that in melting-point it tends to be about half that of 7.    The
general mean value of -, or the number of degrees correspond
ing to CH2, is 19°"086—a number nearly identical with that
which, since the publication of Kopp's celebrated memoir, has
been held in so much repute by chemists. It is, however,
hardly necessary to point out that this estimate can no longer
be introduced in an ordinary linear equation ; neither is it
actually the same with any of the numbers of which it repre
sents the mean.
   The boiling-points of the infinite defines are the only linear
series as regards chemical composition, being all integral mul
tiples of a modulus 61-554. The probable error of a single
determination of the modulus is '20258 ; of nine determina
tions, "06753. Nine of these olefines have been traced in the
 preceding lists.
   An important criterion of stability under ebullition is found
in the value of the integral multiple just referred to ; the sta
bility of a series evidently being in proportion to this multiple.
 As we have seen (§ 16), the multiple is decidedly increased
 under diminished pressure.
    The boiling-point of an infinite " odd " olefine is always
 identical with, or higher than, that of an " even " one. The
 same remark, with a corresponding inference as to stability,
 applies to their entire series.
    The boiling-points as well as melting-points of six of the
 infinite olefines are given in the following table. The mean
 values of the moduli were employed in the calculation.

    Thus the infinite olefine boiling at 553-99 has, as shown by
 melting-point, three isomeric modifications ; the infinite olefine
 melting at 1 40*45 may have three isomeric modifications ; and
 the infinite olefine boiling at 923 31 melts at 153-83.
    The value of four times the modulus of boiling-point is
 246'23. There can therefore be only four infinite olefines
 between 0° and —273° (" absolute zero"). On the other
 hand, the modulus of melting-point is contained forty-one
 times (274-22, or 273-72 within the limits of probable error)

186           Dr. E. J. Mills on Melting-point and
in the same interval. Over this range, then, each infinite
define has, on the average, about ten isomeric modifications.
In general, there may be about nine melting-point curves
ending in one boiling-point.

   23. Among the practical applications of the theory, the
correction of experimental data by each other's aid is very
important. As an example of this may be taken the boiling-
points of the olefines distilled from Menhaden lime-soap and
Rangoon tar, and examined by Warren and Storer (Zeit.
Chem. 1868, p. 228). On grouping their formulae according
to even and odd coefficients of C, it was evident, after a few
approximations, that the even group contained the modulus
 x 11, and the odd the modulus x 9. If we write the usual
equation V—-v^X/           <. in such a form as to impose the con-

   It is interesting to notice that the boiling-point of olefiant
gas, as calculated from the (even) equation, is — 104-73.
Olefiant gas is said to liquefy, under considerable pressure, at
— 110°. As it is probable that, near the boiling-point, large
differences of tension correspond to small differences of tem
perature, the calculated number may be taken as fairly correct.
There is theoretically also a butylene boiling at —9*41, but not
yet known. Again, the calculated value of yu lies remark
ably near the mean (216-05) of the divergent experimental
numbers. The correction for exposure of the mercurial
column is included in the data given by Warren and Storer.

XXIV. Acoustical Observations.—V. By Lord Rayleigh,

                Smoke-jets by Intermittent Visian.
IN the second series of these observations (Phil. Mag. March
      1879) I proved that when stationary sonorous waves
occupy the region surrounding a sensitive flame, the action
of sound in causing the flame to flare manifests itself when
the burner is situated at a loop, but not when the burner is
situated at a node; from which we infer that the effects are
due to a lateral disturbance causing the issuing jet to bend
from its course. During the same year I made a stroboscopic
examination of a jet of phosphorus-smoke issuing from a
drawn-out glass nozzle, and disturbed by the neighbourhood
of a vibrating tuning-fork of pitch 256. So much light is
necessarily lost in this method of observation, that some pre
caution is required in illuminating the jet. Two points should
be especially attended to. In the first place, the eye must be
so situated that the scattered light by which the jet is seen is
but slightly deflected from its original course; and, secondly,
the background must be thoroughly dark. By carrying out
adequately this system of illumination, and by so choosing
the revolving disk that the apertures bore a not too small pro
portion to the entire circumference, I was able to see tolerably
well by the light of a good gas-flame. When the coincidence
of periods was nearly approached, the serpentine motion of
the jet previous to rupture was clearly observable. By placing
the nozzle exactly in the plane of symmetry between the
prongs of the fork, the law above stated could be confirmed.
In this position there was but little effect; but the slightest
displacement caused an early rupture.
                     Smoke-jets and Resonators.
   In order to exalt the sensitiveness of jets to notes of mode
rate pitch, I found the use of resonators advantageous. These
may be of Helmholtz's pattern; but suitably selected wide-
mouth bottles answer the purpose. What is essential is that
the jet should issue from the nozzle in the region of rapid
reciprocating motion at the mouth of the resonator, and in a
                    • Communicated by the Author.

            Lord Rayleigh's Acoustical Observations.         189
transverse direction. I usually placed the resonator's mouth
uppermost, so that the jets were horizontal.
   Good results were obtained at a pitch of 256. When two
forks of about this pitch, and slightly out of tune with one
another, were allowed to sound simultaneously, the evolutions
of the smoke-jet in correspondence with the audible beats
were very remarkable. By gradually raising the pressure at
which the smoke is supplied, in the manner usual in these
experiments, a high degree of sensitiveness may be attained,
either with a drawn-out glass nozzle or with the steatite pin
hole burner used by Tyndall. In some cases (even at pitch
256) the combination of jet and resonator proved almost as
sensitive to sound as the ear itself.
   The behaviour of the sensitive jet does not depend upon
the smoke-particles, whose office is merely to render the effects
 more easily visible. I have repeated these observations with
 out smoke by simply causing air-jets from the same nozzles
to impinge upon the flame of a candle placed at a suitable
 distance. In such cases, as has been pointed out by Tyndall,
 the flame acts merely as an indicator of the condition of the
 otherwise invisible jet. Even without a resonator . the sensi
 tiveness of such jets to hissing sounds may be taken advantage
 of to form a pretty experiment.
    The combination of jet, resonator, and flame shows some
 times a tendency to speak on its own account ; but I did
 not succeed in getting a well-sustained sound. Such as it is,
 the effect probably corresponds to one observed by Savart and
 Plateau with water-jets breaking up under the operation of
 the capillary tension, and when resolved into drops impinging
 upon a solid obstacle, such as the bottom of a sink, in mecha
 nical connexion with the nozzle from which the jet originally
 issues. In virtue of the connexion, any regular cycle in the
 mode of disintegration is able, as it were, to propagate itself.
    The increased and more discriminating sensitiveness ob
 tainable by use of resonators is turned to account in the
 arrangement of flame described in the Proceedings of the
 Cambridge Philosophical Society for November 8, 1880.
 (See ' Nature,' December 16, 1880.)
    In this case the resonator takes the form of a tube, one of
 whose ends opens in the gas-chamber close to the nozzle. The
 other end is closed by a cork, whose position can be adjusted
 so as to vary the pitch. I see from my note-book that, on the
 evening of Dec. 4, 1879, I found the flame nearly as sensitive
 as the ear to vibrations of frequency 512 ; but I have not
 always been equally successful in subsequent attempts to
 recover this degree of delicacy.

 190          Lord Rayleigh's Acoustical Observation*.
    With the very acute sounds, to which alone the high-
 pressure gas-flame (lighted at the burner) is sensitive, little
 can be expected from the use of resonators.
                      Jets of Coloured Liquid.
    In the hope of being able to make better observations upon
 the transformations of unstable jets, I next had recourse to
 coloured water issuing under water. In this form the expe
 riment is more manageable than in the case of smoke-jets,
 which are difficult to light, and liable to be disturbed by the
 slightest draught. Permanganate of potash was preferred as
 a colouring agent, iind the colour may be discharged by mix
 ing with the general mass of liquid a little acid ferrous sulphate.
 The jets were usually projected downwards into a large beaker
 or tank of glass, and were lighted from behind through a piece
 of ground glass.
    The notes of maximum sensitiveness of these liquid jets
 were found to be far graver than for smoke-jets or for flames.
 Forks vibrating from 20 to 50 times per second appeared to
 produce the maximum effect, to observe which it is only
necessary to bring the stalk of the fork into contact with the
table supporting the apparatus. The general behaviour of the
jetcould be observed without stroboscopic appliances by causing
the liquid in the beaker to vibrate from side to side under the
 action of gravity. The line of colour proceeding from the
 nozzle is seen to become gradually more and more sinuous,
 and a little further down presents the appearance of a rope
bent backwards and forwards upon itself. I have followed the
 process of disintegration with gradually increasing frequencies
of vibrational disturbance from 1 or 2 per second up to about
 24 per second, using electro-magnetic interrupters to send
 intermittent currents through an electro-magnet which acted
upon a soft-iron armature attached to the nozzle. At each
stage the pressure at which the jet is supplied should be
adjusted so as to give the right degree of sensitiveness. If
the pressure be too great, the jet flares independently of the
imposed vibration, and the transformations become irregular :
in the contrary case the phenomena, though usually observ
able, are not so well marked as when a suitable adjustment is
made. After a little practice it is possible to interpret pretty
well what is seen directly ; but in order to have before the
eye an image of what is really going on, we must have
recourse to intermittent vision. The best results are obtained
with two forks slightly out of tune, one of which is used to
effect the disintegration of the jet, and the other (by means of
perforated plates attached to its prongs) to give an intermit

            Lord Rayleigh's Acoustical Observations.          191
tent view. The difference of frequencies should be about one
per second. When the means of obtaining uniform rotation
are at hand, a stroboscopic disk may be substituted for the
second fork. It was, in fact, with the use of such a disk, driven
by a water-engine, that the drawing (fig. 1, PI. IV.) was made
by Mrs. Sidgwick in August 1880. It is hardly necessary to say
that these appearances are difficult to reproduce in drawings,
and that the result must be regarded merely as giving a
general idea of what is actually observed. The upper part of
the jet is seen sufficiently steadily to be pretty accurately
copied ; but further down true periodicity is lost, and no
steady impression is produced upon the eye.
    The carrying out of tbese observations, especially when it
is desired to make a drawing, is difficult unless we can control
the plane of the bendings. In order to see the phases properly
 it is necessary that the plane of bendings should be perpen
 dicular to tbe line of vision ; but with a symmetrical nozzle
this would occur only by accident. The difficulty may be got
over by slightly nicking the end of the drawn-out glass nozzle
at two opposite points. In this way the piano of bending is
usually rendered determinate, being that which includes the
 nicks, so that by turning the nozzle round its axis the sinuo
 sities of the jet may be properly presented to the eye.
    Occasionally the jet appears to divide itself into two parts
imperfectly connected by a sort of sheet. This appears to
correspond to the duplication of flames and smoke-jets under
 powerful sonorous action, and to be duo to what we may regard
 as the broken waves taking alternately different courses.
                         Fish-tail Burners.
    "Experiments upon jets from fish-tail burners *.—As with
gas, so with smoke and coloured water, these are sensitive,
and when much excited throw out tall streamers in the per
pendicular plane. I have not yet fully succeeded in tracing
the genesis of these, but believe them due to the rupture or
collision of the sinuosities which are formed in the quickly-
moving part of the sheet. When the sheet, seen broadways
 on, is excited by slow vibrations, a line of deepened colour is
seen to descend, and presently becomes very deep. This
 means that the sheet is so far bent over as to be seen
tangentially."
    Even with the best arrangements as to sensitiveness and
intermittent vision, the appearances presented by these jets
are somewhat difficult to interpret and to reproduce in a
drawing. The jets shown in figs. 2-5 issued from flat-

given by fish-tail burners. In fig. 2 the flat side is pre
sented to the observer; in fig. 3 the sheet (if undisturbed)
would be seen edgeways. The complication arises, partly at
any rate, from the different degrees of sensitiveness of dif
ferent parts of the sheet, from which it results that one
part reaches disruption and loses its periodicity, while an
other is yet in the earlier stages of the transformation. In
figs. 2 and 3 the jet is under the influence of a vibration
sufficiently powerful to cause it to flare in a regular manner;
in figs. 4 and 5 the vibration is less powerful, and the trans
formations stop short of the final stage.
                         Influence of Viscosity.
    It has already been noticed that the notes appropriate to
water-jets are far graver than for air-jets from the same
nozzles. Moreover, the velocities suitable in the former case
are much less than in the latter. This difference relates not,
as might perhaps be at first supposed, to the greater density,
but to the smaller viscosity of the water, measured of course
kinematically. It is not difficult to see that the density,
presumed to be the same for the jet and surrounding fluid,
is immaterial, except of course in so far as a denser fluid
requires a greater pressure to give it an assigned velocity.
The influence of fluid viscosity upon these phenomena is ex
plained in a former paper on the Stability or Instability of
 certain Fluid Motions* ; and the laws of dynamical similarity
 with regard to fluid friction, laid down by Prof. Stokesf,
 allow us to compare the behaviour of one fluid with another.
 The dimensions of the kinematic coefficient of viscosity are
 those of an area divided by a time. If we use the same
 nozzle in both cases, we must keep the same standard of
 length; and thus the times must be taken inversely, and the
 velocities directly, as the coefficients of viscosity. In pass
 ing from air to water the pitch and velocity are to be re
 duced some ten times. But, in spite of the smaller velocity,
 the water-jet will require the greater pressure behind it, inas
 much as the densities differ in a ratio exceeding 100 : 1.
    Guided by these considerations, I made experiments to try
 whether the jets would behave differently in warm and cold
 water. At temperatures respectively about 130° F. and 52°F.,
 the difference was found to be extremely well marked. " With

 a drawn-out glass nozzle, a pressure of l^inch was enough
 with hot water to cause flaring, whereas perhaps 3^ inches
 were necessary with the cold water. At one inch the jet
 in cold water was dead, but in hot water was still quite
active"*.
    These experiments were resumed at Cambridge in April
 and May 1880 by Mrs. Sidgwick, with use not only of hot
 and cold water but also of mixtures of alcohol and water,
 whose viscosity is known to be much greater than that of
 water alone. In order to retard cooling, and thus to diminish
 convection-currents, the experimental beaker was placed
 within a larger one, and supported at the rim only, so as to be
 surrounded by a jacket of warm air. The liquid intended to
 form the jet was placed in a narrow glass jar about 10 inches
high, and the head was adjusted by raising or lowering the
jar and by varying the amount of liquid. The communica
 tion between the two vessels was by a glass syphon, whose
 lower end was drawn out so as to form a suitable nozzle of
about ^5 inch diameter (fig. 6). The transparent tube was
advantageous on account of the more ready detection of air-
bubbles, the presence of which, especially near the nozzle, is
a source of disturbance. The apparatus stood in front of a
window, supported on a stone table carried by the walls of
the building, and the sensitiveness of the jet was usually
tested by dropping upon the table a large nail through a
height of about 2 inches. Observations were made of the
 greatest pressure that the jet would bear, in the absence of
external disturbance, without flaring before reaching the
bottom of the beaker, and also of the least pressure at which
 the jet was sensitive. In the case of the mixture of alcohol
and water in equal parts, a modified arrangement was necessary
in order to obtain sufficient head.
    With plain water the colour was given by permanganate of
potash, and was discharged, as soon as the jet was broken up,
by ferrous sulphate previously added to the liquid in the
beaker. In some of the more delicate experiments it was
found necessary to bring the densities to a more exact equality
by the addition of indifferent saline material to the jet, but in
most cases this precaution is superfluous. For the jets of
methylated alcohol and water, permanganate was found un
suitable, and was replaced by soluble aniline blue.

   It will be seen that tbe effect of varying the viscosity is
very distinct. In the extreme cases a jet which will not bear
a pressure of more than ^ inch without flaring when the
liquid is water nearly at the boiling-point, requires from 20
to 30 inches to make it flare when we pass to the mixture of
alcohol and water in equal proportions. It is probable that
with the hot water the results are somewhat disturbed by the
impossibility of getting the liquid perfectly quiet owing to the
formation of convection-currents; but the differences are so
great that the general conclusion cannot be disturbed by this
circumstance. The comparisons between the cold water and
the alcoholic mixtures, which were all used at the tempera
ture of the room, are entirely independent of this source of
error.
  XXV. Experimental Determination of Wave-lengths in the
      Invisible Prismatic Spectrum. By S. P. Langley*.
                               [Plates VIII. & IX.]
  Note.—The following investigation was made at the expense of the
Bache Fund, and is published here by the permission of its Trustees. It is
the subject of a still unpublished memoir presented in April 1883 to the
National Academy of Sciences, in whose Transactions the unabridged
communication will be found.
IN September 1881, while engaged upon Mount Whitney
      in measuring with a linear bolometer the heat in the
invisible spectrum of a flint prism, I came upon a hitherto
                         * Communicated by the Author.

           Wave-lengths in the Invisible Prismatic Spectrum.     195
     nnknown cold band whose deviation indicated a (probably)
    very great wave-length*. We have had up to the present
    time ro way of measuring such wave-lengths directly, but are
    accustomed to determine them by more or less trustworthy
    extrapolation formulae, the best known of which is Cauchy's.
    Accordingly I attempted to calculate the wave-length by
    Oanchy's formula; but was conducted to an impossible result,
    the formula declaring that no such index of refraction as I
    had measured was possible in the prism in question. Bat the
    measurement was a fact beyond dispute ; and th;s drew my
    attention to the grossness of the errors to which the customary
    formulae may lead.
       Every prism gives a different map of the spectrum ; nor
   when we find a band or line by the prism have we any means
   of fixing the absolute place, except by a reference to the
   normal or wave-length scale, or to one derived from it.
      It is desirable to define at the outset the sense in which the
   term "Normal" is here used as a synonym for "Wave-length"
   spectrum.
      The amount of energy in any region of the spectrum, such
  as that in any colour, or between any two specified limits, is a
  definite quantity, fixed by facts which are irdependent of our
  choice—such as the nature of the radiant body, or the absorp
  tion which the ray has undergone. Beyond this nature has no
  law which must govern us in representing the distribution of
  the energy, and all maps and charts of it are conventions.
      Did the word " Normal," then, signify " absolute," there
  would be no spectrum, exclusively entitled to such a name ;
  but, in this connection, the word is always to be understood
 in its radical meaning of an accepted rule or type of con
 struction. Such a type exists in the wave-length spectrum ;
 and it has obtained general acceptance, not only on account
 of its simplicity and convenience, but also of its, at present,
 unique claim to be a " natural " one. It is properly distin
 guished as the " natural " scale from its not merely repre
 senting a mental picture of the distribution of the energy,
 under a very simple law, but of actually being that which we
do produce by our most efficient optical apparatus, and make
visible and measurable at will.
     While we remain at liberty, then, to represent the energy
spectrum in terms of the wave-frequency, or of the reciprocal
of the square of the wave-length, or of any other function of
it, and while we may often find occasion to use these scales
for some special purposes, we are (and all the more especially
that we habitually speak in terms of the wave-length) led by
                        * Since designated as " Q."

196     Mr. S. P. Langley's Experimental Determination of
considerations of a very practical kind to take as our normal
or standard scale that of the wave-length itself.
   Since we have this normal spectrum actually before us,
through the concave gratings constructed by Professor Row
land, it may seem as though we might dispense with the
prism ; but this is not as yet possible for the lower part of
the spectrum, where overlapping spectra and feeble heat
make the use of the grating too difficult. If we could use
the solar energy here, not in the form of heat, but of
chemical action, as in photography, a great advance might
be made ; but photography has not yet advanced beyond the
upper part of the great infra-rod region. At present we
have only heat, and the thermopile or the bolometer ; which
latter, though less sensitive than the camera, can be made, as
I shall show, to determine experimentally within known
limits of error the actual wave-lengths corresponding to
given indices of refraction, and hence to afford here valid
experimental data for passing from the prismatic spectrum to
the normal one. The reason why this so desirable infor
mation has never been obtained before is twofold :—(1)
While the measurement in question can best be made by
means of a prism and grating conjointly, the heat, which in
the lower prismatic spectrum is very faint, becomes almost a
vanishing quantity when it has passed the grating also,
where the heat is on the average less than one tenth that
from the prism. We must use too, if possible, a narrow
aperture to register this heat ; for a broad one might (on
account of the compression of the infra-red by the prism)
cover the whole field in which its work should be to dis
criminate. (2) Wo must have not only an instrument more
sensitive than the common thermopile, but we must devise
some way of fixing with approximate precision the point at
which we are measuring, when that point is actually invisible.
   The apparatus I have devised for this double purpose has
done its work with a degree of accuracy which, if it may be
called considerable as compared with what we have been
used to in heat-measurements, is yet necessarily inferior to
that obtained by the eye, and less than we may hope for at
some future time from photography. Nevertheless it has, I
believe, given experimental data very far outside the visible
spectrum, by which we may either construct an empirical
formula and supply its proper constants so that it will be
trustworthy within extended limits, or test the exactness of
such formula? as Cauchy's, Redtenbachcr's, &c, which, while
professing a theoretical basis, only agree in their results
within the limits of the visible spectrum (from which they

          Ware-lengths in the Invisible Prismatic Spectrum.     197
  have been in fact derived, and where they arc comparatively
  unneeded). They contradict each other, as will be seen as
  soon as they are called on for information, in the region outside
  of it, where thoy would be chiefly useful.
     The present work has been preceded by a new map of
  the invisible prismatic spectrum, where the abscissa3 were
  proportional to the deviations in a certain prism (Phil.
  Mag. vol. xv. pi. iii.). And the immediate object of this
  research is to pass from the arbitrarily spaced prismatic scale,
  belonging to the particular prism in question, to a map on
  the normal and absolutely general one, which was indeed also
  presented in the same issue, but in advance of the present
  description of the means used to obtain it.
    I should perhaps make the cautionary remark, that the
 general conclusions here offered, as to the relation of wave
 lengths and indices of refraction, have been drawn from
 the observations on a single prism and have not been ex
 perimentally verified on others. This is on account of the
 extremely slow and laborious character of the process used
 (which has involved some months of labour for this special
 prism). Though there seems no reason to doubt the gene
 rality of our conclusions, it may be hoped that these experi
 ments will be repeated with prisms of other material, and by
 other observers, now that the preliminary obstacles have been
 removed.
    In order to map the spectrum on the normal scale, where
the wave-lengths are equally spaced, from such a map as that
 shown in plate iii. vol. xv. of this Journal, in which the con
sideration of wave-lengths does not enter, it is necessary to
establish some relation between the wave-lengths of rays and
their deviations, or between their wave-lengths and refractive
indices, which are connected with the deviations by the well-
known formula                    / , «
                            sin     2

the visible spectrum the deviation, in any prism, of the
Fraunhofer lines (whose wave-lengths have been very accu
rately determined) can be measured by means of an eyepiece
with cross wires ; and from a sufficient number of such
measurements, by making ordinates proportional to indices of
refraction (or deviations) and abscissae proportional to wave
lengths, a curve may be found whose equation is n=(^)\ or

 exactness.
    In the invisible spectrum the difficulties are immensely
 greater, and demand special means, not only on account of
 this invisibility, but owing to the absorption by the prism
 and to its compressing the rays.
    The prism here used was made by Adam Hilger, of London,
and its optical properties are in every way satisfactory. It is
 of a white flint, which has proved singularly transparent to
 the longest solar waves. Its principal constants have been
 given in this Journal, vol. xv. p. 173.
        Apparatus for measuring Obscure Wave-Lengths.
    In 1882 an apparatus was employed in which invisible
 rays, after passing through the Hilger prism, at a known
deviation, fell on a Rutherfurd reflecting grating (either of
681 lines to the millimetre, or half that number), from which
the diffracted invisible ray fell on the bolometer, at a mea
sured angle with the grating. By the use of the known for
mula (ns X.= sin i + sin r) connecting the angle of diffraction
with the wave-length, the wave-length was then found.
    Several determinations were thus made of wave-lengths in
the upper part of the infra-red, where the heat is relativeby
great; but, though the definition of the Rutherfurd grating
was admirable, it was not large enough to supply sufficient
heat to enable measures in tbe lower infra-red to be made
with confidence.
    In May 1 882 I had the good fortune to secure one of the
very large concave gratings, then newly constructed by
Professor Rowland, and which he was kind enough to make
for me of a very short focus, so as to give a specially hot
spectrum. After many essays, during which a great number
of mechanical and optical arrangements for getting rid of the
superposed spectra were tried with unsatisfactory results, it
became clear that, for this large and concave grating, it was
necessary to let the ray fall first on it, and then on the prism,
thus making the wave-length the known and the deviation
the unknown quantity.
    In the use of this form of grating, the slit is placed in the
circumference of a circle whose diameter is equal to the
radius of curvature of the grating, and which touches its
surface. The spectra are then formed, without the need of
collimator, observing telescope, or any further apparatus, all
lying upon the circumference of the circle which contains the
slit. The grating which was employed contains 18,050 lines,
142 to the millimetre, ruled on the surface of a concave

      Wave-lengths in the Invisible Prismatic Spectrum.   199

its lower wave-lengths, to affect the bolometer-strips after
the various reflections and absorptions to which the heat is
necessarily subjected in passing through the apparatus.

200     Mr. S. P. Langley's Experimental Determination of
   Figure 1 illustrates the means finally adopted, and the
course of the rays through the apparatus; although, for the
sake of distinctness, the mechanical devices used to maintain
the proper arrangements of the parts are omitted. The rays
of light, coming from the 300 millim. flat mirror of the large
siderostat, pass across the apparatus, and fall upon a concave
speculum of 180 millim. aperture at M, by which at a distance
of about 1*5 metre they are converged to a focus at Sj. At this
point is a vertical slit, adjustable to any desired width by a
double screw, which moves both jaws at once, so as to keep
 the centre always in the same place. This slit is protected
 from tho great heat by a plate of iron pierced with an aper
 ture only a little larger than the slit when open to the usual
 width. Beyond Sx the rays diverge and fall upon the concave
 grating, G. Directly opposite the grating is a second slit, S2,
 also double-acting ; and the apparatus is so arranged that the
two slits, Sj, S2, and the grating, G, always he upon the cir
 cumference of a circle whose diameter is 1*63 metre; and
 therefore in whatever manner the slits may be placed, the
 light coming through Sj forms a sharp spectrum upon S2.
 A very massive arm, carrying the grating, the slit S2, and the
 heavy spectro-bolometer, is pivoted at the centre of the circle,
 so that the relative positions of these parts are unchanged.
 The slit S2 is automatically kept diametrically opposite the
 grating, and on the normal to its centre.
    The slit S2 is the slit of the spectro-bolometer, provided
 with the same attachments as when used for mapping the
visible spectrum (except that it is now fitted with simple
 colliinating and objective lenses of the same special kind of
 diathermanous glass as the prism, instead of its own concave
 mirror). Its eyepiece and the bolometer are interchangeable.
    By means of the eyepiece and graduated circle tho devia
 tion, and consequently the refractive index, of the rays passing
 through the slit can be determined, if they are visible. If
 they are invisible, their exact wave-length is known by a
 simple ocular observation of the visible ones, on which they are
 superposed by the action of the grating, while their subse
 quent deviation is determinable by the bolometer placed at B,
 provided they retain sufficient energy to affect the instrument.
 It will be seen that, according to this method, all those in
 visible rays which are n times the definitely known length of
 some visible ray are caused to pass together through a slit,
 and then through a prism, which sorts out the ray of the first
 spectrum from that of the second, that of the second from
 that of the third, and so on, so that the corresponding index
 of refraction may be determined by obseivation—with the

        Wave-lengths in the Invisible Prismatic Spectrum.             201
eye in the case of the visible, with the bolometer in that of
the invisible ray.
   To illustrate the use of the above-described apparatus under
somewhat unfavourable circumstances, let us consider as an
example the observations of Juno 13, 1882, which were taken
far down in the spectrum, where the heat is feeble and the
galvanometer-deflection small, requiring a widely open slit.
The apparatus having been previously adjusted, and the sun
light properly directed by the siderostat, the visible Fraun-
hofer line D, of the third spectrum of the grating was caused to
fall upon the slit S2 of the spectro-bolometer. Then, according
to the theory of the grating, there passed through this slit
rays having the wave-lengths—
                   0*589 (3rd spectrum—visible),
                   1-178 (2nd spectrum—invisible),
                   1"7G7 (1st spectrum—invisible).
    The prism having been removed and the telescope brought
into line, an image of S2, of the same size as the slit itself,
was formed in the focus of the object-lens ; and on testing
with the bolometer, whose face was covered with a screen
pierced centrally with a 2-millim. slit, the heat of this image
produced a deflection of the galvanometer-needle of about
thirty divisions. The prism was then replaced on the auto
matic holder and set to minimum deviation, and the image of
the slit containing superposed rays, whose combined effect had
 produced the deflection just mentioned, was separated into
three similar images* (fig. 2), each composed of nearly
                                   Fig. 2.
homogeneous rays. Of these three bands, only the first or
 most refrangible, containing the Dj line, was visible, and its
 deviation was found to be 47° 41', agreeing with the value
 given by the table. It was the object of the experiment to
find the place of the lower invisible band, by groping for it ;
   * These three images, being composed of rays of three different wave
 lengths, could not all be in the same focus of the same lens at the same
 time, since the collimator and objective of this spectrometer were simple
lenses. The lenses were adjusted by means of a table of focal distances
 previously prepared, so as to throw a sharp (invisible) image of the band
to be detected.

i. e. to determine its deviation by trials with the bolometer at
intervals sufficiently close to avoid the possibility of missing
it altogether. According to Briot's formula, the deviation
should be 45° 21', and in the preliminary search the circle
was accordingly set to this reading. Beginning at this point,
and exposing the bolometer at every five minutes of deviation,
it was found that the maximum effect was obtained nearer
45° 15'. The approximate position having thus been found,
the slit Sx was narrowed to 2 millim., and the following
measurements taken, the horizontal line giving the mean
results of a series of thirty exposures of the bolometer, as it
moved through the spectrum.

    The maximum reading at 45° 10' corresponds to a coinci
dence of the 2 millim. bolometer-aperture with the 2 millim.
invisiblo image of the slit whose position is sought. From a
subsidiary curve drawn through the points whose coordinates
are respectively (#=45° 02', t/ = 4-f>), (.r=45° 07', y=5'6),
(;r=45 10', y = (v0), &c, it was concluded that the deviation
of rays whose wave-length is                    is 45° 10'; and each
point in this determination being obtained from the mean of
five observations, the result is partly free from irregularities
 caused by changes in the state of the sky, and minute
 instrumental variations from extraneous causes, which here
 become of great relative importance owing to the feeble heat
 measured.
     Subsequent determinations like the preceding gave for the
 deviation of the same ray 45° 06' and 45° 07^ and from a
 consideration of all, the deviation adopted was (instead of
 45° 21', as given by Briot's formula) 45° 08', corresponding
 to a refractive index of 1*5549.

   We observe that where measures are taken in the prismatic
spectrum alone, we can generally use with advantage a bolo
meter of as small an aperture as one fifth of a millimetre ; but
that here it is advisable to open it to 2 millimetres, owing to
the relative expansion of the spectrum and to the very feeble
heat.
    Owing to difficulties arising from the almost infinitesimal
amount of heat in question, numerous subsidiary observations
are requisite for a single determination, which it therefore
takes long to make, each final value resting upon between 20
and 100 readings. If it should possibly appear to the reader
that, in the three months of consecutive labour which were
given to this part of the work, more than six points might
have been determined in the curve, he is asked to remember
that what is here difficult has till now been impossible.
    Plotting the points given by the data in Table II. and
drawing a smooth curve through them, we obtain the curve
of " observation " showing n as a function of X in the lower
curve of Plate VIII.
   There would be no gain in accuracy, at this stage, in
attempting to work from a formula representing the equation
of the curve obtained, as the graphical construction is fully as
trustworthy as the data. This I say with special reference to
the large original chartsf , which have been drawn by Mr. J.
   • All these observations for discovering the relation between n and X
can be conducted with at least as much advantage by a powerful and
constant electric light as by sunlight. The latter only, however, was at
the observer's actual command.
  t These original charts were exhibited to the members of the National
Academy of Sciences, at Washington, in April 1883. The engraving here
given in illustration, being on a much reduced scale, will merely indicate
the exactness of interpolation possible by the originals.

 204      Mr. S. P. Langley's Experimental Determination of
 E. Keeler, of this Observatory, and which seem to me favour
 able specimens of the accuracy attainable by this method.
    We are now prepared to test t/ie accuracy of the various
formula! connecting refraction with wave-length, though it will
 be convenient to first prepare a table showing what this rela
 tion is in the visible part of the spectrum of the prism employed.
    In the following table the deviations in the visible spec
 trum were measured by the spectrometer, reading to 10" of
 arc, and which has been already described ; in which for this
 special purpose the bolometer was replaced by an achromatic
 observing-telescope with a micrometer eyepiece, and the indices
 of refraction were computed by the usual formula. " 0 " in
 the ultra-violet was measured by aid of a Soret fluorescent
 eyepiece, and its wave-length is from Cornu. The other wave
 lengths are taken from Angstrom, but the unit is herec the
 micron = -r^oTf millimetre = 10,000 times the unit of Ang
 strom's scale). "X" is here the symbol for the wave-length.
    The following indices in the visible spectrum, on which the
computations for testing the formula? are founded, are trust
worthy to the fourth decimal place here given :—

   A smooth curve drawn through points whose positions are
given by the above table, represents with accuracy the relation
between n and X in the visible part of the spectrum. This
method is, however, obviously inapplicable to the very ex
tended invisible portion below the A line ; and accordingly
attempts were first made to effect the determination of corre
sponding indices and wave-lengths, by extending the curve
derived from the above observations by means of formula?.
Several formula? have, it will be remembered, been proposed
by physicists, expressing n as a function of X, and containing
constants which are to be determined by observation. But it
has never hitherto been possible to test these formulae far from

       Wave-lengths in the Invisible Prismatic Spectrum.     205
the visible spectrum, whence their constants have been in fact
derived. This desirable test we are now prepared to apply.
   The simplest as well as the most widely used formula is that
of Cauchy, which, as it is commonly written
                      (,l=0+x> + £)'
contains three unknown quantities, requiring for their deter
mination three simultaneous equations. Selecting the lines A,
D, and H for this purpose, we have from the table just given
the three equations
                                 b              c
              l-5714=a+ (o-Ygoot,^ + (^0009^

              1-6070 = a+ (0-39679)2 T (0-39679)*'
from which, by elimination,
           o= 1-5593, 6=0-006775, c=0-0001137;
so that, for this prism, the formula becomes
                    . ,,no 0-006775

which we find on trial satisfies the observations in the visible
part of the spectrum within very narrow limits. When, how
ever, we attempt to extend the application of the formula to
the infra-red region, its results are not so satisfactory. Since
b and c are both positive, the least value which n can have in
our prism, according to the formula, is a, or 1*5593, corre
sponding to a deviation of 45° 35'; whereas the bolometric
measurements show that in this prism the solar spectrum after
absorption extends as low as 44°; with every sign that if it do
not extend yet further, it is not on account of the prism, but
because below this point the heat is absorbed by some ingre
dient of our atmosphere.
    We conclude, then, that Cauchy's formula gives grossly erro
neous results when extended far beyond the limits within which
the observations on which it is founded are made. Its im
plicit assertion that the lower limit of the prismatic spectrum
(however great the wave-length of the ray transmitted) is not
so far below A as A is below D is absolutely contradicted
by these experiments ; and all extrapolations made by it, far
from the visible spectrum in which its constants have been

 206      Mr. S. P. Langley's Experimental Determination of
 determined, are wholly untrustworthy, as will appear more
 fully later.
    Redtenbacher proposes the formula
 for expressing the same relation. Using the same lines as
before for determining the unknown constants, we have for
 the Hilger prism,
           i =0-412297 -0-00093711X2- 0'00f.?22Q,
            n2                                          X2
a formula which also satisfies the observations in the visible
spectrum, but fails when extended to the invisible. The
curve representing it has a minimum point, corresponding to
n= 1*5647 for a value of X found from the equation                        or
               ¦                                            c
in the special case of the formula above, where , is positive,
X= 1-430 ; so that for every value of n greater than T5647
there are two real values of X. This formula therefore is even
less satisfactory than that of Cauchy.
    Briot gives a formula which has been asserted by other
investigators* to represent satisfactorily the results of obser
vation throughout the whole spectrum, namely
                  ?-•+»(£)+•$<U+2666>»©¦
    From four equations like this, using values of n and X cor
responding to the Fraunhofer lines A, C, F, and H, the values
of the constants were determinedf as follows:—
     a=0-41028, b= -0-0013495, c= -0-000003379,
                          *= +0-0022329.
    With the aid of. these constants the wave-lengths corre
sponding to given refractive indices were computed, and a
curve representing the formula was plotted. This curve, as
well as those representing Cauchy's and Redtenbacher's
formulae, is shown in Plate VIII., where we may obtain by
simple inspection the actual errors of all the formula? in
question ; or we may take them from the following table,
   • Mouton, Comptes Bendus, vol. lxxxix. p. 291, and vol. lxxxiii. p. 1190.
   t This formula has the practical inconvenience of leading to cubic
equations, either in na or \', the solution of which is so tedious as to
forbid its use where many places are to be independently found. I have
been aided in the present lengthy numerical computations by Professor
M. B. Goff.

by the bolometer, are liable to error in the fourth decimal place. For probable
errors of X Bee Table II. " X observed " is either from a direct observation or
from an interpolation between two closely contiguous observations.
    It is evident that Briot's formula, though not exact, yet
gives results much more trustworthy than the others con
sidered ; and it was employed in constructing provisional
maps of the normal spectrum from the prismatic, until an
apparatus was completed for determining the wave-lengths of
the invisible rays by direct measurement.
     We must evidently conclude from the numbers in Table IV.
 and from the curve in Plate VIIL, which embodies them, that
 we in reality can scarcely assign any limit to the extent of the
 infra-red prismatic spectrum ; and that far from the curve
 having an asymptote parallel to the axis of X, as Cauchy's
 theory requires, our curve (so far as we can follow it) rather
 tends to ultimately coincide with a straight line cutting the
 axis at a finite angle, and (if this axis pass through the point
 n = l) at a great distance from the origin.

 208     Mr. S. P. Langley's Experimental Determination of
    With the danger of extrapolations presented to us in such
 examples as have been cited, we shall not attempt to gene
 ralize the results of our observations further than to remark
 that for the prism in question we find that the deviation tends
 within the limits of observation to become proportional to the
wave-lengths as the deviation diminishes, and that, as far
as we can see at present, there is scarcely any limit to the
wave-length our prism can transmit except that fixed by its
absorptive effect.
    The approximate limit of the solar spectrum of the Hilger
 prism is at n = 1*5435, which, according to Briot's formula,
corresponds nearly to 3'*'4, but which, according to our bolo-
metric observations, corresponds to an actual wave-length of
2'1,8. For this same point, as will be seen by Table IV., the
values by Cauchy's formula are impossible, and those by Red-
tenbacher's formula are imaginary.
    These last values rest, it will be remembered, on extra
polations founded on measures in the visible spectrum.

 first published in the Cotnptes liendus of the Institute of
 France, for September 11, 1882, in the form of charts, which
 were drawn from them. These charts were so much reduced

a wave-length scale upon the map of the prismatic spectrum,
without any extrapolation, between our present extreme
points of observation, a deviation of 50° 58' (corresponding
to X = 0'x-344), and a deviation of 44° 25' (corresponding to
X=2'1,356), and also to construct a map in which the wave
length scale is an ordinary scale of equal parts, but in which
the degrees of deviation, if represented, would be unequally
spaced. Such a chart of the normal spectrum has, as we have
already remarked, the advantage of being entirely indepen
dent of any particular prism or grating, and consequently
of being directly comparable with all other maps of the same
kind.
    If, besides making a map of the normal spectrum, we wish
to construct a curve representing the corresponding distribu
tion of energy, a further consideration of the relations exist
ing between the two charts is necessary. The law of disper
sion of the prism causes the distribution of energy in its
spectrum to be quite different from what would have been
observed with a diffraction-grating*. Disregarding the ab
sorbing action of the apparatus, the amount of heat between
 two definite wave-lengths, as between the A and B lines, should
be the same in both spectra, provided the total quantity of
heat is the same in both. The area between any two ordi-
nates of the curvet may be considered to represent the amount
of heat in the part of the spectrum included between them,
and the total area of the curve represents the total amount of
heat. If, then, we suppose the area of the normal curve
required to be the same as that of the prismatic one, the con
dition to be fulfilled by the former curve is, that the area
 included between the ordinates at any two wave-lengths shall
be equal to that included between the same wave-lengths in
the latter, and from this condition we can deduce a construc
tion for effecting the required transformation!.

   it into equal spaces to represent the normal wave-length scale, and upon
   a line CD, at right angles to the first, lay off the same distance and divide
   it into the same number of parts, spaced according to the law of disper
   sion of the prism, as in the wave-length scale marked on the bottom of
   the prismatic chart (plate iii. this Journal, vol. xv.). Erect ordinates
 at the points of division, and mark them with the proper wave-lengths,

   Now, when a and c are indefinitely small, b and d are the ordinates of
the prismatic and normal energy-curves, respectively, at a given wave
length, and (j> is the angle formed by the tangent to EF at their point of
intersection. Hence, to find the height of the normal curve at a given
wave-length, the corresponding ordinate of the prismatic curve must be
 multiplied by tan 0.
    Such a construction was applied to the prismatic energy-
curve of the Hilger prism.
    The true normal energy-curve with all its inflections,
maxima and minima, is easily drawn after this (dotted)
bounding curve of normal energy* is plotted, for the parts of
the ordinate of the latter below and above its intersection
with the former irregular curve bear the same proportion to
each other as in the prismatic spectrum, and we thus finally
attain the object of the preceding labour.
    If now it is desirable to map the distribution of the energy
on any other scale, such as that on which the abscissa? are
proportional to the times of vibration, this can be done with
facility. Thus, in the supposed instance, we have only to find
\ for each vibration, number to get the abscissae, and (obser-
ving that since y now = ^                — \?) *° use         multiplying
factor     to obtain the height of the new ordinate in each
instance. If the length of the new energy-curve between the
limiting perpendiculars (which now represent the reciprocals
of the wave-length ) is to be the same as in the old, we must
introduce a constant multiplier n, writing the equation of ^he
interpolating curve y = T, so that the multiplying factor
becomes —
    I have drawn in this way (on a smaller scale than that of
the normal or prismatic curves, and following the smooth
curve in the former as my original) four different schemes
for the distribution of the energy. Curve A, PI. IX., represents
the distribution of solar energy (after absorption by our atmo
sphere) on the normal scale. Curve B represents the same
 distribution on the scale of wave-frequency (general equation
of interpolating curve *=^j proposed by Mr. Stoney). Curve

 C represents the distribution according to a proposal {x=\og\)
 of Lord Rayleigh.
    Curve D (y=C) is quite different from any of the pre
 ceding. It gives the distribution on a scale I have never
 seen proposed, but which I have found useful. In this, the
 bounding curve is a straight line parallel to the axis of X.
 This construction is not well suited to exhibit the cold bands ;
 but if we consider only the general distribution of the energy,
 we shall find that curve D is not merely suggestive as illus
 trating what has already been remarked here as to the con
 ventional character of the methods of showing this distribution,
 but that it has more practical uses ; for in this last construction
 it is easily seen that the sums of the energies between any two
 wave-lengths whatever are directly proportional to the dis
 tance between their ordinates, measured on the axis of X. If,
 then, we desire (for instance) to know what relation the
 invisible bears to the visible heat, or to inquire about what
 point in the spectrum the energy is equally distributed, these
 and similar problems are solved through curve D by simple
 inspection.
    I have not been able yet to repeat the preceding determina
 tions upon the lower part of the spectrum as often as I could
 wish. They are susceptible of improved accuracy by still
 longer experiment, but I think that, within the limits of error
 indicated, they may already be useful. I should add that
 throughout this investigation I have received constant and
 valuable aid from Mr. J. E. Keeler, not only in the graphical
 constructions, but in the experiments and in the computations,
 through all the details of which his aid has been more that of
 a coadjutor than an assistant.

    Note.—Since the above was in type I have seen the inter
esting article by M. H. Becquerel in the Annates de Cliimie
for September 1883.
    Thf wave-lengths assigned by M. Becquerel to the band at
the limit of his researches at l^^O to 1M"480 appear to me
too great, for this limit corresponds to the band whose wave
length is given at l"-36 to 1M,37 on my chart, published in the
Comptes Rendus of the previous year (September 11, 1882),
and on a larger scale in this Journal for March 1883, and
in the Annales de Chimie for August 1883.                   I regret
that M. Becquerel has not read the article in the Comptes
Rendus.        Had he done so he would have seen that the

 214        Messrs. Lodge and Clark on Dusty Air in the
 wave-lengths there given were not conjectural, but directly
 determined by the only practical method from the use of a
 frating. They were the result, in fact, of the measurements
    have just described, and were specially intended to give
information about the unknown region extending beyond the
limit of M. Becquerel's researches, such as the great newly
discovered band ft, for instance, which stretches from wave
lengths l^O to F-90, while M. Becquerel's furthest band, as
 I have said, is at         (according to him; but according to
 my measures more nearly at lM-38). The present memoir
 will show what degree of reliance may be placed on these
 measurements.
    It is understood that a photographic map of the spectrum to
        and therefore covering the ground of M. Becquerel's
{>aper, but not extending as far as my ft, will shortly be pub-
  ished from the joint labours of Professor Rowland and Captain
 Abney; and as their results will probably be more exact than
the preliminary explorations in which either M. Becquerel or
 myself have been engaged, we may await its appearance for
the determination of a part, at least, of the points in question.
    I would call attention to the fact that M. Becquerel has
stated that the furthest band known to him in Sept. 1883
(except from my own researches) had a wave-length of not
over l^O, according to his own estimate.
XXVI. On the Phenomena exhibited by Dusty Air in the neigh
    bourhood of strongly Illuminated Bodies. By Oliver J.
    Lodge and J. W. Cxark *.
                                Part I.
                              [Plate VH.]
 IN the course of a lecture on Dust and Disease given at the
       Royal Institution in 1870, Dr. Tyndall calls attention to,
and fully illustrates by experiment, a dark or dust-free region
which he had observed in the convection-currents rising from
hot solids placed in the path of a powerful beam of light (see
Proc. Roy. Inst. vol. vi. p. 1, also ' The Floating Matter of the
Air '). He describes this dark stream as of surprising sharp
ness and definiteness, especially when it is seen above an
ignited platinum wire, the line of sight being parallel to the
wire but at right angles to the beam. Dr. Tyndall also gave
   * Communicated by the Physical Society, an abstract having been read
at the Meeting on the 9th of February.

         neighbourhood of strongly Illuminated Bodies.       215
two explanations of the phenomena—one of which he consi
dered to be applicable when the solid is at a red or white
heat; the other applicable when the body is at some more
moderate temperature, such as that of boiling or even warm
water. The first explanation is that the dust is absolutely
burnt and consumed by the heat; the second is that the hot
body warms the air in contact with it, which air therefore
rises, dragging the dust after it but getting a slight start in
advance of the dust, so that a thin stratum of the advance air
from either side of the body is free from dust, and the min
gling of the two strata constitutes the dark plane. This goes
on continually as long as the convection-currents are pro
duced by the body; and so the dark plane is permanent while
the body is hot.
   Prof. Frankland, in another paper on Dust and Disease,
gives a still simpler account of the matter, and considers
(Proc. Roy. Soc. vol. xxv. p. 542) that the observation proves
that " a very large proportion of the suspended particles in
the London atmosphere consists of water and other volatile
liquid or solid matter." In other words, Prof. Frankland
considers that the dust is simply dried up by the heat.
    These three explanations seem to have been sufficiently
plausible to satisfy those who may have examined or exhibited
 the phenomena discovered by Dr. Tyndall, until in 1881 Lord
 Rayleigh repeated and extended the original observation,
 " not. feeling satisfied with the explanation of the dark plane
 given by the discoverer " (Roy. Soc. Dec. 21, 1882; ' Nature/
 vol. xxviii. p. 139). He used a glass box to prevent draughts,
 and his hot body was usually a small copper spade which
 could be warmed from the outside of the box with a spirit-
 lamp. He called attention to the fact that the stream-lines
 round the obstacle follow the electrical law of flow, because
 the warm obstacle is itself the origin of the motion. He
 showed that smoke was not evaporated by being blown
 through a hot glass tube into sunshine, and he conclusively
 disproved any evaporation hypothesis by reversing the whole
 phenomenon : cooling the rod instead of heating it, and causing
 the dark plane to stream downwards.
    Lord Rayleigh further suggested an hypothesis of his own
 to account for the dark plane in a simple mechanical manner,
 viz. that the curvature of the stream-lines near the surface of
 the obstacle was such as to cause the heavier dust-particles to
 be thrown outwards away from the body, and thus to leave a
 thin layer of air free from dust. To test this hypothesis he
 made a special centrifugal experiment with a whirling table,
 the direct result of which was negative; but it led to the

 216       Messrs. Lodge and Clark on Dusty Air in the
 observation of an apparent purification of air by contact with
 a solid, which if followed up might have led a good deal
 further. It was not followed up, however, though the remark
 is made that " it would seem as if this kind of contact was
 sufficient to purify the air without the aid of centrifugal
 force;" and the paper concludes with another test of the
 centrifugal force hypothesis, concerning which, finally, " no
 absolute conclusion can be drawn."
    In the autumn of 1883 our attention was called to the
 matter by Lord Rayleigh's article in 'Nature;' and being struck
 with the apparent total collapse of all explanations hitherto
 offered, we proceeded to repeat the experiments with some
 care. The first result of any importance which we obtained
 was the fact that e dark plane hitherto observed to rise
 from a warm boay, or to sink from a cold one, is only a con
 tinuation of a dark or dust-free coat of uniform thickness and
 sharp outbn which completely invests the body; and we were
 led to the conclusion that this coat is the most important part
 of the phenomenon, because the up or down streaming-planes
 seem only to be that portion of the coat which is being con
 tinuously wiped off by convection-currents, the coat on the
 body being as continually renewed by some action not by us
 then understood. This fact, together with a few other results
 having reference mainly to the effect of electrifying the solid
 bodv, was communicated in a letter to ' Nature ' (26th Julv,
 1883, vol. xxviii. p. 297).
    Since then we have continued the observations. We shall
first describe generally the methods of experiment and the
phenomena observed.
    General Methods of Experiment.—In all cases the electric
 light has been employed to illuminate the bodies under exa
mination in dusty media. For the examination in air and
gases two principal forms of apparatus have been employed.
Fig. 5 shows the glass box which has been used for ordinary
air. The sides and one end are of glass, the other end is of
wood and perforated with a hole for a cork; the top is also of
wood, but provided with a wide slot, which can be closed by
a glass plate, so as to allow the substance under examination
to be illuminated from above, or by perforated wooden covers
through which tubes, wires, &c. could be introduced when it
was desired to test the electrical or other condition of the
body under examination. The box is closed at the bottom by
standing it upon a blotting-paper pad on one of Quincke's ad
justable glass-plated supports. A fragment of magnesium wire
burnt beneath the box served to introduce air laden with mag
netic-oxide particles; and by removing the cover from the topof

         neighbourhood of strongly Illuminated Bodies.         217
the box tobacco smoke could be readily blown in, or ammonic-
chloride smoke by a current of air directed into the box
through a heated tube containing amnionic chloride. The
body under examination was supported near the glass end of
the box either by means of the small adjustable clip shown in
fig. 7, or passed through the cork in the opposite wooden end
of the chamber. Fig. 6 illustrates this mode of support, the
thin line representing a fine platinum wire attached to two
stout copper wires through which a current to ignite the wire
could be passed. MetaJ rods thus supported could be directly
heated from without by means of a gas-flame, and, if desired,
be insulated by passing through glass tubes in the cork.
    Ordinarily the convergent beam of the electric light heated
the body sufficiently, especially when it had been previously
blackened in the smoke of burning camphor. For the exa
mination in dry air and in different gases, either at the atmo
spheric or at lower pressures, the more complicated apparatus
shown in fig. 8 has been employed. The larger end of the
horizontal observing vessel is closed with a plane glass plate,
through which observations were made. The other end of the
vessel was closed with an india-rubber cork carrying two
thermometers. The one served to indicate the temperature of
the air within the vessel; the cylindrical bulb of the other
was covered with camphor smoke and served as the surface
 upon which the coat formed, and also indicated its tempe
rature approximately. Inert gases were dried by passing
through concentrated sulphuric acid and through asbestos
 mixed with phosphoric anhydride; others, like ammonia, by
 passing through finely divided calcic oxide and caustic potash.
The gases then passed through a wide tube containing am
nionic chloride into the experimental chamber. By applying
a gentle heat to this tube of amnionic chloride, the gas could
readily be charged with its particles. For pressure in excess
 of the atmospheric, the form of apparatus shown in fig. 9
 has been employed.
    For the examination in liquids the box shown in fig. 10
was constructed. It has two plain glass sides. The double
 brass tube was about 0"5 centim. in diameter, and passed
through a cork in the back of the box: this tube was heated
either by a current of steam or by simply converging the
 beam from the lamp upon it. To render the liquid turbid,
 particles of dried ferric oxide have been found to answer well.
With this form of apparatus, as also with those previously
 described, the light has been passed in through the side of the
 vessel, the body being examined through the glass in a line with
 its axis but at right angles to the direction of the beam of light.

 218       Messrs. Lodge and Clark on Dusty Air in the
    The appearances presented by the body were observed
 either by the eye, through a hand lens, or through one of
 Quincke's microscopes provided with a micrometer eye-piece,
indicated in fig. 8.
    General description of Black or Dust-free Coat and Plane.—
 Before proceeding to a more detailed description of the ap
pearances about to be described under varying conditions,
we will briefly state what occurs when a rod of electric-light
carbon, in ordinary air holding magnesic oxide in suspension,
is illuminated at right angles to its axis at a place near the
observed end by the converged beam of the electric light, and
is viewed in a line with its axis. A water-cell conveniently
 intercepts a part of the rad'ation and renders the action
 slower. A careful examination at the first instant of turning
 on the light will usually reveal the dust-particles in close
 proximity to the surface of the rod, but in the case of a
 black solid they almost instantly leave it, and after a barely
 appreciable interval of time the upward and rapid convec
 tion-currents commence. There is now a thin ring of per
 fectly dust-free air and of great definiteness surrounding the
 carbon rod, a little thicker on the illuminated side, but
distinctly traceable all round. On the top of the rod this
 ring is seen to stream upwards, the up-streaming portion
being at first broad, but rapidly narrowing into a black line
 of very appreciable width, which is often traceable for a long
distance thrAigh the turbid air of the box. The black ring
surrounding Be carbon cylinder is the dust-free coat, the
 black line rising from the top of it is the dust-free plane;
tho junction of the two the base of the plane.
    On the under surface of the rod the particles are seen
rushing up to the edge of the dark coat, not entering it, but
curling away to the right and to the left, as if this coat were
the real surface of the solid. Fig. la shows the rod in section
surrounded by its coat and the plane on the top; fig. 1 shows
also the paths followed by the dust-particles. It will be
observed that the dust-particles follow the air-stream lines,
moving with the air, not through it : any considerable motion
of particles across stream-lines would soon obliterate the dark
plane, whereas it is very persistent and is seen sometimes
coiling itself up into a spiral. Another point of much in
terest is the distribution of the velocities of the dust-particles
sxt different distances from the surface of the solid on a
horizontal line perpendicular to its surface. In the case of
carbon the velocities are all so great that individual particles
are not readily traced, but under favourable circumstances it
may be noticed that the particles reach their maximum velo

          neighbourhood of strongly Illuminated Bodies.        219
city at an appreciable distance outside the black coat. It
may be of interest here to state that on the surface of ice
the coat and plane are absent, and the velocity distribution,
considered as above, is apparently uniform up to a point so
near the surface of the solid as to be indistinguishable from it
with any degree of certainty.
   We must row proceed to consider these appearances in
greater detail, and tbe conditions under which they undergo
modification. The contents of this paper may be conveniently
summarized under tbe following heads:—
    1. Experiments made with a view to ascertain the influ
ence of size, shape, and nature of surface of the body exa
mined.
    2. Experiments made with a view to ascertain the effect of
temperature, electric potential, and other conditions of the
body.
    3. Experiments made on bodies of different material.
   4. Experiments made to observe *he effect of pressure on
the smoky medium.
    5. Experiments made to examine the behaviour of different
kinds of smoke—(«) volatile, (/8) non-volatile.
    6. Experiments on bodies which themselves give off smoke
or vapour.
    7. Experiments made to examine the conditions under which
dust settles on surfaces.
    8. Experiments made in media of different natures, e. g.
different gases and liquids.
        1. Experiments on the Influence of Size, Shape, and
                       Nature of Surface.
    (a) Size.—To see whether the size of the body had any
marked effect on the width of the dark coat and plane, we
 have used cylinders of various thickness (e.-g. iron wires *15 and
 •4 centim. diam., carbon rods -7 and T22 centim.); but without
 temperature-measurements it is useless to exactly specify the
 results. We judge, however, that the thickness of the dark
 coat is independent of the size of the body (other things being
 the same), but that the rising dark plane is best marked on
 rods of moderately large diameter ; certainly its base is
bigger.
    (b) Shape.—In ou- early experiments, when examining the
 appearances of the dark plane, we used copper scraps cut and
 bent into very various shapes ; but we found the dark coat on
 all of them, and that the up-streaming of the dark plane was a
 simple matter of stream-lines ; so we need only specify the
 results for a few of the more important shapes. In the great

220       Messrs. Lodge and Clark on Dusty Air in the
majority of cases we used a simple round rod, and its appear
ance has been already described. A flat horizontal plate or
spade, a centimetre or less in width, shows a coat all over its
under surface, very thin coats at its edges where the currents
are violent, and a dark plane rising from a broad base, conti
nuous with the dark coat on its upper surface. On a horizontal
flat copper plate, 6 centim. wide, the coat on the upper sur
face is very thick, being little disturbed by currents. Its
outline is not perfectly sharp, and it hovers or wnvers about,
some portions being thicker than the rest, and appearing
likely to form upward streamers, though they seldom do.
There is a certain amount of up-streaming from the coat,
mainly from near the edges. On perforating the plate with
a hole of about 0'07 centim. in diameter, a thin line of du t-
laden air rises through the black coat on the under surface
of the plate, and emerges into the black coat on the upper
surface like a miniature volcano. If it emerge into dusty air
the small smoke-column is sometimes seen thinly edged with
black from having passed so near a solid.
   A vertical flat plate has good coats and a plane. With thin
mica or copper, "003 inch thick, the coats are rather thicker
near the top of the plate than near the bottom, and the dust
touches the plate near the bottom, as proved by a deposit of
dust which forms there. Blackening the surface increases the
thickness of the coats.
    A hemicylinder of sheet-copper was examined (a) with the
concave side turned towards the light, (b) turned upwards,
 and (r) with the concave surface turned downwards. Its ap
pearance in position a is shown in fig. 2; its interior is lined
 with a good dark coat. The coat was first seen on this piece.
In position b a coat surrounds the surface, and from the two
 upper edges rise dark planes. We illuminate this from above
 by a 45° mirror. On the inner surface the definiteness of the
boundary of the coat is not so good. Position c gives a dark
plane from the top much as a round rod does ; and inside
also the dust-free coat is thick and well-marked. Wishing to
make the air inside more stagnant, we glazed in its ends with
mica, so as to stop oven longitudinal currents, and now the
 gravitational settling of the dust broadened the inside dark
 coat ; but the coat narrowed to its customary width when con
 vection-currents were caused to circulate within the cavity.
 The different thickness of coat on curved surfaces is well shown
 by using the hemicylinder of glass, shown in fig. 4. The
coat is evidently thickest where gravitation assists it, and
thinnest where it opposes it.
    The behaviour of very thin films is curious. Vertical

         neigJ&ourhood of strongly Illuminated Bodies.     221
glass films about "0003 inch thick usually show no dark coat
at all, and they either set up no convection-currents, or those
which they set up are exceedingly sluggish. Strips of ordinary
glass give good coats, the one on the illuminated side appear
ing first. It seems as if very thin films were incompetent
to absorb enough radiation. (It has been incidentally noticed
that these glass films, when freshly blown, adhere together
when placed in contact. After standing in the air for a few
hours this does not take place.)
   A lump of rock-salt in ordinary air exhibited dark coats
and a plane, but this might be due to moisture on the surface.
A good plate of clear rock-salt, in air thoroughly dried with
phosphoric anhydride, behaved just like the thin glass films,
giving no coats and doubtful convection-currents. A plate of
mica 0*002 inch thick absorbs sufficient radiation to exhibit
the effects, though when the sheet was horizontal the coat on
its upper surface was very badly marked. Mica showed an
unexpected result, which is described later on.
    Horizontal glass tubes filled with smoke, and immersed in
the beam, have been examined by looking along the axis.
The air inside is nearly stagnant, but the smoke collects in
the axis of the tube, leaving a clear dark space or ring all
round. The smoke settles also more slowly when the glass
is thus warm than when it is at the temperature of the
air.
    (c) Nature of Surface.—Of three copper rods, one was
tightly covered with blotting-paper, one with cotton wool, and
the third left uncovered. They were all smoked with cam
phor-black, and exposed to the beam : the cotton-wool surface
showed slightly the broadest plane. But the effect of such
variation of surface is not marked, and is probably insignifi
cant. Other experiments made with smooth electric-light
carbon, and carbon roughened with sand-paper, led to the
same conclusion.
    2. Experiments made on Solids at different Temperatures.
   To determine roughly the heating-power of the beam of
 light used, and to see at what temperature the dark plane be
came distinctly visible, a thermometer with its cylindrical
bulb blackened with camphor-smoke was inserted horizontally
into the box (fig. 5), and used as the solid to be examined.
When the smoke was introduced, the thermometer read 21°.
A few seconds after the light had been turned on, the dark
plane was visible, and the thermometer read 210,2. At 210-5
the plane was good, but there was no coat visible to the eye.
At fl° the coat appeared, and at 23° it was distinct. The

222       Messrs. Lodge and Clark on Dmty Air in the
thermometer was still rising rapidly, and soon attained 35°.
The water-vessel, which had been used to moderate the violence
of the converging electric beam, was then removed, and before
long the thermometer was at 100° C, and was still rapidly
rising. The coat and plane were now thick and exceedingly
well-developed.     In a second experiment, and examining
through a hand lens, the coat was visible at 23°"7, and at 26
it was fairly thick. It must be remembered that the whole of
the bulb was not warmed by the beam, and these temperature-
readings are therefore orly rough indications.
   Probably common wood-charcoal gives the thickest coat of
any substance we have examined ; and although so bad a con
ductor of heat, the coat is not confined to the part of the solid
immediately exposed to the beam. The thermometer was
withdrawn from the experimental box, and the brass steam-
tube out of the water apparatus (fig. 10) was inserted in its
place ; its surface was platinized. When this tube was heated
by steam, the coat was rather thicker than when heated only
by the beam from the lamp. The thickness of the coat on the
steam-heated tube differs little from its thickness on the lamp
black thermometer-bulb at 100°.
   The direct effect of temperature is ordinarily inseparable
from the secondary effect of the convection-currents, which
increase with the difference of temperature between the solid
and the air. When the temperature of the solid is high,
the coat is thick, although the convection-currents may
be very rapid ; for the cause which gives rise to the con
vection-currents also gives rise to the black coat : and it
appears that the increased temperature facilitates the formation
of the dark coat more than the increased velocity of the con
vection-currents thins the coat. Air-currents can be produced
by blowing through a capillary tube on to the surface of the
rod under observation, and the effect of such a current is to
reduce the thickness of the coat ; in fact the coat may thus
be rendered so thin as to be imperceptible. The rod may
be replaced by a metal tube, closed at one end and pierced
laterally by a fine longitudinal slit or small hole in the exa
mined region. An india-rubber tube attached to the other
end of the tube allows air to be blown into the coat or plane.
In this way the dark plane may be deflected in any direction,
and by a very strong blast the coat rendered imperceptible.
A body at the temperature of the air is probably destitute of
a visible coat. On black surfaces it is hard to establish this
point, as the light necessary for their examination warms them
so rapidly. The careful study of a glass plate, or bright
metal surface, however, reveals the fact that the coat is absent

          neighbourhood of strongly Illuminated Bodies.         223
  when first illuminated; its rapid formation may be seen. The
  coat appears to reach its maximum thickness very rapidly.
  At first we examined a body at the neutral temperature
  as it passed gradually from a temperature lower than tbat of
  the surrounding air to a higher. This method of examination
  led one of us to suppose, and to imply in the letter to ' Nature '
  (26 July, 1883, vol. xxviii. p. 297), that the coat was present on
  all bodies, whether warmer, colder, or at the same temperature
  as the surrounding air. But this method of examination is
  unreliable, as may be seen from the following.
     A rod of carbon is cooled to —21° C. in a test-tube sur
  rounded by ice and salt. The rod is quickly transferred to
  the glass box (fig. 5), smoke introduced, and the beam, filtered
  through water, turned on. The temperature being low, the first
  thing seen is a bright down-stream of partic'es. Very soon
  a dark streak in the middle of this appears, which dark streak
  widens and becomes a sharp and well-defined down-streaming
 dark plane, edged at first with the bright one, but later be
 coming free from it. The convecc'on-currents are still rapid,
 and the only portion of a coat visible is the thickened base of
 the (inverted) plane. This incipient coat is soon traceable
 further.
     This incipient coat becomes visible further round the rod,
 until the lower half is provided with a thin black coat.
Soon the downward convection-currents cease, the plane loses
its definiteness, and becomes confused with its thickening
base and the coat itself, until the ill-defined mass of dust-free
air turns around the rod of carbon, thus giving rise to a
hazy ill-defired adventitious coat, which, if removed, would
not be able to re-form at this temperature. The currents
then begin to ascend, and this adventitious coat gives place
to the true coat and sharp plane, already described as exist
ing when carbon is warm. The appearance presented bv the
cold but warming rod seems capable of some modification,
in consequence probably of variations in the rapidity with
which the carbon is heated, and of its being an imperfect
conductor. Thus occasionally the dark ill-defined dust-free
space which exists at the bottom of the rod, just as the pro
cess of inversion commences, turns round towards the lamp,
and may be succeeded by the ordinary black coat and a plane
on that side, whilst, so far as has been ascertained, the coat
may be partially wanting on the side remote from the lamp.
Under these conditions one half of the base of the plane is
more or less absent. This constitutes the ¦ unilateral plane
shown in fig. 3.

 224      Messrs. Lodge and Clark on Dusty Air in the
         3. Experiments made with different Substances.
    Various substances have been examined in dusty air, such
 as copper, iron, zinc, carbon, glass, mica, selenite, vitreous
 selenium, Iceland spar, potash, rock-salt, bismuth, blotting-
 paper, black paper, white paper, chalk, polished silver, &c;
 carbon moistened with various liquids ; water, ice.
    It may be stated, in a general way, that all these
 substances, when examined in the beam of the electric
 lamp, exhibit a remarkable similarity in their action towards
 the dust in the air, although they no doubt exhibit dif
 ferences in the thicknesses of the coats. This is almost
 certainly exclusively dependent upon the temperature to
 which they are raised, and it is very probable that a thin
layer of black camphor-smoke would make it difficult to
 distinguish between them. Ordinary wood-charcoal yields a
coat remarkable for its thickness, in which respect it re
sembles electric-light carbon. Black solids and bad con
ductors favour the action by their high surface-temperature.
Repeated heating to redness and cooling in vacuo certainly
produces little, if any, diminution in the thickness of the coat
of electric-light carbon.
    Porous solids moistened with more or less volatile liquids
yield wide coats, and sometimes downward black planes. In
the dust-laden atmosphere they have been observed to give
rise to a partial double coat and two planes. When moistened
with two liquids of different boiling-points, no two distinct
planes and coats were obtainable, although the boundaries of
the observed coat and plane may not have been as distinct as
in the case of a solid in merely smoke-laden air.
   Liquid surfaces are capable of giving rise to dark planes of
great distinctness in the dusty air above them. This may be
well shown by attaching a thin horizontal platinum wire to
the ends of two copper wires passing through the tube of
a funnel, rendered water-tight by means of sealing-wax.
Water is then introduced into the funnel until it is about to
overflow.     Above the surface of the water is the smoke-
laden atmosphere of the box. The platinum wire just beneath
the liquid surface is then warmed by means of a feeble current,
and the light turned on: a clear and distinct plane can then
be distinguished rising from the thin line of warmed liquid.
If the whole liquid surface be allowed to get warm a thick
dark coat is visible above it, and a large columnar dark
plane rises from .the centre.
   Our experience with mica was interesting. The first small
sheet which we tried was placed horizontally in the box with

             neighbourhood of strongly Illuminated Bodies.     225
     magnesic-oxide smoke.       The light revealed little growing
     bushes or trees of aggregating magnesic-oxide particles. The
     mica was evidently electrical. Rubbed sealing-wax acted in a
    similar way, but so did an unrubbed rhomb of Iceland spar to
    a slight extent. We at first thought that the mica might be
    photo-electric like certain crystals observed by Hankel. All
    pieces of mica do not behave in this way. Pressure between
    the finger and thumb, writing upon the surface with a blunt
    point of cork, or with a pencil on a piece of paper laid upon
    the mica, all seem capable of producing the deposition of the
    white dust upon these portions, but in a lesser degree. There
    would seem to be a possible relation between these effects
    and the " Hauchbilder " of Moser (Wiillner, Physik, Bd. i.
    S. 416, Dritte Auflage). Perhaps the removal or moisture-
    condensing nuclei may not be without influence upon the
    correctness of his explanation. The action in the case of
   mica would not, however, seem to be wholly, nor neces
   sarily, electrical, as the following observation would tend to
   show. A Chladni brass plate was casually used by the assis
   tant as a desk upon which to support a piece of paper upon
   which he was writing with a pencil. Upon subsequently
  bowing the plate, after dusting Lycopodium upon it, the
   writing became legible upon the surface of the brass. This
  action of mica is not, so far as we have observed, produced
  by simple heating. With a slab of tourmaline cut perpen
  dicular to the axis from a crystal belonging to Prof. N. Story
  Maskelyne, the effects of heating, cooling, and re-heating
  this pyroelectric crystal by the beam of light were very dis
  tinctly shown. We believe that some such simple and delicate
 method as that here indicated may be of use in the investi
  gation and demonstration of such actions.
      4. Experiments made to ascertain the Effect of Pressure
                         in the Smoky Medium.
     The apparatus for this purpose has already been referred to ;
 it is shown in fig. 9. It could be connected with a water
 air-pump, which reduced the pressure to a few centimetres of
 mercury, or with a large iron cylinder, in which the air was
condensed by pressure of the water-main. The open mercury
manometer indicated a pressure of 4£ atmospheres (in excess
of the atmospheric pressure).
     Tobacco smoke was introduced by slight exhaustion, and
the small rod of electric-light carbon, shown in section in
fig. 9, was heated by the electric-light beam being con
verged upon it. Under an absolute pressure of 5£ atmo
spheres the convection-currents became very slow, the black

226       Messrs. Lodge and Clark on Dusty Air in the
plane wavy and unsteady, whilst the coat was so thin that
only with the aid of the hand-lens could it be traced with
certainty on the side of the carbon directly exposed to the
heat of the lamp. The plane, moreover, was incomplete at
its base—unilateral, a further indication that the coat was
probably wanting on the colder or shadow side of the carbon-
rod. Under a pressure of about 6 centim. the coat was
wider than in air at the barometric pressure. The depen
dence of the thickness of the dust-free coat upon pressure
was well marked; and already some preliminary numerical
determinations have been made, which we hope will shortly
enable us to determine the law of the dependence of the
coat upon pressure with some degree of accuracy. The
following figures for air serve to show that the thickness of
the coat varies at different pressures. They were made with
the apparatus shown in fig. 8.

                       3-9                   -083
   The variation with pressure of course suggests ideas con
nected with the free path of molecules at the surface of the
 body ; but the thickness of the coat is far greater than that
ordinarily reckoned as the length of free path corresponding
 to the pressure.
    The effects of electrification on the dust-free coats and the
examination of electrical actions in dusty air generally were
 preliminarily noted in ' Nature,' July 1883, but the investiga
 tion of them is yet incomplete.
          5. Experiments with different kinds of Smoke.
    We have endeavoured to ascertain whether any of the
 phenomena obviously depend on a drying or on a combustion
 of the smoke-particles. Bearing in mind the very wide coat
 which surrounds an incandescent platinum wire, it seemed to
 ns, even in this case, improbable that dust-particles were often
 burnt up by it, although we are well aware of the ease with
 which finely divided matter will oxidize. Chiefly with this
 object in view, we repeated an experiment adduced by Tyndall
 to show that combustion was a vera causa of the dusWree
 up-streaming air, but we used the incombustible and non
 volatile particles of MgO. For this purpose we have em

             neighbourhood of strongly Illuminated Bodies.      227
    ployed a platinum wire, fig. 6, enclosed in the box fig. 5, and
    ignited by a current from a battery. The appearances are
    unchanged, and the air of the box rapidly clears ; the white
    smoke being deposited upon the cold sides of the box. When
    volatile particles, such as ammonic chloride, are used, a
    thicker coat is observed at high temperatures than with
    magnesic oxide. This is probably in consequence of volatili
    zation ; for at low temperatures, such as 100°, no such differ
    ence is noticeable. When a rod of camphor is examined
    in air laden with magnesic-oxide particles, a dust-free coat
    and plane may be distinguished. But as the camphor gets
    gradually heated it volatilizes and makes the coat on the
    side near the lamp far wider than elsewhere. Hence it would
    appear that the volatilization of the camphor keeps back the
    dust-particles beyond the normal distance. The camphor-
   particles can be distinguished amidst the particles of MgO
   on the boundary of the coat and plane near the light, on
   account of their crystalline sparkling nature.
      What influence the size of the dust-particles exerts upon
   the thickness of the coat has not yet been fully made out
  experimentally.
     6. Experiments on Bodies which themselves give off Smoke.
      We early noticed that a distinction had to be drawn between
  smoke given off from the warm body itself and smoke which
 belonged to the air external to the body. The latter seemed
  to be repelled from the body; the former seemed to come into
  contact with its surface.
     If tobacco-smoke is blown on to an illuminated strip of
 common window-glass, the smoke nearest to its surface hovers
 tenaciously about long after the more distant smoke has dis
 appeared; but a visible dark coat is still found to separate
 the dust from the surface.
     There are many ways of getting a body covered by a layer
 of smoke. One way is to blow it on to its surface through a
capillary tube ; another way is to pass the copper rod through
the axis of a narrow glass tube fixed in a cork at the end
of the box, so that the rod projects into the experimental
glass box (fig. 5), and blow smoke through the tube. The
smoke rushes along the surface of the rod, forming a sort of
tube, but is gently carried away as the rod gets warmer, in
the manner described, showing itself all the time as a white
coat and plane inside the dark coat and plane which separate
and keep back the general dust in the air of the box.
    Another way is to let smoke ooze through holes in the sides
                                   Q2

228        Messrs. Lodge and Clark on Dusty Air in the
of a tube upon which the light is allowed to fall. But the
easiest plan is to use a substance which generates its own
smoke, such as phosphorus. A common stick of phosphorus
in ordinary air produces copious white fumes, which, being
heavy, descend, and when illuminated a white coat and well-
marked descending white plane are seen. The white coat is
very thick, and hence probably it is that no portion of the
black coat or plane is to be seen. If the air in the box is
gradually dried, however, oxidation of the phosphorus so far
diminishes as to enable an observation to be made upon the
phosphorus in the particle-laden air before it again begins to
emit smoke. This reveals the phosphorus surrounded by the
 dark coat and plane. But as the temperature rises the oxi
dation proceeds more rapidly, and the black coat and plane
gradually become more obscure, as the smoke coming from
the surface of the solid enters them.
               7. Experiments on the Settling of Dust.
    Black paper-sheets and metal plates blackened with cam
phor smoke have been arranged in various positions in a box
 full of the white smoke of magnesia. It is observed that
 those which are warm receive barely any deposit of dust, not
 withstanding the large volume of air which has passed near
 them. This is not due to the deposit being blown away.
     Of surfaces at the temperature of the air those seem to
 collect most dust over which the air is the most stagnant;
 the dust has time to settle on flat level surfaces by common
 gravitation unless the motion of the air over them is too
 rapid. Cold surfaces collect a large quantity of smoke, and
 become coated over with a thick white deposit, as if it were
 attracted by the solid. Among cold surfaces rank .all those
 walls of the box which are not directly warmed by the beam
 of light. If warm smoke is blown through a tube on to such
 a surface it adheres very largely, giving a thick local deposit
 opposite the tube.
     Impressions showing the dark plane can be obtained by
 placing glass plates near warm solids in dust-laden air; and
 we have copied such impressions of the dark coat and plane
 on to sensitive paper by ordinary photographic printing *.
                   8. Experiments in different Media.
     (a) Gases.—By far the larger number of our experiments

 (31st Jan.), to have obtained these records upon glass, It is singular how
 closely many of his experiments run with ours.

   hare been conducted in common air, but we considered it
   highly important to observe the behaviour of various dry
   gases of very different density from air, and also to see whether
   any phenomena of the same kind could be detected in liquids.
      With the apparatus shown in fig. 8, and already described,
   we have ascertained that hydrogen gives a much thicker
   coat, and carbonic anhydride a thinner coat, than is obtained
   in air, under conditions which we believe to be fairly com
   parable.
      The figures in the following Table will serve to indicate

    The quantitative portions of this paper are as yet incom
 plete, and we consider the above figures only as indicating the
 differences provisionally. Some gases, moreover, appear to
 vary considerably in their action towards the camphor-smoked
 surface; and, in short, there are obscure conditions which affect
 quantitative results in a way which we do not yet fully
understand.
    (b) Liquids.—The outline of the method employed for the
study of the appearances observed in liquids holding fine
particles in suspension has already been described (fig. 10).
The box is best filled with cold water from which the air has
been expelled by recent boiling, and to which a little ferric
oxide has been added, to render it turbid. When the beam
of the lamp is now converged on to the surface of the empty
brass steam-tube, there is usually to be seen a slightly dust

230      Messrs. Lodge and Clark on Dusty Air in the
free space of liquid beneath the tube. Under the influence of
the beam this becomes thinner, and two dust-free planes rise
from each side of the tube, ultimately meeting upon the top
of the rod, and often at first enclosing particles between them,
as occasionally observed in gases. A dust-free black coat
and plane are then seen, distinct but rather thin. This seems
to be a permanent state so long as these conditions are pre
served unaltered. The convection-currents are fairly well
developed, and the velocity-distribution resembles that de
scribed for a warm solid in dusty air. If now a current of
steam be sent through the brass tube, the convection-currents
become more rapid, and the coat so thin that we are not certain
of its existence. Moreover, the distinctly dust-free black
plane is no longer quite certainly there,* although a casual
observation would probably lead to the conclusion that it was.
A long fine up-streaming layer of liquid, differing from the
surrounding liquid, is distinctly visible, and a very similar
result is obtained from a platinum wire strongly heated by
the passage of an electric current. There is no doubt that
liquids holding small particles in suspension are capable of
giving rise to appearances similar to those described in gases,
and it seems that in a liquid an increase of temperature
occasions a less rapid increase in the thickness of the coat
than is the case with a gas ; or, in other words, the coat is
thinner at high temperatures such as 100° C. than it is at a
lower because the convection-currents have more power to
destroy it.
    Examination of the Hypothetical Explanations already
                            suggested.
   At the commencement of the paper are given all the pro
visional explanations which have been hitherto suggested as
accounting for the dark plane so far as we are aware. The
existence of the coat renders several of them improbable, but
they appear capable of direct disproof, thus :—
   Any centrifugal-force hypothesis is negatived by the points
of inflexion on the stream-lines of fig. 1, and more conclusively
by fig. 2, where the white space between the parallel curved
tones represents in section a hemicy Under of sheet-copper with
its black coats. The convection of the stream-lines is here
such as to whirl the particles into the coat rather than out of
it. The evaporation and combustion hypotheses are dis
proved by the use of a non-volatile and incombustible smoke
like magnesic oxide; also by the phenomena being observable
in liquids.

          neighbourhood of strongly Illuminated Bodies.         231
    There remains only the " distribution " hypothesis of
 Tyndall (originally given Proc. Roy. Inst. 1870, vol. vi. p. 3),
 viz. that the dust lags a little behind the air as it starts off in
 a convection-current. It is not so easy to negative this, and
 in fact in some form or other it is certainly true that the dust
 does get filtered out of the air, being all made to keep out
 side the dark coat, while some of the air passes in. The only
 question is, Why does the dust get driven out of the air in
 this way ? what is there near the surface of a warm body
 which keeps back the dust? A mere lagging behind of the
 dust particles by reason of their extra inertia seems to us a
 quite insufficient statement. The first formation of a coat on
 the surface of a solid before the convection-currents have
  started, and the case of the interior of a glass tube, may be
 adduced as negativing any purely convective explanation :
 the dust-free coat is seen not only on the outside of a tube
 where convection-currents are in full swing, but it is well
 marked also as an internal lining of the tube where the air
 and dust are both stagnant. The internal lining, though
 thick, is of irregular thickness, and has not the sharp boundary
 of the outside coat. The universal effect of convection-
 currents is to sharpen the boundary of the coat, but to thin
it down. This is, indeed, a very important fact, and leads
straight to the conclusion that the formation of the dark coat
is an operation which requires time, though only a very short
time, and that it is possible to carry off a great part of the
coat more quickly than it can be renewed.
                      Suggested Explanations.
    The provisional explanations which have occurred to us as
possible during the course of the investigation have been
very numerous, and have been mostly one after another dis
carded, and only one or two are at all worthy of being here
mentioned.
    One notion which occurred pretty early in the experiment,
if it had held its ground, would have reduced the whole thing
to the merest mechanical phenomenon, just as Dr. Tyndall's
original ingenious explanation (to which, by the way, we were
more than once tempted to revert) or Lord Eayleigh's centri
fugal-force notion would, if true, have deprived the dark
spaces of most of their physical interest. It was in the belief
that something deeper than common mechanical principle
was at the root of the appearances that we were originally
tempted to examine them so closely ; and we are not sorry
that the barbarous simplicity of the notion now to be men
tioned has failed to explain them, though at the same time

232       Messrs. Lodge and Clark on Dusty Air in the
we .still believe it modifies the effects, and that sometimes
notably. We call it the settling hypothesis, and it may be
stated thus :—
   Dust falls through fluids at a pace depending on the size
of the particle and the viscosity of the fluid, but the relative
settling velocity is not affected by the motion of the fluid,
whether horizontal or vertical. We may regard all dust as
constantly settling relatively to the fluid in which it is.
   By so settling, it may leave dust-free spaces.
   Under a horizontal plate, therefore, the dust might settle,
and leave a clear dust-free coat; so it might also perhaps im
mediately under the middle of a round rod; and it is just
conceivable that air from this clear space might get partially
carried up and round the rod by convection-currents no faster
than fresh settling kept on renewing it below.
   It is undeniable that gravitation must assist the formation
of coats on the under surface of plates, and must do its best
to spoil any coat on the top. The action of gravitation in
this way is described in various parts of the paper. It is im
possible, however, for any one witnessing a really good dark
coat under a warm rod, and seeing the rushing-up of the dust
against the dust-free coat, to go away with the notion that
gravitative settling has produced that sharp, definite, and
thick coat against which the up-rushing dust-particles almost
seem to rebound. The idea is irresistibly suggested of some
thing keeping them forcibly off.
   Moreover, suppose a plate to be originally at the tempera
ture of the air: it has no coat. Turn on a powerful light :
a coat instantly forms, and rapidly thickens under the eye
before any convection has time to begin. It looks just as if
the dust were driven out from its surface by some action
which depends upon the temperature.
   Again and again have we been driven to the notion of a
molecular bombardment carried on from the surface of the
body, by which the dust-particles are driven away like the
vanes in Mr. Crookes's radiometer, or like drops in the sphe
roidal condition. But we were unable to take up precisely
this position because of the enormous thickness of the dust-
 free coat as compared with the mean free path of an air-
 molecule at the ordinary pressure.
    We then tried to develop a notion of an extreme free path :
we thought whether the dust-particles might not be so easily
moved that the impact of even a few molecules on their sur
face would be sufficient to drive them back; and we tried to
imagine that, though the great bulk of the flying molecules
only shoot a distance from the surface reckoned in hundred

         neighbourhood of strongly Illuminated Bodies.      233
thousandths of a millimetre, yet a few, say an odd million or
so per second, might escape collision for a distance of even
half a millimetre, and that these might drive back the dust.
The difficulty here would be to see why the boundary of dust
and no-dust is as sharp as it is, though we tried to imagine
that this was caused by the convection-currents, a definite
amount of bombardment being necessary to drive back the
dust when carried towards the surface at a given rate, and
this definite bombardment being found at a definite distance
from the surface. Wo were now fairly landed, by the obser
vations we had made, on some molecular bombardment hypo
thesis or other, while before this we had been searching
among all kinds of mechanical, electrical, and other notions
of a vaguer kind. The necessity for some kind of bombard
ment explanation being thrust upon us, it was not long before
we perceived that no considerations of free path were neces
sary, but that a differential bombardment on the two sides
of a dust-particle would be sufficient to drive it back. In
other words, a dust-particle would move from a region of
greater pressure to a region of less, being urged by a force
depending on the size of the particle and the pressure-
slope.
    Consider a warm flat vertical surface of copper. Adhering
to the surface is a layer of condensed gases with very different
properties from ordinary air, which forms part and parcel of
the body, and constitutes a transition between genuine air on
the one side and unmistakable copper on the other. This layer,
or " Bunsen-schicht," is warmed directly by contact with the
solid, and by molecular diffusion it warms the next outer
layer, which, sending out quick-flying molecules, warms the
next, and so on. Ultimately a stationary state is reached,
and the temperature must fall continuously as we recede from
 the surface, according to some exponential law when convec
 tion-currents are permitted, but otherwise linearly.
    The air-film next the solid is known to cling tightly to the
 solid, and not to be quickly removed. Its adherence need
 not, indeed, be one relating to individual molecules; it may
 be only a statistical one, but its renewal is known to be such
 a slow process that it is very unlikely that it appreciably
 streams upward even when fairly hot. The layer outside this
 streams upward a little, being retarded by viscosity or
 molecular diffusion as it shears itself over the inside layer.
 It in its turn retards the next, and so on, the velocity of up-
 streaming increasing as we go out from the surface. But
 this increase of velocity of successive Layers only goes on to
 a certain limit ; it soon reaches a maximum, because the

234       Messrs. Lodge and Clark on Dusty Air in the
temperature of the successive layers is rapidly decreasing, and
thus they have less tendency to rise although there is now-
very little to prevent them, until at a distance from the solid
the air is at rest.
   There is, then, in all convection-currents from a vertical
surface a layer whose velocity is a maximum ; on either side
of it the velocity is diminishing—on the cool side because the
temperature gets less and less; on the hot side, in spite of the
high temperature, because of the viscosity. The maximum-
velocity layer marks the position of compromise between the
lightening due to temperature and the resistance due to the
neighbourhood of the solid.
   The fact that the convective velocity increases and reaches
a maximum as you recede from the solid, combined with the
fact that the temperature constantly diminishes as you go in
the same direction, seems to us to have an important bearing
on the production of the dust-free space by molecular bom
bardment in a way we will endeavour to explain.
   A mere steady fall or gradient of temperature as one recedes
from a body will not of itself produce the differential bombard
ment necessary to keep back the dnst-particles. For though
it is true that the air is hotter on the side next the body than
it is on the far side, this excess of temperature does not result
in an excess of pressure but in a defect of density. The air
near a warm body is less dense than the air outside, but it is
not at a greater pressure ; at least, if it is, it is a new pheno
menon, and one not to be expected from any known action of
a solid upon gas, except, of course, within the extremely
minute range of the molecular forces estimated by Quincke
at the five-millionth of a millimetre. The warm gas there
fore would produce no greater bombardment on the one side
of the particles than the cold gas produces on the other ;
for though each molecule hits harder and hits oftener, there
are fewer molecules to hit ; and the one effect compensates
the other as soon as a stationary condition as to distribution
of temperature has been attained. Not before ; for so long
as the air near a solid is getting warmer, there is a more rapid
diffusion of molecules outward than there is inward, and till
equilibrium is reached there will certainly be a pressure out
wards from the body sufficient to drive the dust back.
   If the air near a solid can be kept stagnant while the body
is -warmed, the dust in it ought to be driven back at first by
the outward heat-diffusion; but as soon as a stationary tem
perature-condition has been attained, this bombardment ought
to cease, and permit the dust to slowly settle back again if
it likes. This is much the case of the interior of a glass tube,

         neighbourhood of strongly Illuminated Bodies.          235
and, we believe, explains the quick formation of a coat when
the light is first turned on to any surface, and also the reason
why such coats in stagnant air, though broad, are hazy and
indefinite in outline.
    But suppose the air near the body is rapidly changed (in the
case of the tube by blowing through it, or by convection- cur
rents in ordinary cases), the stationary state never is reached,
the air outside the body is always getting warmed, and the bom
bardment may always continue. The function of the convec
tion-currents, then, is to prevent the arrival of the stationary
state, and so to perpetuate the dust-repelling bombardment, at
the same time that they sweep off some of the already cleansed
air and bring up dusty air at such a rate that the bombard
ment has as much as it can do to keep a layer clear. The
coat therefore tends to become thinner when convection-
currents increase ; and if currents are unfairly produced (as
by blowing), the coat may be swept away faster than it can
be renewed, and so wholly disappear. But if excess of tem
perature only is the cause of the currents, then the same cause
 which strengthens them also assists the bombardment, and
 accordingly the coat is not swept off by such currents, but
 may even become thicker as the temperature rises. At the
 same time it is not to be expected that small differences of
 temperature will much affect the coat, because of the com
 pensation action already explained. Moreover, we have at
 present no theoretical guarantee that a rise of temperature
 need thicken the coat ; it might thin it in some media. All
 we can say is, that convection-currents have a double action,
 both helping the formation, and causing the removal, of the
 coat.
    But now, how does the fact of an increasing upward velocity
 of the air as we go through successive layers from the surface
 of a body account for the differential bombardment or greater
 internal pressure necessary to account for the driving back of
 the dust ? Without technicalities, we answer this question as
 follows :—Consider a vertical flat plate at a higher tempe
 rature than the air. We grant that the total pressure of the
 air is the same near a warm solid as it is anywhere else ; that
 is, the average mean square of molecular velocity is simply
 proportional to the temperature ; but then the average mean
  square of velocity can be resolved into three components—
  normal to the surface, parallel to the surface and horizontal,
  and parallel to the surface and vertical. If the air were at
  rest, all three components would be equal ; but in any given
  layer the air is not at rest, it is up-streaming : consequently the
  vertical component of velocity is greater than tho average, and

 236       Messrs. Lodge and Clark on Dusty Air in tlie
 so some other component must be less. The horizontal com
 ponent of velocity parallel to the surface we naturally assume
 to be simply the average. The component normal to the sur
 face must therefore be less than the siverage. In other words,
 though the total pressure is the same in all directions, its
 vertical component in the case of up- or down-streaming air is
 greater, and hence the normal component is less; and the
 amount by which the normal component of the pressure is less
 than the average at any given distance from the body depends
 upon the velocity of the convection-current at that place.
    But the current-velocity increases as we go from the body
 to a maximum, and then decreases : consequently the normal
 component of the pressure, starting from its average value
 close to the surface, decreases as far as the maximum-velocity
layer, where it reaches a minimum, and then increases. It
 is this differential normal pressure from the surface which
the dust-particles feel, and they are driven back towards the
maximum-velocity layer. They may not, indeed, be driven
quite to it, because there must be a compromise between the
rate at which dust is carried past the surface and the distance
to which the differential bombardment has time to drive them
through the air.
    It is easy to see that any differential bombardment will be
simply proportional to the volume of the particles, provided
their thickness is small ; hence the behaviour of big particles
relatively to small ones will be like their settling behaviour
under gravitation.
   Putting the matter in symbols, let us call the plane
of the solid yz, y being vertical ; and let u, v, w be
the three component velocities along x, y, z respec
tively, and T the absolute temperature; and let=
signify proportion only when convenient : then
                        «J + »s+ws=3T.
But at a distance x from the surface let the convection up-
streaming velocity be <f>, and let the velocity along z be the
average: then
                               w,2=T,
and
                           V* = w1 + <f>2;
SO
   Hence u decreases as       increases, and there is accordingly

           neighbourhood of strongly Illuminated Bodies.      237
  a bombardment up towards the maximum-velocity layer from
  either side.
     Calling the three components of the pressure px, p3 pt) it
  can be shown that
                   P*=PU<1>
  and              pt=pur'=p, the proper pressure of the gas.
  Hence
                     =p-pp=p(l-$P)l
  and ^2?, which determines the intensity of the differential
 molecular bombardment per unit distance along the normal
 to the surface, is proportional to the original pressure and to
                         J2
 the rate of change of ^.
    Remember that <b is the up-streaming velocity, and T the
 temperature, of the different layers. In a region where <p is
 increasing and T is decreasing, the differential bombardment is
 considerable, and it acts in the direction of increasing <f>. In
 a region where <b and T are both increasing or both decreasing
 the bombardment is likely to be feeble, and may be nil if <f>
 varies with the root of T.
    Now outside a warm plate we have near the surface <f> in
 creasing and T decreasing as you go outwards : consequently
here is an outward bombardment. Further on both are de
creasing, so the bombardment is feeble or nil, and one cannot
say without farther consideration which way, if any, it ought
to act.
    Close to the surface of a cold body proceeding outwards
is increasing, but T is also increasing : consequently there is
here feeble bombardment. Further on <j> is decreasing and T
still increasing ; consequently here is a bombardment inward
towards the body.
    Representing these things diagrammatically, the arrow re
presents the direction of the bombardment when it is decided,
the dotted line the maximum-velocity layers :—

    Surface.                            Surface.
   Now, the conductivity of a gas for heat, and the viscosity
which resists its own motion, are each of the nature of a
diffusion or interchange of molecules ; and, as shown in
 Maxwell's 'Heat,' the three things—the diffusivity,the conduc
tivity, and the effective (or " kinematic ") viscosity, are all
proportional to one another, and vary directly with the square
of the absolute temperature, and inversely as the pressure.
   Returning to the warm solid, with its up-streaming air-
currents and maximum-velocity layer towards which dust is
bombarded from the surface, it is evident that a rise in the tem
perature of the solid would throw this layer further out from
its surface (and so thicken the dust-free coat), both because
the conductivity of the gas improves, and because its viscosity
near the surface increases with temperature. A fall of tem
perature, on the other hand, would throw the maximum-
velocity layer inwards, until, when the solid was colder than
the air, the maximum down-streaming layer might be very
close to the surface, because its viscosity would be least there,
and because the conductivity of the gas would then be so poor.
(N.B. We never assume that the dusty air is warmed by
radiation from the solid, because the far more powerful elec
tric-light radiation produces no particular effect on the dust
except in the neighbourhood of bodies.) The effect of an
increased pressure would be to diminish both the conductivity
and the viscosity in the same proportion ; and so for both
reasons it would throw the maximum-velocity layer inwards,
in fact it would act like cold. Rarefaction of the air would
act like an increase of temperature.
   Hydrogen has a higher conductivity and viscosity than air,
consequently its maximum-velocity layer should be further
from the surface of the warm solid exciting the currents. Car

bonic acid, on the other hand, should act in the opposite
direction.
    Very little is known about the properties of liquids, but
their kinematic viscosity is known to be less than that of
gases, and it is supposed to decrease with a rise of temperature
(Wullner, Bd. I. S. 326, Flow of liquids through tubes at dif
ferent temperatures). Hence it may be guessed that the
maximum-velocity layer in liquids should be much nearer the
surface of the solid causing the currents than in gases, and that
a rise of temperature would bring it still nearer. On the other
hand, it may be expected that cold would drive it further off
the solid, so that any phenomena connected with this layer in
liquids might be better developed in descending cold currents
than in ascending warm ones.
    In conclusion, the writers wish to call attention to a paper
 read to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, by Mr. John Aitken,
on the 21st of January this year, and of which an abstract ap
peared in ' Nature ' of the 31st January last. Judging from
the abstract, it would appear that Mr. Aitken, so well known
for his previous researches on dust-particles as nuclei, has
 been travelling over much of the same ground as we have,
 and that he has arrived on the whole at similar conclusions.

 The Elements of Plane Geometry : Part I. (corresponding to Euclid,
    Books I.-1L). Prepared by the Committee appointed by the Asso
    ciation (for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching). London :
    W. Swan Sonnenschein, 1884 (pp. 138).
   A BECENT Presidential utterance on the teaehingof Mathematics
        in England asserts that " the teaehingof Geometry especially,
 as judged by the text-books which have come before me, is somewhat
 deplorable. And this is so, principally, because the spirit of Euclid
 and the methods of the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, rather than
 the fundamentally different ideas and methods of modern Geometry,
 still rule supreme."
     The same elegant geometer goes on to Bay that, " when the
 Syllabus on the Elements of Plane Geometry appeared, I resolved to
 give it a thorough trial, and took the best means in my power to
  form an opinion on its merits, by introducing it into one of my
  classes. The fact that it did not quite satisfy me, and that I gave
  up its use again, does not, of course, prove that it fails also for use
  in schools, for which it was originally intended." This, we would
  fain think, is just the point. The writer above quoted has himself
  written a beautiful ' Elements of Geometry,' which we dare say

  240                Notices respecting New Books.
  no English mathematical master has as yet ventured to teach to
 any class of school-boys, but we would not on that account brand
 the little work referred to as a failure; on the contrary, we pro
  nounce it to be a most suggestive book for teachers, and possibly
 for students who have left school-days far behind. The book under
 notice was brought into existence as a Syllabus by an Association of
 Mathematical teachers, and has been nurtured by them until its suc
 cess in its original form as a means of getting geometrical ideas into
 the heads of junior pupils has been such as to lead to the demand for
 the clothing of the bare bones of a Syllabus in the present decent
 garb in which these ' Elements ' now appear.
    We fear that this latest form, however, will be no more accept
 able to our critic than the antecedent forms, and that he will still
 pronounce upon the Association's work the dictum, " the result is
 not as satisfactory as might have been wished." Certainly " there
 is very little of the influence of modern ideas to be found " here,
 and " for modern methods one looks in vain." Deluded mathe
 matical teachers ! who still prefer " stare super antiquas vias," why
 do you not burst the Cantabrigian bonds and be willing " jurare in
 verba magistri,"—that master, of course, being Steiner? The
 age is not ripe, we fear, for such teaching. Our own experience,
 which dates from the consulship of Plancus, is that one or two in
 a hundred pupils might appreciate the high Alps of the modern
 methods, but the rest must be kept down to the lower pastures.
 " Faithful are the wounds of a friend ! " and that our Critic is a
 friend is clear from his parting words. " Nevertheless, it is satis
 factory to see that the use of the Syllabus on Plane Geometry has
 spread pretty widely, and it is to be hoped that it will continue to
 do so. A thorough reform, in the direction indicated, will be a
 difficult task, and it will perhaps be a long time before it is pos
 sible." Much will be done by the work he himself is doing in our
 midst. Now a word or two on the book itself. We have read
 from Theorem ii. to the end with much interest. Into a well-worn
subject the Committee have infused much freshness of treatment ;
the arrangement appears to us excellent ; and the collection of
 Exercises admirably chosen. All these opinions are formed with
reference to the purpose for which the work has been drawn up.
For advanced pupils the exercises would in many cases be too ele
mentary ; but for the ordinary members of our classes they are
capitally graduated, and many a boy ought to be lured on by the
ability of getting out " riders " for himself. We have always hesi
tated over Theorem i., which is, " All right angles are equal to one
another." The compilers, doubtless after some considerable debate,
have gone in for a long proof of this, instead of getting it from the
Obs. to def. 10, " A straight angle is equal to two right angles."
But this is a point of no great importance, as any teacher is free to
substitute a proof founded on the " Obs.," or any other proof, for
the one in the text. The rest, as we have implied, goes off most
trippingly. We venture upon a few remarks upon the definitions.

It would be a matter of very considerable difficulty, if not an
absolute impossibility, to put one's hand on any other book which
contains, bulk for bulk, such a vast amount of valuable information
as is comprised in this yearly issue of the Bureau des Longitudes.
The astronomer, the geographer, and the statistician will here
find an abundance of material carefully reproduced, for the most
part, in a tabular form. Nor will the chemist find that his wants
have been by any means neglected.
   In the Astronomical portion of the work, besides the usual
Ephemerides and Elements of the Sun, Moon, and Planets,
Schonfeld's Catalogue, supplemented by more recent discoveries,
has furnished the Editor with the means of computing the epochs
of the maxima and minima of those Variable Stars whose periods
are known. Of 130 of these the Eight Ascensions, Declinations,
and Magnitudes are tabulated, while the same information is given
 concerning 186 whose periods have not yet been determined. The
Elements of the Minor Planets have been brought well up to date,
the last in the tables being No. 234, which was discovered on
August 12, 1883. Those who have anything to do with Cometo-
graphy will be grateful to the Editor for inserting, as he has done
now for the last two or three years, a complete list of all the comets
that have appeared from 1801 onwards; the last noticed being
Barnard's, which reckons as Comet III. 1882. We observe that the
comet supposed to have been seen by the same observer on March 1 6",
1882, is called Comet a of that year, although astronomers have
almost unanimously agreed to give that title to Wells's comet, known
as Comet I. 1882. The most approved Elements are given, as well
as a concise description of the discovery and peculiarities of each.
There is hardly any work on the subject, or periodical of any
scientific pretensions, or the Eeport of any Observatory, that has
not been laid under contribution in order to render this section
of the work as complete as possible. A new feature in this year's
Annuaire is the introduction of a table of the positions of the
Radiant Points of some of the principal Meteor-showers. The
information here given is very meagre, and it is (o be hoped that
in future years the Editor will be able to spare sufficient space to
give the Radiant Points of more than nine showers. The researches
of de Koukoly, de Kiiveligethv, Denning, and others will easily

   Many pages are devoted to particulars of the Paris Mint and to
tables of the value of French money as compared with that of other
countries. The geographer and statistician will find ample infor
mation concerning the population and area of every country in the
 world ; details respecting European countries, particularly France,
 being most abundant. M. Marie-Davy contributes some valuable
particulars, together with a map, of terrestrial magnetism. A large
number of useful tables concerning gases, solids, and liquids
concludes this portion of the work. M. Faye presents us with an
 Essay on Famines, Earthquakes, Deluges, and other Scourges of
Nature. In speaking of famines, he alludes to the supposed
connection, which we in England have heard so much of during
the last few years, between the years of a maximum of sunspots
and of excessive rainfall in India, and to that between the minimum
of spots and an extraordinary number of bankruptcies in London.
M. Faye amusingly traces the connection of all these :—many sun-
spots cause much heat and this brings much rain, which causes
abundant rice-crops, therefore the heart of the Hindoo rejoices and
he issues many orders for cotton goods from England, therefore
is English trade prosperous during the years of maxima, and,
inferentially, unsuccessful at the opposite period. An easy
confutation of this fallacious proposition lies in the fact that
during a year of maximum sunspots the mean temperature in Java
exceeded that of a minimum year by only "1° C. By taking the
rainfall at Madras from 1830 to 1870, M. Faye shows conclusively
that the connection between maxima or minima of sunspots and
excessive rainfall or drought is purely imaginary. The final portion
of this valuable work is devoted to the Report of the French Expe
dition sent to Caroline Island to observe the Eclipse of the Sun
of May 6, 1883. It is accompanied by an untouched photograph
of the sun, which shows well both the inner and the outer corona.
The chief results of the expedition were the observation of
M. Tacchini, showing the analogy between the spectrum of certain
parts of the corona and that of comets ; and the proof by MM.
Falisa and Holden of the non-existence, or at any rate the non-
visibility, of an Intra-Mercurial planet.

   Clark, M.I.C.E. Npon: London and New York (pp.fi/).
Mr. Clark has taken out patents for two new forms of the Transit
Instrument, and is naturally anxious to bring them before the

                    Notices respecting ATeiv Booh.
  public, and what better way of doing so could there be than by
  writing a short treatise on the use of the instrument ? In
  observatories the astronomer looks upon his transit as the only
  means at his disposal of ensuring that correctness of time without
  which all his observations would be valueless. The price of the
  instrument is now so reduced as to bring it within the reach of all
  who are anxious to attempt the feat of keeping all the watches and
  clocks in their houses in accordance with Greenwich time, even if
 they resemble the immortal Captain Cuttle's watch. In the general
 description of the instrument, the directions given for the use of
 the striding level, in which we are told to file away a little brass
  " from the higher end" of something or other, are, to say the least,
 a little vague. Nor is the description of the use of the vernier
 couched in such language as to make its meaning at all clear. Eye
 and ear observations are always difficult, but this difficulty is surely
 much increased when we have to count the ticks of the same watch
 with which we are noting the time of transit. We have never
 tried the method recommended for obviating the roughness or want
 of level of a pillar by the use of a greased sheet of glass, on the
 surface of which " the iustrument slides freely," and which is to be
 levelled by means of " a little pool of water and two or three small
 wooden wedges," but we should imagine that its adoption might
 possibly lead to the necessity of purchasing a second instrument
from the maker. There are, however, many useful points in the
book. The Tables, which are published annually, will doubtless
be highly esteemed by those amateurs who possess a transit
instrument, but are not disposed to wade through the calculations
involved in the use of the Nautical Almanac, from which the
contents of the present little volume are computed. For every day
in the year we have the Greenwich Mean Time of Transit (as well
as the Altitude) of the Sun and of various suitably situated Stars
to "01 of a second ; while for alternate days that of the transit of
each of the chief planets is tabulated to the nearest minute. There
are also clear directions how to fix the transit instrument, and how
to find Greenwich or local time in any part of the world. In what
Mr. Clark calls his "Improved Window Transit" we have a new
and handy form of the instrument, which obviates the use of the
diagonal eye-piece, and, we should think, renders the taking of a
transit a much easier process than with the usual form. To
residents in country places, far away from a trustworthy clock, the
use of these tables and one of the author's instruments will save
much vexation and the loss of many a train.
Oeneral Index to the First Twenty Volumes ofthe AstronomicalRegister.
    By F. W. Levander, F.R.A.S. London: Alabaster, Passmore
    and Sons, 1883 (pp. 82).
It goes without saying that such a work as this must be very
useful to a very large class of readers : even the non-astronomical
reader is interested in it. He might wish to learn how (Lord)

244            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
Tennyson poses as an astronomer, but would not care to turn
over the indices of some twenty volumes to arrive at what he
wants. Here, oup. 73, he will flnd a reference to vol. xii. p. 92.
This is no perfunctory performance. Mr. Levander is not content
with reproducing the several Indices referred to, but having found
some of them " to be not quite so complete as they ought to have
been, and also to contain some typographical errors," he has carefully
gone through the whole of the 6000 pages and attempted to make
his list as complete as possible. It is only by frequent use that mis
takes, if they exist, can be run to earth. In the great majority of
cases much valuable time will be saved to the possessor of this
handy book. AVe have detected the few following typographical
slips : Sir Isaac Newton figures twice as J. Newton ; Isaac Tod-
hunter as J. Todhunter ; W. llowau Hamilton as R. W. H. (p. 44) ;
Q. M. Seabroke (p 79) should be " Seabrooke ": and Sir E. Beckett
is printed (p. 53) Becket. These are all trival matters, but even
such are likely to vex the soul of such a careful worker as our com
piler evidently is. Perhaps it was imperative to keep strictly to
 the instructions of the brief, but now and then one could wish for
 a little explanation, as in the case of " Mrs. Somerville, new work
 by " (p. 63) and one or two similar entries.

   on rainbows and glomes.           by john tyndall, ll.d., f.r.8.
       Dear Francis,
 "V170ULD you permit me to add the following observation to
   * * what I have already communicated to you regarding rain
 bows ?
     Some time ago I had sent to me, to Hind Head, the compressed
 gases and other appliances necessary for the production of the
 lime-light. On the night of Saturday, February 9th, I sent its
  beam athwart one of the wildest storms that I have known. Fog
  and driving rain filled the atmosphere. Standing in the beam, my
  dark shadow was cast at a distance on the fog, and round the beam
  were the zones of colour characteristic of the spectre of the Brocken.
  A white circular rainbow, encompassing the beam, though far
  removed from it in the darkness, was seen at the same time. A
  glance at the plate in Ulloa's work will show that I had before me,
  produced artificially, the exact phenomena described by him. The
  plane of the white rainbow, however, was, to all appearance, much
  nearer to me than the glory which surrounded the shadow of my
  head.                                      Yours faithfully,
                                                         John Tindall.

         ELEVATION OF LAND DURING THE GLACIAL PERIOD.
   [We have been requested by Prof. Dana to insert the following
Note in order to correct any wrong impression that might possibly
be formed by the reader from the statement of Dr. Croll on page 93
of our last Number. —Eds.]
   The opinion advocated formerly, and now, by Mr. Dana is that
the more northern lands (or, in later papers, portions of northern
lands) were more elevated than now during the era of increasing
and maximum ice, or the era distinguished by him as the Glacial
period ; that this era was followed, both in America and Europe, by
a subsidence of the same land initiating the Champlain period, and
 that this was the era of melting, and of the spreading of mammals
northward, an impossible occurrence in America during the Glacial
era ; that another era of ice of much less extent occurred subse
quently in Europe, if not also in North America, probably com
mencing with the epoch of the change in the land to its present
level, and that this was the occasion of the destruction of the mam
 mals of North Siberia, and other faunal changes. The evidences
 believed to favour these conclusions are stated in his various papers
 and his ' Manual of Geology,' and need not be here repeated. The
 latest discussion by him of the facts from Eastern North America
 as to the Champlain subsidence is contained in the ' American
 Journal of Science' for 1882.
    Mr. Dana's opinion as to the fact of an elevation of northern
 lands in the Glacial era (that is, the era as he defines it) was a con
 clusion front facts that had been observed in Europe and America,
 and not a supposition suggested by, or thought to be sustained by,
 any theory as to the cause of the elevation. The era of maximum
 ice he has always supposed to be that of maximum or nearly
 maximum cold ; and the Champlain era, following, an interglacial
 era (for Europe at least) of milder climate, in which the Mammoth
 and the associated mammals and other species of life, animal and
 vegetable, of the colder temperate and temperate latitudes, reached
 their furthest northern limit.
 ON THE CAUSES OF THE PRODUCTION OF ATMOSPHERIC ELEC
    TRICITY IN GENERAL, IN STORMS, AND IN HEAT LIGHTNING.
    BT M. DE TROMEL1N.
     In seeking in nature for causes capable of producing electricity,
  1 have been led to assume in the first case the friction of moist or
  dry air against the surface of the earth or of the seas.
    Every one knows Armstrong's hydro-electrical machine. When
  the steam emerges from the boiler, the latter is charged negatively

246           Intelligence and ifmcelluneom Articles.
while the steam is positive. In the machine there is a box full of
water to cool the tubes through which the steam emerges. Hence
before the steain escapes it begins to condense, and thus passes out
mixed with vesicles of water. This is a necessary condition.
   According to Faraday's experiments the passage of dry steam or
of a current of dry air does not liberate electricity, while a current
of moist air gives the same result as Armstrong's machine, but to a
less extent. M. Spring, it is true, found that the friction of dry air
against a copper sphere gave a little electricity, but a quantity far
less than in Faraday's experiment. On the other hand, it has been
Bhown by numerous experiments that the mere evaporation of
water, even when acidulated, does not produce electricity. But in
evaporation produced by wind there is friction, and in this mecha
nical work the desired cause is to be sought.
   The wiud in grazing the surface of the sea carries with it the
aqueous particles of the crest of the waves, which here play the
part of the comb in Armstrong's machine. The roughnesses on
the surface of the soil play the same part when a moist wind
blows over them. These particles of water retain their electricity,
and rising in the atmosphere form clouds, and as electricity passes
to the surface of bodies, they tend to spread over the highest atmo
spheric surfaces ; and I hold, with M. Faye, that the cirrus must
retain great part of this electricity.
   That being admitted, it may be conceived that a cloud is elec
trified if formed in the conditions just cited. It would not be the
case with a cloud formed by mere vapours rising in the air in the
morning.
   But to produce lightning there must be a discharge between the
cloud and another point, the earth or cloud, such that the dif
ference of potential between the point and the cloud, at the
moment in question, is sufficient to produce the lightning.
   But the distance across which the spark passes depends on" the
electric pressure and on the mechanical resistance which the medium
presents to the discharge. This pressure varies with the square
of the potential of the cloud, its form, its surface, the charge of
the cloud, and its distance from the point in question.
   But the potential energy of a cloud depends on its form, its
surface, and its temperature. "When this cloud originally elec
trified undergoes any change whatever (condensation, congelation
of aqueous vesicles, &c.), it absorbs a certain amount of energy,
which should be found in the form of an increase of potential
energy.
   This consequence results from the principle of the conservation
of energy, and from Carnot's principle, from which Lippmann has
deduced such remarkable results.
   If, then, we suppose that the charge of the cloud remains con
stant for a certain time, condensation or lowering of temperature
will increase the potential of the mass.
   During a storm, it is very exceptional when there are no elec
trical manifestations. The abundant condensation then observed is

                  Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.               247
    the cause of an increase of potential of the storm-cloud, and when
    this potential is sufficient, discharge takes place in the form of
   lightning. Moreover, the continual renewal of the charge indicates
   that the cause must reside in the storms themselves.
       Air being a dielectric, the vapour becomes the natural reservoir
   of the electricity. Imagine a mass of electrified aqueous vapour in
   suspension in the air : at night, when the sun has disappeared,
   there will be a cooling of the cloud-mass. For the reason above
    given its potential will increase.
       Now if the potential readies a certain extent, the vesicles considered
   separately can no longer retain their charge—that is to say, they will
    escape into the air in the form of silent discharges.
       It is calculated that, at the ordinary pressure, a small sphere,
    0-6 millim. in diameter, cannot retain electricity at the potential
   obtained with our ordinary machines.
       From the small radius of the vesicles it will be seen that a cloud
   cannot retain a charge at a potential exceeeding a certain amount.
   In this way would be produced the phenomenon known as heat
   lightning.
      As these lightning flashes are seen by different observers in the
   horizon, it is logical to suppose that they are also produced at the
  zenith, and that they are not the reflections of the lightning due to
  storms at a distance. A similar phenomenon occurs with a
  traveller who always sees a laver of fog towards the horizon, while
  the sky above is clear. This is only due to a different thickness
  of the layers traversed by the visual rays.— Comptes Rendus,
  Jan. 28, i884.
                NOTE ON THE TEMPERATURE OF SUN-SPOTS.
                      BY PROF. EILHARD WIEDEMANN*.
      Messrs. Liveing and Dewar, in one part of their very interesting
 paper (Phil. Mag. vol. xvi. p. 402), have endeavoured to show that
  the temperature of the sun-spots may be higher than that of the
 surrounding surface of the sun, although their thermal and chemical
 effects are much less. The authors are of the opinion that the
 intensity of the total radiation from the spots may be much larger
 than that from the rest of the surface, containing a greater propor
tion of violet and ultra-violet rays which are absorbed at the border
 of our atmosphere. In these conclusions I cannot agree with them.
In increasing the temperature of a luminous source it is true that
the intensity of the more-refrangible part of the spectrum increases
more rapidly than that of the less-refrangible part ; but, never
theless, the intensity of the latter does increase ; so that, of two
sources of different temperature, the hotter emits in every part of
the spectrum more light than the colder, at least as long as the
spectrum is continuous.
                         * Communicated by the Author.

248            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   We may conceive the emission of light, of different wave
lengths as the temperature rises, to proceed from the increase of
the small vibrations which produce the less-refrangible rays of the
infra-red. In this way we could imagine that, by heating a body,
every radiation which it gives out would be shifted toward the blue.
If the extension of the spectrum in infra-red were limited, it might
happen that the entire light given out would be confined, in case
of a solid body, to a larger or smaller band in the spectrum, and
that at very high temperatures the whole light would be present
only in the most-refrangible part*.
   Now we know that the spectrum is most extended in the infra
red, and that even in the sources of highest temperature it has a
very large extent, as shown by Langley, Abney, H. Becquerel, and
others ; so that the deductions of the above-mentioned authors
cannot be quite exact.

      NEW SOLENOIDAL GALVANOMETER. BY E. BOTTCHER.
   A soft iron cylinder, 1 to 1-5 centim. in thickness and 20 centim.
in length, is freely suspended by a thread to a spring balance, so
that one half just projects from a solenoidal spiral rigidly fixed to
the stand of the spring balance. By means of the current which
traverses the spiral the iron core is raised more or less ; and the
index of the spring balance shows first the weight of the iron core,
and then the strength of current. The instrument is thus an elec
tromagnetic one, with the use of elasticity as a measuring-power.
One use of this simple instrument is that it can bear pretty violent
shocks, and is therefore suited for somewhat rough usage. As
regards the graduation of the instrument, the author observes that
within certain limits it may be rationally divided ; and he has given
the results of these investigations in the form of a table, and ex
plained it by a diagram. If the iron core is drawn to £ or £ of its
whole length within the spiral, one observation is sufficient for the
graduation within these limits, to deduce the other current-strengths
in respect of the pull they exert : for, according to the above inves
tigation, the latter is proportional to the square of the current-
strength, and moreover increases by about 2 per cent, for each
centimetre of the rising or sinking core.— Centrdlblatt f. Electro-
technik, v. p. 620 ; Beiblatter der Physih, viii. p. 48.
  • In this reasoning there is not taken into account the fact that in these
very constrained movements, as in solids or in very dense gases, beside
the vibrations of high there must also be those of low refrangibility.

   XXIX. On some Experiments illustrating an Explanation of
     Hall's Phenomenon. By Shelford Bidwell, M.A., LL.B.*
                               [Plate XI.]
   IN a recent communication to the Royal Society I attempted
        to show that the apparent action of a magnet upon an
   electric current (well known as Hall's Phenomenon) might
   be completely explained by the operation of mechanical strain
   and certain Peltier effects.
      My experimental acquaintance with the subject began in
  July 1883, and I have since devoted a considerable amount
  of attention to it. But the paper referred to contained only
  a bald and simple statement of the results at which I finally
  arrived, little or nothing being added by way of comment or
  explanation. To my mind, saturated as it was with the matter,
  it appeared that such a statement afforded in itself over
 whelming evidence in favour of the views which I had been
  led to adopt ; and I believed that when once set forth, how
 ever briefly, they could not fail to meet with immediate
 acceptance. But Hall's own theory of the phenomenon has
 for some years been universally recognized as interpreting a
 well-established law of nature. It seemed to be in complete
harmony with the views of Clerk Maxwell as to the existence
of a rotatory coefficient of resistance : it has provided a field
for investigation to mathematicians of the highest eminence;
and it has derived additional interest and importance from
the fact that it was believed to point to an intimate relation

 250         Mr. S. Bidwell's Experiments illustrating
 between electricity and light. Under the circumstances, it is
 reasonable that such a theory should not be abandoned with
 out the exercise of very considerable caution.
    I propose therefore in this paper to treat the subject in
 greater detail than at first seemed necessary. Attention will
 be directed to facts and arguments which in my former paper
 were left altogether unnoticed ; and those points which, as I
 have gathered from conversation and correspondence, seem to
 present the greatest difficulty, will be considered at some
 length. With regard to the experiments upon which I rely,
 such of them as are new are of a very simple character, and
 can easily be repeated by any one possessing a reflecting gal
 vanometer. They are of course of a somewhat delicate nature,
 and more suitable for the laboratory than for public demon
 stration ; but I shall be bold enougn to attempt the perform
 ance of most of them in the presence of the members of the
 Physical Society.
   Mr. Hall's first paper on the subject appeared in Silliman's
 Journal in 1879, and is reproduced in the ' Philosophical
 Magazine ' for March 1880. After stating that his object was
to prove that the current of electricity in a fixed conductor is
acted upon by a magnet, he describes the following experi
ment :—A strip of gold-leaf, forming part of a circuit, was
placed between the poles of an electromagnet, cutting the lines
of force perpendicularly. The terminals of a galvanometer
were applied to opposite edges of the gold-leaf, and moved
about until two equipotential points were found. The magnet
was then excited, and a galvanometer-deflection immediately
occurred. This deflection was too large to be attributed to
the direct action of the magnet upon the galvanometer-needle.
It was permanent, and so not due to induction. It was
reversed when the magnet was reversed. " In short," says
Mr. Hall, "the phenomena observed were just such as we
should expect to see if the electric current were pressed, but
not moved, toward one side of the conductor. In regard to
the direction of this pressure, as dependent on the direction of
the current in the gold-leaf and the direction of the lines of
magnetic force, the following statement may be made :—If
we regard an electric current as a single stream flowing from
the carbon pole of the battery through the circuit to the zinc
pole, the phenomena indicate that two currents in the same
direction tend to repel each other. But if we regard the cur
rent as a stream flowing from negative to positive, then the
phenomena indicate that two currents in the same direction
attract each other/' The meaning of this is, as appears from
subsequent papers, that the direction of the transverse current

              an Explanation of Hall's Phenomenon.           251
across the gold-leaf is opposite to that in which the gold-leaf
itself would move across the lines of force if it were free to do
so. If the two points to which the galvanometer is connected
are joined by an equipotential line across the gold-loaf, the
effect caused by magnetization may be expressed by saying
that the equipotential line is rotated in a direction opposite to
that of the current circulating in the coils of the electro
magnet.
    A second paper was published in the ' Philosophical Maga
zine' for November 1880, in which were described experiments
made with other metals in addition to gold. With silver,
nickel, tin, and platinum the direction of the transverse effect
was the same as with gold, though it differed in degree in the
case of every metal. But with iron the direction of the trans
verse current was found to be reversed; a fact which Mr. Hall
was naturally inclined to attribute to the magnetic properties
of that metal, though he was at a loss to account for the differ
ence between its behaviour and that of nickel, which is also
strongly magnetic. In iron, therefore, the equipotential lines
are rotated in the same direction as that of the current circu
lating in the coils of the electromagnet.
    In a third paper, published in the ' Philosophical Magazine '
 for September 1881, the author says that the direction of the
 transverse electromotive force in the magnetic metal cobalt
                                                            E' .
 was the same as in iron. In this paper it is stated that y is
 probably a constant for any given metal ; E' being the trans
 verse electromotive force per centimetre of the width of the
 strip, and V the direct current divided by the section of the
                               E' .
 conductor. This quantity y- is called, in accordance with a
 suggestion of Dr. Hopkinson, the " rotational coefficient " of
 the metal. The direction of the transverse effect or sign of the
 rotational coefficient is in iron and metals which behave like
 iron called +, because its direction is that which the con
  ductor itself bearing the current would follow if free to move
 across the lines of magnetic force. In gold and similar metals
 the sign of the rotational coefficient is called — .
     A fourth paper appeared in the ' Philosophical Magazine '
  for May 1883, entitled " Rotational Coefficients of various
  Metals," in which it is stated that aluminium, copper, and
 brass behave in the same manner as gold, that zinc behaves
 like iron, and that with lead no transverse effect whatever is
 produced.
     Collecting Mr. Hall's various results, we find that, of the
                                 S2

252         Mr. S. Bidwell's Experiments illustrating
thirteen different metals which he has tested, three (iron,
cobalt, and zinc) are classed as positive ; nine (gold, silver,
tin, copper, brass, platinum, nickel, aluminium, and magne
sium) are negative ; and one (lead) shows no signs of
rotation.
    I began a repetition of Hall's experiments with the object,
if possible, of carrying them further, and especially of estab
lishing in a satisfactory manner the existence of a connexion
between the phenomena in question and the magnetic rotation
of the plane of polarized light. My earlier experiments were
made with iron, of which I happened to possess a suitable
specimen in the form of foil '019 millim. thick. The magnet
used consisted of a bar of soft iron, 38 millim. in diameter,
bent into horseshoe shape ; if pulled out straight its length
would be about 50 centim. It was covered with about 600
turns of wire, 2 millim. in diameter; the pole-pieces used were
30 millim. square, with flat ends, and were generally fixed
about 6 millim. apart. The magnet was excited by a battery
of either seven Grove's or, more generally, of five 3-quart
bichromate cells.
   The arrangement of the apparatus is shown in fig. 1
(Plate XI.), where P P' is the strip of metal cemented to a
plate of glass, and placed above one pole, S, of the electro
magnet ; M is a section of the yoke of the electromagnet ;
B is a battery of one or two cells, generating the current
through the strip ; C a commutator to reverse the direction
of the current ; B' the electromagnet battery ; C a commu
tator to reverse the magnetism ; W W wires from equipoten-
tial points in the metallic strip to the galvanometer G ; K a
key in the galvanometer circuit.
   The method of proceeding was as follows :—A current was
passed from B through the strip P P', and sliding-contacts on
the opposite edges were adjusted until, when the key K was
depressed, no deflection of the galvanometer occurred. The
magnet was then excited by the battery B', and on again de
pressing K the galvanometer was deflected. On reversing
the direction of the current either from B or B', by means of
one of the commutators, an opposite deflection occurred when
K was depressed. The galvanometer used was a reflecting
instrument, of -2 ohms resistance; it was placed at a distance
of 4 metres from the scale, upon which it reflected the image
of a very fine wire. The scale, key, and commutators were
all within easy reach of the operator.
   With this comparatively small apparatus there was at
first some difficulty in producing a sensible Hall effect, and
the greatest care had to be exercised to avoid disturbing

             an Explanation of Hall's Phenomenon.             253
influences. In addition to the possible sources of error men
tioned by Mr. Hall, I was much troubled by one which he does
not seem to have noticed, and which may probably account for
the uncertain nature of some of his results. It was found
that, though the galvanometer-deflection indicating the Hall
effect was invariably reversed when the direction of the
magnetizing current was reversed, it sometimes appeared to
be altogether independent of the direction of the current
passing through the strip. It occurred to mo to excite the
magnet without passing any current at all through the strip ;
and I found that when the key K was depressed a steady de
flection of the galvanometer occurred, which was reversed ou
reversing the magnetizing current. That this effect was not
due to the direct action of the magnet on the galvanometer-
needle was proved by the fact that, when the key was raised,
the deflection immediately ceased. It appeared at first sight
as if the magnet had the power of generating a current in the
strip of metal. But this, of course, was impossible if the mag
netic force remained constant. I concluded therefore that it
was an effect of induction caused by weakening of the magnet
in consequence of the running-down of the battery, or perhaps
of the resistance of the wires being increased by the heating-
effect of the current; but it was difficult to see how this could
induce a current in the strip which was symmetrically situated
 with regard to the lines of force. Finally, I found that the
effect was produced, not in the strip at all, but in the wire
which passed from the strip between the arms of the electro
 magnet to the galvanometer. When this wire was led out on
one side of the yoke, the deflection produced was opposite to
that which occurred when the wire was led out on the other
side ; and if the wire was turned half a dozen times round the
 magnet, the resultant galvanometer-deflection was so great
that the spot of light disappeared from the scale. This was
 ultimately remedied by forming the wire in question into a
 loop embracing the yoke of the magnet, as shown at L L'
 (fig. 1). From this loop an independent wire W, attached
 to a sliding binding-screw D, was led to the galvanometer.
 It was found that the position of D could be so adjusted that,
 K being steadily depressed, the magnetism of the electro
 magnet might be interrupted, or even reversed, without causing
 any material deflection of the spot of light even at the instant
 of the change. AYhen so adjusted it was, of course, impos
 sible that the comparatively small changes in the magnetic
 force, caused either by polarization of the battery or by the
 heating of the wires, could have any effect upon the galvano
 meter. The Hall effect now came out with great distinctness,

254          Mr. S. Bidwell's Experiments illustrating
the deflections to the right or left of the zero-point of the
scale, caused by exciting the magnet, being generally as much
as 15 or 20 centim.*
   A number of experiments were now made with pieces of
iron cut into various shapes, and occasionally with fine copper
wires arranged in different forms: and the conviction gradually
forced itself upon me that the effect in question was not due
to any such action of the magnet upon the current as that
 which Mr. Hall supposed.
    The possibility of a thermoelectric effect suggested itself at
an early stage, the heat being derived from the current flow
 ing through the strip, and the changes in direction being
possibly produced by some effect of magnetization upon the
 thermoelectric properties of the metal. Such effects, I
 thought, could only occur at the points where the wires were
 attached which went to the galvanometer. Disks of bismuth
 and antimony were therefore inserted at the contacts of the
 wires and the strip, and their relative disposition varied in
 order that the thermoelectric effect, if any existed, might be
 exaggerated. But it was found that, whether the disks were
 of bismuth or of antimony, or of the two metals in various
 combinations, the extent of the galvanometer-deflections was
 unaffected, except in such a manner as could be perfectly
 accounted for by ordinary thermoelectric action. The idea of
 mechanical strain then occurred to me ; and I may mention
 that this occurred to Mr. Hall, but only to be rejected by him
 as utterly inadequate to account for the phenomenon. I
 attached a string by means of sealing-wax across the middle
 of a thin sheet of iron, which was cemented to glass and con
 nected with the battery and the galvanometer as usual. On
 pulling the string in a transverse direction I found unmis
 takable indications of a galvanometer-deflection in the same
 direction as if the sheet ot iron had been acted upon, not by a
 mechanical pull, but by the electromagnetic force. The effect
 was small, but I have since greatly increased it by the follow
 ing device :—A strip of thin iron was cemented between two
 thin slips of deal about 20 centim. long, forming a kind of
 sandwich. The sandwich was attached to a board by means
 of four screws, the distance between the middle screws being
 about 7 centim. The two ends of the iron were connected with
 a battery, and the middle points of its opposite edges with
   * That the magnetizing current used by Hall was not absolutely con
 stant is evidenced by a statement in his paper in the ' Philosophical
 Magazine' for September 1881, that the readings of a tangent-galvano
 meter, placed in the circuit for a special purpose, "slowly decreased with
 the running-down of the ¦current."

               an Explanation of Hall's Phenomenon.           255
the galvanometer. On pressing with the finger the middle
of one edge of the sandwich in a direction perpendicular to
its length and in the plane of the metal, though no appreciable
distortion was produced, the galvanometer was immediately
deflected, the direction of the current from the strip to the gal
vanometer being always the same as the direction of the force.
A similar sandwich was prepared in which platinum-foil was
used instead of iron, and with this a transverse force produced
opposite deflections to those which occurred in the case of
iron.
     There is, of course, no doubt whatever, as to the real exist
ence of a mechanical stress in a conductor through which a
current is passing, and which is at right angles to the lines of
 magnetic force. Its effect may be rendered evident to the
 eye by a simple experiment, to which I attach no importance
 whatever except as affording a rather pretty illustration of a
 perfectly well-known law. A shallow glass cell is fitted with
 iron electrodes at its two ends, and is filled with mercury to a
 depth of 3 or 4 millim. When this cell is placed between the
 poles of an electromagnet and a current is passed through it,
 the mercury along the transverse middle line is drawn towards
 one side of the cell. Here it is heaped up, and, yielding to
 the force of gravitation, it runs along the two ends of the cell
 in the opposite direction, once more to be urged forwards
 across the lines of force. The result of a continuation of this
 process is the formation of two little whirlpools of mercury
 which rotate in opposite directions in the two halves of the
 cell. The same effect may be produced, but with less violence,
 if a solution of sulphate of zinc is used with zinc electrodes.
      Having completely satisfied myself that mechanical strain
 was concerned in the production of Hall's phenomenon, it
 remained to ascertain the modus operandi. Thermoelectric
 action again occurred to me, and I remembered that Sir
 William Thomson had discovered that thermoelectric effects
 occurred in stretched and unstretched wires of the same
 material when brought into contact with each other. On
 referring to Thomson's paper, which was published in the
  ' Philosophical Transactions' for 1856, I found it stated that
 if a stretched copper wire is connected with an unstretched
  copper wire and the junction heated, a thermoelectric current
 will flow from the stretched to the unstretched wire through
 the hot junction ; while, if the wires are of iron, the direction
  of the current is from unstretched to stretched. There could
  be little doubt that effects of the same nature would occur in
  sheets of these metals; and I proceeded to consider the precise
  manner in which a sheet of metal conveying a current would

256         Mr. S. Bidwell's Experiments illustrating
be strained when placed between the poles of an electro
magnet.
    My first idea was that, since the magnetic force was stron
gest in the middle of the field, the lower half of the metallic
sheet would be, on the whole, transversely compressed and the
upper half extended. But I immediately saw that strains of
this nature would not explain Hall's phenomenon, unless
indeed it turned out to be the case that lateral compression
and extension produced opposite thermoelectric effects to those
caused by longitudinal compression and extension. The effect
of lateral compression in an iron wire was noticed by Thomson
in the paper referred to. He states that when an iron wire is
 laterally compressed, a current passes from uncompressed to
compressed through the hot junction. He supposes therefore
that since a lateral traction would probably produce the reverse
effect of a lateral pressure, it would give rise to currents from
stretched to free—the reverse of longitudinal traction. In
making this experiment, Thomson used many turns of wire
wound round a block of wood (to multiply the effect) and
squeezed the whole in a hydraulic press. I attempted to repeat
the experiment by a simple method and using only one wire;
but no amount of pressure that I was able to produce resulted
in any indication whatever of a current. I have since endea
 voured to ascertain whether any appreciable current could be
 produced in a sheet of metal by lateral traction. The arrange
 ment used is shown in fig. 2:—A B is a sheet of metallic foil;
 the shaded part D E was held between two fixed blocks of
 wood, and the shaded part C F between two blocks of wood
 which were attached to a lever. A heated glass rod was
 applied along C D, and on drawing the lever upwards in the
 direction of the arrow, a current immediately passed between
 the unstrained and the strained portions of the metal through
 the hot junction. Two metals only have been thus treated—
 zinc and iron ; and the direction of the current was in both
 cases the same as if the traction had been longitudinal instead
 of lateral. In zinc the effect was very strong, in iron it was
 feeble, but not, I think, so feeble as to be doubtful.
     On further consideration I came to the conclusion that no
 appreciable strains of the kind above referred to would be
 produced by the transverse force in the magnetic field. This
  force would be sensibly uniform across the whole of the
  middle portion of the strip, for the pole-pieces were flat and
  within a very short distance of each other, and the strip did
  not extend across their whole width. Considering the analogy
  of a beam of wood, rigidly fixed at both ends, and acted upon
  in the middle by a force perpendicular to its length, I imagined

              an Explanation of Hall's Phenomenon.                   257
that the transverse force would tend to make the metallic strip
assume a distorted form of the same character as that indicated
in fig. 3. As thus distorted, the strip may be mapped out
into six districts, in three of which the metal is, on the whole,
subjected to longitudinal traction, while in the other three it
undergoes compression. This, of course, supposes that the
metal, though cemented to glass, is capable of yielding to
some extent to the force acting upon it. And since neither
the metal itself, nor the glass, nor the cement which connects
them, is absolutely rigid, this must necessarily be the case,
though probably in a very small degree. The ends C, D of
the strip, which are in a weaker part of the magnetic field, or
even removed from its influence altogether, will not be acted
upon in the same manner ; and if the strip is sufficiently long
they will remain absolutely at right angles to the middle line,
as shown in the figure. Two points of contrary flexure will
therefore exist on each of the edges; and the necessary conse
quence of this will be alternate regions of compression and
extension, as indicated in the figure. It seems to me that,
 however thin the metal may be, so long as it is not altogether
 without cohesion and elasticity, the action of a transverse
 force across the middle will affect it in some such manner as
 that pointed out, to some degree which may be very small.
     I have prepared a rough model to illustrate my idea of the
 nature of the distortion which the plate undergoes. A num
 ber of narrow strips of deal are attached at short intervals to
 a rectangular sheet of indiarubber: they are equal in length,
 and parallel to the shorter sides of the rectangle. The two
 strips at the ends of the sheet are nailed firmly to a board;
 otherwise the indiarubber is free. If the middle strip of
  wood is drawn or pressed in a direction transverse to the rect
 angle, the indiarubber is distorted and assumes the form of
  fig. 3 ; and the regions which are there marked as stretched
  and compressed appear very clearly, the strips being drawn
  apart in the former, and crowded together in the latter. The
  same kind of distortion would be produced, though to a
  smaller extent, if the ends, instead of being rigidly fixed, were
  able to yield, more or less, to pressure or tension. But unless
  they were each attached to a single point, and were otherwise
  perfectly free (in which case the sheet would be longitudinally
  divided into two equal regions of compression and extension),
  some such distribution of strain as that indicated in fig. 3
  must necessarily occur*.
     *It should be remarked that no account whatever is taken in the
  model of lateral compression and extension, which, as already stated, are
  probably very small in the case of the metallic sheets used in Hall's
  experiments.

258          Mr. S. Bidwell's Experiments illustrating
   Suppose now that a current is passing through the plate
from C to D, and that A and B are two points on the opposite
edges, which, when the metal is unstrained, are at the same
potential. Then the ratio of the resistances between the points
C and A, and the points A and D, is equal to that between
the points C, B and the points B, D. And so far as me
chanical strain alone is concerned, this equality will not be
disturbed by placing the plate in a magnetic field, the strain
produced being symmetrically distributed on both sides of the
middle line. At all events, no strain could occur which would
in itself affect the resistance of gold and iron in opposite
ways, for the resistance of both is increased by extension, and
(presumably) diminished by compression. But the currents
from C to A and from B to D pass from regions which are
compressed to regions which are stretched, while the opposite
is the case with currents passing from C to B and from A to D.
And here the thermoelectric effects come into play.
   It has already been mentioned that a thermoelectric cur
rent will pass from a stretched copper wire to an unstretched
copper wire in contact with it, if the junction is heated.
From this it might be inferred, that a current would flow
through the heated junction from an unstretched or free
copper wire to a longitudinally compressed copper wire. And
I have proved by actual experiment that this is the case.
A fortiori, therefore, a current would pass through the heated
junction from a stretched copper wire to a compressed copper
wire. For similar reasons the current would, if the wires were
of iron, flow in the opposite direction, from the compressed
wire to the stretched wire , across the hot junction. And the
same effects, so far as regards currents between stretched
and unstretched portions, occur, as I have proved experi
mentally, if strips of foil are used instead of wires. If, there
fore, a battery-current is passed from a stretched portion of a
wire or foil to a compressed portion, heat will (according to
the laws of the Peltier effect) be absorbed at the junction if
the metal is copper, and will be developed at the junction if
the metal is iron. In passing from compressed to stretched
regions, the converse effects will occur.
    Let us now imagine the metal plate to be divided into four
equal regions A, B, C, D, as shown in fig. 4. Let a current
 pass through the plate from E to F, and let a force (produced
electromagnetically or otherwise) be .applied in the direction
 H G. First, suppose that the plate is of copper, then the
current travelling from E to the line 0 G passes from a com
 pressed to a stretched portion of the metal ; heat will there
 fore be developed in the region A. Between the line O G

             an Explanation of Hall's Phenomenon.            259
and the point F, the current passes from a stretched to a
compressed portion ; heat will therefore be absorbed in the
region B. For like reasons, heat will be absorbed in C and
developed in D. The temperature of the copper plate will
therefore not be uniform, the portions A and D being on
the whole hotter than the portions B and C. But the resist
ance of a metal increases with its temperature. The resistance
of A and D will therefore be greater, and the resistance of B
and C smaller, than before the plate was strained. If there
fore Gr H were originally an equipotential line, it is clear that
it will be so no longer. An equipotential line through the
point 0 will now be inclined to G H in the direction K L, as
shown in the figure.
    Supposing the plate to be of iron instead of copper, the
Peltier effects will be reversed, and the regions which in the
former case were hot will now be cold, and vice versa. The
distribution of resistance will be changed in a corresponding
 manner, and the equipotential line will be rotated in the
 opposite direction.
    The peculiar thermoelectric properties of copper and iron,
 discovered by Sir William Thomson, are thus seen to be
 sufficient to account for Hall's phenomenon in the case of
 those metals. If the explanation which I have offered be the
 correct one, it is clear that Hall's " positive " metals, cobalt
 and zinc, should, when tested by Thomson's method, exhibit
 the same thermoelectric effects as iron ; that his " negative "
 metals should behave thermoelectrically in the same manner
 as copper; and that lead might be expected to be thermo
 electrically unaffected by strain. It became exceedingly
 interesting to ascertain if this was the case, and I therefore
 proceeded to repeat Thomson's experiment upon all the metals
 mentioned by Hall. In most cases at least two or three diffe
 rent specimens of the metal were used, and, except in the case
 of cobalt, the following simple method of operating was
 adopted.
    A short piece of the wire or strip of the foil to be examined
 was held at the ends by two fixed brass clamps, about 5 or 6
 centim. apart, which were connected with the terminals of a
 low resistance reflecting-galvanometer. A point near the
 middle of the metal was then gripped by a pair of pliers
 which had been previously heated, and one half of the wire
 was drawn taut, leaving the other half slack. A galvano
 meter-deflection immediately occurred, which ceased when the
 tension was discontinued. The process was then repeated,
 the pull being made in the opposite direction : this resulted
 in an opposite deflection of the galvanometer.

260           Mr. S. Bidwell's Experiments illustrating
    Upon first gripping the metals, especially the harder ones,
it frequently happens that before beginning to pull a thermo
electric current is set up between different parts owing
to local differences in physical condition, and these thermo-
currents are sometimes so strong as to completely mask the
effect produced by stretching. Their effect may be practically
eliminated by giving a series of short pulls at regular inter
vals, corresponding with the periodic swing of the galvano
meter. The results can thus be observed with perfect accu
racy, but the method is not well suited for use before an
audience on account of the difficulty of rendering evident the
correspondence between the pulls and the consequent galva
nometer-deflections. The hand and eye should, in fact, work
together*.
    The directions of the currents through the hot junctions
are given in the following table, which is taken from my
former paper, with the addition of the results for wires of tin
and lead:—

All Hall's metals were used except cobalt, which could not be obtained
in the form of wire, and the only doubtful case was that of tin, the wire
being ruptured before any marked deflection was produced. It should be
noticed that the temperature of the hot junction should not exceed about
100° C, otherwise, at least in the case of iron and nickel, different
results may be obtained.

correspondence between the direction of the thermoelectric
current and the sign of Hall's effect. With regard to the
aluminium, a piece of the foil was mounted upon glass, and
Hall's experiment performed with it. As was anticipated, the
sign of the " rotational coefficient " was found to be + like
that of iron, zinc, and cobalt. It is probable, therefore, that
the specimen of aluminium with which Mr. Hall worked
differed in some respect from that used by myself. The
anomalous specimen of gold being in the form of wire, could
not be submitted to the same test : it probably contains some
disturbing impurity.
   With regard to cobalt, since it could not be obtained in the
form either of wire or of sheet, it was necessary for the obser
vation of the thermoelectric effect to treat it in a somewhat
different manner from that previously described. A rod of
the metal was held firmly by one end in a vice, and both ends
were connected by wires with the terminals of the galvano
meter. The middle of the rod was gripped with gas-tongs
which had been made hot in a Bunsen flame, and stress was
produced by twisting. It was found that, while the stress
continued, a current passed from the strained to the free
portion of the rod through the hot part. The direction of the
current was the same whether the twist was clockwise or
counterclockwise, and it ceased the moment the stress was
discontinued. For the sake of comparison, a copper rod was
treated in a similar manner, and the resulting current was in
the reverse direction. For the purpose of this experiment,
torsion is clearly equivalent to traction, both tending to draw
asunder the molecules of the metal.
    Some months ago, when experimenting with pieces of iron
cut into different ai_Qpes, I tried the effect of making a longi
tudinal slit along the middle of the plate. The result was,
that the Hall effect was considerably weakened even though
a stronger current was used than before the slit was cut. In
the light of subsequently acquired knowledge, I have varied
the experiment thus :—A plate of iron was prepared as usual,
but the galvanometer-wires, instead of being attached in the
ordinary manner, were connected to points nearer to the
middle of the plate than to the edges. When the magnet was
excited, the ordinary Hall effect was found to occur, but it
 was somewhat weakened. Two longitudinal slits were then
 cut along the middle of the plate, a connecting piece about
 4 millim. wide being left at the centre. A current from two
 bichromate cells was passed through the plate, and the posi
 tions of the galvanometer connexions were carefully adjusted,
 until, on depressing the key K (see fig. 5), not the smallest

262           Mr. S. Bidwell's Experiments illustrating
movement of the spot of light occurred. The electromagnet
was then excited, the key was depressed, and the spot of light
was deflected. The magnet-current was reversed, the key
was again depressed, and there was again a deflection of the
spot of light. And the directions of the deflections were in
both cases opposite to those which occurred before the slits
were cut in the plate. The amount of deflection thus pro
duced was about 35 scale-divisions *.
    Now it is quite clear that, if Hall's effect were due to the
direct action of the magnet upon the current, it ought to
occur in each of the two halves of the divided plate. The
transverse current in the lower half would (supposing its
direction to be upwards in the figure) pass from the point
B to the metallic bridge at the centre, and the transverse
current in the upper half would pass from the centre to
the point A. Upon no conceivable hypothesis could the
mere division of the plate have the effect of actually reversing
any direct action which the magnet might exert upon the
current.
    The strain theory, however, explains the matter perfectly.
Supposing a south pole to be beneath the plate, and the cur
rent through it to be flowing from left to right, then, before
the cuts were made, the point A would be in a stretched dis
trict, and the point B in a compressed district (see fig. 3);
and the resulting Peltier effects would cause the transverse
current to flow in the direction A G B, fig. 5. But in con
sequence of the longitudinal cuts, the distribution of stress is
altered. Instead of the whole plate, each half of it may now
be mapped out into six areas which are differently strained,
and the point A will now be in a compressed district, and B
in a stretched district. The Peltier effects will therefore be
 reversed, and the transverse current will flow in the direction
 B G A. The existence of the central bridge does not prevent
 the new strain, because there is no shearing at points midway
   * TLe experiment as described is an exceedingly troublesome one, and
 no attempt was made to exhibit it at the meeting. The difficulty arises
 from the fact that, in order to show the effect with certainty,"a very
 perfect balance must be obtained, and this alone generally occupies a
 great deal of time. But even when two exactly equipotential points
 nave been found, it often happens that the mere reversal of the polaritv
 of the magnet disturbs the adjustment of the galvanometer-contacts to
 such an extent that the effect cannot be observed : more time must
 therefore be consumed in readjusting the contacts before a successful
 experiment can be made. Believing this inconvenience to be due to
 small displacements resulting from the attractive action of the magnet
 upon the iron, I have since tried the experiment with gold-foil. This
 turns out to be a much more suitable metal for the purpose, rendering it
 possible to observe the effect with ease and certainty.

              an Explanation of Hall's Phenomenon.             263
between the ends of the plate ; and as regards transverse dis
tortion, the central bridge merely forms a link between the
upper and lower portions of the plate, which link shares their
movement in the upward direction without impeding it. Thus
the reversal of the Hall effect is easily and completely accounted
for.
    The ' Philosophical Magazine ' for last January contains a
translation of a paper by Prof. Righi, on Hall's Phenomenon.
He uses three electrodes instead of four. The current enters
or leaves by one, and leaves or enters by the other two. The
two partial currents pass through a " Wiedemann's " (pre
sumably a differential) galvanometer, and zero is obtained by
the use of resistance-coils. On exciting the electromagnet a
galvanometer-deflection occurs, indicating a current in the
opposite direction to that named by Hall.
    This also can be explained by strain and Peltier action.
Let us suppose, as before, that the plate is of iron, and that
the south pole is beneath it. Let a current enter the plate at
A, fig. 6, and leave it at the two points D and E by the wires
leading to the differential galvanometer G. The plate is
 divided into six strained regions exactly as in Hall's arrange
ment, those which are compressed being marked C, and those
 which are stretched S. But the neighbourhood of the upper
 electrode D will, in this case, be heated, because the current
 is passing from stretched to compressed : the resistance of the
 region will therefore be increased. Similarly the resistance
 of the metal in the neighbourhood of the lower electrode F
 will be diminished. Thus a greater quantity of electricity
 will pass by E than by D, and the galvanometer-deflection
 will be in the opposite direction to that which would have
 occurred if the connexions had been made in the middle of
 the plate, in the usual manner. Eighi's experiment therefore
 confirms my explanation of the Hall effect.
     The theory which I have ventured to submit seems to me
 capable of bearing any test which could reasonably be applied
 to it. Not only does it completely account for the phenomena
 described by Hall, but it explains anomalies and enables one
 to predict results. The chief point of difficulty lies in the
 straiu. In conversation on the subject, I have found that,
  while it is readily admitted that a strain such as is described
 might well be produced in a piece of metal a millimetre in
 thickness, it is by no means so easy to conceive the possibility
  of a similar strain in a sheet the thickness of which does not
  exceed a hundredth or a thousandth of a millimetre. But let
  it be imagined that the thick piece of metal is divided into a
  hundred or a thousand independent layers, each of which is

264      Experiments in Explanation of Hall's Phenomenon.
acted upon by a force equal to a hundredth or a thousandth
part of that which acted upon the whole. Then it becomes
evident that each individual stratum, including the bottom
one, will be affected in precisely the same manner as the sum
of them which constitutes the thick plate. Of course, if the
film of metal is so exceedingly thin that its physical properties
of cohesion and elasticity are impaired, we should expect
the effects of extension and compression to be diminished.
This is, in fact, the case with thin gold-leaf, not so much on
account of its mere thinness as of the inequalities and irregu
larities necessarily existing in it; and accordingly we find it
noted by Mr. Hall (Phil. Mag. November 1880, p. 312) that
the transverse effect in gold-leaf appears to be relatively much
smaller than the effect in strips of sensible thickness*. Ceteris
paribus, the galvanometer-deflection is, of course, greater with
a thin sheet than with a thick one, because the difference of
potential at any two points in a thick sheet must always be
comparatively small.
   If it is objected that, since the plate is firmly cemented to
glass, the distortion actually produced must be very small, it
may be replied that the consequent effect is also very small,
and that a distortion far too insignificant to be visible to the
eye would be sufficient to produce it. The warmth commu
nicated to the plate by lightly touching opposite corners of it
with the fingers is capable of causing galvanometer-deflec
tions many times as great as those produced by Peltier effects
requiring three or four amperes of current for their pro
duction.
   Lastly, it may be urged that the force available for pro
ducing the required strain is a very small one. This is
undoubtedly true. But, apart from the fact that a very small
force would be sufficient to cause a sensible strain in a very
thin sheet of metal, it must be remembered that the force
with which we are dealing acts in an exceedingly advan
tageous manner. It does not, like an external push or pull,
act upon a single point or group of points in the sheet, but it
exerts a perfectly independent action upon every individual
molecule of the metal which is within the magnetic field,
most powerfully in the middle, gradually falling off towards
the ends. It acts, in short, in the most effective manner
possible for the production of the strain.
   Though it may not impossibly turn out, on further investi-
   • Mr. Hall thinks that the apparent difference may be accounted for
by the existence of a multitude of small holes in the thin leaf, by impu
rities in the gold, and by the, difficulty of securing good contact with the
electrodes.

gation, that the details of the action differ in some respects
from those which I have suggested, I think no reasonable
doubt can remain that Hall's phenomenon is simply a con
sequence of mechanical action combined with Peltier effects.
And if it should be thought that I have, in this paper,
brought forward a superfluity of argument in support of a
proposition which, when once stated, appears almost self-
evident, I can only say that, under the circumstances, and
having regard to the great importance of the subject, it
seemed desirable that it should receive the most thorough and
exhaustive treatment possible.
X.XX. On the Adjustment of Resistance -Coils. By Professor
   Silvanus P. Thompson, B.A.. D.Sc, Univ. Coll. Bristol*.
1. A LTHOUGH the existing methods for the exact mea-
    -Ejl. surement of the electric resistance of a wire are
simple, rapid, and reliable to a very high degree, there is not,
so far as I am aware, any simple, rapid, and reliable method
yet known of adjusting resistance-coils to their exact value,
when some standard coil of known resistance is used for com
parison. It is, of course, much more important to know what
the exact value of a coil is than to have that coil adjusted to
one ohm or one hundred ohms, if such adjustment involves
some uncertainty in the percentage of its precise value. But
I do not see why our standards should not only be accurately
known, but also accurately adjusted to standard values, at
least with far greater precision than is often the case. Further
than this, the great cost of reliable resistance-coils, which hin
ders in many cases their being purchased by individuals and
institutions of limited means, arises almost entirely from the
high cost of the skilled labour now needed for the tedious
processes of adjusting the coils by trial and error to something
approaching their nominal values.
    The method of adjusting resistance-coils now suggested has
proved itself in practice far more accurate than any other, and
the rapidity with which adjustment can be secured is extra
 ordinary. It consists in taking as a first approximation a wire
 cut off roughly of such a length as to have a resistance slightly
 greater than that to be finally given, and then shunting the
 whole or a portion of this coil by a coil of much higher resist
ance, also approximately cut off to a resistance calculated from
 a single careful measurement of the first rough coil. The
 method, though new for the construction and adjustment of
permanent coils, is not new as a method in general, as it was

266                Prof. S. P. Thompson on the
used nearly twenty years ago by the Committee on Electrical
 Standards for temporary adjustments. On page 101 of the
Reports, as reprinted under the editorship of Prof. Fleeming
Jenkin, the following passage occurs :—
   " The idea of using large coils combined with small ones in
multiple arc to obtain extremely small minute differences of
resistance was suggested to the writer by Professor [now Sir]
W. Thomson, and will be found useful in very many ways."
But only one way is mentioned in the Reports, namely that
of plugging in the high resistance as a temporary shunt during
a single experiment
   2. I will first describe the method pursued in the Physical
Laboratory of University College, Bristol, for the adjustment
of coils not exceeding 10 ohms in resistance. First, the length,
calculated to within OS of a centimetre, is cut off from a
specimen of German-silver wire of which the resistance per
centimetre is roughly known ; 2 per cent, being added before
the wire is cut off. It is soldered to the stout copper terminals
prepared to receive it, doubled on itself, twisted, wound up,
and when the soldering has cooled, the resistance of the wire
is measured with the utmost care by comparison, made on
Professor Carey Foster's method, with a standard coil, con
structed at Cambridge in Professor Stuart's workshops, and
which has been verified at the Cavendish Laboratory and cer
tified in terms of Lord Rayleigh's determination of the ohm.
The " rough resistance " of the measured coil being thus very
accurately known, a calculation is made to ascertain what
resistance, connected as a shunt, will reduce the resistance
between terminals to one exact Rayleigh ohm. The resistance
required for the shunt is in practice from 12 to 50, (50, or
even 80 ohms. The nearer the first approximation, the higher
the shunt-resistance required, as the formula given below
shows at a glance. The calculation then having been made,
the requisite length to approximate to this is cut off from a
much finer wire, which is then soldered across the terminals.
At first we used to measure the resistance of tbese shunts
before putting them on. In practice we find this quite
unnecessary, as they can always, if there is any error of im
portance, be readjusted after soldering them to the copper
terminals. In nine cases out of ten, however, no further
adjustment is needed.
    3. The following is the theory of, and formula for, the
value of the shunt required.
   Let 9? be the exact resistance of the first rough approxi-
matoly-cut coil, being larger by from 1 to 4 per cent, than

  the final value. It is required to find the value S of a shunt-
  coil which will reduce its resistance to the final exact value R.
     By the ordinary rule for divided circuits we have
                                  3£ + S'
                       R(M + S)=9tS;

     4. An example for the adjustment of a 1-ohm coil will
  illustrate the method and its advantages. The following data
  are taken from the note-book of Mr. C. C Starling, Demon
  strator in the Physical Laboratory of University College,
  Bristol, January 30, 1884. Coil marked " <f> 3."
     1-1 metre of German-silver wire (No. 24 B.W.G.), diam.
  0-56 millini., cut off and soldered to tenninals. Tested (by
  Foster's method) against Cambridge Unit No. 6.

     7*05 metres of German-silver wire (No. 36 B.W.G.), diam.
  0-2 millim. (at 20'8 centim. per ohm), cut off, and without
  further measurement soldered to terminals. Immediately
  tested by Foster's method,
           R= 1-007912 Rayleigh ohms (temp. 17°-3 C).
     Time required to make and test coil and shunt 38 minutes.
     This coil was tested again three days later, namely on
 February 3, and gave
           R= 1-004178 (temp. 13°'5 C).
 Tested again, February 5,
                  R= 1-0050854 (temp. 14°-5C).
Tested again, February 21,
                  R= 1-0063923 (temp. 15°-5 C).
This coil is therefore correct at 0o-97 C.
    One other example of the application of the method to a bad
case will suffice. In this instance the resistance of the main
wire was not near enough to the final value, being more than
14 per cent, too great, and the shunt consequently shorter
than desirable. Nevertheless the result was quite satisfactory.

   U = V-fi(x-x').
   R= 1-0000900 Rayleigh ohms (temp. 16° C).
[Tested again next day this same coil gave
   R= 1-0000435 Rayleigh ohms (temp. 17°-2 C.).]
   5. The amount of the final error caused by any given error
in the shunt is easily expressed by a formula. Let r be the error
of the shunt, and n the ratio of the shunt to the unshunted
resistance. In practice 00>n>10. If the shunt S were
without error we should have, from the usual formula,
                          R_ JKS_
                          K~ 0i+S;
or, if S were truly equal to n9?,
                          R= ^L.
                               1+n
But in reality S = nJK + r, and consequently the shunted coil
has for its slightly erroneous final resistance,
                         p,_«K(n9i + r)
                         LX~dl + n9i + r
                                ndi + r
Therefore we get as the final error,
                e=R'-R =                r
                              (n + l)2+^(n-l)
    The second term in the denominator is always small com-
E>ared with the first term, and may be omitted, for n is never
 ess than 10, as remarked above, and r is very seldom one

                  Adjustment of Resistance- Coils.             269
 fiftieth part of 91, and need not, with care, exceed one two-
 hundredth. This reduces the expression for the error to
 Suppose the error r made in measuring the shunt is as much
 as 2 per cent., and the value of the shunt-ratio n only 10 ;
 then, as the formula shows, the final error is only "0165 per
 cent., or in a 1-ohm coil amounts to O000165 ohm. But if,
 as is in practice much more frequently the case, the shunt-
  ratio n is 50 instead of 10 (and often more), then with a 2-per
 cent, error in the shunt the final error is only "000767, or in
 a 1-ohm coil amounts to 0*00000767 ohm. In practice, the
 error made in cutting off the shunt wire is nothing like
 2 per cent.: one half per cent is easily attainable.
    6. The special advantages possessed by this method of adjust
 ment cease to be available for resistances exceeding 10 ohms,
 as it is not convenient to measure off shunts of 500 to 800
 ohms ; for the wire is either inordinately long, or too thin for
 a reliable proportion to exist between length and resistance.
 For resistances exceeding 10 ohms we therefore modify the
 process of adjustment as follows. The wire is roughly mea
 sured out as before, to a value slightly exceeding the final
 correct resistance. It is soldered to the usual stout copper
 terminals ; but before it is doubled, twisted, and wound up, a
 spot is bared at about one tenth or less of its length from one
end. At this point a short piece of copper, about 2 millim.
thick and 3 centim. long, is soldered. The resistance of the
whole wire is then very accurately measured by Foster's
method, and the resistance of the short portion between the
terminal and the copper piece is also very accurately mea
sured. We next calculate the value to which the resistance
of this short piece must be reduced in order to bring the total
resistance to its correct desired value, and then the short
portion is shunted down to the required amount by a shunt-
wire calculated, measured out, and soldered on, exactly as
described before.
    7. In conclusion, I would remark that in advancing from
coils of 1-ohm to coils of higher values we have followed the
suggestion made by Lord Rayleigh in 1881, of passing by
three threes plus one to ten, and three thirties plus ten to one
hundred. We have, however, found it much more convenient
not to use the ingenious but complicated system of mercury-
cups suggested by Lord Rayleigh for facilitating this operation.
Instead of this we have employed the following simpler device.
Six holes are drilled in a block of paraffin for mercury-cups.

270        Mr. G. Kamensky on the Electric Conductivity
The holes have sheet-copper disks fixed at the bottom.
Each cup is large enough to admit of the insertion of three
stout copper terminals. Figures 1 and 2 below show how the
arrangements are made for connecting the three threes in
parallel, for verification, and for connecting the three threes
flus one in series, when using them for testing a 10-ohm coil,

     I afterwards found it necessary to prepare two more, viz.:—
 No. 10a, Antimony 49, Copper 51, which has the formula
 Cns Sb ; and No. 13a, Antimony 31'9, Copper 68'1, which
 possesses the formula Cu4 Sb.
    From the point of view of the metallurgist, the most inte
 resting fact connected with the electrical constants of the
alloys is the determination of the group to which, following
 Matthiesen's classifications*, they belong. Are the alloys of
copper and antimony like, for instance, those of copper and
tin, " solidified solutions of one metal in the allotropic modi
fication of the other "; and if so, is the curve of their electrical
resistance a continuous one, showing at first a rapid fall on the
copper side, and then turning and passing nearly horizontal
to the point representing unalloyed antimony ?
    The entire series of the copper-antimony alloys is unfortu
nately very brittle, and therefore the preparation of wires is
out of the question, and the determination of the electrical
resistance of cast rods of metal is known to be attended with
many diflSculties.i I therefore determined to follow the course
           • Phil. Trans. British Association Reports, 1868.

272       Mr. G. Kamensky on the Electric Conductivity
indicated by Prof. W. Chandler Roberts*, who has shown that
the necessary information as to the electrical position of alloys
may be readily ascertained by the induction-balance; and the
accuracy of his view was subsequently confirmed by Dr.
Oliver Lodgef, who used the Wheatstone bridge. The method
adopted in the case of the induction-balance consists in placing
the disk to be examined on one side of the balance, and in
superposing a graduated wedge-shaped scale of zinc over the
opposing coil. This method has already been described by
Prof. Roberts, who has lent me the graduated zinc scale by
which his numbers representing the " induction-balance effect "'
of various alloys were made.
   It is true that the numbers named by the use of this scale
are arbitrary ; but they can be controlled by employing disks
of pure metal of known resistance, provided that they have
the same dimensions and volume as the disks of the alloys
under examination.
   The alloys were cast direct into the required
disks, which was managed by using an ingot>niould
in which a steel plate cut out, as here shown, was
inserted. The disks so cast were ground down
on a stone to a thickness of 3 centim.
   In mapping out the curve of Electric Con
ductivity, I decided, after consultation with Prof.
C. Roberts, not to give the number obtained for
the disk of copper, as in his opinion that cannot
be determined for a disk of the same size as the
rest of the series by the particular zinc scale used.

274    Electric Conductivity of the Copper-Antimony Alloys.
There is a very rapid fall from copper to the alloy containing
only 1 5 per cent, of antimony ; and this decrement is con
tinued until the alloy SbCu4 is. reached, when the curve turns
rapidly and rises to SbCu2, and then turns again and passes
to pure antimony. It is not a little interesting that, in the
copper-tin series (Roberts), the alloy SnOu4 occupies the
lowest part of the curve, precisely the position that, in the
copper-antimony series, is occupied by the alloy SbCu4. In
the copper-tin series, however, the second critical point is held
by the SnCu3 ; and this point in the copper-antimony curve
is assumed, not by SbCu3, but by SbCu2.
   I may add that I have confirmed the composition of the
alloys at these critical points by analysis.

   The  following is a description of the fractures of the series:—

    The alloys from Nos. 12 to 16 are easily tarnished.
    From this it will be seen that antimony is very persistent
  n its influence, and also that the colour of the " Eegulus of
 Venus " first appears in the alloy containing 75 per cent, of
 intimony, and disappears in that containing 45 per cent.
    From these data it would appear that in the copper-antimony
 series there are two alloys which may be assumed to possess
 very definite compositions—viz. the " Eegulus of Venus,"
 SbCu2, and the alloy represented by the formula SbCu4.
   XXXII. Remarks on Professor Newcomb's " Rejoinder."
                By James Croll, LL.D., F.R.S.*
IN the ' Philosophical Magazine' for last February Professor
     Newcomb has done me the honour to reply to my remarks
in the October number on his Review of ' Climate and Time/
which appeared in the 'American Journal of Science ' for May
1876. With regard to this Rejoinder of his, I regret that I
most repeat what I said about his Review, viz. that nearly all
his objections are based on strange, and to me unaccountable,
misapprehensions of my reasoning and of the views which I
actually hold. I have no desire to continue this controversy,
                    * Communicated by the Author.

 276                 Dr. J. Croll's Remarks on
 but may be allowed briefly to refer to those points on which I
 have been so thoroughly misunderstood.
     Of course I fully concur in Professor Newcomb's opening
 remarks as to the desirability of "a purely mathematical
 investigation of the subject." Such an investigation, how
 ever, is, I think, impossible at present. In a question so
 complex and difficult as that of the cause of the Glacial Epoch,
 depending as it does on the consideration of so many different
 elements, some of which are but little understood, logical ana
 lysis rather than mathematics will require to be our instrument
 in the mean time. The question must first assume a clear,
 definite, and logical form before mathematics can possibly be
 applied to it.
    Prof. Newcomb objects that my language is wanting in
 quantitative precision—that I use such terms as " great," " very
 great," "small," " comparatively small," and so forth without
 any statement ofthe units of comparison relatively to which these
 expressions are employed. No one reasoning on the combined
 influence of a multitude of physical causes could well avoid
 the almost continual use of such terms. Besides, my critic
 forgets that in almost every case in which I use these terms
 numerical exactness is not attainable ; and even if it were, it
 would, as a rule, be of little service, seeing that the conclusion
 generally depends on the simple fact that one quantitj' is less
 or greater than another; not on how much less or how much
 greater the one may be than the other. Although my argu
 ments are logical, few writers, I venture to say, have done
 more than myself to introduce definite quantitative exactness
into the questions I have discussed.
     Prof. Newcomb gives his readers to understand that I
assume Newton's law of cooling to be correct ; and that I ap
parently nowhere adduce the more correct law of Dulong and
Petit—viz. that if we take a series of temperatures in arith
metical progression, the corresponding rates of radiation of
heat will not be in arithmetical progression, but in a series of
which the differences continually increase. If he will refer
to the < Reader,' Dec. 9, 1865, Phil. Mag. Feb. 1870, ' Nature,'
April 1, 1880, and ' Climate and Time ' (the book he reviewed),
E). 37, he will there see the question discussed at considerable
 ength. He will also find reference made to a remarkable
circumstance connected with radiation which perhaps may be
new to him. It is this: the law of Dulong and Petit (that as
the temperature of a body rises the radiation of the body
increases in a much higher ratio) holds true only of the body
considered as a mass. The probability is, as has been shown
by Prof. Balfour Stewart, that the individual particles com

               Professor Newcomb's " Rejoinder."                  277
 posing the body obey Newton's law in their radiation; in
 other words, the radiation of a material particle is directly
 proportionate to its absolute temperature.
    Further, in estimating the extent to which temperature is
 affected by a change in the sun's distance, Newton's law
 makes the extent too great ; while the formula of Dulong and
 Petit, which is an empirical one, makes it, on the other hand,
 too small. This formula has been found to agree pretty
 closely with observation within ordinary limits, but it com
 pletely breaks down when applied to determine high tempera
 tures. For example, it is found to give a temperature for the
 sun of only 2130° F., or not much above that of an ordinary
 furnace. It is probable also that it will equally break down
 when applied to very low temperatures, such as that of space.
    I am very much pleased to find that Prof. Newcomb draws
 a conclusion from Dulong and Petifs law favourable to my
 theory of the cause of the Glacial Epoch, which certainly did
 escape my notice. And it is a curious circumstance that Mr.
 Hill* has likewise deduced a conclusion even more favourable
 to glaciation than that of Prof. Newcomb.
    Prof. Newcomb says :—" Mr. Croll suggests that I may have
 forgotten the researches of Pouillet and Herschel into the
 temperature of space. I reply that I regard the conclusion
 that the temperature of space is —239° as having no sound
 basis." This may be perfectly true ; but it is hardly a war
 rant for affirming that practically there is but one source (the
 sun) from which the surface of the earth receives heat, with
 out even referring to the researches of these eminent physicists,
 who have arrived at a totally different conclusion. Any one
 who has read ' Climate and Time ' will know that I adopted
  — 239° as the temperature of space, not because I believed
 that estimate to be correct, but because at the time I wrote
 there was no other to adopt. In fact in adopting so high a
 temperature for space I was doing my theory a positive injury.
 This is obvious; for the lower the temperature of space the
 greater must be the decrease of temperature resulting from an
 increase in the sun's distance due to eccentricity. My opinion
 all along has been that the temperature of space is little above
 absolute zero.
    As an argument against the conclusion that space can have
 the high temperature assigned to it by Pouillet and Herschel,
he says:—"Photometry shows that the combined light from
 all the stars visible in the most powerful telescope is not a
 millionth of that received from the sun, and there is no reason
   • " Evaporation and Eccentricity as Co-factors in Glacial Periods,"
Geological Magazine for November 1881.

278                  Dr. J. Croll's Remarks on
for believing that the ratio of light to heat is incomparably
different in the two cases." This very argument from the
extreme smallness in the amount of light derived from the
stars in comparison to that from the sun, intended by him to
convince me of the absurdity of supposing that space pos
sesses a temperature as high as — 239°, is just the argument
advanced by myself upwards of eighteen years ago, in the
'Reader' for December 9, 1865, and afterwards reproduced
in ' Climate and Time,' at page 39, from which I quote the
following: —
   ' We know that absolute zero is at least 493° below the melting-
point of ice. This is 222° below that of space. Consequently, if
the heat derived from the stars is able to maintain a temperature
of —239°, or 222° of absolute temperature, then nearly as much
heat is derived from the stars as from the sun. But if so, why
do the stars give so much heat and so very little light ? If the
radiation from the stars could maintain a thermometer 222° above
absolute zero, then space must be far more transparent to heat-
rays than to light-rays, or else the stars give out a great amount of
heat, but very little light, neither of which suppositions is pro
bably true. The probability is, I venture to presume, that the
temperature of spate is not very much above absolute zero.'
   In regard to Prof. Newcomb's objections to the reasons
which 1 have adduced to show that the ocean ought to be
warmer than the land, I am at a loss to understand how he
can have so completely misunderstood me on that point. I
thought I had expressed my views with sufficient clearness,
but now fear I cannot have done so. I need not, however,
again go over my argument in detail, but shall simply state
what the views are which I have all along maintained. This
will suffice to show that these views are diametrically the
opposite of those which my critic has attributed to me.
   The temperature of a body can remain stationary only when
the rate at which it is losing equals that at which it is receiving
heat. If heat be lost more rapidly than it is received the
temperature will fall. The fall of temperature will diminish
the rate of loss till the rate of loss equals the rate of gain.
After this the temperature becomes stationary. If we have
two bodies, A and 13, the same in every respect, each re
ceiving (say from the sun) the same amount of heat in a given
time, and if the only difference between them be that A bas a
greater difficulty than B in getting quit of the heat which it is
receiving, then, for the reason just assigned, A will necessarily
stand at a higher temperature than B. Let us now suppose
the southern, or water hemisphere, to be A, and the northern,
or land hemisphere, to be B. I have endeavoured to show

               Professor Newcomb's " Rejoinder.'                 279
(' Climate and Time,' and elsewhere) that A, the water hemi
sphere, ought to have a higher mean temperature than B, the
land hemisphere, because the former has a greater difficulty
in getting quit of the heat which it is receiving from the sun
than the latter. The question then arises, How is it that the
water hemisphere has a greater difficulty than the land hemi
sphere in getting rid of its heat? It is mainly due to that
cause which Prof. Newcomb says is quite new to him, viz. the
fact that the aqueous vapour of the air isfar less diathermanous
to radiation from water than from land. It is a curious fact
that Prof. Newcomb, in his " Rejoinder," entirely overlooks
this cause assigned by me, although I have stated it fully in
my fourth reason. The period of the heat-vibrations of the
aqueous vapour of the air is the same as that of the ocean, and
consequently the aqueous vapour will absorb radiation from
the ocean more readily than from the land. A considerable
portion of the heat absorbed by the aqueous vapour of the air
is thrown back upon the ocean, and in this way the aqueou9
vapour acts as a screen, or like the glass of a greenhouse, in
preventing the ocean from getting quit of its heat so rapidly
as the land. The result is that the temperature of equilibrium
of the ocean must be higher than that of the land. In other
words, before the ocean can manage to throw off its heat into
space as rapidly as it is receiving it, its temperature must be
higher than that of the land.
   The foregoing conclusion follows so obviously from the
known properties of aqueous vapour and the principles of
thermodynamics that I can hardly believe Prof. Newcomb
will call it in question. But he will ask how can the trans
parency of the ocean for heat-rays, the mobility of its particles,
and the greater store of heat which it possesses, be a reason
why its mean temperature should be higher than that of the
land? I thought I had made all this clear. The reason
becomes apparent when we consider why it is that the surface
of the ocean during night and also during winter is warmer
than the surface of the land. The ocean in temperate regions
seldom sinks to the freezing-point, while the land is frequently
frozen for months. The cause is obvious enough : at night,
when the surface of the ocean becomes cool, the cold particles
sink and their places are supplied by warm particles from
below, and so long as the heat stored up remains the surface
can never become cold, Were it not for the transparency of
water for heat-rays, it would be impossible that the ocean
could obtain a supply of heat sufficient to maintain its surface-
temperature during the entire winter; and, on the other hand,
were the particles not mobile, this store could be of little service.

280                 Dr. J. Croll's Remarks on
   It is true that the land is hotter during the day and also
during the summer than the ocean, but it is found that the
more equable temperature of the ocean gives a higher mean.
This is further shown from another consideration. The land
is more indebted for heat to the ocean than the ocean is for
heat to the land. For example, a very considerable portion
of the warmth enjoyed by North-western Europe is derived
from the Atlantic. In like manner, Western America is
indebted to the Pacific for a large amount of its heat. In
addition, an immense quantity of the heat received from the
sun by the ocean is consumed in reducing evaporation, and a
largo portion of this heat latent in the vapour is bestowed on
the land during condensation. Yet notwithstanding this
transference of heat from the ocean to the land, the mean
temperature of the former is greater than that of the latter.
Were it not for its store of summer heat, the ocean could not
afford to part with so much of its heat to the land during
winter and still maintain a higher mean temperature.
   I come now to the consideration of the most singular of
all Prof. Newcomb's misapprehensions—that one, namely,
which has reference to my third reason. In that reason I
stated, what every physicist knows to be perfectly correct, that
the aqueous vapour of the air radiates back a portion of its
heat ; and the ocean, for reasons which have been already
stated, absorbs this radiation more freely than the land. Ra
diation from the air therefore tends more readily to heat
the ocean than it does the land. Prof. Newcomb says that
this involves the reductio ad absurdum of two bodies heating
each other by their mutual radiation. This is not the state
of the case at all, for both bodies receive their heat from the
sun ; their mutual radiation simply retains them at a higher
temperature than they could otherwise have. Here Prof. New-
come appears to get into confusion owing to the meaning
which he attributes to the word " heating." The views which
I have advocated in reference to this mutual radiation are as
follows:—According to the dynamical theory of heat, all bodies
above absolute zero radiate heat. If we have two bodies, A
at 200° and B at 400°, then, according to Prevost's theory of
exchanges, A as truly radiates heat to B as B does to A. The
radiation of A, of course, can never raise the temperature of
B above 400° ; but nevertheless the tendency of the radia
tion of A, in so far as it goes, is to raise the temperature of B.
This is demonstrated by the fact that the temperature of B,
in consequence of the radiation of A, is prevented from sink
ing so low as it would otherwise do. All this is so well known
to every student of thermodynamics, that I can hardly think
Prof. Newcomb, on reflection, will dispute its accuracy. And

                Professor Newcomb's " Rejoinder"                       281
if he admits this, then he must also admit the soundness of
my third reason, for this is the principle on which it is based.
The aqueous vapour of the air absorbs a considerable amount
of the heat which is being constantly radiated by the ocean ;
a portion of this heat thus absorbed is thrown back upon the
ocean, the tendency of which is to keep the surface of the
ocean at a much higher temperature than it would otherwise
have. Prof. Langley has concluded, from observations made
at Mount Whitney, that were it not for the heat thrown back
by the atmosphere, or " trapped " as it is popularly called,
mercury would remain solid under a vertical sun.
   In his Review of ' Climate and Time,' Prof. Newcomb ad
vocated, as a fatal objection to my theory, that the quantity
of heat received from the sun during summer would be suffi
cient to melt in a few days the entire amount of snow and ice
accumulated during winter*. This objection, I pointed out in
my reply (Phil. Mag. Oct. 1883, p. 256), is based on the
erroneous assumption that the quantity of snow and ice melted
must be proportionate to the amount of heat received from the
sun. In proof of the erroneous nature of this assumption, I
refer to the fact that on the lofty summits of the Himalayas
and Andes, for example, the quantity of .heat received from
the sun would be sufficient to melt at least fifty feet of ice per
annum, and that is no doubt more than ten times the quantity
actually required to be melted ; yet notwithstanding the snow
remains permanent. The cause of this non-melting I showed
to be due to the fact that at these elevations, owing to the dry
ness of the air (want of aqueous vapour), the loss of heat from
radiation into stellar space is so excessive that the rays of the
sun, intense as they undoubtedly are, are unable to raise the
 temperature of the snow to the melting-point ; consequently,
 no matter what may be the amount of heat received, the snow
 can never melt. It may evaporate, but it cannot melt. I
 further pointed out that, were the aqueous vapour possessed
 by the atmosphere sufficiently diminished, the snow-line would
 descend to the sea-level even at the equator, and perpetual
 snow would cover our globe down to the sea-shore.
    1 was much pleased to find that Prof. Newcomb has not
 only adopted these views regarding the effects of an absence
 of aqueous vapour, but suggested that they may yet afford
 an explanation of the cause of the Glacial Epoch. Every
 one familiar with the subject, however, knows that that epoch
 was not due to a dryness of the air, but the reverse.
   * Were this objection correct it would prove that there could have
been no Glacial Epoch ; for it is obvious that had not the sun's heat failed
to melt the winter's snow, not during the course of a few days merely but
during the entire summer, there could not possiblyhave been permanent ice.

147. TT is well known thai the E.M.F.'s of cells like those
       JL of Daniell and of Grove vary with the degree of
concentration of the solutions used therein, and many measure
ments of the amounts of such variations have been from time
to time published by different experimenters, e. g. by Regnault
{Ann. de Chim. et de Phys. [3] xliv. p. 453), Svanberg (Pogg.
Annalen, lxxiii. p. 290 [1848]); and more recently by Streintz
(Carl. Rep. xv. p. 6 [1879]), Baumgartner {ibid. xv. p. 105
[1879] ), and Fromme {Annalen derPhysik, viii. p. 326 [1879] ).
From various causes, the nature of which will be apparent later
on, the figures obtained by different observers do not exhibit
such a degree of concordance as to lead to the establishment of
any fundamental principle coordinating the variation in E.M.F.
with the degree of dilution of the solutions used, excepting this
general rule, that when the strength of the copper sulphate in
a Daniell cell or of the nitric acid in a Grove's cell is decreased,
a fall in the E.M.F. results ; and that when the strength of
the solution surrounding the zinc is decreased, a rise in E.M.F.
ensues, provided the solution is one of zinc sulphate : with
other salts, and with dilute sulphuric acid, some observa
tions indicate rise, others fall, in E.M.F. with decrease of
strength.
    It has been shown by Moser {Annalen der Physik, iii. p. 216
 [1878]) that when two solutions of the same metallic salt,
but of unequal strengths, are allowed to communicate so as to
mix by interdiffusion, a current is set up passing from the
weaker to the stronger solution through the fluid when elec
trodes are employed of the metal contained in the salt used
(e.g. zinc for solutions of zinc sulphate, copper for solutions of
copper sulphate, and so on) ; whilst the experiments described
in Part V. (§ 110) indicate that the variations in E.M.F. of a
Daniell cell containing zinc-sulphate solution round the zinc,
according as the zinc-sulphate or the copper-sulphate solution
varies in strength, are approximately equal numerically to the
      Communicated by the Physical Society. Read January 26. 1884.

      values obtained by Moser as the E.M.F.'s set up by the inter-
      diffusion of solutions of zinc sulphate or of copper sulphate
      respectively, with the same limits of strength of solution.
         It seemed of interest to pursue this point further, so as to
     decide by accurate measurements how far this approximation
     is merely an accidental coincidence : accordingly a large
     number of experiments have been made, mostly described in
     the following pages.
        At first the observations were made by means of the quad
     rant electrometer, no permanent current passing ; but it was
     found that the experimental and observational errors were
     such that unless a very large number of duplicate cells were
     prepared and very many observations made with each, in
     volving an immense expenditure of labour and time, trust
     worthy averages could not be obtained. The electrometer-
     readings (deflections on both sides of zero) could, at best, be
     read to no nearer than + -0025 volt; so that averages for
     single-cell values with a probable error of not more than + "001
     volt (one millivolt) entailed a large number of readings for each
     cell ; and as the values for different cells thus obtained exhi
     bited a range of several millivolts, numerous duplicate cells
    had to be set up to obtain a final mean with a probable error
    of less than ±1 millivolt as the E.M.F. of each kind of cell:
    whilst, finally, the differences between the mean E.M.F.'s
    thus obtained exhibited, when plotted, deviations from a regular
    mean curve approaching to + 1 millivolt, even with the utmost
    care in making observations and the bestowal of much time
    in so doing. Accordingly, the method of observation was
   changed, a delicate galvanometer being substituted for the
   electrometer ; the instrumental errors being smaller and the
   sensitiveness greater*, the same degree of accuracy (i. e. the
       * The galvanometer (by Elliott) was capable of being adjusted so as
  to fjive a total deflection, reading on both sides of zero with a reversing-
  kev, of upwards of 200 scale-divisions when the current from a Daniell
  cell waa passed through a resistance of 100,000 ohms, using the t^Vit shunt;

      It being convenient to have some term representing the millionth of a
 millionth (•000000000001=10-12); it is proposed to use the prefix " elasso "
 for this purpose (from i\ao-<rov), just as ' micro " represents 10~6, and
 ** megti represents 10" : the value of 1 scale-division as above then becomes
5G ela&so-amperes. The fraction -000000001 = 10-9 maybe conveniently
represented by the double prefix " milli-micro," using each half in its
ordinary sense ; so that a centimetre = 1 milli-micro earth-quadrant. In
the same kind of way 1,000,000,000 ohms may be termed a kilomegohm;
and a million of million ergs may be spoken of as a meizerg (ftclfav). This
nomenclature seems to be practically more convenient than such terms as
twelfth-ampere, ohm-nine, erg-twelve, &c.

284 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
same limits of probable error) were found to be attainable
with a notably smaller number of observations, provided
 that certain precautions were observed, detailed more fully
 later on (§§ 149, 150). It was soon found, however, that
 the observance of these precautions sufficed to permit of the
 method of opposition being used so as to obtain directly the
 difference in E.M.F. between two cells alike in all respects,
 save that the zinc (or copper) sulphate solution used in one
 was stronger than that in the other. The values thus ob
 tained led to sensibly the same mean curves as those obtained
 with a far greater amount of labour by means of the electro
 meter, and, notwithstanding the diminution in the number
  of observations, the range of probable error was sensibly
  diminished.
     One of the essential precautions being the avoidance of dimi
  nution in E.M.F. in consequence of so-called " polarization,"
  by using currents of only minute density, it at once suggested
  itself that under these conditions in all probability the differ
  ence of potential set up between (for example) two plates of
  zinc immersed in zinc-sulphate solutions of different strengths
  allowed to intermix by interdiffusion (or what may be con
  veniently called a diffusion-cell) would vary little, if at all,
  from that set up between the same two plates immersed in
  the same solutions respectively when these solutions are not
  directly connected so as to interdiffuse, but are severally con
  nected (by any of the means used in two-fluid cells) with
  solutions of copper sulphate of identical strengths, in which are
  immersed copper plates of the same surface-character connected
  together by a wire : t. e. that subsisting between the terminal
  plates of two opposed Daniell cells containing the same copper-
  sulphate solution, but zinc solutions differing from each other
   in strength and respectively identical with those used in the
   diffusion-cell, when the copper plates are united together and
   the zinc plates are the terminals. On trying the experiment
   this was found to be the case, sensibly identical mean curves
  being obtained Jor given variations in solution-strength and for
   given kinds of plate-surfaces, whether the method of opposition
   was used, or that of diffusion-cells.
       148. Whichever method of observation was employed, the
    following general laws were always verified with a high degree
    of exactitude whenever sufficient observations were taken to get
    average results with only a small probable error. All the ob
    servations were carried out in every instance at a temperature
    within a very few degrees of 18° C, almost invariably between
    15° and 20°.

tallic salts and plates of the respective metals contained there
in, an increase in strength of the solution surrounding the plate
acquiring the higher potential, in virtue of the normal action of
the cell (i.e. the plate functioning as the copper plate of a
Daniell cell), causes an increment in the potential-difference set
up between that plate and the other. The opposite effect is
always produced by an increase in the strength of the solution
surrounding the other plate. The increment and decrement
thus producible are, in certain cases, very considerable: with a
Daniell cell a difference of nearly 6 centivolts (or upwards of
5 per cent, of the total E.M.F.) is producible, according as
strong copper-sulphate and weak zinc-sulphate solutions are
taken, or vice versd ; with cells containing zinc and cadmium
chlorides analogous differences up to even 30 centivolts are
thus producible.
    (2) A " law of summation " holds, expressible thus :— The
effect of the sum of a series of changes in the strengths of the
solutions in a two-fluid cell is eqiial to the algebraic sum of the
effects ofeach change severally. Thus, by increasing the strength
of the copper-sulphate solution in a Daniell cell (from, say,
•25 CuS04 100 H20 * to 2-0 CuS04 100 H20), a given incre
ment in E.M.F. ensues, = a : by similarly varying the zinc-
sulphate solution (from, say, -25"ZnS04 100 H20 to 5*0 ZnS04
 100 H20), a decrement ensues, =6. Then the difference in
E.M.F. between two cells, one containing -25 CuSOi 100 H20
and -25 ZnSO., 100 H20, and the other containing 2-0 CuS04
 100 H20, and 5*0 ZnS04 100 H20, is the sum of these amounts,
i. e. is a— b ; so that if e is the E.M.F. of the first and E that
 of the second, E = e + a — b.
    Similarly, if three cells be compared, alike in all respects
save that the copper-sulphate solutions have (for example) the
strengths -25 CuS04, 1-0 CuS04, and 2-0 CuSO, (per 100 H20
 in each case) , the excess of E.M.F. of the second over the first
 being experimentally found =c, and that of the third over the
 second being similarly found = d, then a=c+d.
    (3) The values of a, b, c, d,             are independent, not only
 of the actual strength of the solution which does not vary in any
 two cells compared, but also of the nature of that solution and of
 the metal immersed in it.
    For example, in zinc-copper-sulphate cells with amalga
 mated zinc and electro-copper plates, the effect of a given
alteration in the strength of the zinc-sulphate solution is sen
 sibly the same whether the copper-sulphate solution be strong
   * Instead of expressing molecular strengths in the form MSO, riitfl,
 and so on, it is more convenient for certain purposes to express them in
the form n»MS04 IOOH.,0, and so on.

 286 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
 or weak; and, further, is precisely the same in zinc-cadmium-
 sulphate, or in zinc-silver-sulphate cells set up with amalga
 mated zinc plates. Similarly, the numerical value of the effect
 of a given alteration in the strength of the copper-sulphate
 solution is the same whether the zinc-sulphate solution be
 strong or weak ; and, further, is still the same in copper-
 cadmium-sulphate or copper-silver-sulphate cells set up with
 electro-copper plates *.
     (4) The values of a, b, c, d,              vary perceptibly with the
 nature of the plate-surface of the metal immersed in the varying
 solution ; i. e. they are not constant for a given difference in
 strength if the plate-surface vary. In the case of the metals
 copper, zinc, and cadmium the highest values are observed,
 cceteris paribus, with plates superficially amalgamated, the
 amalgam being fluid ; plates freshly electro-coated give lower
 values, and bright polished plates of fused metal lower values
 still.
    (5) With the majority of kinds of plate-surface examined,
 the values of a and b in the expression
                               E=e + a—b
are such that a and b are unequal in magnitude for equal
 amounts of variation in the strength of the two solutions in a
two-fluid cell. Sometimes a increases more rapidly than b in
numerical value as the solution-strength increases ; in which
case the B.M.F. of the combination rises with the strength of
the solutions when both are always of equal molecular strength:
such a case is presented by a zinc-copper-sulphate cell with
electro-zinc and amalgamated copper plates (§ 154). Some
times the opposite is the case, e. g. a zinc-cadmium-chloride
cell with amalgamated zinc and electro-cadmium plates (§ 156).
Zinc-copper-sulphate cells set up with amalgamated zinc and
electro-copper plates show the peculiarity that a and b are
nearly equal numerically for all solution-strengths; so that
the E.M.F. of such a Daniell cell is practically invariable no
matter what the strength of the solutions of zinc and copper
sulp/tate used, provided that these are of the same molecular
strength.
    (6) On contrasting the values of a,b,c,d,                      with the
B.M.F.'s corresponding to the amounts of heat developed on
intermixture of gramme equivalents of the two strengths of
the varying solution compared together, the former are usually
   * In copper-silver-sulphate cells the effect of a given increment in the

found to exceed the latter, sometimes by a very considerable
 amount.
    149. In carrying out observations by means of either the
method of opposition or that of diffusion-cells, it is obvious
 that the current observed produced through a given total re
 sistance only represents the E.M.F. due to difference of solu
 tion-strength, provided that the two zinc plates and the two
 copper plates are identical in surface-characters, and provided
 also that the current-density is small enough to reduce polari
 zation to negligible amounts. In practice it is impossible to
 ensure equality of surface with any pair of plates, even though
 prepared with the greatest care in precisely the same way
 from the same mass ; and the result is that when two plates,
 apparently identical, are immersed in the same solution, one
 is sufficiently electropositive with reference to the other to
 cause a distinctly measurable current to flow through even a
 large external resistance. In order to form some estimate as
 to the probable magnitude of this source of error, a large
 number of observations were made with pairs of zinc plates
 immersed in zinc-sulphate solutions of varying strengths, and
 pairs of copper plates immersed in copper-sulphate solutions.
 The following results in millivolts were obtained with upwards
 of 120 pairs of plates, readings being taken every few minutes
 for about half an hour after the first immersion, and being then
 averaged. As a rule the currents observed increased somewhat
 as time elapsed, so that the first readings were usually the
 minima. The galvanometer-readings were translated into volts
 by means of the formula
                       m    R,     D
  where m = the galvanometer-reading to be translated (no
                    shunt being used).

    As a general rule the weaker the solution the greater is
the average difference of potential set up between two plates,
as alike as practicable, immersed in the same fluid : ceteris
paribus, bright plates show much wider limits of variation
 than amalgamated or electro plates.
     It being impossible to ensure equality of surface-conditions
 by simply taking pains to make plates as alike as practicable,
 an approximation to the value that would have been obtained,
 had the plates been equal in surface-conditions, was arrived
 at in each experiment by the simple device of exchanging the
 plates after one series of readings had been taken, and taking
 another series of readings, averaging the two mean values thus
 obtained. In many cases the plates were exchanged twice more,
 and the general mean of all four sets of readings taken. To
 prevent alteration of solution-strength, the plates exchanged
 were always rinsed with the solution into which they were

        Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive Force.    289
about to be dipped before immersion therein. Operating in
this way, the difference between the values obtained before
and after exchanging represents double the sum of the poten
tial difference that would be set up between the plates when
opposed to one another in the same solutions respectively. It
is noteworthy that the figures thus got by exchanging plates
are of the same order of magnitude as those resulting from
the opposition of two plates of the same kind. Thus in the
above-described experiments the maximum variation observed
with amalgamated zinc plates is 1*55 millivolt, and that with
electro-copper plates "66 millivolt, giving a sum of 2"21;
whilst the corresponding average values give a sum of less
than "5 millivolt. With two opposed Daniells set up with
amalgamated zinc and electro-copper plates, the halves of the
differences observed on exchanging plates averaged less than
 •5 millivolt, sometimes, however, amounting to 1*0, and occa
 sionally, but only rarely, to 2-0 millivolts; and similarly in
 other cases.
    150. In order to eliminate errors arising from depreciation
of E.M.F. through non-adjuvancy, arising from the current-
 density being greater than the limiting-density below which
 such effects are inappreciable (" polarization "), several series
 of observations were made in order to find out what the
 limiting-densities are for different kinds of plates and fluids,
 such that the depreciation in E.M.F. shall not exceed a
 definite small quantity, say "1 to "2 millivolt. The experi
 ments already published made with single Daniell and other
 analogous cells (§§ 103-105, Part V.) show that with current-
 densities of from 10 to 20 microamperes per square centi
 metre of plate-surface (both plates being equal in area, and
 one only being reckoned), diminutions in E.M.F. of from
 1 to 6 millivolts may bo brought about, quantities in many
 cases far exceeding the potential-differences due to varying
 solution-strength to be measured. Manifestly, therefore, only
 very minute currents can be employed when two Daniell
 or other analogous cells are opposed, and consequently the
 effect of " polarization " about doubled. Similarly the ex
 periments described in Part IV. (§ 93) indicate that when
 a current passes between two zinc plates in zinc-sulphate
 solution, or between two copper plates in copper-sulphate
 solution, a "counter electromotive force" of a considerable
 number of millivolts, and even some centivolts, may be set up
  with current-densities of but a few microamperes per square
  centimetre; so that in a " diffusion-cell " serious diminutions
  in the potential-difference actually set up may be brought
 about by very small current-densities.

290 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
   In order to determine these limiting current-densities,
experiments were made in the following way. The diffusion-
cell, or pair of opposed Daniell or other cells to be examined,
was set up, as was also a normal Daniell cell for compa
rison, and the currents from each alternately sent through
a large external resistance (using appropriate shunts), series
of readings being taken in each case. The resistance was
now altered, and two fresh series of readings taken ; after
which it was again altered, and two more series taken, and
so on : usually the whole set of series of readings was
repeated in reverse order. The average scale-readings for
a series of given total resistances in circuit were thus known
both for the Daniell cell and the other one compared with it.
With the former, the product of average scale-reading and
total resistance was sensibly constant for current-densities
that caused an appreciable falling-off in the product similarly
obtained with diffusion-cells or with two opposed Daniell
cells, &c, showing that whilst " polarization did not occur
to a measurable extent in the first case, it did in the second.
The following illustration will make the point clear : two
series of readings with varying resistances were made in
reverse order with a normal Daniell cell, and with two
opposed cells jointly giving an effective E.M.F. of a little
more than one-hundredth of that of the Daniell cell; for the
former the j<fojj shunt was used, and for the latter the -j^
shunt.

 Hence with an increase of current from '06 to -08 micro
ampere, representing an increase in density from "02 to "027,
the fall in E.M.F. was barely measurable, being only '02
millivolt ; but when the current rose to "12 microampere,
giving a density of '04, the fall in E.M.F. was distinct, being
  upwards of '1 millivolt.
      151. In the same kind of way various other observations
  were made, and indicated on the whole that the effect of
  polarization in cells set up with amalgamated-zinc and electro-
 copper plates is not greater than about -2 millivolt, as long
as the current-density does not exceed about *05 microampere
 per square centimetre of plate-surface.
      Limiting values not far from this were similarly obtained with
 other kinds of zinc- and copper-plate surfaces. Accordingly
 in the observations made with these kinds of cells for the pur
  pose of estimating the variations in E.M.F. due to difference
 in solution-strength, the current-densities were never allowed
 to exceed this limit, and were usually a long way below it.
      In precisely the same kind of way the limiting values for
 various kinds of diffusion-cells were arrived at. The following
table represents some of the average results obtained, the
E.M.F.'s being expressed in millivolts:—

     It is here noticeable that the amounts of depreciation for
 given increments in current-density observed with two opposed

292 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on tlie Determination of
Daniell cells containing amalgamated-zinc and electro-copper
plates are fairly close to the sums of those similarly observed
for two diffusion-cells, one containing amalgamated-zinc and
the other electro-copper plates. The chemical action in two
opposed Daniell cells amounts to solution of copper in one
cell and deposition thereof in the other, and ditto for zinc; or
precisely the sum of the actions with two diffusion-cells.
   The amount of depreciation for a given current-density in
crease varies notably with the metal and character of surface :
thus amalgamated zinc gives less depreciation than electro-
copper, and electro-copper less than electro-zinc. Variation
in the strength of the solution used did not appear to influ
ence the result to anything like so great an extent as variation
in the nature of the plate-surfaces.
   On the whole it was found, even in those cases where the
maximum amount of depreciation was produced, that this de
preciation did not exceed from '1 to '2 millivolt, until the
current-density overpassed "02 to -03 microampere per square
centimetre. In the four cases above cited the limiting current-
densities, when the depreciation amounts to "2 millivolt,
are:—
      Two opposed Daniell cells, amalgamated-zinc and
        electro-copper plates                                       -05

          „         „ electro-copper plates                         *08
    In carrying out the observations, therefore, care was taken*
that in no case should the current-density exceed the limiting
value for the particular class of coll examined, current-den
sities of much less amount being in most cases employed; so
that, finally, the effect of u polarization" on the average values
obtained is in no case to depreciate them by a quantity so great
as "2 millivolt, and is usually insufficient to depreciate by an
amount approaching to '1 millivolt.
    152. As a general rule, it was found that when the cell (or
pair of opposed cells) to be examined was set up, compara
tively little variation in the current flowing took place during
 15 to 30 minutes; what alteration did occur being evidently
due to alteration in condition of plate-surface (by superficial
 oxidation by dissolved air, or by molecular change, i. e.
spontaneous change of state of aggregation, or by solution or
   • Owing probably to the influence of "polarization," the values obtained
by Fromme, he. cit. sttpril, do not exhibit very close concordance with one
another, nor do the mean curves thence deducible agree sharply -with
those subsequently detailed. Moser's diffusion-cell figures, on the other
hand, do not difler widely from those obtained by us.

deposition of external film as the current flowed producing
electrolysis), and being only a fraction of the variation pro
duced on exchanging plates. With bright zinc plates, how
ever, the alteration during a few minutes after setting up was
often considerable and irregular in direction. The numbers
given in the subsequent section are in all cases deduced from
the average readings of the cells during the first 15 or 20
minutes after first setting up, or after exchanging plates, as the
case might be; the mean of the two averages thus obtained
(or of the four, if three exchanges were made after taking the
first set of readings) being finally adopted as the mean value
for the particular experiment.
   As regards the experiments with the diffusion-cells, these
were ordinarily constructed of two beakers united by an
inverted Y-shaped tube, the ends of which were covered with
bladder or other thin membrane, and filled with either of the
two solutions used, one in one beaker, the other in the other:
in short, they were precisely similar to the forms of Raoult
cell used in the preceding portions of these researches. It was
thought desirable to see if any influence could be traced as
exerted by the membranes as such, and accordingly a number
of gravity diffusion-cells were set up by pouring into a long
 U-tube the stronger of the two solutions used until rather
more than half full, and then very cautiously running slowly
into one limb the weaker solution, so as to have a well-marked
line of demarcation between the two fluids. Two plates were
 then immersed in the two solutions and exchanged after
 taking readings, and so on. Both with zinc sulphate and
 copper sulphate no measurable differences could be detected
 between the average results obtained with these cells and
 with the Raoult form of cell, both sets of cells having respec
 tively the same fluids and kinds of plates; clearly proving
 that the membranes as such exercised no measurable influence
 on the results.
    As an illustration of the general character of the experiments
 made, the following observations with two opposed Daniell
 cells may be cited as an example, typical in all respects saving,
 first, that the values obtained before and after exchanging
 plates differ more than usual (for which reason this experiment
 is selected) ; and, secondly, that the galvanometer was regu
 lated so as to be considerably less sensitive than was found
 desirable for other experiments,on account of the comparatively
 large potential-difference to be measured.

   It is evident that, having regard to the impossibility of
completely eliminating errors from difference of character of
plate-surface, these numbers coincide sufficiently closely to
show that whether no current at all circulates (electrometer),
or a small current not too great to set up any notable " pola
rization," sensibly the same numbers result whether the observa
tions be made by carefully valuing separate cells and subtracting
the values from one another; by opposing two cells and measur
ing the current due to the difference in their E.M.FSs ; or by
means of diffusion-cells (representing the terminal liquids of
two opposed cells of Raoult's form, when directly connected).
The same conclusions also follow from the observations detailed
in § 154 made with copper- sulphate solution and electro-

these three sets of figures are found to coincide within reason
able error-limits, thus confirming the results arrived at above
with amalgamated zinc plates and zinc-sulphate solutions.
Further, it is noticeable that these values are all close to those
similarly obtained with zinc-sulphate solutions and amalga
mated zinc plates when similarly reduced.

   It would hence result that the E.M.F. of a Daniell cell set
np with zinc- and copper-sulphate solutions of the same mole
cular strength, and amalgamated-zinc and electro - copper
plates, cannot exhibit any very marked variation, whatever
the actual strength of the solutions, inasmuch as whatever
effect on the E.M.F. is produced by a given variation in the
strength of the zinc-sulphate solution must be very nearly
 counterbalanced by the equal and opposite effect of the same
variation in the strength of the copper-sulphate solution. If,
however, electro-zinc or bright zinc plates be used, the E.M.F.
 must rise with the strength of the solutions, the copper-sul
 phate variation effect overpowering the zinc-sulphate variation
effect. In other words, if e be the E.M.F. of the cell for a
given low strength of solution, and E that for a greater strength,
thenE = e+a— b (§ 148): with amalgamated zinc and electro-
copper plates, a nearly = 6; but with electro or bright zinc,
a<b.
   The following experiments show that the value of a, cceteris
paribus, is greater with amalgamated, but less with bright,
 than with electro copper; so that with cells set up with amal
gamated zinc plates, the value of the E.M.F. rises with the
strength of the solutions when amalgamated copper plates are
 opposed, and falls when bright copper plates are used instead.

   Curves 1 to 4 (figs. 3 and 4) represent these sets of values
respectively : it is noticeable that the curve obtained with
crystalline amalgam plate-surfaces underlies the others.
   On contrasting the first of these tables with that similarly
obtained with zinc sulphate (§ 153), and the second with that
obtained with copper sulphate (§ 154), it is evident that with
certain kinds of plates the effect of an increase in strength of
 solutions (both being always of equal strength) is to produce
an increase in E.M.F. in zinc-cadmium-sulphate cells or
cadmium-copper-sulphate cells ; and with other kinds of plates
to produce a decrease: t. e. the values of a and b in the
formula
                              ~E = e + a—b
are such that in certain cases a > b and in others b > a, precisely
as is found with zinc-copper-sulphate cells. It is noticeable
that even in the most extreme cases the difference between a
and b is never very great, rarely exceeding a few millivolts.

 XXXIV. The Temperature of Sun-spots. Reply to Prof.
        Wiedemann by Professors Liveino and Dewar*.
PROFESSOR WIEDEMANN'S Note on our paper is
       very much to the point and deserves full discussion ;
but, admitting the truth of the principles on which he rests
his argument, the conditions of the problem of solar spots do
not seem to us so simple that those principles can be directly
applied to it. We are not dealing with the radiation of a
single body at different temperatures, but with the sum of the
radiations and absorptions of a great thickness of more or less
transparent material.
   If we suppose the photosphere to consist of a cloud of liquid
or solid particles giving a continuous spectrum, most of the
radiation we get from those parts of the sun where there is no
spot will be derived from this cloud, and we shall get scarcely
any rays from the interior of the solar mass: the cloud will be
comparatively opaque, its absorption corresponding generally
to its emission. A further cooling of this cloud cannot well
produce the phenomena of spots which are characterized by a
selective absorption suggestive of a gaseous absorbent. Any
cooling of the photospheric cloud, which must be surrounded
by saturated vapour of its solid or liquid particles, would pro
duce more solid or liquid with more continuous absorption.
On the other hand, if the photospheric cloud were raised in
temperature, so that the solid or liquid particles were to a
considerable extent vaporized, we should then get rudiation
from the interior of the sun's mass, but sifted through the
vaporized photospheric matter. The total radiation would,
it is conceded, be greater now than before, but it would be
made up of the radiation of the vaporized photosphere
together with that of the sun beneath it. As regards the
former part the radiating matter would be a gas instead of
being solid or liquid, it would have changed its physical state
and therewith the character of its spectrum. The radiation
from the interior of the sun is added ; but this arises from
mutter which may be different chemically, probably is different
as to physical state, from the matter of the photospheric cloud.
The argument of Prof. Wiedemann requires a continuity in
the nature and in the state of the radiating matter ; that is to
say, it must be the same matter first and last, and it must not
change from solid to gas. Neither condition is exactly ful
filled in the case before us. Let us suppose, for the sake of
definiteness, that the photosphere consists of particles of silicon,

in the solid or liquid state, emitting a continuous spectrum ;
and that by some means it is further heated until it becomes
gaseous, as we have it in the electric arc ; it will now emit
very little visible radiation but some very strong ultra-violet
rays. The radiation from silicon in the visible part of the
spectrum appears to be not relatively but absolutely less when
it is gaseous than when it is solid. The whole argument of
the gradual shortening of the period of oscillation with increase
of temperature hangs on the supposition that there is a con
tinuity of state, which must not be assumed to be the case in
sun-spots. The phenomena of spots are those of increased
absorption by (1) increase in the number of Fraunhofer lines,
and (2) increase in their breadth or in their darkness. Now
the increase in the number of Fraunhofer lines may be due
either to an addition to the sun's atmosphere of the vapours of
some substances not usually present, or to an increase in
the rays absorbed by those which are usually present.
    Increase of temperature frequently causes vapours to emit
 (and absorb) rays not seen at lower temperatures, and increase
of temperature might add to the number of different gaseous
substances in the sun's atmosphere by evaporating materials
which had been before solid or liquid. On the other hand,
cooling might allow of the formation of chemical compounds
with absorptive powers quite different from those of their
(separate) components. We cannot then safely infer either
an increase or a decrease of temperature from an increase in
the number of Fraunhofer lines. But, turning to the in
creased width of the lines, we know no case in which such an
effect is produced by a diminution of temperature. Many
examples seem to indicate that such widening is connected
with increased density of the vapour producing the line ; not
however increased density produced by cooling, but only
increased density produced by increased evaporation, in
creased (partial) pressure of the vapour. In fact, when a line
is self-reversed (as it has been called) the dark line due to the
cooler vapour is always narrower than the bright line emitted
by the hotter vapour, even when there is no reason to think
 the hotter vapour to be more dense than the cooler, as in the
 case of the reversal of the F line of hydrogen when sparks
 are passed through hydrogen, as observed by Hasselberg

spots based on the total radiation is irrefragable; and we have

considerations very properly adduced by Professor Wiede

XXXV. Direct-Reading Electro-Measuring Instruments, and a
   Non-Sparking Key. By Professors W. E. Aykton, F.R.S.,
   and John Perky, M.E.
                             [Plate XII.]
THE construction and use of our various measuring-
       instruments are now so sufficiently well known that it is
unnecessary for us to give any general description of them ;
indeed the names " Ammeter," " Voltmeter," by which we
ventured to christen two of our children, have found favour
in the eyes of Electricians, and are now current in electrical
literature as the typical names, or surnames, of instruments
used to measure strong currents and large electromotive forces
respectively. But just as improvements in electrical measure
ments have led, step by step, to the names for the electrical
units receiving more and more exact definitions, so we now
propose to take advantage of certain important improvements
that we have recently effected in our measuring-instruments »
to define the names "Ammeter," "Voltmeter,' and "Ohm-
meter " more exactly.
    Proportional Law.—In the earliest form of instruments
commercially employed for measuring the large currents used
for electric lighting, viz. the instruments of M. Deprez, refer
ence had to be made to a table of values to ascertain the
meaning of any particular deflection, since there was no im
mediate connexion between 1 degree deflection and 1 ampere;
and, further, it was necessary to refer to the table twice over
 when measuring two different currents, as the deflections
 were not proportional to the current. By giving a proper
 shape, however, to the coil, needle, and pole-pieces of the
 controlling permanent magnet, we succeeded (in 1880) in
 producing instruments in which the current or potential dif
 ference was exactly proportional to the deflection throughout
 the whole range of the scale; and, further, by the employment
 of our commutator principle an instrument was obtained
 having two degrees of sensibility, one exactly ten times the
 other; so that a commutator ammeter, or voltmeter, although
 employed to measure strong electric currents and large po
 tential differences respectively, could be calibrated by the

                Electro-Measuring Instruments.               305
employment of a single cell of known electromotive force but
of totally unknown resistance.
   Objection* to the Employment of a Constant.—Bnt these
instruments possessed one serious fault looked at from the
user's point of view, and two others which especially concerned
the manufacturer. The scales of all the instruments were
divided into degrees; and although the deflections were pro
portional respectively to the current or the potential difference
to be measured, still there was nothing to show to how
many amperes or volts one degree of the scale corresponded.
Consequently for each instrument there was a " Calibration
Constant," such as 1*75 ampere or 2-14 volts per degree,
which was determined experimentally by the makers. We
have here two of such old type of voltmeter, in one of which
5*7 volts produce one degree deflection, and in the other
0'09 volt produces one degree ; the former being intended
for measuring electromotive forces up to about 250 volte, the
other the electromotive force of a single cell. But the em
ployment of such a constant had the very serious objection
that, as all the instruments looked exactly alike, there was the
great danger in any factory, where several of these instru
ments were in use, of the constant for one instrument being
 used accidentally for that of another. And this mistake not
only renders the answer, of course, quite wrong, but is liable
 to lead to the destruction of the instrument, or at any rate to
the breaking of the pointer, from, say, an instrument having a
 constant 0*12 ampere per degree being put on a circuit
 through which 50 amperes are flowing, in consequence of the
experimenter mistaking the "constant" for 1*2 ampere per
degree. Further, even if no mistake be made in the " con
stant," it is troublesome, except for those who are expert in
 mental calculation (a quality not always predominating in the
 men in the charge of electric-light circuits), to multiply a
 " constant " 3*17 by the deflection, say 21*32, quickly without
the employment of paper and pencil.
    We therefore decided, not merely to avoid using tables of
values such as had to be employed by M. Deprez, but even
to abandon the use of constants altogether, and to arrange
matters so that the pointer pointed at once throughout the
whole range of the scale to the number of amperes or volts to be
measured ; to design, in fact, " Direct- Reading " instruments.
And for the future we propose to confine the definition of an
" Ammeter," a " Voltmeter," and an " Ohmmeter " to instru
ments on which respectively amperes, volts, and ohms can be
immediately read off without any calculation or any reference
to a constant or table of values.

306      Professors Ayrton and Perry on Direct-Reading
   On the table there are various specimens of our new Direct-
Reading Ammeters and Voltmeters. In each case the dial is
a complete disk (see Plate XII. fig. 1), and not a sector as
in the old instrument. The lig^ht aluminium pointer is also
much longer, and the length ot the graduated arc over which
its end moves is much greater, so that readings with the new
instruments can be made much more accurately than in the
old. Here is a direct-reading ammeter suitable for measuring
up to 10 amperes, correct to a tenth of an ampere ; here an
other for measnring up to 150 amperes, each division of the
scale corresponding with one ampere. I now send a current
with these accumulators through this thick German-silver
wire, and you see at once from the deflection on this ammeter,
without any reference to a table of values, and without the
employment of any troublesome constant, that the current
passing, and which is now making the wire white-hot, is 207
amperes. Again, each division on the scale of this voltmeter
corresponds with 1 volt, this particular instrument being suit
able for measurements up to 100 volts.
   To construct a direct-reading instrument it is necessary to
employ some form of adjustment for sensibility, since to have
a special scale engraved for each instrument after it was wound
would be both troublesome and expensive ; and, further, if
there were no power of adjustment, any change in the strength
of the permanent controlling magnet would prevent the in
strument from any longer giving one division-deflection per
ampere or per volt— in other words, would necessitate the
employment of a constant.
   Difficulties of Manufacture of Older Forms.—As regards the
two defects from the manufacturer's point of view they were
these:—Even although the shape of the coil, needle, and pole-
pieces of the magnets were made accurately to templates, it
was found difficult, when very thick wire had to be coiled on
the bobbin of an instrument for measuring strong currents, to
wind it with certainty so that both the deflection was propor
tional to the current, and that equal deflections on the two
sides of the zero had exactly the same value. As long as the
wire was thin, symmetry of winding was comparatively easy
to obtain; but when thick wires, having but a few convolu
tions, were wound round a small bobbin, the thickness of the
wire, combined with the galvanometric importance of each of
the few convolutions, especially of those closest to the needle,
made it necessary to wind and rewind some of the instru
ments several times before the proportional law, as well as
equal deflections right and left, could be obtained.
   Adjustment of Direct-Reading Instruments.—It therefore

                Electro-Measuring Instruments.                307
was important, to avoid complexity of construction, that the
adjustment for sensibility referred to above should, if possible,
be so contrived as to serve also for an adjustment for the pro
portional law. And this we are happy to say we have at last
succeeded in accomplishing, by fitting into each end of the
bobbin round which the wire is wound specially constructed
charcoal-iron cores fitted with a fine screw. If these cores be
too far out or out altogether, the proportional law will pro
bably not be true, the current increasing more rapidly than
the deflection ; on the other hand, if they be screwed fully
home the proportional law will also not be true, the deflection
now increasing more rapidly than the current ; but we find
that between two limiting positions of these iron cores the
proportional law is true; and by moving the cores in or out
within these limits, the sensibility of the instrument can be
much altered without destroying the proportional law.
    To construct then, say, a 50-umpere instrument, wire is
selected of such thickness, first, that 50 amperes will not heat
it too much ; secondly, that a sufficient number of convolu
tions can be wound on the bobbin for 50 amperes to deflect
the needle to the limit of the scale when it is controlled by a
permanent magnet of normal power. A scale divided for 50
amperes (that is, having the division marked 50 amperes at
the end of its range) is then put on, and the soft-iron cores
screwed in or out a little by trial until the pointer is found to
point to exactly the same number on the dial as the number
 of amperes of current flowing through the coil. If at any
 time it be found that the permanent magnet has lost some of
 its magnetism, so that less than, say, 40 amperes will deflect
 the pointer to 40 amperes on the dial, the iron cores are un
 screwed out a very small distance until the change in the
 magnetism of the controlling magnet is exactly compensated
 for.
    The other adjustment to be employed by the makers for
equalizing the deflections right and left for the same current
is effected by fixing the coil so that it can turn about its
centre.
    The " Ten Law " of our commutator-instruments, which
 means that an ammeter is exactly ten times as sensitive when
the commutator is turned to series as when to parallel, while
a voltmeter is ten times as sensitive when the commutator is
 turned to parallel as when turned to series, is effected by
 the ten wires forming the bobbin having, inclusive of the
 resistance of the contacts at their ends, exactly the same resist
ance; which condition being fulfilled, it is quite unnecessary
for obtaining the ten-law that the ten wires composing the

 308      Professors Ayrton and Perry on Direct-Reading
  strand should be at all symmetrical in the way in which they
 are wound on the bobbin. With some of our earlier commu
 tator-instruments the resistance of the contact of the springs
 with the metallic pieces of the commutator introduced an error
  when the ten wires were each thick and short, since then the
 terminal resistance was a very material portion of the whole
 resistance of any one of the ten wires. To avoid this the
 commutators and the springs, as will be seen from the various
 specimens of the instruments on the table, which, Darwinian
 like, show the history of the survival of the fittest, have assumed
 a much larger form.
    In our direct-reading commutator-instruments the scale is
 double, as may be seen from fig. 2 ; the upper numbers
 corresponding with the number of volts when the commutator
 is to parallel, the lower when to series ; while in a Direct-
 Reading Commutator Ammeter the upper numbers correspond
 with the number of amperes when the commutator is to series,
 and the lower when to parallel.
     Fig. 3 shows the interior of the latest form.            A A is
 the bobbin round which the wire is coiled ; M M is the per
 manent controlling magnet, made in two parts to obtain
 considerable strength ; P P are the soft-iron pole-pieces of
 special shape, to be referred to further on ; F F are the soft-
 iron cores, and B B is a connecting bridge-piece of charcoal-
 iron used in our latest form of instrument for increasing the
 strength of the deflecting field for a given current by con
 necting magnetically these iron cores together. This addition
 is very important in voltmeters ; since, although in an am
meter the constant of the instrument is nearly independent of
temperature, this is not the case in a voltmeter. The current
producing a given deflection in either instrument is practically
independent of temperature ; but the potential difference
necessary to be maintained at the terminals of the instrument
to produce the current, and which potential difference is what
the voltmeter is designed to measure, depends necessarily on
the resistance and therefore on the temperature of the coil. A
temperature-correction can be easily made for the portion of
the effect arising from the temperature of the room ; but the
unknown amount of heating of the coil arising from tie pas
sage of the current is far more difficult to allow for. Hence
it is generally necessary to be contented with a weaker con
trolling permanent magnet for a voltmeter in order that the
magnetic effect necessary to produce any given deflection, and
consequently the heating effect which is proportional to the
square of this magnetic effect, shall be less in the case of a volt
meter than in an ammeter. But the employment of our soft-

                 Electro-Measuring Instruments.                 309
iron pole-pieces combined with the soft-iron bridge enables as
to use much more powerful controlling magnets, and therefore
to obtain a much greater dead-beatness, and a greater freedom
from disturbance produced by extraneous powerful magnets,
with our last form of voltmeters than with our earliest.
   German-Silver or Copper Wire for the Coil of aVoltmeter.—
It might appear at first sight that German-silver wire would
be better than copper wire for voltmeters. As regards the
error arising from the change of temperature of the room this
is undoubtedly the case, but not as regards the heating of the
coils by the passage of the current. For, to produce any
given deflection on a voltmeter provided with a given control
ling permanent magnet requires a given current for a given
number of convolutions ; hence, since the specific resistance
of German silver is about 13 times that of copper, the produc
tion of heat, which necessarily accompanies the production of
a given magnetic effect with a given instrument, will be 13
times as great if German silver be used than if copper be used.
And on account of the inferior heat-conducting power of the
German silver the elevation of temperature will be probably
more than 13 times as great. But for the same elevation of
temperature the increase of resistance of copper is only 8*8
times the increase of resistance of German silver. Consequently
copper wire will be decidedly better than German-silver in any
case where the change of resistance due to the heating pro
duced by a current flowing through a given coil is concerned.
   The question whether all the wire should be wound on the
bobbin of the voltmeter, or whether a portion only should be
on the bobbin, and the remainder of the resistance, necessary
to be employed to prevent the voltmeter shunting too much
of the main current, should be in the form of a resistance-coil,
must be answered by the consideration as to whether the total
consumption of energy which takes place when a particular
deflection is maintained in the voltmeter, or the variation,
arising from the heating of the bobbin, of the reading for a
fixed potential difference, is the more important.                  ,
   If it is desired that a particular deflection of the needle shall
be maintained with the least total consumption of energy, then
all the wire should be wound on the bobbin of the voltmeter ;
whereas if the heating-error is to be reduced to a minimum,
then a large portion of the total resistance in the voltmeter
circuit should be external to the voltmeter itself, and should
be in the form of a resistance-coil made of German-silver
wire, of sufficient thickness that its resistance is not sensibly
increased when the current necessary to deflect the pointer of
the voltmeter to the limit of its scale is maintained.

 310     Professors Ayrton and Perry on Direct-Reading
    Methods of Construction for obtaining the Proportional Law.
 —Next, with reference to the principle that must be followed
 to obtain the proportional law in galvanometers. In an ordi
 nary galvanometer controlled by the earth-magnetism, the
 strength of the controlling field is a uniform one; whereas the
 strength of the deflecting field produced by the current flow
 ing round the coil is strongest in the plane of the coil, and
grows weaker as we recede from that plane. Hence, when
the needle is deflected, it moves into a weaker part of the
 deflecting field. The result of this is that the deflections for
different currents increase much less rapidly than the current.
If both fields be uniform for all positions of the needle, and be
at right angles to one another when the needle is in its zero
position, then, as is well known, the tangent of the deflection
increases proportionately to the current. In order, then, that
the deflection may increase proportionately with the current,
one of three conditions must be fulfilled:—(1) the needle when
deflected must move into a stronger part of the deflecting-
field, or (2) must move into a weaker part of the controlling-
field, or (3) both these results must be true. The first con
dition (uniformity of controlling-field combined with increase
of strength of deflecting-field) can be fulfilled by using two
solenoids at a small distance apart from one another, but with
a common axis, and suspending the needle between them so
that, on being deflected, it enters the solenoids and therefore
moves into a stronger part of the solenoid field ; or it may
be fulfilled by a plan carried out practically by two of our
assistants, Messrs. Walmsley and Mather, and which consists in
suspending a magnet over two coils, C C, wound as shown by
the dotted lines in fig. 4, the distance between the coils being
rather less than the length of the needle.
   This latter mode has been employed in our laboratory for
making students' rough galvanometers, a specimen of which
you see in its embryo state on the table, and with which the
deflections are accurately proportional to the current at any
rate up to 45° or 50°. If, however, a dead-beat instrument
is required, then, in order to ensure roughly uniformity of
controlling-field, the pole-pieces, P P, of the permanent mag
net, M M, must be hollowed out, as shown in fig. 5, and must
embrace the tube, T, in which the needle moves. We have
made a number of ammeters and voltmeters of this type, and
a sample one dissected is on the table. The augmentation of
strength of the deflecting-field is still further produced by
the employment of the soiMron cores F F referred to above,
and which screw into the brass bobbin A A.
   But the condition 3 (the needle moving into a stronger part

                Electro-Measuring Instruments.                 311
of the deflecting-field and also into a weaker part of the con
trolling-field) is the one we find the best, and it is the one we
are using in all our latest experiments, the interior of one of
which is shown in fig. 3.
    Change of Strength of the Controlling-Magnet.—In some of
our instruments we have found that the constant did not
suffer sensible change during a period of many montbs ; in
others that the change during a much less time, arising from
the falling-off of the strength of the controlling-magnet, was
very serious. This latter effect we believe to be partly due to
inferiority in the steel, it being very difficult to obtain succes
 sive deliveries of magnet-steel from the same manufacturer
 equally good in quality; and partly from the way in which the
armature, attached to the instrument when not in use, was
 removed from the magnet when about to be used. In some
 of our older instruments, from the form of construction, the
 mode of removal of the armature took rather the form of a
 pull, which is known to be bad for the permanency of a
 magnet. Consequently our new Non-Commutator Instru
 ments are so arranged as to make it impossible to use arma
 tures at all, while in our Commutator Instruments armatures
 are attached ; but the instrument is so constructed that the
 armature A (fig. 2) can only be removed by a pure sliding
 motion ; and we shall thus be able to ascertain experimen
 tally whether no armature at all, or an armature put on and
 removed by a pure sliding action, is the better for keeping the
 controlling-magnet constant in its strength. We anticipate,
 however, that no armature at all will be the preferable plan.
                             Ohmmeters.
     An ohmmeter, as we have already said, we define to be an
 instrument in which the pointer points at once to the number
 of ohms required to be measured. The method we employ
 for making such an instrument consists in fixing two coils, at
  right angles to one another, acting on the same soft-iron
 needle. One of these coils, having terminals T T (PI. XII.
 fig. 6), is made of thick wire, and is placed in series with the
 resistance to be measured ; while the other, having terminals
 1 1, is composed of very fine wire, and is put as a shunt to the
 unknown resistance. Hence the main current produces its
 effect by means of the thick wire coil, and the difference of
 potentials at the terminals of the unknown resistance on the
 fine wire coil. Now by properly proportioning the shapes of
 coils, and by winding these coils in a definite way, we have
 obtained an instrument in which the deflection of the pointer
 is exactly proportional to the number of ohms, and which wo

312              Professors Ayrton and Perry cm
find most convenient for measuring the resistance of any parts
of an electric-light circuit ; such as the field-magnet of a
dynamo, or the resistance of an arc-lamp while the strong cur
rent is flowing. The thick coil is always kept, like an ammeter,
in the main circuit, and the terminals 1 1 of the fine wire coil
are attached to any two points, the resistance between which, at
any particular moment, it is desired to know. The use of this
instrument also permits the employment of an iron wire, or
 even of a bit of wet rope, as a resistance-coil for experimental
Eurposes, the resistance of the iron wire or of the wet rope
  9ing determined with the ohmmeter at the moment the expe
riment is being made.
    Sir William Thomson has recently proposed a new unit, a
" Mho," the reciprocal of an ohm, on account of the difficulty
which is found in making people realize that one thousandth
of an ohm may be of great importance when you are dealing
with a large current. But we do not propose graduating our
ohmmeters as mhometers, an operation of course quite simple
to effect ; because, first, if it be found that practical men can
not be got to pay attention to a thousandth of an ohm, we
venture to think that they can probably be got to appreciate
its value if it be called a thousand microhms ; just as practical
men do not disregard the capacity of a mile of submarine
cable when called, as it always is, a third of a microfarad,
although, possibly, they might do so if it were spoken of as
a three millionth of a farad ; and, secondly, a still greater
objection to the adoption of the word "mho," ingenious as
is this suggestion of Sir William Thomson's (like all his
other suggestions), is that the constants in connexion with
conductivity, the reciprocal of resistance, are quite different
from those connected with resistance. For example, take the
case of increase of resistance with temperature. Let R be
the resistance of a wire at a temperature <° C, and H0 that at
0°C.;then                  R=R0(l+a<),
where a is the increase of resistance per ohm per degree. Now
let C and C0 be the respective conductivities ; then
                          C=C0(l-a'0,
where a' is the decrease per unit of conductivity per degree
of temperature.                   _ l
   But since                         C'

   When a t and aft are small, as in German silver, the per
centage increase of resistance per degree equals the percentage
decrement in conductivity per degree ; but if at is large, as
in copper, this is not the case ; so that while "388 is the per
centage increase of resistance of copper per degree, '293 is the
percentage decrement of conductivity per degree.
   Non-sparking Key.—Various so-called non-sparking keys
have been devised during the last year or two ; but, as far as
we are aware, they by no means completely fulfil their object.
On breaking a circuit through which a currrent is flowing, a
spark is produced the brilliancy of which depends on the
coefficient of seif-induction of the circuit, and on the current
flowing through the circuit just before the circuit was broken.
To completely avoid this spark, the energy stored up in the
circuit must be utilized to send a current through an unbroken
circuit, and this can be accomplished if the resistance of the
circuit, instead of being suddenly varied from a small value
to infinity, is increased steadily by the insertion of a resist
ance increasing at a proper rate. If it increases too quickly,
a spark will certainly take place ; if too slowly, the wire of
the resistance-coil which has been added to the circuit will be
dangerously heated.
   Fig. 7 (Plate XII.) shows an arrangement which we have
devised for introducing this resistance at a proper rate, inde
pendently of any control on the part of the person stopping
the current. To start the current, the handle H is turned
moderately quickly until a solid piece of metal comes into con
tact with the brush B, when a catch holds the key in that
position, and which is the position shown in the figure. The
current now passes from one of the binding-screws to the
other through practically no resistance. To stop the current
the little handle, h, is slightly pulled, when a spring, S, which
was coiled up when the handle was turned round to put the
current on, causes the cylinder to turn in the opposite direc
tion, the various metallic pins on the right-hand side coming,
in succession, into contact with the brush B, until finally the
pins M made of ebonite, and not of brass, come into contact
with the brush B, and the circuit is entirely broken. Between
each of the metallic contact-pins there is a resistance varying
from a small fraction of an ohm for the first coil to some
hundreds of ohms for the last. The effect is, then, that resist
ance at a perfectly definite rate is added to the circuit before
breaking it.
   These resistances are adjusted partly by calculation and
partly by trial ; so that with the particular rate of rotation
which the coiled spring S gives to the barrel of the key, the

circuit of an A Gramme machine sending a fairl}- strong cur
rent can be broken by the use of this key without any visible
spark.
   The spring S, combined with the locking-arrangement,
makes it impossible for the key to be left partly on or off. If
not put so that tho current flows without resistance, then the
spring S breaks the circuit altogether.
    Besides the advantage this key affords of being able to break
 an entire electric-light circuit without spark, it is possible that
 another advantage may be produced, viz. that the life of
 incandescent lamps may be increased by the current passing
 through them being always gradually diminished to nothing,
 instead of being stopped as is at present the common practice;
 but whether this second advantage exists, which, however,
 seems extremely probable, time of course alone can prove.
    At any rate the existence of a Non-Sparking Key now makes
 it possible for Insurance Companies to turn their attention to.
 the question of prohibiting sparking altogether, which hitherto
 it has been almost useless contemplating.

 The Classification of the Cambrian and Silurian Mocks, being the
    Sedgwick Prize Essay for the Year 1882. By John E. Mahb,
    M.A., F.G.S., Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge. 8vo.
    Pp. 147. Deighton, Bell & Co.
  OF the many wars in which the " fighting geological " has been
        engaged, none have been carried on with more persistence than
  the almost continuous fight over the body of the ' Old Greywacke,"
  which was broken up by those two paladins of geology, Sedgwick and
  Murchison, some fifty years ago. If the author of this classification
  be correct, the previous confusion of the Greywacke became more
  elaborate in consequence of the errors of the founder of the Silurian
  System, which was based, we are told, according to an American
  geologist and an impartial judge, upon a series of stratigraphical
  mistakes which are scarcely paralleled in the history of geological
  investigation.
     In consequence of their conviction of the general inapplicability
  of previous classifications, some authorities, in the light of more
  recent studies of these rocks and their contents, have desired to
  abandon the historical classification in favour of one which they
  consider more natural. To this the author demurs ; and the object
  of the Essay is to show that the historical and natural classifica
  tions coincide, provided we accept the arrangement and subdivisions
  proposed by Sedgwick rather than those of Murchison. The latter,
  in consequence of his official position, was enabled to keep adding

                     Notices respecting New Books.                   315
  fresh slices to his domain carved out of his rival's territory, so
  that ultimately his Silurian embraced every thing of the Old Grey-
  wacko save a few barren slates.
     Considering that the present work is a Sedgwick Prize Essay
  written by a distinguished young geologist, who has made the
  Lower Palaeozoic Bocks his especial study, it is not surprising that
  he should have accepted a brief for the plaintiff in the great case
  of Sedgwick v. Murchison, and that he should regard all compromise
  in a suit, which seems likely to be transmitted from generation to
  generation, as only throwing the nomenclature into worse confu
  sion. Mr. Marr is, in fact, on this occasion the exponent of the
 views of the Cambridge School, which also find an able advocate in
 the eloquent successor of Sedgwick who now fills the Woodwardian
 Chair. These men are determined that justice shall be done,
 though late, to the illustrious author of the Cambrian System.
    In his introduction the author clears the ground, as it were, by
 indicating what he considers to be the principles of classification ;
  and, moreover, points out the errors arising from field geologists
 having formed lists of fossils belonging to certain series, which
 contain some wrong determinations, whereby the number of fossils
 apparently common to two different systems may be increased.
 Then follows a dissertation on the position of the boundary-line
 between the Cambrian and Silurian Systems, which the author
 considers to be marked by a strong unconformity in most areas.
 And here it should be noted that the Silurian System is for him
 more or less coincident with the Upper Silurian of the Geological
 Survey, whilst his Cambrian System includes the rest of the Lower
 Palaeozoic beds down to the pre-Cambrian rocks. He then gives a
 brief description of the Cambrian and Silurian Rocks of the British
 Isles, followed by a further description of their occurrence on the
 European continent and in America. These descriptions are
 fortified by numerous lists of characteristic fossils, which form no
 inconsiderable portion of the entire work, and bear witness to a
most creditable amount of palaeontological knowledge. A brief
conclusion is followed by tables of British and foreign fossils ; but
no attempt is made to show the percentage of fossils common to
two subdivisions, since the Author considers such tables to be
misleading in the present state of our knowledge.
    In order to establish his position the author masses his forces on
 two points. Firstly, to show that the break at the base of the Silurian
(t. e. Upper Silurian) is one of the highest importance ; secondly,
to prove that there is no such break in any portion of SedgwickV
Cambrian.
    1. Break between Sedgwick's Cambrian and the overlying Silurian.
—It will be remembered that in 1879 Prof. Lapworth expressed
his opinion that the local unconformities between the Balas and
Llandeverics had been made too much of, and he argued for their
 being in the main stratigraphically concordant nearly all over the
 world. But Mr. Marr assures us that he has seen evidence of a
 physical discord not only in the typical area, but also in the North
                                  Y2

                    Notices respecting New Books.
of England, Scandinavia, and Bohemia. Where such important
witnesses differ so materially in their interpretation of the facts,
those less versed in the stratigraphy of the Lower Palaeozoics can
scarcely hope to arrive at any very definite conclusion. Yet in
some places the unconformity would seem not to be restricted to
the same horizon. So much confusion arises out of the double
nomenclature which now prevails that the issues are less clear
than they might be. Nevertheless the base-line cannot be so
self-evident when a portion of the Llandovery rocks were at one
time classed with the Bala, and formed part of what is usually
 known as Lower Silurian, but were subsequently separated from
 the Bala series and transferred to the Upper Silurian. Moreover,
in the table at p. 22 we find that, whilst Sedgwick, Lyell, Hicks,
 and Lapworth drew the line at the base of the Lower Mayhill,
 Murchison, Jukes, Phillips, and the Geological Survey drew the
line at the base of the Upper Mayhill. Even granting that these
latter were altogether wrong, it is evident that the exact position
 of this great break has not been so easy to determine in the
 typical areas.
   When we come to the palaeontological evidence we are almost
aghast at the discrepancy between the calculations of Mr. Ethe-
ridge, as announced in his first Presidential Address, and Mr. Marr's
conclusions. " Analysis shows that, of the 613 Caradoc species,
103 pass to the Lower Llandovery (Upper Bala of Sedgwick) ;
but, strange as it may appear, 107 are common to the Caradoc and
Upper Llandovery, although we know of the stratigraphical break
which occurs between the two formations. This relation is chiefly
through the Actinozoa, Hydrozoa, and Brachiopoda, as we might
expect from their bathymetrical position and habitat " (Q. J. G. S.
vol. xxxvii. p. 134). Well may Mr. Marr enter a caveat against the
method of percentages ! Moreover, if these calculations are sound
they are equally fatal to Prof. Lapworth's " Ordovician" as a system
but this point must be left for specialists to decide.
   It is only proper to mention in this connect;on that Prof. F.
Schmidt, referring to the Baltic provinces of Russia, recognizes a
very marked distinction in the fauna of the Upper and Lower
Silurian, no intermediate group like the English Llandovery being
observed. " There is a clear break with us in the development of
organic life, notwithstanding the fact that the physical conditions
remain the same, for the Upper Silurian strata consist of Lim
stones and Marls, like those of the Lower Silurian " (Q. J. G. 8.
vol. xxxviii. p. 525). Notwithstanding the distinction in their respec
tive faunas, this physical resemblance yields additional testimony to
the systematic unity subsisting between the Silurian (Upper Silu
rian) and Ordovician (Lower Silurian) ; and such is evidently Prof.
Schmidt's opinion, who regards the whole series of strata in the
Baltic provinces as one system, because all the strata are arranged
conformably, and the whole is covered unconformable by the Devo
nian, the connecting lowest Devonian stages being altogether
unrepresented. Thus the stratigraphical conditions are, in some

                       Notices respecting New Books.                 317
    respects, the reverse of what obtains in most parts of the area west
    of the Severn, where a confused and irregular unconformity, or series
   of unconformities, reigns about the horizon represented by the
   Llandoverie8.
       2. Absence of important break in Sedgwick's Cambrian.—The
   Sedgwickian, desirous of establishing the systematic unity of all
   the Palaeozoic rocks below the base of the May Hill, is bound to
   minimize the gaps and changes occurring between the Bala, Llan-
   deilo, Arenig, Tremadoc, Lingula Flags, Menevian, and Harlech,
   which he alleges were, with the exception of the last, swallowed
   one after another by the voracious Murchison. Hence Mr. Marr,
  whilst approving of the strong line drawn between the Silurian and
   Ordovician (i. e. between the Upper and Lower Silurian), affirms
  that Prof. Lapworth has drawn " another line between Ordovician
  and Cambrian at a position where there is no break." This is at
  the base of the Lower Arenig. Substantially we presume that this
  line coincides with the one adopted by Lyell and Hicks in 1871.
  Whether right or wrong, it is at least important to note that the
  two men, who have done more than any others to work out the
  obscure and difficult palaeontology of the Lower Palaeozoics, viz.
  Hicks and Lapworth, are in substantial agreement as to where a
  sharp line should be drawn, and they therefore restrict the term
  Cambrian to the series below the base of the Arenig. Mr. Marr,
  however, finds that in the lists of the Tremadoc fossils given in the
  Cambridge catalogue nearly 60 per cent, of the genera range into
  the Arenig rocks, and not 20 per cent, into the Ffestiniog or Lingula
 Flags ; and he further quotes Mr. Etheridge (Mem. Geo!. Survey)
 to the effect that, out of 85 Tremadoc species recorded, 15 pass
 upwards into the Arenig rocks, and only 8 downwards into the
 Lingula Flags.
     Surely this is a little unfair of Mr. Marr after his general
 disclaimer of the method of percentages ! He seems inclined to use
 this method when it suits his purpose, and we are thus forced to
 the conclusion that if it told in his favour he would not hesitate to
adopt it elsewhere. Let us see how Mr. Etheridge explains the
 fact in his Presidential Address (Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. xxxvii.
p. 98). " More than 50 per cent, of the species pass (from the
Tremadoc) to the Arenig, or 11 genera and 16 species. These few
species little affect the question of the palaeontological break that
takes place here: for 40 new genera and 133 new species make
their appearance in the succeeding Arenig, through some physical
changes accompanying the zoological, which we have not yet been
able satisfactorily to discover. Unconformity between this group
and the Arenig is not known in the typical areas of South and
North Wales ; but at no time in the history of the lowest Palaeozoic
rocks has apparent extinction on the one hand, and migration from
some unknown area on the other, taken place so markedly."
Hence the late President of the Geological Society is clearly in
accord with Messrs. Hicks and Lapworth as to the magnitude of the
palaeontological break at the base of the Arenig.

318                  Notices respecting New Books.
    Although there seems to be no unconformity in Wales about
this horizon, yet in some countries there is a marked change in the
lithology ; and here we would again refer to Prof. Schmidt. Had
the Lower Palasozoics been first studied on the southern shores of
the Gulf of Finland there would have been less difficulty in arriving
at a definite classification before the personal element had produced
any bias on the subject. Moderate in thickness, regular in deposi
tion, devoid of the convolutions and dislocations inseparable from
mountain-chains, these ancient and in many places highly fos-
siliferous beds have been quietly raised so as to form the southern
wing of a gently sloping anticlinal. We have already seen that, in
this region, the beds containing the second and third faunas (practi
cally those above the base of the Arenig) consist of limestones and
marls with insignificant layers of sandstone. Below this line the
beds are entirely formed of sandstone, clay, and shale ; they contain
fossils, but no Primordial Trilobites of the Paradoxides or Olenus
group : hence their identification with the first fauna is not so
certain. In whatever way they may be correlated ultimately, the
beds in the Baltic Provinces exhibit an important physical change
 somewhere about the base-line of the equivalents of the Arenig.
    Turning now to Bohemia, we find a very important break about
 this horizon, " as shown by the absence of the Olenus fauna, and
the occurrence of a conglomerate resting unconformably upon the
 Pa/arfoxiefo-bearing beds " (p. 1 15). Mr. Marr would no doubt say
that, judged by the Welsh standard, this break was below the Trema-
 doc horizon rather than above it, simply because beds with an admix
 ture of ' primordial ' and ' second ' forms succeed in the Bohemian
 area. Such a point is of minor importance : the main fact to
 be learned both in Bohemia and on the shores of the Gulf of Fin
 land is, that in the one case a marked unconformity, in the other
 an entire lithological change occurs in the very heart of his hero's
 Cambrian, and that, too, not so very far from the line where the
 great influx of new forms, alluded to by Mr. Etheridge, occurs in
 the Welsh area.
     In conclusion, we may remark that, apart from all personal ques
 tions, there really do seem good grounds for accepting the ideas
 of Schmidt and Barrande as to the systematic unity of the
  Palajozoic rocks below the Old. Bed Sandstone. It is one system
  with three large divisions, and the lines which mark off these
  divisions will be magnified or minimized according to the school to
  which a given writer may happen to belong. Provided that no
  names are used, we can allude to the first, second, and third faunas
  of the Lower Palaeozoic rocks with comparative safety ; but once
  let a name be used, and the dogs in the opposite camps begin to
  bark immediately. This arises from a not unnatural desire to have
  a share of the bone ; and it does seem unjust that the biggest dog
  of all should be allowed to walk ofE with the whole of it. But,
  after all, this question of names is a barren and profitless logomachy
  which ought not to be allowed to obscure the real issue. Altering
  somewhat the terms of Prof. Lapworth's conclusion, let us say

                   Notices respecting New Books.                     319
that Nature has distributed the Lower Palaeozoic rocks in three
nearly equal subsystems ; and the problem awaiting solution is to
find a name which shall cover the entire system, and three other
names of subordinate value for each member of this remarkable
triad.
The Parallel Roads of Olenroy ; their Origin and Relation to the
    Glacial Period and the Deluge. By James Macfadzean. 8vo.
    149 pages, with a map. Menzies and Co. : Edinburgh [1883J.
This is a thoughtful work, full of the results of the author's read
ing, by which he has collected arguments and facts to elucidate his
views of the origin of these " Parallel Eoads." He mentions all
the hypotheses that have been framed to account for these local
terraces :—namely, (1) an artificial origin by human agency ;
 (2) natural, by a flood, (3) by the sea, by lakes dammed up, (4)
 by an undetermined obstacle, or (5) by debris, or (6) by ice. The
 authors and references are carefully mentioned. After describing
 the " Eoads " and the hillsides on which they are, he states his
 objections to the glacial theory of their origin ; and ultimately
 shows that these terraces were formed, not during a gradual emer
 gence of the land, but during its subsidence, and that the several
 levels or stages were connected with the successive tidal conditions
 obtaining in the several bays (now glens) opening on the two sides
 of the sinking land. These stages were formed by the tidal waters
 gradually overstepping the dividing cols, and by the resulting posi
 tions of the cotidal lines then existing round the British Isles (p. 31),
 and modifying the coating of debris on the mountains by average
 high-tides at certain levels. The play and action of the tides
 under all the presumed circumstances of the case are carefully
 described by the author, and dealt with for each of the terraces.
 It was the rise of the sea of the Glacial Period in the North-
 Atlantic basin that invaded and terraced these Highlands ; and the
 author sees his way to account for its retreat without having
 effaced the terraces (p. 44).
    The evidences of the great rise and fall of the oceanic waters,
 the author finds in connection with the distribution of the early
 and the late Tertiary deposits, respectively, in different regions of
  the earth. In the North-Atlantic and South-Pacific quarters of
  the globe he finds the land to have been high in the early Tertiary
 period ; but at the close of that great period the level of the ocean
  was reversed in the four quarters, the water having retired from
 the other two quarters to invade the North-Atlantic and South-
  Pacific areas. Northern Europe became an Archipelago ; and co-rela
  tive facts are noticed for New Zealand and Australia (p. 20). The
  local differences, such as the two meridian lines of maximum
  change of level and two of no change, are carefully pointed out
  (p. 107).
     To account for these great oscillations of level, the author treats

320                Notices respecting New Books.
of the shifting of the axis of the earth, and its cause (p. 20), which
he assumes to be the temporary accumulation of ice and snow at
two quarters of the globe (as the South Pacific and the North
Atlantic), which would increase the momentum, resulting in this
case in the Equator being drawn further north on the meridian of
Greenwich, and further south on the meridian of New Zealand
(p. 24). The absence of the Gulf-stream allowed the European
Archipelago to be cooler than it is at the present time (p. 77).
A very interesting and suggestive chapter contains the author's
views of the general destruction of terrestrial mammals by the
oscillation of the great waters, or waves of translation, in the
Drift or Glacial Period ; but the survival of such as could swim,
float on trees, or otherwise escape during floods is carefully indi
cated (p. 64). The destruction of man also during such a cata
strophe is well thought of, and the " palaeolithic" people, as distin
guished from the " neolithic," are referred to as having disappeared
simultaneously with those Quaternary mammals which then became
extinct (p. 76). The possible effects of a wave of translation pass
ing over rivers running transverse to its direction, and to others
coinciding with it, are also argued, and the probable mixing of
gravels and included stone implements (whether originally scattered
or hoarded), of different ages and conditions, is noticed (p. 80
Ac.).
   The effect of the great oscillation of land and water on the
distribution of plants is also treated of (p. 92).
   The author next takes up the subject of the Mosaic Deluge, in
which and its results be finds a close resemblance to the effects of the
waves of translation of the Glacial Period. After this era he
regards the British Isles and New Zealand as having respectively
stood from 700 to 1000 feet higher (than at present), and the two
reciprocal quarters of the globe as having been correspondingly
depressed, the ocean covering the Pampas of South America in the
 one, and all the flat Tundras of Eastern Siberia in the other. The
elevation of the land in the North-Atlantic and South-Pacific areas
brought on a second Glacial Period over each of these quarters of
the sphere : and the glacial conditions again brought the same
 forces into play that produced the great Tertiary shifting of the axis
of rotation. This great Post-tertiary oscillation had its meridian of
maximum effect probably near 30° W. of Greenwich. The grada
tions of elevation and the relative position of the Equator are also
referred to (p. 107). Geological and geographical observations
bearing on this discussion are given in full.
   The last cosmical change of level (p. 126) is argued out with the
same industrious collection of facts in geography and history ;
and it is shown that in the North Atlantic and South Pacific there
has been a gradual elevation, and in the South Atlantic and North
Pacific a gradual depression, during the last stage of the world's
history. The collection of facts relating to elevatory movements
in the Pacific area will be of interest to those who do not accept

  Dr. Darwin's view of the formation of the coral-atolls and barrier-
  reefs during depression (p. 131 &c.). The author's search for a
  true cause of the Parallel Roads has thus led him, in his somewhat
  discursive chapters, to a world-wide view of marine conditions
  and movements and their apparent periodicity. He has chosen
  to the best of his judgment, and certainly in good faith, very much
  that supports his views, both as to the direct cause of the long
  terraces under notice, and the wide-spread conditions that may
  have been more distantly concerned in its operation. Both to
  those specially interested in these terraces of the Highland Glens,
  and to those who like to study cosmical changes and great
  terrestrial modifications, this book offers many good suggestions
  and much to think over.

 J. J. H. Teall, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
    The author described the stratigrsphical relations and the struc
 ture, macroscopic and microscopic, of a number of dykes which
 occur in the north-cast of England, giving analyses. He pointed
 out that they fell into four more or less distinct groups :—
       (1) The Cleveland dyke and that of Acklington.
       (2) The Heth and its related dykes.
       (3) The dykes of Hebburn, of Tynemouth, of Brunton, of
              Hartley, and of Morpeth.
       (4) The High Green dykes.
    Groups (1) and (3) resembled one another in specific gravity and
chemical composition, as did (2) and (4), the percentage of silica
in the first two (except in the Morpeth dyke) varying from 57 to 59,
and the specific gravity being about 2-7 or 2-8, while the others had
a silica percentage of from 51 to 53 and a rather higher specific
gravity. The former present some microscopic differences, the latter
are very closely related. The Cleveland, Acklington, and Heth
dykes have been examined at intervals far apart, and exhibit no

 322                     Geological Society :
 variation or relation to the surrounding rocks ; so that evidently
 they have not taken up any appreciable portion of the material
 through which they have broken. The dykes of Group (3) being
 probably Pre-tertiary (the author does not himself find it possible
 to distinguish igneous rocks by their geologic age) would be termed
 melapbyres on the continent ; but those of (2) and (4) are nearer
 to the group of diabases. The Cleveland dyke (Group 1) is almost
 certainly of Tertiary age, and its structure and composition entitle
 it to the name of an augite-andesite.

lower than the present brine-cavities, towards the north-east of
 Droitwich—a conclusion which receives support from the deeper
 borings carried on at the Stoke works. Full details of these and
 other recent borings were given by the author.

    The following communications were read :—
    1. "On the Volcanic Group of St. Davids." By the Eev. Prof.
J. F. Blake, M.A., F.G.S.
    The result of tho author's examination of the rocks in the district
of St. Davids which have been designated Dimetian, Arvonian, and
Pebidian, is that they belong to one volcanic series, whose members
are those usually recognized in eruptive areas, and whose age is
anterior to, and independent of, the true Cambrian epoch.
    The independence of this series and the Cambrian is shown by the
nature of the junction at all points of the circuit that have been
seen. In a bay west of Nun's Chapel the junction on the beach is
actually a faulted one, the conglomerate being cut out, and the
amount of ashy rock seen comparatively small. To the west of
this all ashes have been cut out, granite and slate being in
contact, to the east: at Caerbwdy there is a quarter of a mile
across the ashes. This shows discordance. In the Solva valley
the beds beneath the conglomerate are again different, and up
the higher reach the series on the north and south side are quite
distinct, showing a fault. At Trehenliw the conglomerate is absent,
at Ogof Goldfa there is a forked fault. South of Castell the conglo
merates and slates strike directly at the consolidated ashes, and at
Carn-ar-wig tho conglomerate is actually seen overlying unconlbrm-
ably green ashes and agglomerates, silky schists being in the neigh
bourhood, but nowhere near the visible junction. At Ogof Llesugn

         Prof. Blake on the Volcanic Group of St. Davids.           323
  the appearances are due to the intrusion along a fault of a diabase
  dyke which has caught up large fragments of granite, felsite, and
  conglomerate, and cemented them in its substance ; but the granite
  scarcely anywhere comes in contact with the conglomerate, and is
  nowhere intrusive. The junctions in the Allan valley are all faulted
  with forked faults, some reversed, others normal, the intervening
  mass often decaying.
     The supposed isocline west of the granitic mass cannot be verified
  on an examination of the coast-section, there being great irregularity
  and gentle synclinals not far from where the apex of the isocline
  should be.
     "With regard to the nature of the rocks which thus antedate the
  Cambrian, the author was unable to recognize any true alternations
  in the materials of the granitic axis, though the rock is a peculiar
  one in the arrangement of its constituents. The felsitic rocks are
  not independent of the granite, as they surround it on all sides, the
  line along the north and south being specially traced. They are
  also often intrusive into the ashes, and hence can have no definite
  strike. The general features of these rocks are therefore most
  easily to be matched in such volcanic districts as that of Mull.
     These results are confirmed by the structure of two outlying
  masses, one at Ramsey Island, the other south of Points Castle. In
  the former, at Forth Hayog, quartz-porphyry is succeeded by a band
  of rhyolite showing flow-structure, and this by ashes and agglo
  merates. On the South Cam is a mass showing perlitic structure
  and contorted lines of flow, and on the north, at Pwll Heudre, largo
  masses of banded spherulite of somewhat doubtful character, and an
  apparent strike of E. and W. The conglomerate in this area has
  many pebbles of the associated rocks. In the latter area we have a
 similar series separated by a fault from the Cambrian rocks, and
 consisting of banded felsites, weathering into apparent beds of very
 irregular lie, and followed by an ashy series.
    The mass which lies to the east and terminates at Roche Castle
 does not present sufficient similarity to these to be included in the
 same description. The Roche-Castle rock, however, instead of being
 bedded, was originally andesitic or trachytic, the felspar crystals
having been replaced by pseudomorphous quartz.
    Attention was drawn to the highly acid character of the whole
series, and to the small size of the centres of eruption, and it was
suggested that such centres have continually decreased in number
and increased in magnitude during geological time.

   The following communications were read :—
   1. " On the Serpentine and associated Rocks of Porthalla Cove."
By J. H. Collins, Esq., F.G,8.
   In a paper read before the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall
in November 1879 the author described the rocks at Porthalla Cove
as consisting of much-contorted strata of slaty green and red ser
pentine- and hornblende-rocks, which he regarded as " highly altered
Lower Silurian stratified rocks." Prof. Bonney has since (Q. J.
G. S. vol. xxxix. p. 1) described the same rocks, and explained
the structure of the district quite differently, correlating the rocks
with those of his " Archaean metamorphic series " at the Lizard.
The author in the present paper argued in support of his previously
expressed opinion.
   He stated that within a space of little more than 100 yards the
following varieties of rocks may be distinguished :—1. Crumpled
shales and slates, sometimes containing veins and layers of quartz
and flakes of mica ; passing into 2, greenish slates of talcose appear
ance ; passing into 3, soft and shaly mudstone ; passing into 4, red
and green bands of serpentine ; often passing into 5, hornblende-
schists of the type characterizing the locality ; and 6, pinkish or
greyish granulite. No. 1 he regarded as belonging to a younger
series than the rest ; nos. 2 and 6 are the rocks supposed to repre
sent Prof. Bonney's micaceous group of the Archaean series ; and
no. 4 was regarded by the latter as intrusive.
   The author stated that the slates, shales, serpentine, and horn
blende-schist appeared to him to be distinctly interstratified, and
the granulite to be distinctly intrusive. At Nelly's Cove, about
half a mile north of Porthalla, there are a few thin bands of black
limestone, like those of Gerrard's Bay and also containing frag
ments of Crinoids ; these were regarded by the author as of Lower
Silurian age, and as underlying the Porthalla rocks considered by
Prof. Bonney to represent the Archaean metamorphic scries of the
Lizard Head. The author discussed at considerable length the
arrangement and relations of these rocks, and gave chemical analyses
of many of them, dwelling especially upon the comparative analyses
of a " talcose slate " from Porthalla and of one from the Lizard, the
latter regarded as characteristic of Prof. Bonney's Archaean mica
ceous series at that locality. The differences shown by these analyses
he considered incompatible with the identity ascribed to the two
rocks. The serpentine of Porthalla he regarded as produced from
the hornblende-schist (itself a metamorphosed Silurian rock) by an
extreme alteration caused by the action of the magncsian salts ex
isting in sea-water, probably during a period of marine submer
gence. Although regarding the granulite as well as the gabbro of
the district as intrusive, he thought that the existing contortions of

              Mr. Doughty on the Geology of Arabia.              325
the rocks need not be referred to the introduction of any intrusive
rock, but to a more general agency, namely, that which produced
the ancient axis of elevation off the east coast of Cornwall, in the
line of the Eddystone, and parallel to the general granitic axis of
the Cornish peninsula.
   2. " Outline of the Geology of Arabia." By C. M. Doughty, Esq.
Communicated by Prof. T. G. Bonney, D.Sc., F.R.S., Sec. G.S.
   The author described the general outline of the geology of a
considerable district in the western part of Arabia, over which he
had travelled. It was not in his power to enter into details, espe
cially as regarded the sedimentary rocks, because the circumstances
under which his journey was undertaken made it impossible to
bring back specimens. There was, however, considerable simpli
city in the geological structure of the country. The igneous rocks
consisted of granites and basalts, the latter breaking through the
former. The sedimentary rocks, which are newer than the granites
and, in fact, rest upon them, consist of—
    (a) A yellowish sandstone, with stains of a reddish or greenish
colour and veins of ironstone. In this, for example, the rock-
tombs <kc. of Petra have been excavated. These sandstones, in the
 author's opinion, may be traced as far as Medina, and occur all
 about Kasim. They often weather in a singular way ; pebbles are
 scarce in them ; fossils he had not seen.
    (6) The limestone contains bands of flint, and appears to be
 identical with that which occurs in Palestine, and is, he thinks,
 probably of Cretaceous age.
    (c) Of much later date is a coarse flat gravel which overspreads
 a considerable tract of country, as, for example, at Mount Seir in
 Edom, altogether about 250 square miles. The flints are doubtless
 derived from the limestone, and are often polished by drifting sand.
 It occurs on plateaux at very considerable elevations above the sea,
 sometimes forming the highest ground in the neighbourhood ; and
 sections had shown this gravel to be more than 20 feet deep. In
 it the author had discovered two or three flint weapons of palaeo
 lithic type, rude, but very like those of Hoxne or St. Acheul.
    The granite by its aspect and mode of occurrence recalls that of
 Sinai. It is cut by dykes of basalt ; now and then the author had
 observed other intrusive igneous rocks, which he must be content to
 classify as traps. The dykes of basalt, however, were not the only
 modes of occurrence of this rock ; there were considerable flows of
 basaltic lavas and occasional small craters. These volcanic districts
 bear the name of Harra ; the principal are the Aneyrid, the Khay-
 bar, and the Kesshub. The lost lies between Nejd Arabia and the
 Mecca country. These masses of lava &c. are comparatively modern ;
 eruption, indeed, has in one or two localities occurred in historic
 times, and steam has been seen to issue from certain craters.

             ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION IN SPHERES.
       To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       Gentlemen,
  IN the ' Philosophical Magazine ' for January 1884, Prof. Lannor
      has published a paper* containing highly interesting researches
  on the electromagnetic induction in continuous conductors, espe
 cially in spherical shells and in spheres. 1 hope I may be allowed
 to publish a few lines in order to show that the results of Professor
 Larmor concerning the induction in spheres have been published
  some years ago by myself.
    In a paper, " Ueber die Schw ingungen ernes Magnets unter dem
 Einfluss einer Kupferkugel,"t I have dealt with the electricity
 induced in a copper sphere by an oscillating magnet and with the
 influence of the induced currents on the motion ot the magnet. In
 a second paper, " Einige Versuche iiber Induction in korperlichen
 Leitern,"J 1 have treated the same problem for a system of
 magnets. This includes the case of a rotating sphere and magnets
 at rest, the electromagnetic induction being the same whether the
 sphere is at rest and the magnet rotates round an axis, or the
 sphere is rotating round this axis and the magnet is at rest. More
 over I have developed the solution of the equations for the case of
 a sphere rotating in a uniform magnetic field, and for all the cases
 1 have determined the couple of the induced currents on the moving
 magnets or on the rotating sphere. As Prof. Larmor has given his
 formula? expressed in Bessel's functions and in spherical harmonics,
 they can easily be compared with mine given in terms of the same
 functions. Indeed the results agree very well.
    At page 21 of his paper Prof. Larmor says :—" It would be very
interesting to determine the absolute value of the couple for a
copper sphere in a uniform rotating field of known strength, and
to determine the log. decrement of its torsional oscillations due to
induction in a stationary field, and to deduce thence, by approxima
tion from the general formula?, two values for the specific resistance.
          No absolute quantitative experimental verification appears
to have yet been made for induction-currents in continuous media."
I have tested my formula? by experiment, and derived from these
experiments values for the specific resistance of copper. For a
first copper sphere I have found: —Diameter d = 92-94 millim. ;
specific weight « =8-88; specific resistance X=              -—      j-or

       Getitlemen,
    1 regret that I was unacquainted with Dr. Himstedt's papers
 when preparing my communication referred to in the above. The
 first paper I have not at present access to ; and I did not find
 it mentiuned by any subsequent writer on the subject. On refer
 ring to the second paper, 1 find, in addition to the very interesting
 experimental verification, a discussion of the general solution for
 solid spheres. This latter, however, is of a much more analytical
 character than the investigation contained in my paper, in which
 one of my aims was to reduce the mathematical analysis to as nar
 row limits as possible, replacing it by a discussion of the physical
 phenomena. A comparison of the results shows agreement when
 a slip in my work is corrected. On page 17 the expression for G
  at the top of the page should be (see also Errata)
                                         (^.dS;
  and each expression for a couple on pages 17, 18, 19 should be
  multiplied by a. This requires that the value of Fa at the foot
  of page 19 should be divided by a ; and in the special case con
  sidered makes F=93 nearly, or about 200 times the Earth's mag
  netic force. Indeed the dimensions will not otherwise be correct.

  ON A SIMPLE METHOD OF INVESTIGATING THE THERMOELEC
    TRICITY AND PIEZOELECTRICITY OF CRYSTALS. BY A. KDNDT.
     The exact investigation of the thermoelectrical properties of
 crystals is shown, more particularly by Hankel's comprehensive
 researches, to be a very tedious and very difficult piece of work.
 The determination of the electricity of each individual point of the
 surface, by means of the electrometer, in order to arrive at the dis
 tribution over the whole surface, not only requires much time but
 also a number of precautions. Besides thermoelectricity Hankel
 distinguishes another mode of evoking electricity in crystals,
produced by rays, and more particularly those of low refrangi-
bility, and which he calls actinoelectricity. And, finally, pressure,
according to the discoveries of MM. Curie, produces electricity in
hemimorphic crystals, which they call piezoelectricity. The exact
investigation of actino- and of piezoelectricity presents in general
the same difficulties as those of thermoelectricity.
   Iu order to get a mean of investigating crystals in all directions,
it is desirable to have a method which enables us to demonstrate
the distribution of electricity over the whole system, even if the
method did not admit of quantitative measurements. I have found
such a method, which in simplicity and convenience of working
leaves nothing to be desired. The method is that used by Lichten-
berg to show the distribution of positive and negative electricity on
an insulator to which electricity has passed.
   In the moment in which the electrical distribution, produced in
a crystal by change of temperature, or pressure, is to be examined,
it is dusted with a mixture of red lead and sulphur which has been
sifted through fine cotton. By this means the powdered sulphur
becomes negative and the red lead positive ; and, as in Lichten-
berg's figures, the negative sulphur deposits on those parts of
the surface which are positive and the red lead on the negative.
The distribution of the two powders then gives a very striking
image of the electrical distribution on the surface.
   The method described is so simple, and in fact so obvious, as to
make it improbable that it had not already been tried. L could not,
however, find in the literature in question any indication of it. I
have first only tried the method with a small number of substances,
namely quartz, tourmaline, and arragonite. Whether also the
thermoelectricity of those crystals in which it is exhibited in but
small degree can also be investigated by it I must leave undecided.
The experiments on the substances mentioned show its applica
bility ; and I have since found that boracite, sugar, and tartaric
acid may be readily investigated by the method in question.

senschaften zu Berlin, April 1883.

 PLUCKER and Hittorf, in their celebrated paper "On
         the Spectra of Ignited Gases and Vapours " t, were
the first to call attention to the remarkable system of lines
which almost always appears, together with the characteristic
hydrogen-lines H„ Hp fiy and H{, in tubes containing hydrogen,
under small pressure, when traversed by the electric discharge.
These groups of lines, which are distributed through the whole
spectrum from H„ to Hy, but are especially bright and cha
racteristic in the neighbourhood of D, have since been made
the. subject of numerous investigations, especially to decide
the question of their origin, since the views of the discoverer
upon this point had been rendered doubtful by later experi
ments. The result of these investigations was not altogether
satisfactory, since even now the question can hardly bo re
garded as settled. On the contrary, two opposite opinions
upon this point are held by spectroscopists, one of which, held
by Pliicker, Hittorf, and Wiillner, represents the lines in
question as a spectrum belonging to hydrogen at a low tem
perature ; whilst the second, represented by Berthelot, Ang
strom, Salet, and recently Ciamician, finds the source of these

330                Dr. B. Hasselberg on the
radiations in acetylene. This circumstance may be regarded
as a sufficient reason for a renewed study of the subject, in
view of the great importance which attaches to an exact
knowledge of the spectroscopic phenomena exhibited by this
gas ; the more so since it offers opportunity to give a more
accurate description of the spectrum than those which spec
troscopic literature offers at present, and which are in no way
fitted to give even a moderately satisfactory idea of the spec
trum in question. It is, indeed, surprising that so little has
been done towards the exact knowledge of a subject which
has so often given occasion to discussion ; and I should be
even inclined to regard this very circumstance as the reason
of more than one of the differences in opinion which still
exist upon this subject. As complete an examination of the
spectrum as possible, as it appears under different conditions,
will then, in my opinion, not only supply a gap in the spec
troscopic literature concerning this gas, but will facilitate in
no small degree the solution of the problem concerning the
origin of the spectrum. In order to make this clearer, 1 will,
in the first place, and before passing to the description of
my own experiments, consider somewhat fully the inves
tigations upon this spectrum published up to the present
time.
   As already mentioned, the first description of the spectrum
is to be found in the paper of Pliicker and Hittorf referred
to above. This gives in few words as exact a description of
the main features of the spectrum as possible without mea
surements and drawings, and shows at any rate that the
subsequent designation of the spectrum as a band-spectrum,
belonging to the same category as the band-spectra of
nitrogen, sulphur, &c., is to be regarded as altogether in
admissible. The description is as follows :—" Even in the
old spectral tubes enclosing highly-rarefied hydrogen, the
gi-ouud, from which the three characteristic lines rise, did not
appear always of the same darkness ; in some instances new
bright lines appeared, especially in the neighbourhood of the
sodium-line. In resuming the subject we pointed out the
existence of a new hydrogen spectrum corresponding to a
lower temperature, but having no resemblance at all to the
spectra of the first order of nitrogen, sulphur, &c. In this
spectrum, of a peculiar character if fully developed, we ob
serve a great number of well-defined bright lines almost too
numerous to count and represent by an engraving, but bril
liant enough to be examined with a magnifying power of 72,
after the light has passed through four prisms." It is clear
from this that the spectrum possesses a character altogether

                   Second Spectrum of Hydrogen.                 331
 different ; and, indeed, the employment of more powerful
 instruments does not reveal in its whole extent a single line
 of similar nature to the band characteristic of the so-called
 spectra of the first order of other gases. On the contrary,
 the spectrum consists entirely of sharply-defined lines distri
 buted upon a feebly-illuminated background without any
 definite order, which neither in appearance nor in intensity
 differ essentially from the four characteristic lines of hydrogen.
    If, then, we take into account only the appearance of the
 spectrum, we find no reason for distinguishing it ns a separate
 spectrum of hydrogen from the four lines H„ . . . Hj. It would
 be more simple to assume the existence for hydrogen of only
 one line-spectrum, consisting of all these lines together with
 the lines H„ . . . Hj, always assuming that they can be shown
 to possess identical origin. This view of the matter is, to a
 certain extent, justified by the circumstance that with hydro
 gen, in opposition to what is found with other gases giving
 double spectra, the two spectra almost always appear together,
 whereas in other cases the appearance of the ono spectrum is
 accompanied by the disappearance of the other, or at least
by its greater or less diminution. We may, for example, recall
the behaviour of a tube filled with nitrogen the pressure of
which is caused to vary: as long as the pressure is small or
there is no air-break in the circuit, the well-known band-
spectrum only is seen; whereas if the pressure be increased,
or if an air-break be introduced, the spectrum gives place to
the line-spectrum. Between these two cases there is always
a transition-point at which a sort of conflict takes place be
tween the two spectra, in which sometimes the one, and some
times the other, spectrum partially starts up ; but we never
have the two spectra completely developed at the same time.
Although these conditions do assume somewhat different
forms with hydrogen, yet one difference between the two
spectra, based upon the different temperatures at which they
are produced, may be pointed out. Pliicker has already
shown that in wide tubes, where the temperature of the dis
charge is certainly less than in capillary tubes, Hp is the
only one of the chief lines of hydrogen which makes its
appearance, whilst the groups of the second spectrum in the
red and orange are still distinctly to be seen. On the other
hand, by the introduction of an air-break or Leyden jar,
even at extreme rarefaction, it is possible to entirely extin
guish the second spectrum, whilst the characteristic lines at
the same time assume a more or less expanded and diffuse
appearance. Now, since this arrangement involves an in
crease in the potential of the quantities of electricity which
                                Z 2

  332                  Dr. B. Hasselberg on the
  unite in each discharge, the mechanical equivalent of the
  discharge is greater, and consequently its temperature is
  higher. The expansion of the lines is therefore to be re
  garded only as the consequence of this rise in temperature * ;
  and if the same effect is produced by increase of pressure,
  this is only because then a higher potential is necessary in
  order that the discharge shall take place.
     If, instead of the induction-coil, we employ an influence-
  machine as source of electricity, then, as E. Wiedemann t has
  shown, the simpler process of discharge which takes place
  with the machine permits the two spectra to be much more
 clearly separated from each other, by gradually lengthening
 the included air-break, than is possible with the more com
 plicated process of discharge in the induction-coil. The
 second spectrum, which appears with no air-break, or only a
 small one, becomes gradually less bright as the air-break is
 increased, whilst the characteristic lines become more distinct,
 until finally, with a certain length of spark, the second spec
 trum disappears almost suddenly. These conditions are
 exactly suited to make the phenomena obtained with the
 induction-coil more intelligible. Since, on account of the
 gradual flow of electricity to the electrodes which takes place,
 each opening or closing of the primary current, besides the
chief discharge, produces also a whole series of feebler partial
 discharges, it is probable that the second spectrum is due
to these smaller discharges, whilst the primary discharge at
greater potential produces the characteristic lines. Conse
quently, in more completely exhausted tubes, where the resist
 ance is not sufficient to prevent the passage of the smaller dis
charges, both spectra should be visible; whilst as the pressure
is increased a point is at last reached at which only the prin
 cipal discharge takes place, and tho spectrum due to it, con
sisting of the lines H„ . . . Hj, is seen. If this is so, then in
one and the same tube, in which the exhaustion is gradually
increased, when currents of different strengths are employed,
 that pressure at which the second spectrum begins to show
itself must be greater the greater the intensity of the current,
and consequently the potential of the partial discharges. But
this is confirmed by experiment. Thus, for example, on
passing the current from a large induction-coil excited by
means of five Buusen cells through a tube containing hydrogen,
and then passing the current of a small induction-coil through
it, I found that on gradually exhausting, the first traces of

the second spectrum appeared at pressures of 22 millim. and
2 to 3 metres respectively.
    These views ot the connexion between the process of dis
charge and the nature of the spectral phenomena obtained
have already been propounded by Angstrom", being supported
by observations of the image of the tube produced by a rota
ting mirror. But if we observe in this manner, not the tube
itself as is generally done, but the spectrum of the tube, it
would seem that we ought to obtain a still sharper criterion of
the admissibility of the above view than is afforded by experi
ments hitherto described. If the three principal lines are to
be referred exclusively to the momentary chief discharge, and
the system of lines forming the second spectrum to the series
of partial discharges, then, in the revolving mirror, the first
 should appear as isolated lines upon a continuous background
 formed by the latter. However simple the experiment theo
 retically considered may appear, its actual performance is
attended by such considerable difficulties, in consequence of
 the small luminous intensity of the spectrum, that my attempts
in this direction have not given any certain result.
    Pliicker and Hittorf, from their experiments with wide
tubes, drew the conclusion, in respect to the origin of the
second spectrum, that it is to be ascribed to hydrogen just as
much as the four lines undoubtedly characteristic of this gas.
In their method of experimenting there is, in fact, no un
certainty upon this point arising from possible influence of
the material of the electrodes or of the glass envelope. Al
though no details are given of the method of preparing the
gas, yet it is clear that Pliicker and Hittorf have certainly
bestowed due care upon this point, so that their conclusions
need not fear criticism upon this ground. Since these con
clusions were very completely confirmed some years later
by the experiments of Wiillner f, there was every reason to
regard this question as settled. But other views were ex
pressed almost at the same time, based upon chemical inves
tigations on the conditions of equilibrium of gaseous systems,
by Berthelot and Richard J, which not only caused the re
opening of the question, but so hindered a definite decision
that even now there is no agreement among spectroscopists
upon this point. I will now consider these views more
closely.
    It is known that every compound body is decomposed into

334                  Dr. B. Hasselberg on the
its elements under the influence of the electric discharge.
 On the other hand, compounds are formed under the same
influence; and between these opposite actions there is pro
duced in certain cases a condition of unstable equilibrium, in
which no further change is produced by the continued action
of the electric current. Acetylene, amongst others, is, ac
 cording to Berthelot, one of the bodies which behave in this
 way. If a continuous series of electric discharges be sent
 through this gas, decomposition occurs, which, however, is
not complete, but ceases at a certain point, depending upon
the pressure at which the composition of the gaseous mixture
remains the same. Since, moreover, with constant change
 of pressure the percentage composition of this mixture
does not change gradually but suddenly, this composition is
within certain limits independent of the pressure. Thus, for
example, Berthelot found in 100 volumes of the resulting
mixture, at a pressure of from 3-46 to 0"41 metres of" mercury,
 12 volumes of acetylene; at 0'31 metre, 6-5 volumes; and
between 0-23 and 0"10 metre, 3'5 volumes : the last mixture
retained its stability even at a pressure of only a few millimetres.
   We see from this that the equilibrium between acetylene,
carbon, and hydrogen in the resultant gas-system changes
only abruptly with the pressure in multiple proportions ; and
since, consequently, those complications which would other
wise result by continuous change in the composition of the
gas under the influence of the discharge are, for the most
part, avoided, Berthelot and Richard have justly regarded
the spectroscopic examination of this and similar mixtures as
specially adapted to give clearer evidence as to the spectro
scopic conditions of compound bodies. The results of these
investigations, so far as the mixture of gases at present under
consideration is concerned, on the interpretation given to
them by Berthelot and Richard, can hardly be brought into
agreement with the results of later spectroscopic research,
and consequently cannot, in my opinion, be made to serve as
an argument against the admissibility of Plucker's view of
the second hydrogen spectrum.
   The mixture employed contained 1'7 per cent, of acetylene,
and 98'3 per cent, of hydrogen. These proportions wore so
chosen in order to be as far as possible from the limits given
above. The gas having been introduced, under a pressure of
a few millimetres, into a Geissler's tube, the discharge of a
powerful induction-coil was passed through the tube, and the
spectrum observed. It is described * by Berthelot and Richard
as follows :—

   As far as the first point is concerned, there is no doubt of
its correctness, since the mixture contained more than 98 per
cent, of hydrogen. But it is different with the second. The
bands mentioned here can no more be ascribed to the element
carbon, but form the spectrum common to all hydrocarbons,
 which was first exactly studied by Swan f, and has since
 formed the subject of investigation by many spectroscopists.
 In my paper " On the Spectra of Comets, &c." t I have given
 the history of this spectrum somewhatQ fully, and have given
 reasons (chiefly from the researches of Angstrom and Thalen §)
 why the above interpretation appears to me the right one.
 Since, according to these investigations, which have been
 recently confirmed by the exhaustive researches of Liveing
 and Dewar ||, the acetylene which always forms in hydro
 carbons under the influence of the electric current is to be
 regarded as producing these radiations, its appearance in the
 spectrum of the mixture in question was not to be expected,
 but forms a direct proof of the correctness of the explanation
 of the spectroscopic phenomena observed with hydrocarbons
first given by Angstrom and Thalen.
    But if, as, strange to say, is still the case with most spectro-
   * It is remarkable that the passages treating of this point in Pliicker
 and Hittorfs paper should have escaped the notice of the authors, since,
from the remarks made above under No. 2, we must assume that this

336                    Dr. B. Hasselberg on the
scopists, we regard Swan's spectrum as that, of carbon, wo
might ascribe the third spectrum appearing in the above
gaseous mixture to the third component of the mixture, viz.
acetylene, as Berthelot and Richard do. But the matter is
not so. Against such an assumption we have not only
the arguments already brought, but also the circumstance
that the spectrum does not at all bear the character usual to
spectra of chemical compounds, since it does not consist, as
Berthelot and Richard maintain, of a system of channelled
spaces, but, on the contrary, must be placed in every respect
in the category of the line-spectra of the elements. Since,
moreover, it appears always in those cases where not only has
no acetylene been mixed with the gas, but where the greatest
care has been bestowed upon the purification of the gas,
it seems much more reasonable to ascribe it to hydrogen
itself than to assume for a compound body such as acetylene
spectral peculiarities having no analogy with those in any
other known case. Against what has here been said, the
 objection may possibly be raised that even the greatest care in
 the preparation of the hydrogen does not atfora any complete
 guarantee that the gas may not, after all, be rendered impure
 hy the presence of hydrocarbons, since it must of necessity
 come repeatedly into contact with the ditferent parts of the
 air-pump. That carbon compounds may actually be intro
 duced into the gas in this way is not to be denied ; but it is
 not necessarily the case, and 1 shall presently adduce experi
 ments which completely prove this.
   It need scarcely be mentioned that there is no doubt of the
identity of the spectrum mentioned by Berthelot and Richard
under No. 3 with Pliicker's second hydrogen spectrum. Since,
on the scale of their spectroscope, the hydrogen-lines Ha, Hp,
and Hy fell respectively upon the divisions 13"5, 144-5,
and 229-0, the divisions 25 and 65, which the authors give
 as the limits upon the same scale of the most conspicuous
 part of the spectrum, correspond to the wave-lengths \=633
 and X=570; and these are in fact, according to my measure
 ments, the limits within which the part of the spectrum in
 question is included.                                               0
    The views of Berthelot were at the time shared by Ang
 strom*, which may appear surprising, since it was from his
 investigations, made conjointly with Thalen, that the identity
 of Berthelot's second spectrum with that of acetylene appears.
 But one or two0remarks must be made upon this point. In
 the first place, Angstrom has not altogether taken it as settled
          * C. JR. Ixriii. p. 372 (1871) ; Pogg. Ann. cxliv. p. 300.

                   Second Spectrum of Hydrogen.                    337
that Berthelot's third spectrum belongs to acetylene; he has
only inferred, from the processes of discharge in the appear
ance of this spectrum on the one hand, and of the ordinary
spectrum of hydrogen on the other hand, that we have to do
in the first case with a compound of hydrogen, " soit avec
lui-meme soit avec un corps etranger; " and then, on account
of the stability of the mixture of acetylene and hydrogen as
shown by Berthelot, he takes the latter alternative as the
more probable. If, now, in consequence of evidence already
brought forward, and further on account of evidence still to be
adduced, the assumption of a compound with a foreign sub
stance appears to be little probable, there is no reason that
we should lose0sight of the possibility of the other alternative
suggested by Angstrom, according to which the spectrum is
to be ascribed to a compound of hydrogen with itself. On the
contrary there are, as we shall presently see, reasons which
are decidedly favourable to such an assumption.
    If further, in Qthe second place, we remember that, the
investigations of Angstrom and Thalen, which treat, amongst
other things, of the spectroscopic relations of carbon com
pounds, and give the first rational explanation of the spectro
scopic phenomena of hydrocarbons, were not published until
 four years later,
              o     viz. in the fcyear 1874, and moreover, in conse-
quence of Angstrom's death, were not so complete as was
intended, we have the explanation of the fact that Angstrom
 did not subject his first theory of the second hydrogen spec
trum to further proof.
    Berthelot's theory receives a confirmation, which, at first
 sight, seems of great weight, from the researches of Salet *.
 If, in fact, Pliicker's spectrum really belongs to acetylene,
 then this spectrum cannot appear in a hydrogen-tube which is
 free from all impurity of carbon compounds. In order to test
 this, Salet allowed a current of pure dry oxygen to circulate
 for a long time through the tube to be used before it was filled
 with hydrogen, the tube being all the time heated to a low
 red-heat. In this way it was believed all traces of carbon
 compounds must have been removed. Further, in order to
 eliminate all possible influence of the electrodes, they were
 omitted altogether, and instead the wide parts of the tube were
 coated with tinfoil : when these were connected with the poles
 of the induction-coil, or with the combs of the Holtz machine,
 the gas became luminous. Under these circumstances spec
 troscopic examination of the tube showed only the three
 principal lines of hydrogen without any trace of the second
           • Salet, Spectres dee Mttalloides (Paris, 1872), p. 17.

338                   Dr. B. Hasselberg on the
spectrum; and Salet concludes therefore that Berthelot's view
is shown to be correct. However natural this may appear at
first sight, there is yet an objection which may be made, and
which appears to me to essentially alter the state of the case,
and to deprive Salet's experiments of most of their force.
We know that if a gas is rendered luminous in the way
described the temperature is comparatively low, or at least
decidedly below the limits it may attain when the discharge
passes directly through the tube. Consequently the intensity
of the light and of the spectrum will be smaller, and, unless
the coatings are very strongly charged, may be even so small
that only the stronger lines of the spectrum (in this case the
principal lines H„, Hp, Hy) are visible. In order further to
test the admissibility of this explanation of Salet's experiment,
I have made the two following experiments :—A hydrogen-
tube (purchased ready rilled), which showed the second hy
drogen-spectrum very vividly when a powerful current was
sent through it, was provided with tinfoil coatings and
excited in the manner described. The light emitted by the
tube, usually brilliant and nearly white, was now feebly red,
and showed in the spectrum, besides mere traces* of the
second spectrum in the green, only H* and Hy of small
intensity, and Hfl relatively bright and diffuse. The same
experiment was then repeated with another tube, of the form
shown in fig. 2 (Plate X.). This tube was closed at one end,
A, by a plate-glass disk ground air-tight and cemented, in
order that it might be placed before the slit in a longitudinal
position (t. e. in tl e direction of the axis of the collimator),
and was united to the air-pump by means of the tube B.
After being repeatedly filled with pure hydrogen and exhausted,
it was finally excited, in the same way as before, with the gas
at a few millimetres' pressure, and examined with the spectro
scope. If the tube was placed in the ordinary way before the
slit the spectrum was exactly that described, whilst it was
only necessary to place the tube longitudinally in order to see
the second spectrum fully developed. It follows therefore
that the absence of this spectrum in Salet's experiments
affords no certain proof that it belongs to the eliminated
carbon compounds and not to the hydrogen ; but their expla
nation may just as well, and even with greater probability, be
sought in the diminution in intensity of light in the whole
phenomena due to the experimental conditions employed, a
diminution by which the already feeble lines of the second
spectrum must be first affected.

                    Second Spectrum of Hydrogen.                 339
     After the foregoing explanation I cannot but regard the
  explanation of Berthelot's spectrum given by Plficker and
  Wiillner as by far the best founded. In this opinion I am
  Btill further confirmed by numerous experiments of my own.
  That nevertheless this view has not yet received universal
  assent, is indeed perhaps not shared by the majority of spec-
  troscopists, is seen from the circumstance that Ciamician* has
  recently given Berthelot's explanation as the correct one, and
  that Schusterf regards the question as still open. This last
  circumstance has induced Wiillner X also to undertake new
  experiments upon this subject, the results of which require
  further notice here in conclusion.
     Wiillner's experiments are designed to show directly that
  the spectrum of acetylene is quite different from the second
  spectrum of hydrogen, and could not be confused with it. For
  this purpose acetylene, prepared from cuprous acetylide with
  careful observation of the precautions necessary to secure the
  purity of the product, was introduced into a spectral tube, ex
 hausted to a pressure of 1 or 2 millimetres. The spectroscopic
  examination of the greenish-white light produced by the passage
 of the induced current revealed a somewhat complicated spec
 trum, which Wiillner considers to be that of acetylene ; and
 the difference between which and that of hydrogen he further
 endeavours to show by means of a complete description based
 upon measurements. That there is a difference there is no
 doubt, but not because the spectrum belongs to acetylene, the
 spectrum of which is altogether different, but because it is
 formed by the simple superposition of the spectra of carbonic
 oxide and of hydrogen ; of which last spectrum, just because
 of this superposition, only the strongest lines are perceptible.
 In order to show this, I here compare Wiillner's description
of the spectrum with„the measurements of the carbonic-oxide
spectrum made by Angstrom and Thalen, and with those of
the second hydrogen spectrum made by myself, omitting
nevertheless those spectral regions which, according to Wiill
ner, form the boundary of the bright carbon-oxide bands on
the more refrangible side of the spectrum, since these, under
varying circumstances, have no significance as characteristic
of the spectrum. The wave-lengths of the lines here given of
the second hydrogen spectrum are taken from complete tables
of wave-lengths of this spectrum given further on.

 channelled band occur
 ring in the spectra of all
gases containing carbon,
showing the fine lines
 which are so beautifully
 seen in the bands of the
 carbonic-acid and car
 bonic-oxide spectra. This
 band, however, is di
stinctly narrower than
 in the spectrum of car
 bonic acid. It is bounded
 by a sharp line at         5550                         6536-6
   A broad green field,
 which, like the first hy
 drogen spectrum, shows
 a large number of lines,
 follows, and then the
 green band finely shaded,
 as in the carbonic-acid
 spectrum, begins at        5200; 5197 Brightest band
 which, however, like the                   of CO.
 greenish-yellow band, is
 only half as broad as in
 carbonic acifl.
    The same holds good of
 the following carbon
 bands : the blue one be
 ginning at                 4834 4833-51
 the first violet at        45101 4500-01
 the second violet at       43'JB 43940
    Between these bands
 the spectrum is similar
 to the band-spectrum of
 hydrogen; as is also
 the case with ethylene
 and marsh-gas, although
  there are differences in
 detail.
     We see from this comparison that Wiillner's so-called ace
tylene spectrum contains scarcely a single line or band which
does not occur either in the spectrum of carbon oxide or in
the second hydrogen spectrum. It is exactly the brightest
 lines of this last spectrum which appear here ; as indeed must
be the case, since the weaker lines are concealed by the broad
bright bands of the superposed carbon-oxide spectrum. That
these bands belong to carbon oxide, and not to carbon as
 Wiillner thinks, may be considered as a settled matter. Their

 342                  Dr. B. Hnsselberg on the
 appearance in Wullner's tube is completely explained by the
 small pressure of the gas, since under these circumstances the
 complete exclusion of oxygen is attended with considerable dif
 ficulty. The true spectrum of acetylene, on the other hand, is,
 according to the investigations of Angstrom and Thaten and
 Liveing and Dewar, an altogether different one, and coincident
 with the well-known flame-spectrum of gases containing car
bon observed. In the spectrum under discussion there is no
trace of these bands, unless we identify the band 6192 with
the hydrocarbon band (5187, which appears to me somewhat
doubtful, since the much stronger bands at 5(533, 5 1 64, and
 4736 are absent.
    These experiments do not therefore prove directly, in the
 way intended by Wiillner, that the second spectrum observed
 in hydrogen tubes really belongs to hydrogen and not to
 acetylene, though they do so indirectly; since, according to
Wullner's observations, this spectrum gradually predominates
during the observation over that of carbonic oxide, until finally
it takes its place almost completely. This observation agrees
completely with Berthelot's experiments, according to which
the continued action of the electric discharge gradually con
verts acetylene into the stable mixture of hydrogen and acety
lene, the percentage composition of which in the present case
is expressed by the numbers 97 and 3. It is exactly this ulti
mate great preponderance of hydrogen which shows that the
spectrum in question belongs to this gas and not to acetylene;
and its gradual production sufficiently explains the gradual
fading of the carbonic-oxide bands.
    From this account of the older investigations I pass now to
the description of my own experiments. They were designed,
in the first instance, to determine the origin of the spectrum, if
possible, more certainly than had already been done, and then,
further, to investigate as fully as possible the different con
ditions under which they are produced. It is not necessary
to insist upon the close connexion of these two problems. In
fact it is exactly the complete identity of the spectral pheno
mena of the gas prepared in different ways, taken together
with the above criticism of previous investigations, which has
convinced me that this spectrum must be ascribed to hydrogen
itself. But how little these investigations have contributed
to the more accurate knowledge of the spectrum appears from
the fact that, with the exception of a few isolated measure
ments by Seabroke* and Vogelf, no actual measurements
were made. The drawing given by Wiillner a few years ago

                 Second Spectrum of Hydrogen.                343
is also not suited to satisfy the requirements of spectroscopic
science, since in the absence of numbers, or even of a scale,
not even approximate wave-length determinations of the few
lines given can be obtained from it. The measurements given
below and the drawing constructed from them (PI. X. fig. 1)
will supply this deficiency, at least to some extent.
   The spectroscope which I employed is of the usual Steinheil
model, and when a powerful Rutherfurd prism is employed,
shows the spectrum in great detail.
   The dispersion, which was somewhat greater than that of
two ordinary flint-glass prisms of 60°, might, with the means
at my command of rendering the gas luminous, have been
somewhat increased ; but little would have been gained by
that, since the rest of the spectrum was not of sufficient inten
sity to bear a higher dispersion. The magnifying-power of
9'3 employed in the first series of observations was increased
to 17"0 with the remaining series, since the brightness of the
spectrum proved to be sufficient to permit such an increase.
   The wave-lengths of the lines were determined by micro-
metric measurement with reference to suitable metallic lines
chosen from Thalen's tables. These lines were always so
chosen that the errors of interpolation might influence as little
as possible the reliability of the wave-lengths determined. It
would certainly have been an advantage if the lines of the
gas could have been directly determined from those of the
solar spectrum ; but with a spectrum of such feeble intensity
as the one in question, this method is attended with consider
able difficulties, and may, in my opinion, even introduce
greater errors than those which are to be apprehended from
the employment of the metallic spectra as references.
   It is well known that a Geissler tube, placed immediately
in front of the slit of the spectroscope, acts as a cylindrical
lens, and every small displacement produces a greater or less
apparent change in place of the lines of the spectrum. This
circumstance in the present case, when, in order to observe the
comparison-spectrum, the tube had to be pushed on one side,
would have given rise to extremely prejudicial irregularities
in the measurements ; and I have therefore, in order to avoid
this source of error, employed an achromatic lens of short
focus, so as to throw a sharp image of the tube or of the spark
used for comparison upon the slit. In this way, the projecting
lens being fixed, the spectrum remains altogether fixed in tho
field of view, and the source of error mentioned is avoided.
   The source of electricity employed was, in all cases, a large
Ruhmkorft''s coil, made by Keyser and Schmidt, of Berlin,
excited by a battery of six large Bunscn cells. Commonly

344                  Dr. B. Hasselberg on the
the simple induced current only was employed; but cases have
occurred, particularly with wider tubes, when the introduction
of a small air-break and Leyden jar has increased the distinct
ness of the spectrum. This air-break must, however, be taken
so small that the characteristic lines do not appear hazy, since
in this case the second spectrum loses in brilliancy instead of
gaining. Four different tubes in all were employed for the
measurements. The first was a small tube containing hydro
gen, about 3 inches long, of the usual form, whose capillary
was about 30 millim. long, and possessed an internal diameter
of about 0"5 millim. It was exhausted to a few tenths of a
millimetre. The second tube was a purchased hydrogen-tube.
The third tube had the well-known form introduced by Wiill-
ner ; but with the modification that a globe about an inch in
diameter, containing phosphoric anhydride, was attached *o it
by grinding. The fourth tube, in order that it might be
placed longitudinally before the slit, was provided with a wide
cylinder at one end and at right angles to the capillary, which
was about 55 millim. long, as will be understood from the
figure (fig. 3, Plate X.). The internal diameters of the capil
laries of these two tubes were respectively 1 and 2*5 millim.,
and the pressure of the gas in the two cases 2 to 3 millim.
   It scarcely needs to be specially mentioned that in preparing
the gas used, as well as in filling the tubes, all the precautions
upon which its purity depends were strictly observed. The
gas evolved from zinc and sulphuric acid was therefore care
fully freed from impurities by the use of known methods, and
introduced directly from the evolution-apparatus into the tube,
which had been repeatedly heated and exhausted. Not until
the tubes had been in this way repeatedly washed out with
hydrogen were they closed at the pressure mentioned above,
and used for observation. The results of all the measure
ments made of the spectrum are given in the following tables.
They contain the wave-lengths of all the lines visible under
the conditions employed, of which a large number, especially
in the green and blue portions of the spectrum, are so ex
tremely weak that they approach the limits of visibility. It
might be thought superfluous to give here any more than the
final mean, but I have thought it desirable to give the separate
series of measurements, first, because the accuracy attained
can best be judged from them, and, secondly, because they
show the complete identity of the spectral phenomena with
the gas obtained in different ways. For the yellowish-red
part contained in Table A, which forms the characteristic
portion of the spectrum, the four series of measurements were
obtained by the use of the before-mentioned four tubes ;

 whilst the measurements of the rest of the spectrum given in
 Table B have been made by means of the tubes Nos. 2 and 4.
 The employment of a higher magnifying-power with the
 Series III. and IV. of Table A is the reason why single fine
lines occur in these Series which are absent in the Series I.
and II. All the values of Table B were obtained by employ
ing the higher magnifying-power.
     As far as the general arrangement of the tables is concerned,
it is only necessary to remark that the wave-lengths are ex
pressed in ten-millionths of a millimetre, and that the numbers
in column J give the estimated intensities of the lines ; the
numbers 1 to 6 being employed, 1 to denote the weakest
scarcely perceptible line, and 6 the strongest. Certain lines
having a somewhat hazy appearance are marked v. Lastly,
under V and S are given the somewhat older determinations
of Vogel and Seabroke, of which the latter have been reduced
from KirchhofFs scale to wave-lengths.

    As we see, the agreement between the values in the sepa
 rate series is in general very satisfactory; only in the yellowish-
 red portion there are occasionally more important deviations,
 but yet not greater than may be easily explained in view of
 the smaller dispersion of this portion of the spectrum. We
 may therefore regard the accuracy of the definitive wave
 lengths as in general quite satisfactory, and for most of them
 weQmay estimate the probable error as not more than a unit
 of Angstrom's scale. Those wave-lengths which occur in only
 one series of observations are included in the column of mean
 values; because, since each of them (as of all the other determi
nations) is the mean of at least three separate observations,
 they are in fact mean observations.
    Since the identity of the spectral phenomena of hydrogen
from different sources may be said to be put beyond doubt by
the numbers of the above table, it appears to me absolutely
 impossible to ascribe the spectrum to any foreign substance
whatever. This is further confirmed by the fact that a fifth
tube which I filled with electrolytic hydrogen, carefully obser
ving all precautions, showed identically the same spectrum.
    The single circumstance which can be alleged against what
has been here said by those who nevertheless regard this spec
trum as that of acetylene, is the always possible contamination
of the gas by some carbon compound from the taps of the air

350                 Dr. B. Hasselberg on the
pump. But to this objection may be replied, first, that if
this were the case the carbon-monoxide spectrum must also
show itself, since, as is well known, this spectrum is nearly as
ubiquitous in highly exhausted spectral tubes as that of sodium
is in flames. In all the tubes prepared by me there was, how
ever, no trace of it to be seen. Secondly, it is to be observed
that if our spectrum belonged to acetylene proceeding from
such impurity, we must expect to find the same more or less
 completely in every tube prepared with the same pump. But
this is not the case ; for when the tube No. 3 was filled with
dry air and exhausted to about 1 millim., I observed a perfectly
pure and beautifully developed band-spectrum of nitrogen,
whilst the admission of moist air after removal of the phos
phoric anhydride at once gave rise to the above spectrum.
   It is therefore impossible to attribute it to any carbonaceous
gas derived from the pump.
   As the result of all these experiments, I confidently express
the opinion that the spectrum described here certainly belongs
to hydrogen and not to acetylene. If we examine the series
III. and TV. of Table A as well as Table B more closely, we
find that in both cases the number of observed (that is, of
visible) lines is very nearly the same ; in other words, that
increasing the layer of radiating gas about sixty times has
not caused any perceptible change in the spectrum. This
appears to be in direct opposition to the experiments described
above on page 338, since the longitudinal use of the tube
there described showed the spectrum perfectly distinctly,
whilst only traces were otherwise to be seen. The apparent
contradiction disappears, however, at once when we consider
that in the latter case the temperature was decidedly lower.
We easily see from Zollner's well-known formula
                     E={l-(l-AA)'}e,
which gives the intensity of the light of wave-length X radi
ated from an incandescent layer of gas of the thickness 8, that
this intensity will be less affected by an increase in the value
of 8 the higher the temperature is.
   It follows from the two equations,
             §       elog(l-A,)(l-A^,
         ^-=e(l-A,)i-Ml + Sloga-AA)},
that t^- increases with AA so long as AA<1— e             but de

                   Second Spectrum of Hydrogen.                 35 L
 creases as AA increases, if AK > 1 — e~'. Since, then, for a given
  wave-length, AA is only a single function of the temperature,
  which, of whatever form it may be, must at least possess this
  property—that, within limits determined by its nature, it
 increases with the temperature—we see that so long as the
                                                                  i
 temperature is so low that AA does not attain the value 1—
 an increase in the thickness of the radiating layer and an
 increase in the temperature both produce an increase of E ;
 whilst for those temperatures for which AA exceeds the value
  mentioned, a further increase of temperature produces the
 opposite effect to the increase of 8. Consequently at high
 temperatures a spectrum will be considerably less affected by
 change in the thickness of the radiating layer than at lower
 temperatures, exactly as shown by the above experiments.
    But we may perhaps go further still, and in these expe
 riments obtain even an experimental confirmation of the
 peculiarity of the function A mentioned above. I am the more
 disposed to do so, since it appears to me altogether unintel
 ligible how a continual rise in temperature can have any other
 effect, at least so long as no dissociation and consequent alte
 ration in the arrangement of atoms in the radiating system,
 has taken place. If this is admitted, we shall be obliged to
 assume such a dissociation as the explanation of the displace
ment of a spectrum by a new one with rise of temperature,
and must therefore ascribe the first spectrum to a more com
plicated arrangement of molecules, or to a compound of the
 body with itself. Since, according to the investigations of
 Wiedemann*, in the case of hydrogen a continual rise in tem
 perature produces first a gradual diminution of the spectrum
 above described, and then upon reaching a certain limit its
almost sudden disappearance, these considerations 0lead us to
the view proposed as a second alternative by Angstrom,
according to which the spectrum belongs to a compound of
hydrogen with itself. The heat-eqnivalent found by Wiede
mann for the quantity of energy necessary to transform this
spectrum into that consisting of the three characteristic bright
lines, would therefore be nothing else than the thermal equi
valent of the corresponding work of dissociation.
    If the views thus explained of the spectroscopic conditions
of hydrogen are regarded as justified by facts, we have an
easy explanation of the fact that in the spectra of the sun and
most stars only the characteristic lines of this gas appear as
bright lines or absorption-lines, as the case may be, whilst no
                 • Wiedemann's Annakn, vol. x. p. 202.

 352                 Mr. J. J. Hood on the Rate of
  trace of the second spectrum is to be detected. The reason is
  to be found in the enormous temperature existing in these
  bodies. But in the case of stars such as a Orionis, a Herculis,
  &c., which, judging from their complicated spectra, are in a
  more advanced stage of cooling, the appearance of the second
  hydrogen spectrum would not, under these circumstances, be
  remarkable, since observation shows that the characteristic
  spectrum is either entirely absent in these stars, or only feebly
  present. Nevertheless the verification of this expectation by
  observation must always be nearly or quite impossible on
  account of feeble intensity of light ; and the same is afortiori
  true of the nebulae, in which the appearance of the second
  hydrogen spectrum, together with the characteristic line Hp,
¦ might have been expected, upon other grounds, with a certain
  degree of probability.
  XL. On the Rate of Chemical Absorption of Gases, with regard-
     to their Interdiffusion. By John J. Hood, 13.Sc., Assoc.
     R.S.M.*
                               [Plate X. fig. 4.]
  WITH the exception of Graham's work on the diffusion
           of gases, their rates of passage through porous dia
  phragms or minute apertures into a vacuum, and Loschmidt's
  experiments on free diffusiont, no measurements of any note
  have been made bearing on this important subject. The former
  chemist has shown that the lighter a gas is the more rapidly
  does it pass through a porous diaphragm, or, as it is expressed,
  the rate of diffusion varies as the reciprocal of the square root
  of the density. The experiments of Loschmidt, which were
  performed by placing two tubes containing different gases
  over each other, opening a channel between them, and after a
  certain time determining the amount of the gases that had
  exchanged places, gave measurements of the rate of intcrdif-
  fnsion of the one gas into the other. The results obtained by
  this method of studying diffusion, a physical process somewhat
  different from that of the passage of a gas through a porous
  diaphragm or minute aperture into a vacuum as worked out
  by Graham, show a relation to exist between the molecular
  weights of the gases and their rates of interdift'usion, but
  which relation is not quite clearf.

                   Chemical Absorption of Gases.              353
    If in a closed vessel containing a homogeneous mixture of,
say, two gases, it were possible so to arrange matters that, of
the molecules of the two gases which impinged on a fixed area
of the side of the vessel, only those of one sort passed out into
a vacuum without any returning, the rate at which the vessel
would be emptied of this gas would give a measure of its rate
of interdiffusion through the molecules of the other gas. To
effect such an ideal process is doubtless an impossibility ; but
the practical method, imperfect it may be, that offers itself for
accomplishing this operation, that of selective absorption by
 chemical means, forms the subject of the present investigation.
    The objections that can be raised against this method for
 studying the rate of interdiffusion of gases are great, and these
are in part considered experimentally at the end of the paper;
 still the results that have been obtained may be of some
interest. For instance, it is shown that, with a given absorb
able gas, the rate at which it is absorbed is less when it is
mixed with air than when mixed with the lighter gas, hydro
gen i this is especially noticeable in the first stages of the
absorption. On the other hand, however, when the atmo
sphere is the same, the rate of absorption in relation to the
density of the gas does not come out in a satisfactory way.
 Of the two gases C02 and SH2, for part of the course a marked
 difference in their rates of absorption is visible, the lighter
gas SH2 being absorbed more rapidly. This is especially
noticeable in an atmosphere of hydrogen ; the same is true
for the gases CI and S02. These facts, which are principally
observable in the first stages of the experiments, are in har
mony with previous experimental work on gaseous diffusion ;
but a strange anomaly is brought to light, and it is this—that,
although there is a difference in the rates of absorption of the
gases C02 and SH2 in favour of the lighter one, and also of
the two gases CI and S02, these latter, each possessing a higher
density than the two former gases, are absorbed with much
greater rapidity than either C02 or SH2, especially when an
atmosphere of air is employed ; when hydrogen is used, SHS
and CI are absorbed with nearly equal rapidity.
    In the method here adopted for getting out these facts, the
perturbations that might arise from physical causes at the
surface of the absorbent were attempted to be overcome, or at
least lessened, by employing a comparatively small volume of
the absorbable gas diffused through a large volume of another
gas—air or hydrogen—and using a strong solution of potash
so as to have it very much in excess over that required for
complete absorption of the gas. Strong potash solution was
employed also in order to prevent complicating matters by

354              Mr. J. J. Hood on the Rate of
the evolution of aqueous vapour, which would happen with a
weak solution. It was also necessary to maintain the volume
of the absorption-vessel constant, so that the pressure of the
unabsorbable gas should not vary, otherwise there would be
introduced an unknown factor—that relating to the interdif-
fusion of one gas through another at varying pressures ; then,
by employing a reasonable hypothesis regarding the rate of
absorption of a gas, to obtain a formula which with the expe
rimental numbers might form the basis for the calculation of
the rate of interdifFusion of the two gases.
   This hypothesis, that the rate of absorption is proportional
to the pressure, has already been employed by Hurter* in his
experiments on the absorption of chlorine and carbonic dioxide
by lime, viewed from a technological point, and was supposed
also by Graham to be true for the rate of passage of a gas
through a porous diaphragm. The method, however, that the
former chemist employed does not admit of that desirable
accuracy requisite to establish the hypothesis, and indeed the
experiments in the present paper do not tend to confirm its
truth.
   The absorption-vessel employed had a capacity of 136*8
cubic centim., or, with the connecting-tubes forming part of
the gas-space, of 138*2 cubic centim. The capacity of the
500 millim. of the manometer-gauge was "845 cubic centim.,
so that between the start and the finish of an experiment the
volume varied only by about '6 per cent.; thus practically the
pressure of the unabsorbable gas was constant. The initial
pressure of the gas to be absorbed that was introduced into
this vessel was equal to 500 millim. of water, or about 6*7
cubic, centim., forming 4*82 per cent, of the whole volume.
10 cubic centim. of the potash solution (the volume that was
employed) contained 3"54 grms. KHO, or equal to about 105
times the amount requisite to combine with all the gas.
   In order to fulfil the requisite conditions of maintaining the
 volume of the absorption-vessel constant, introducing any
 desired quantity of the gas to be absorbed, and measuring the
variations of pressure during an experiment, the following
apparatus was employed, as shown on Plate X. fig. 4.
   The absorption-vessel, A, measured from the surface of the
potash to the top 195 millim., and had an internal diameter of
28*6 millim., determined by calibration with mercury. The
side chamber / for the potash solution had two marks etched
on it, the intervening volume being 10 cubic centim. ; the
glass stopper o, ground into the bottom of/ and air-tight, was

raised to allow the potash to run into A. b is a small gronnd
glass stopper, the opening to the connecting-tube being very
narrow ; this was raised simultaneously with a to afford an
exit for the displaced mixture of gases. Hydrogen or air, as
tho case might be, thoroughly dried and purified, was introduced
by the tube h, and the absorbable gas by d. In preparing the
latter gas, all the air in the generating and drying apparatus
was expelled by passing down e, having a mercury or oil-of-
vitriol trap, and finally through a potash tube attached to k : the
completed expulsion of the air was indicated by no gas passing
through the potash. 0 is a small Sprengel-puinp for exhausting
the apparatus, the mercury-fall tube being about 200 millim.
long. B is the manometer ; the tube, which was carefully
selected and calibrated, had a very uniform internal diameter
of 1*46 millim. ; the scale, a very fine one engraved on glass,
was divided into 500 millim., and inlaid into the wooden sup
port with a backing of white paper.
   As it was important that the manometer should be perfectly
reliable in its indications, considerable time was expended in
testing its accuracy. At first an air-manometer was employed,
having a comparatively large air-chamber inserted in a water-
bath to keep the temperature constant, the index being a
globule of mercury moistened with oil-of-vitriol. Although
it worked admirably, it had to be abandoned owing to the
difficulty of maintaining the index at the zero-point, due to
fluctuations of barometric pressure and temperature. Oil-of-
vitriol was next tried ; but this was found to be utterly useless,
owing to the viscosity of the liquid, for measuring variable
pressures ; for on exhausting the whole apparatus the column
of acid would continue to rise from 5 to 15 millim. after the
exhausting had ceased, whereas when air or water was em
ployed the stoppage of the pump and the movement of the
index were practically simultaneous. Mercury could not con
veniently be used in the manometer, as the experiments were
designed to be made at comparatively low pressures. Finally,
it was decided to use water in this part of the apparatus ; and
to prevent ingress of aqueous vapour into the absorption-
vessel, a small tube c, containing fused calcic chloride, was
attached between the two vessels.
   To perform an experiment, A was disconnected and tho
roughly dried and placed in position; a current of air—passed
through strong potash, oil-of-vitriol, and about two feet of
tubing packed with fused calcic chloride—was swept through
the apparatus for about one hour. When hydrogen was em
ployed as the atmosphere, the gas, generated from zinc and
dilute hydric sulphate, was passed through strong potassic

 356              Mr. J. J. Hood on the Rate of
 permanganate, potash, oil-of-vitriol, and calcic chloride ; a
 small mercury exit-trap was connected with / to prevent the
 entrance of air. When the current of gas had swept through
 the apparatus for about two hours the trap was disconnected,
 the stopper a inserted rapidly, and the screw-clip h closed.
 The apparatus was then exhausted by the Sprengel-pump till
 the level of the water in the manometer stood at 500 millim.,
 and the screw-clip g closed. The absorbable gas was admitted
 by opening the screw-clip </ and allowing the gas to enter till
 the gauge fell to zero, then closed.
    The apparatus so charged was allowed to stand for twenty
hours in order that the gases might become thoroughly mixed.
At the end of this time the potash solution was placed in the
 side chamber /; and when the temperature of the water-bath
had been kept at 16° C, the temperature at which all the
experiments were made, for about half an hour, by raising the
 stopper b, the absorbent was introduced, an operation taking
about four seconds.
    As any fluctuations in the temperature of the water-bath
produced alterations in the manometric readings, constant
attention had to be given to this. By maintaining the tem
perature of the room about ^° C. below that at which an
 experiment was made, and using a large bath, fluctuations
 were scarcely discernible, although a delicate thermometer
divided to tenths of a degree was employed. Any alterations
in the barometric pressure likewise influenced the manometer ;
 indeed so sensitive was the apparatus in this respect, that it
was quite impossible to perform an experiment during a gale,
as every gust of wind was accompanied by a depression of the
 gauge by two, three, and sometimes by even six millimetres.
AH experiments were discarded when the barometer showed
any alteration between one hour before and one hour after the
experiment As, however, the most important observations
were made during the first five minutes from the start, baro
metric changes could introduce no appreciable error.
   It was found necessary before beginning an experiment to
force the water in the gauge to the top of the scale in order
to moisten the inside of the tube ; otherwise the neglect of
this precaution rendered the results untrustworthy, owing to
the inside of the tube becoming dry by long standing, and
thereby causing irregularities in the ascent of the water.
   Although in each case the exhaustion of the apparatus was
carried to 500 millim., this pressure was never indicated at the
end of an experiment, owing to the fact that a portion of the
gas was absorbed during the running-in of the potash This
was not under control ; but only those experiments are here

 given, selected from about 126, in which the readings of the
  manometer after sixty minutes were nearly the same ; the pres
 sures being in all cases corrected for capillarity and alteration
 of level of the water-reservoir of the manometer.
    The barometric pressures show slight differences ; but some
  experiments made at differences of five and eight millimetres
 of mercury exhibited no appreciable difference in the results,
 indicating that this want of uniformity in the whole set of
 experiments may be overlooked.
    If it be assumed that the rate of absorption of a gas varies
 as its pressure, the volume remaining constant, then, Q being
 the original quantity of the gas, and q that which has been
 absorbed,
                             dq = Kpdt ;

    The object of the present work was to determine the co
 efficient c for the various gases with a view to forming an esti
 mate of their rates of interdiffusion in atmospheres of air and
 hydrogen ; for the reason, however, that experiment does not
 show the validity of this equation, the quantities e~c are only
 calculated.
    Integrating the equation, we get p=Ne~ct, N being the
initial pressure of the gas. This factor was not determined,
nor was it necessary in order to establish the formula ; for if
n, nf, n", &c. be the readings of the manometer after equal
consecutive intervals of time t, andp,p', p"} &c. the pressures,
then
                   p =N— n =Ne-rf,

and
                       n", —n' —B-Ct
This ratio, taking the intervals of time t as the unit (one
minute in the experiments), should be constant ; this, however,
is not shown by experiment to be the case, but that the ratio

                    Chemical Absorption of Gases.            359
   Here it is at once seen that the rate of absorption in the
lighter gas (hydrogen) is greater than when the carbonic
dioxide is diffused through air ; also that the hypothesis as to
the relation between the rate and the pressure of the gas does
not hold. This latter point, however, is more marked in some
of the other experiments that follow. Although the mano
meter continued to rise very slowly a few millimetres after
the sixtieth minute, it is not considered necessary to record
the observations beyond this limit.
    Sulphuretted Hydrogen.—This gas was prepared both from
sulphide of antimony, previously boiled with dilute hydric
chloride to decompose any trace of carbonate that might be
 present, and .also from ferrous sulphide; it was found, however,
 more convenient to employ the latter material. As ferrous
 sulphide usually contains particles of metallic iron, which give
 rise to an evolution of hydrogen, the material was finely
 ground, mixed with sulphur, and ignited, the operation being
 repeated twice. The gas obtained from this prepared sulphide
 gave off only a very small quantity of unabsorbable gas, which
 could influence the results but slightly.
    The densities of sulphuretted hydrogen and carbonic dioxide
 are as 17 : 22; and the following results show how much more
 rapidly the former is absorbed than the heavier gas C02. This
 is noticeable especially at the start ; the rate, especially in
hydrogen, rapidly decreases as the pressure diminishes.

   Chlorine.—In performing the experiments with this gas,
after charging the absorption-vessel the whole apparatus was
covered over with a cloth, and the room kept darkened to
prevent any decomposition taking place by the action of dif
fused light with any trace of moisture that might be present,
or combination with the free hydrogen to form hydric chloride.
After the gases had been allowed to stand twenty hours to
mix, the experiment was completed by the aid of feeble candle
light. The gas was prepared from manganic dioxide pre
viously boiled with dilute hydric chloride.
   The following tables show how much more rapidly this gas
is absorbed than the two previous ones in an atmosphere of
air ; in hydrogen the rate is not much different from that of
SHa under like conditions :—

   Sulphurous Anhydride.—Prepared in the ordinary way by
the action of strong hydric sulphate on pure copper-turnings
previously ignited in a current of coal-gas. It was considered
at first that there would be some difficulty experienced with
this gas, owing to its absorption by the water in the mano
meter, standing for so long a time as twenty hours ; but this
was scarcely perceptible.

    The foregoing tables show, in comparison with the results
 obtained for chlorine gas, a rate of absorption at the com
 mencement of the experiments in favour of the lighter gas
 S02, whilst in air both gases are absorbed with much greater
 rapidity than either C02 or SH2.
    What seems most remarkable in all the experiments, con
sidering the large size of the absorption-vessel employed and
the comparatively small quantity of gas used, is the very great
rapidity with which the gases pass into the absorbent. During
the first minute about 75 per cent, of the gases SH2, CI, and
S02 are absorbed when the atmosphere is hydrogen ; in an
atmosphere of air, too, the amount is remarkably great ; so
that the majority of the observations that succeed the first two
or three minutes are made when the gases have a compara
tively low tension, in which state there are no very marked
differences in their rates of absorption.
   How far the physical and chemical actions that take place
at the surface of separation between the gas and the absorbing
agent vitiate the foregoing experiments, as regards the nume
rical results being looked upon as measures of the interdiffusion
of the gases experimented with, are points of vital importance;
and to elucidate these a number of experiments have been
made which as yet do not throw much light upon the matter,
but indeed seem to indicate that this method for studying
interdiffusion comes nearer the ideal case cited than might at
first consideration be expected. In the first place, many ex
periments were performed with a view to see how far the

                   Chemical Absorption of Gases.              363
 strength of the absorbing agent influenced the rate of absorp
 tion of a gas, carbonic dioxide in an atmosphere of dry air
 being selected as most easily and satisfactorily purified. The
 solution of potash was reduced in strength by dilution with
 distilled water by 5 per cent, without producing any percep
 tible effect; then by 10, 15, and 30 per cent., but no variation
 in the rate of absorption was visible ; then the strength was
 reduced to one half, still the rate was practically the same as
 when the strong potash was employed : and finally it was
reduced to only one fourth of its original strength. With this
 comparatively great alteration in the potash solution the varia
 tion in the rate of absorption was not great, and was chiefly
observable at the start of the experiment by a retardation :
after the first minute the rise of the water in the manometer
was about the same as when the strong potash was used.
This result may be accounted for by the fact that the dilute
solution, when introduced into the absorption-vessel containing
a thoroughly dry atmosphere, would evolve aqueous vapour
and so depress the gauge, at the same time as the gas was
being absorbed; and for this reason solutions of a less strength
 were not employed. The results of these experiments are
 illustrated by the following three tables (p. 364), marked a, 0,
 and 7, which show the numbers obtained when the potash
 solution had a strength of 1,     and \ respectively.
    No systematic series of experiments of a similar nature were
made with the other gases ; but as two complete sets of expe
riments with the different gases in hydrogen and in air were
made in which the strengths of the potash differed by 30 per
cent., and the results obtained in the two cases showed no
greater differences than individual experiments of either set,
there is no doubt that what the above results show to be true
 for C02, viz. that the rate of absorption practically does not
vary with the strength of the absorbing agent, holds good for
 the other absorbable gases. If it be assumed that, by mea
suring the rate of absorption of a gas, an estimate is obtained
of its rate of interdiffusion through another gas, the above
result is what might be expected ; for the mere strength of
 the absorbing agent cannot influence the number of impacts
of the molecules on its surface. This number will be the same
whether a strong or a weak solution be employed ; and if all
the impinging molecules of the gas be absorbed, the rate of
absorption would remain invariable with a variation in the
strength of the absorbing agent.
    In every case it is seen that the hypothesis that the rate of
absorption is proportional to the pressure breaks down ; this is
especially noticeable in those cases in which the gas is absorbed

 most rapidly or in which the greater portion of the gas is ab
 sorbed in the first two or three minutes. This might be due
 to the salt produced by the gas and the potash forming a kind
 of skin on the surface of the absorbent, and so retarding further
 action. If such were the case, and if the ratio of the pres
sures at equal intervals of time ought in truth to be constant,
by making experiments in which the gas had initially dif
 ferent pressures the values of this ratio would be somewhat
 similar. To investigate this point, the gas SOs was selected
in an atmosphere of dry air, as here this coefficient varies
considerably between limits of pressure easily accessible to
 experiment. From a number of experiments the following
 three (p. 366) are selected, and they show very clearly that
 this coefficient really does increase as the pressure diminishes.
 This result may in fact be an indication that the coefficient of
 diffusion of a gas is a quantity variable with the pressure ;
 which has not yet been shown satisfactorily in an expe
 rimental way, although theoretical considerations seem to
 suggest the idea.
    It seems scarcely possible that the very much greater rate of
absorption of the heavier gases CI and SO* than that of COs,
under like circumstances, can be due to the formation of cur
rents or a down-pouring of the gases upon the surface of the
potash. In order to see if such could be the cause of the
anomaly, several experiments were made in the following
way:—The absorption-vessel was charged in the usual manner
with C02 in an atmosphere of hydrogen and allowed to stand
twenty hours, the solution of potash run in, and the rate of
absorption observed. When the experiment was completed
and all the gas seemed to be absorbed, C02 was allowed to
flow into the apparatus upon the potash until the manometer
fell to zero, the inlet of the gas immediately closed, and the
gauge observed as before. In this case, the 003 being twenty-
two times heavier than the atmosphere (hydrogen), the former
gas might be expected to tumble down to the bottom of the
vessel more or less in the form of a cloud, and its rapid ab
sorption indicate the fact. Such, however, did not seem to
be the case. The water in the manometer began at once to
rise, and during the first five minutes, or till about 65 per
cent, of the gas was absorbed, the rate of absorption was con
siderably slower than when the gases had been allowed to
mix thoroughly for twenty hours. After the fifth minute the
rate began to increase slightly, and continued to be greater
than in the first experiment, the pressure of the COs being
also greater up to the end of the thirtieth minute; by the end
of the sixtieth minute the manometric reading was still a few

    That the chemical and physical actions that take place at
 the surface of the absorbing agent in these experiments do
 influence the rate of absorption cannot be denied; and to what
an extent these actions distort the measurements as regards
their bearing on the interdiffusion of gases, and whether they
will account for the anomaly in the case of CI and SOj com
pared with C03 and SH2, are important points for further
study. The employment of different alkalies for absorbing
these gases and the various acids for absorbing NH3 would
seem to afford ample material for working out the subject ;
and this may form the substance of a future communication.
 Considering, however, the result obtained by a variation of
 the strength of the potash, it may be conjectured that neither
 the nature of the alkali employed will influence much the rate
 of absorption of these gases, nor the acid that of NH3 ; but
these points remain to be proved by experiment.
XLI. Examination of Mr. Alfred R. Wallace's Modification
    of the Physical Theory of Secular Changes of Climate. By
    James Cboll, LL.D., F.R.S.
                      [Continued from p. 111.]
 Part II. Geological and Palozontological Facts in relation to
             Mr. Wallace's Modificaton of the Theory.
MR. WALLACE'S chief, and indeed only real, modifica
          tion of my theory, is to the effect, as I have pointed
out, that the alternate phases of precession causing the winter
of each hemisphere to be in aphelion and perihelion each
10,500 years would produce a complete change of climate
only when a country was partially snow-clad. According to
his view, when the greater part of North-western Europe was
almost wholly buried under snow and ice, those glacial con
ditions must have continued, and perhaps have even become
intensified, when the winter solstice moved round to perihelion,
instead of being replaced, as I have maintained, by an almost
perpetual spring. In short, Mr. Wallace's conclusion is that,
during the Glacial Epoch proper, a warm and equable Inter-
glacial Period could not have occurred.
   In the preceding part of this paper I have endeavoured to
show that physical principles do not warrant such a con
clusion. I shall now proceed to consider what the direct
testimony of Geology and Palaeontology is on the subject;
and 1 believe we shall find that the facts of Geology and

368           Dr. J. Croll on the Physical Theory
Palaeontology are as much opposed to the conclusion as are
the principles of Physics.
   On this point I may quote the evidence of a geologist who,
more than any other, has devoted special attention to all points
relating to Glacial and Interglacial periods. Prof. J. Geikie,
after devoting upwards of 500 pages of his ' Prehistoric
Europe ' to the consideration and accumulation of facts from
all parts of this country and the Continent relating to Glacial
and Interglacial periods, gives the following as the result of
his investigations:—
   " We note," he says, " as we advance from Pliocene times,
how the climatic conditions of the colder epochs of the Glacial
Period increase in severity until they culminate with the appear
ance of that great northern mer de glace which overwhelmed
all Northern Europe, and reached as far south as the 50th
parallel of latitude in Saxony. Thereafter the glacial epochs
decline in importance until in the Postglacial Period they cease
to return. The genial climate of Interglacial ages probably
also attained a maximum towards the middle of the Pleistocene
Period, and afterwards became less genial at successive stages,
the temperate and equable conditions of early Postglacial times
being probably the latest manifestation of the Interglacial
phase.' (' Prehistoric Europe/ p. 561.)
   I shall now quote the same author's description of an Inter
glacial Period as demonstrated by its flora and fauna. The
reader must, however, observe that by Pleistocene Period
Professor Geikie means the so-called Glacial Period with its
alternations of severe arctic climate and mild and genial con
ditions. See p. 544, ' Prehistoric Europe.'
   "An examination," he says, " of Pleistocene organic remains
leads us to conclude that strongly contrasted climatic condi
tions alternated during the Period. At one time an extremely
equable and genial climate prevailed, allowing animals, which
are now relegated to widely-separated zones, to live throughout
the year in one and the same latitude. Hippopotamuses,
elephants, and rhinoceroses, Irish deer, horses, oxen, and
bisons then ranged from the borders of the Mediterranean as
far north at least as Middle England and Northern Germany.
In like manner, plants which no longer occur together—some
being banished to hilly regions, while others are restricted to
low grounds, and yet others have retreated to the extreme
south of the Continent or to warmer regions beyond the limits
of Europe—lived side by side. The fig-tree, the judas-tree,
and the Canary laurel flourished in Northern France along
with the sycamore, the hazel, and the willow. And we en
counter in the Pleistocene deposits of various countries in

                   of Secular Changes of Climate.               369
  Europe the same remarkable commingling of northern and
  southern forms—of forms that demand a humid climate and
  are capable of enduring considerable cold, together with species
  which, while seeking moist conditions, yet could not survive
 the cold of our present winters. The testimony of the mam
  mals and plants is confirmed by that of the land and freshwater
  mollusca—all the evidence thus conspiring to demonstrate
 that the climate of Pleistocene Europe was, for some time at
 all events, remarkably equable and somewhat humid. The
 summers may not indeed have been warmer than they are
 now; the winters, however, were certainly much more genial."
 ('Prehistoric Europe/ p. 540.)
    This, be it observed, is a description of a condition of things
 which existed during an Interglacial Period belonging, not to
 the close, but to the very climax of the Glacial Epoch. For
 immediately preceding and succeeding this Period almost the
 whole of Northern Europe was enveloped in one continuous
 sheet of ice. "But if," continues Prof. J. Geikie, "the
 evidence of such a climate having formerly obtained be very
 weighty, not less convincing are the proofs, supplied by the
 Pleistocene deposits, of extreme conditions. Think what must
 have been the state of Middle and Northern Europe when
 Palaeolithic man hunted the reindeer in Southern France, and
 when the arctic willow and its congeners grew at low levels
 in Central Europe. Reflect upon the fact that in the very
 same latitude in France, where at one time the Canary laurel
and the fig-tree flourished, the pine, the spruce, and northern
and high-alpine mosses at another time found a congenial
habitat. Bear in view, also, that the land and freshwater
molluscs testify in like manner to the same strongly contrasted
climate. Besides those that tell of more equable and genial
 conditions than the present, there are species now restricted
to the higher Alps and northern latitudes that formerly
abounded in middle Europe, and their shells occur commingled
in the same deposits with the remains of lemmings, marmots,
reindeer, and other northern and mountain-loving animals."
(P. 541.)
    But more convincing still is another range of facts, some of
which have been adduced by Mr. Wallace himself. In a sec
tion on alternations of warm and cold periods during the
Glacial Epoch (' Island Life,' p. 114), he says:—
    " The evidence that such was the case " (alternate warm and
cold periods) " is very remarkable. The ' Till,' as we have
seen, could only have been formed when the country was en
tirely buried under a large ice-sheet of enormous thickness,
and when it must therefore have been, in all the parts so

  370             Dr. J. Croll on the Physical Theory
  covered, almost entirely destitute of animal and vegetable life.
  But in several places in Scotland fine layers of sand and
  gravel, with beds of peaty matter, have been found resting on
  ' till ' and again covered by ' till.' Sometimes these interca
  lated beds are very thin, but in other cases they are twenty or
  thirty feet thick, and in them have been found remains of the
  extinct ox, the Irish elk, the horse, reindeer, and mammoth.
  Here we have evidence of two distinct periods of intense cold,
  and an intervening milder period sufficiently prolonged for
  the country to become covered with vegetation and stocked
  with animal life."
      Let us now see to what all this leads. It has been proved
  beyond the possibility of a doubt that, at the time the Till
  was being formed which overlies the Scottish interglacial beds,
 the whole of Scotland, Scandinavia, the bed of the North Sea,
 and a great part of the North of England were covered with
 one continuous sheet of ice upwards of 2000 feet in thickness.
 This sheet overwhelmed the Hebrides, the Orkney and Shet
 land Islands, extended into Russia, filled the basin of the
 Baltic, overflowed Denmark and Holstein, and advanced into
 North Germany as far at least as Berlin. It has also been
 demonstrated that, at the time the Lower Till was being formed
 which underlies these interglacial beds, North-western Europe
 was under a still more severe state of glaciation. The ice-
 sheet at this time advanced further south into England, and
 extended into North Germany as far as Saxony. It is per
 fectly obvious that this sheet must have destroj-ed all plant
 and animal life in Scotland ; and before the country could
 have become covered with vegetation and stocked with those
 interglacial animals, to which Mr. Wallace refers, the ice must
 have disappeared and the climate become mild.
     Equally conclusive are the facts adduced by Mr. Wallace in
 reference to the interglacial beds of England. " In the east
 of England Mr. Skertchly," he says, " enumerates four distinct
 boulder clays with intervening deposits of gravels and sands.
 Mr. Searles V. Wood, Jun., classes the most recent (Hessle)
 boulder-clay as ' post-glacial,' but he admits an intervening
 warmer period, characterized by southern forms of mollusca
 and insects, after which glacial conditions again prevailed
with northern types of mollusca. Elsewhere Mr. Wood says :—
' Looking at the presence of such fluviatile mollusca as (Jyrena
fluminalis and Unio littoralis, and of such mammalia as the
hippotamus and other great pachyderms, and of such a littoral
Lusitanian fauna as that of the Selsea bed, where it is mixed
up with the remains of some of those pachyderms, as well as
of some other features, it has seemed to me that the climate of

                  of Secular Changes of Climate.               371
 the earlier part of the Postglacial Period in England was pos
 sibly even warmer than our present climate ; and that it was
 succeeded by a refrigeration sufficiently severe to cause ice to
 form all round our coasts, and glaciers to accumulate in
 the valleys of the mountain districts.' " That these fauna
 indicate a warm and equable condition of climate is further
 evident from Mr. Wallace's remarks :—" The fact," he says,
 "of the hippopotamus having lived at 54° N. lat. in Eng
 land, quite close to the time of the Glacial Epoch, is abso
 lutely inconsistent with a mere gradual amelioration of climate
 from that time till the present day. The immense quantity
 of vegetable food which this creature requires, implies a mild
 and uniform climate with hardly any severe winter ; and no
 theory that has yet been suggested renders this possible except
 that of alternate cold and warm periods during the Glacial
 Epoch itself.             Thus the very existence of the hippo
 potamus in Yorkshire as well as in the south of England in
 close association with glacial conditions must be held to be a
 strong corroborative argument in favour of the reality of an
 interglacial warm period."
    I trust that Mr. Wallace has not been misled by Mr. Wood's
 unfortunate use of the term " Postglacial " as applied to the
 Hessle boulder-clay. The Hessle boulder-clay as surely belongs
 to the Glacial Period proper as does the true Till of Scotland,
 which covers the Lowlands and overlies the interglacial beds
 cf that country. It is the moraine profonde of the last mer
de glace which covered the greater part of North-western
Europe. The Upper Till of Scotland and the Hessle boulder-
 clay of England belong to the same period. This has been
clearly shown by Prof. J. Geikie in his ' Great Ice-Age,'
chap. xxx. (2nd edit.), and in ' Prehistoric Europe,' chap, xii.,
and elsewhere. The Hessle boulder-clay is, in short, a con
tinuation of the Upper Till of Scotland.
   The position of these Hessle beds to which Mr. Wallace
refers, like that of the interglacial beds of Scotland, is between
two boulder-clays—the Hessle and the Purple boulder-clays,
both of which indicate a period of extreme glaciation : only
the Purple boulder-clay period was somewhat the more severe
of the two. At both periods the greater part of North-western
Europe was buried under ice. We know that during the last
Seat ice-period, which was undoubtedly the period of the
   essle boulder-clay, the ice-sheet reached in North Germany
as far as Berlin; while during the period of the Purple boulder-
clay it advanced to about Saxony.
   The observations of Prof. Torrell, Dr. A. Penck, Prof.
Credner, Prof. Berendt, Dr. Jentzsch, A. Helland, F. Wahn

 372            Dr. J. Croll on the Physical Theory
 schaffe, H. Habenicht, and other geologists have shown that
there are in North Germany three distinct boulder-clays—an
 Upper, Middle, and Lower, with two series of interglacial
beds. In these interglacial beds have been found organic
 remains which evidently indicate a mild and genial condition
of climate. The younger interglacial period (the one prior
to the last great extension of the ice) in all probability corre
 sponds to the last interglacial period of Scotland, England,
and Ireland. Interglacial beds belonging to the 6ame period
have been found in Switzerland, Italy, Denmark, North Ame
rica, and other places, all indicating a mild and equable con
 dition of climate.
    There is another class of facts, almost entirely overlooked,
 which will doubtless yet prove even more conclusively the
 warm character of interglacial periods. These facts will be
 referred to when we come to consider the question of warm
 polar climates.
    It would be impossible within the limits of the present
 paper to give even the briefest outline of the recent disco
veries in regard to interglacial periods. But though this were
possible it would be wholly unnecessary, as the facts which
 have already been adduced by Mr. Wallace himself are per
 fectly sufficient for our present purpose.
    If now it be true, as it undoubtedly is, that the Hessle
boulder-clay of England belongs to the same age as the Upper
Till of Scotland, and that the last warm interglacial period,
when the Cyrena Auminalis and Unio littoralis, the hippo
potamus, the Elephas antiquus, and other animals of a southern
type lived in England, occurred between two glacial periods so
 severe as to envelop the greater part of North-western Europe
 in a continuous sheet of ice, then this particular interglacial
period must have supervened during a high state of eccen
tricity, and not, as Mr. Wallace assumes, at a period subsequent
 to the Glacial Epoch proper, when the eccentricity had greatly
diminished. This is obvious ; for if the last great ice-sheet
 could have been produced without a high state of eccentricity,
then there seems no reason why the one preceding it should
not also have been produced without high eccentricity. If so,
then all the previous ice-sheets may in like manner have been
so produced. For the difference in magnitude between the
last and penultimate ice-sheets was not so great as to warrant
the supposition of any considerable difference in the amount
of eccentricity at the two periods when these ice-sheets were
respectively developed. In short, if the last great ice-sheet
can be explained without the supposition of a high state of
eccentricity, then there does not appear to be any real necessity

                  of Secular Changes of Climate.              373
for any theory of eccentricity in accounting for the Glacial
Epoch.
   If we adopt the Physical theory of the cause of the Glacial
Epoch, we are compelled to maintain that the last two great Ice-
periods were the indirect results of a high state of eccentricity,
and in this case we can hardly avoid the conclusion that the
mild intervening period was due to the same cause. The
occurrence of a mild interglacial period between the two ice-
periods is directly in opposition to Mr. Wallace's view—that
during a high state of eccentricity the ice would not disappear
but be continued. It is in perfect harmony, however, with
that which I advocate ; for during high eccentricity a mild
and equable condition of climate, when the winters occur in
perihelion, is as much a necessary result as a cold and glacial
condition when they occur in aphelion.
   The facts of Geology thus to me appear so far to be as much
opposed to Mr. Wallace's modifications as are the principles
of Physics.
   Difficulty in detecting the Climatic Character of the earlier
Interglacial Periods.—It follows according to theory that , other
things being equal, the greater the amount of eccentricity the
more equable and mild will the interglacial periods be. It is
probable therefore that some of the earlier interglacial periods
were milder and more equable than the last. It may be difficult
in the present state of our knowledge to prove this conclusion
by direct geological and palseontological evidence ; but, on
the other hand, it is certainly impossible to disprove it by that
means. The absence of deposits containing organic remains
indicative of a superior mildness of climate having obtained
during early interglacial periods cannot certainly be regarded
as satisfactory evidence against the conclusion just referred to.
When we consider the enormous pressure and destructive
power of an ice-sheet some 2000 or 3000 feet in thickness
grinding down the face of a country, our surprise is that so
much evidence remains of even the last interglacial period.
That so few relics of the flora and fauna of preceding inter
glacial periods have been preserved is a conclusion which we
might a priori anticipate. This fact has been clearly pointed
out by Mr. Wallace himself, who says :—" If there have been,
not two only, but a series of such alternations of climate, we
could not possibly expect to find more than the most slender
indications of them, because each succeeding ice-sheet would
necessarily grind down or otherwise destroy much of the
superficial deposits left by its predecessors, while the torrents
that must always have accompanied the melting of these huge
masses of ice would wash away even such fragments as might
have escaped the ice itself" (p. 118).

374             Dr. J. Croll on the Physical Theory
    When we pass beyond the limits reached by the ice-sheets
 of the Glacial Epoch we may expect, of course, to find the
remains of many of the plants and animals which lived during
 the earlier interglacial periods. But here, again, we encounter
another difficulty; for we have in this case seldom any means
 of determining the age to which these remains belong. Unless
in relation to overlying and underlying boulder-clays, there
 seems in many cases no way of knowing to what interglacial
 period they ought to be assigned ; or, in fact, whether they
 are really interglacial or not. If the remains in question
 indicated a condition of climate much milder than the present,
 the probability is that they would be classified as preglacial.
 I fully agree with Prof. J. Geikie, that many of those plants
 and animals of a southern type which have been regarded as
 preglacial are in reality of interglacial age.
    Objection as to the Number of Interglacial Periods.—It has
been urged as an objection to the physical theory of the
 Glacial Epoch, that according to it there ought to have been
 more interglacial periods than we have direct evidence of
 having actually occurred. I am doubtful as to the force of
 this objection. I do not think that there could have been
 more than about five well-marked interglacial periods during
 the entire Glacial Epoch ; three probably during the former
 half of the epoch, and certainly not more than two during the
latter half. There*would be a large interval between ihe two
maxima of eccentricity of 100,000 and 200,000 years ago, when
 the alternations of climate would be comparatively moderate in
 extent. Besides, it is not correct to assume, as is generally
done, that the interval between two consecutive interglacial
periods is only 21,000 years ; for the mean rate of motion of
the perihelion during the Glacial Epoch was considerably less
than has been assumed. It will be seen from the Table of the
Longitude of the Perihelion, given in 'Climate and Time,'
p. 320, that it has taken the perihelion 231,000 years to make
one complete revolution.       If, therefore, we assume, what of
course is not certain, that the mean rate of precession during
the Glacial Epoch was the same as the present, then the
rate of precession to that of the perihelion's motion would, in
this case, be as 9 to 1. The equinoxial point will take 25,811
years to make one revolution; but as the perihelion moves
in the opposite direction, it will reduce the time taken by the
point in passing from perihelion round to perihelion to 23,230
years, which will represent the mean interval between two
consecutive interglacial periods. But as the motion of the
perihelion was very irregular, the length of the interval be
tween the periods would of course differ considerably.

                  of Secular Changes of Climate.               375
   When we consider how difficult it mast be to detect in the
drift covering glaciated countries even a relic of early inter-
glacial deposits, and when moreover we remember that it is
only within the past few years that geologists have begun to
bestow any attention on the subject, it is certainly not sur
prising that direct geological evidence of so few interglacial
periods has as yet been discovered. In England geologists
have, however, already detected evidence of three interglacial
periods with four or five ice-periods. In Germany, quite
recently, two interglacial periods and three or more ice-periods
have been recognized by competent observers. In Denmark
 there are four boulder-clays separated by intercalated beds of
 sand and clay. In severely glaciated Scotland, where traces
 of former interglacial periods can hardly be expected, there
 have nevertheless been found in old preglacial buried channels
 and other sheltered hollows three, four, and in some places five,
 boulder-clays, separated from one another by immense beds of
 sand, gravel, and clay. Some of these beds are found to be
 continuous for long distances. It is true that these intercalated
 beds have yielded few or no organic remains, but it may well
 be that further research will yet result in the discovery of
  more abundant fossils; for frequently the beds in question are
  too thick and too extensive to allow us to infer their subglacial
  origin. They do not in such respects resemble the deposits
  which have been accumulated by aqueous action under ice,
  but have all the characteristics of deposits which have been
  laid down in lakes and lacustrine hollows. As some have
  already yielded organic remains, a more extended scrutiny
  will probably lead to the discovery of similar fossils in those
  beds which are at present believed to be unfossiliferous.
      Interglacial Periods less strongly marked in Temperate
  Regions than Glacial.—I quite agree with Mr. Wallace that the
  interglacial deposits never exhibit any indication of a climate
  whose warmth corresponded to the severity of the preceding
  cold. This, however, cannot be urged as an objection, for it
  is a result which follows as a necessary consequence from
  theory. It theoretically follows that the cold of the glacial
  periods will not only exceed in severity the heat of the inter
  glacial, but will also be of longer duration. During the glacial
  periods extreme cold is the characteristic of the winters, which,
  owing to the presence of snow and ice, only becomes mode
  rated, although, of course, considerably, during tho summers.
  But, on the other hand, during interglacial periods mildness
  and equability of temperature rather than heat are the cha
  racteristics both of summer and winter.
     That the cold of the glacial periods must have continued

 376        Physical Theory of Secular Changes of Climate.
 longer than the warmth of the interglacial will, I think, be
 apparent from the following considerations. As long as a
 country remains permanently covered with snow and ice, the
 climate, as has been repeatedly shown, must continue cold, no
 matter what the direct heat of the sun may be. Astronomi
 cally considered the interglacial periods are, of course, of the
 same length as the glacial,—the mean length of which, during
 the Glacial Epoch, was about 11,600 years ; but the cold of
 a glacial period would not, as we shall presently see, actu
 ally terminate at the end of the period, but would be continued
 on probably for centuries into the succeeding interglacial
 period. Suppose that during a glacial period the country is
 covered with a sheet of ice, which during the continuance of
 the period had accumulated to the thickness of 2000 or 3000
 feet. All this enormous quantity of ice would have to be
 melted off the ground before the warmth of the interglacial
period would commence. So long as a single inch of ice
 covered the surface of the country, the cold would continue.
 Ice, as we have seen, by chilling the air induces fresh snow to
 fall ; and of course it is only when the amount of ice annually
 melted exceeds that being formed from the falling snow, that
 a diminution in the thickness of the sheet would begin to take
place. A real melting of the ice, and consequent decrease in
the thickness of the sheet, would probably not commence till
the astronomical and physical agencies in operation during
the glacial period began to act in an opposite direction. In
 short, it would be the favourable conditions of the interglacial
 period that would effectually remove the ice; and it would be
then, and only then, that the warmth would begin; while,
 again, at the close of the period, when the first inch of ice
made its appearance on the surface of the country, the inter
glacial condition of climate would come to an end. The time
required to remove the ice does not prevent an interglacial
condition of climate ; it only somewhat shortens its duration.
    There is another circumstance worthy of notice here. It is
this : as the mild and equable character of the climate during
interglacial periods resulted to a large extent from the enor
mous transference of equatoreal heat, and its distribution over
temperate and polar regions, the difference of climatic condi
tions between the subtropical and the temperate and polar
regions would be less marked than at present ; in other words,
the temperature would not differ so much with latitude as it
does at present. This, as we have seen, is a conclusion which
is fully borne out by geological and palaeontological facts.
   The question as to the probable cause of warm polar climates
will next be considered.

         J-     developed on intermixture of strong and weak
 solutions, the following series of observations were made with
 solutions of zinc and cadmium chlorides, these salts being
more especially selected because the calorimetric observations
 detailed later on (§ 160) showed that, whereas the heat of
 dilution of cadmium-sulphate solutions is greater than that of
 zinc-sulphate solutions, the opposite relationship holds with
 the solutions of the chlorides of these metals.

 378 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
 exceeds that of a for all cases where equal molecular strengths
 of solutions are used in zinc-cadmium-chloride cells; t. e. the
 E.M.F. of a cell set up with zinc and cadmium chlorides,
 amalgamated zinc, and electro-cadmium decreases as the solu
 tion-strength increases, both solutions being equal in strength.
    A number of observations made with the galvanometer
 showed that this is the case, and that the value of the E.M.F.
 of any zinc-cadmium-chloride cell is given in volts by the
 equation
                          E = -330 + a-6,
 where "330 is the E.M.F. of a cell containing amalgamated-
 zinc and electro-cadmium plates, and solutions of the chlorides
 of equal strength *25MC12 100 H20; whilst a and b are the
 values deduced from the above tables for the difference of
 potential set up for solutions of this strength as compared with
 the particular strengths employed in the cell examined.
    157. A noteworthy point in connexion with the value "330
 volt for solutions *25MC1S 100H2O is the following. Ac
 cording to Julius Thomsen (Journ. Prakt. Chemie, xi. p. 402),
 the heats of formation of cadmium and zinc sulphates dissolved
 in400H2O (-25MS04 100 H20) exhibit exactly the same dif
 ference as exists between those of cadmium and zinc chlorides
 dissolved in 200 H20; thus:—
     Zn, O, S03, aq= 106090             Zn, Cl„ aq= 112840
     Cd, O, SOs, aq      89500          Cd, Cl2, aq _96250
                         16590                         16590
    Consequently, as the heat of dilution of ZnCl2 200 H20
 to ZnCl2 400 H20 exceeds that of CdCl2 200H2O to CdCl2
 400 H2 O, and the excess is to be added to the above difference
 in the case of the chlorides, the heat evolved in the displace
 ment of cadmium by zinc from CdCl2 400 H20 is slightly
greater than that from CdSO4400H2O. The electromotive
forces of zinc-cadmium-sulphate and zinc-cadmium-chloride
cells for solutions of strengths MS04 400 H20, and MC1S
400 H20 (-25MS04 and -25MC12 per 100 H20) do not ex
hibit this relationship: on the contrary, the E.M.F. of the
latter is materially less than that of the former; and, further,
is distinctly less than that corresponding to the heat evolved
in the net chemical change with which the E.M.F. of the
former fairly coincides; thus :—
   E.M.F. corresponding to 16590 gramme- "\
      degrees per gramme-molecule, or 8295 > = "365 volt,

      and electro-cadmium plates                 )
    The difference betwen -365 and "330 volt, or '035 volt,
represents nearly 10 per cent, of the former value, and cor
responds to upwards of 1500 gramme-degrees per gramme-
molecule, a quantity almost too large to be likely to be due
solely to accumulation of experimental errors. This point
will be further discussed in a future paper.
    158. No material difference is made in the relationships
between the E.M.F.'s observed (deduced from the assumption
that the E.M.F. of Clark's cell = 1-457 volt) and those calcu
lated from the heat-values (by using the factor 4410), when,
instead of the numerical values l-457 and 4410 for these quan
tities (hitherto purposely employed throughout for the sake
 of uniformity), the more exact values are used deduced from
more recent observations on the true value of the B.A. unit
 of resistance, and especially those of Lord Eayleigh, which
 indicate that the true value is only "9868 x 10'. For the use
 of this corrected value reconciles the apparent discrepancy
 between Joule's various valuations of the mechanical equiva
 lent of heat(§§ 33, 34, Part I.)j and, further, causes all the
 different estimations of the value of J discussed in §§ 55 and
 56 (Part III.) to agree fairly well together, and to become on
 reduction values close to the mean result of Joule's friction
  experiments, viz. 41*555 megalergs (§ 34). Combining this
  value of J with the mean value of the " Faraday coefficient "
  (the quantity referred to in § 7, Part I., as indicated by but
  which may be gracefully indicated instead by F in commemora
  tion of Faraday) deducible from the experiments of Kohlrausch
  and the more recent ones of Mascart, viz. 0001048 (§ 103,
  footnote, Part V.), the end result is attained that
              JF=41-555 x 10' x -0001048=4355.
  Now 4355 = 4410 x -9875; so that whilst the actual measure
  ments of E.M.F. are reduced in the ratio '9868, those deduced
  from heat-valuations must concurrently be reduced in the
  ratio -9875, or almost exactly to the same extent. If J be
  taken = 41*5 x 106, the reduction ratio becomes "9862 instead
   of 9875. Hence it appears that in order to reduce to the
                                2C2

 380 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on tlie Determination of
 values most consistent with the bulk of evidence at present
 extant the various E.M.F. determinations described in the
 previous portions of these researches, it will practically suffice
 to multiply them by "987, i. e. to subtract 1*3 per cent, of
 their value, whether the figures be direct determinations of
 E.M.F. or deductions from calorimetric experiments.
    It may further be noticed that when the value '987 x 108
 for the B.A. unit is taken, in consequence that of Clark's cell
 becomes *987 x 1*457 = 1*438 volt; so that the mean value of
 the E.M.F. corresponding to the work done in electrolysing
 water, as directlv determined in Part II. § 46, becomes
 1*4808 x 108 C.G.S. units, taking J = 41*555 x 106 instead of
 42 x 10°, as in Part II. The mean heat-valuation arrived at
 § 31, Part L, from the results of various experimenters em
 ploying the calorimeter, being 34100 gramme-degrees, the
 product 34100 xJF becomes 34100 x 4355 = 1*4850, which
 value exceeds 1*4808 by only *29 per cent., a quantity falling
 within the limits of probable error in the experiments (±*32
 per cent.). Inasmuch as from various causes a slight syste
 matic error of defect necessarily attended the direct determi
 nations, the final conclusion is warranted that these direct
 determinations are sensibly in accordance with the two propo
 sitions, firstly that the B.A. unit is actually only *987 x 10s;
 and, secondly, that Clark's cell has an E.M.F. of -987 x 1*457
 = 1*438 volt.
    159. The experiments described in §§ 153 and 154 lead to
the conclusion that a Daniell cell containing solutions of zinc
and copper sulphate of equal strengths has an almost invari
able E.M.F. whatever the strengths of the solutions when the
plates are of amalgamated zinc and electro-copper * but rises
in E.M.F. if the plates are either amalgamated zinc and amal
gamated copper, electro-zinc and electro-copper, or, a fortiori,
electro-zinc and amalgamated copper. It seemed desirable to
substantiate these deductions more rigorously. Accordingly
two pairs of solutions of zinc and copper sulphate were care
fully prepared, such that one pair had the composition
2*069 MS04 100 HaO, and the other the composition *0937
MSO4100H2O. Cells were then set up with these fluids,
opposed to one another, and series of readings taken. It was
found that the numbers thus obtained exhibited much greater
divergences and fluctuations than those similarly obtained
with cells where the molecular strengths of the solutions were
not equal in each case respectively. In the latter case the cur
rent always passed in one direction,and did not exhibit any very
marked alteration in magnitude during the first 15 to 30 minutes
after setting up (during which period the observations above

        Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive Force.          381
described were ordinarily made) ; but with two opposed Da-
niell cells, containing pairs of solutions of the same strengths
in each severally, the differential current sometimes passed in
one direction on first setting up, sometimes in the opposite
direction ; sometimes it increased in intensity as time elapsed,
and sometimes it diminished : in the latter case occasionally
it diminished to nil, and then flowed in the opposite direction
with gradually increasing intensity. Thus, for instance, the
following numbers were obtained in one set of observations
where the density never exceeded "02 microamperes per square
centimetre, and was usually much le3S, so that " polarization "
errors were eliminated (§ 150). The total resistance in cir
cuit (including galvanometer and cells) was 107,400 B.A.
units. The sign + indicates that the E.M.F. of the cell con
taining the stronger solutions was higher than that of the
other; the sign — indicates the opposite. Readings were
taken every minute for 15 minutes after setting up ; the
plates were then exchanged (after rinsing with the appropriate
solutions), and another similar series of readings taken : a
second, and then a third exchange was similarly made, readings
for 15 minutes being again taken in each case : the readings
are translated into millivolts, every scale-division being equal,
in these experiments, to 85- 7 elassoamperes, and consequently

tions of the same strength, amalgamated zinc and electro-copper,
is really independent of tlie solution-strength within the limits
of observational error.

   Heat developed during Intermixture of Solutions of Zinc
      {Copper or Cadmium) Sulpliates or Chlorides of different
       Strengths.
     160. The results above described show that when two solu
  tions of different strengths, but containing the same metallic
  salt, are allowed to intermix by diffusion, plates of the metal
  contained in the salt immersed in the two solutions respectively
  acquire different potentials, the potential-difference set up with
  any given pair of solutions being to some extent dependent on
  the surface-characters of the plates employed , but being, cateris
 paribus, greater the greater the difference between the strengths
  of the solutions, the plates immersed in the stronger solution
 acquiring the higher potential. It is evident that if there is
  a development of heat during intermixture of the solutions
  used, the work done by a current developed on connecting
 the plates by a conductor may reasonably be supposed to be
  done in virtue of this heat-development, just as the work done
 by an ordinary voltaic couple is done in virtue of the heat
  developed by the chemical actions taking place therein. Ac
 cordingly it becomes of interest to determine precisely what
 amounts of heat are actually generated during intermixture
 in order to see what relationships hold between the electro
 motive forces actually generated and those corresponding to
 the heat-developments.
     The required " heats of intermixture " are readily calcu
lable from the values representing the " heats of dilution "
 obtained by measuring the amounts of heat produced when
solutions of metallic salts are diluted to known extents by

of dilution of gramme-molecules of the three solutions MS04
2aH20, MS0426HaO, and MS04(a + i)H?0 to the same

produce two of the third, is given by the equation
                            H = A1 + /*2-2/i3.
   In order to obtain the data for the calculation of the various
values of H in the case of the solutions examined in the pre
ceding pages, a number of calorunetric determinations were
made, substantially in the way described by Julius Thomsen
(Thermochemisehe Untersuchungen, i. p. 18, 1882), using a
calorimeter containing 1 litre of fluid in the lower compart
ment. The quantity of salt employed was usually close upon
^ gramme-molecule, the weight being arranged so that the
resulting fluid was of the strength MSO4400H2O, or
MCl2400H2O. The thermometers nsed were graduated in
millimetres, about 11 millimetres representing 1 C.j so that
readings being made to ±-%o millim., the thermometer-error
was ±?j?>o °f 1° C. As determined by means of various
blank experiments (with water only intermixed), the limit of
accuracy of each experiment was within ± 10 gramme-degrees;
so that each observation might be erroneous within the limits
of not exceeding ±70 gramme-degrees per gramme-molecule;
but as several observations were usually made and averaged,
the probable error of each average was ordinarily within + 25
gramme-degrees. The following numbers were ultimately
obtained as means from upwards of fifty observations, indi
cating the heat-evolution, in gramme-degrees per gramme-
molecule, on diluting mMS04 100 H30 to -25MS04 100 HsO,

386 Messrs. Wright and Thompson on the Determination of
    Analogous results are obtained when the calculations are
similarly made for other kinds of mixture : the observed
E.M.F. generally notably exceeds that calculated from the
heat of intermixture*. It would hence seem that the modus
operandi of a "diffusion-cell" is to some extent rather analo
gous to that of a thermo-couple than to that of an ordinary
galvanic element, part at least of the energy gained outside
the battery being due, not to the heat-development during
chemical action taking place, but to the transformation of
sensible heat into electric-current energy. It is noteworthy,
moreover, that analogous phenomena are presented in cases
where strong and weak solutions of acids (e. g. nitric and sul
phuric) interdiffuse, platinum or other unoxidizable plates
being employed : diffusion-cells of this kind are now being
examined.
    By uniting together in series a sufficient number of diffusion-
cells, all the effects of an ordinary voltaic battery can be pro
duced, at least those compatible with the presence of a»large
resistance in circuit : electrolysis of metallic solutions (e. g.
copper sulphate) is readily brought about.
 Volume-alteration on Intermixture of Solutions of Zinc, Copper,
                       and Cadmium Sulphates.
    162. Although not directly connected with the subject of
electrical measurement of chemical affinity, it yet seemed of
some interest to examine how far the volume-alterations that
take place on mixing solutions of different strengths of zinc
(copper or cadmium) sulphate run parallel with the thermal
developments thereby caused. It might reasonably be anti
cipated that the much greater heat- evolution taking place on
dilution of cadmium sulphate as compared with zinc or copper
sulphate would be found to be concurrent with a greater
amount of volume-alteration. On examining the matter, how
ever, this is not found to be the case ; the volume-alterations
on dilution through a given range being but little different,
whichever of the three sulphates be employed, in every case
   • Since these experiments were made, the third volume of Julius
Thomsen's Thermochcmische Untcrmchungen has appeared; in this are
given the results of this author's previously unpublished experiments on
the heat of dilution of solutions of zinc and copper sulphates, and of zinc
chlorides. These figures do not materially diner from those cited above ;
and their use, instead of those employed in this paper, makes no note
worthy difference in the end conclusion that the heat of intermixture
usually represents a less E.M.F. than that actually set up in any given
case.

       Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive Force.            387
contraction* taking place, even when the solution is already
so far diluted as not to cause any measurable heat-evolution
on mixing with water.
    The observations were made with a large-bulbed dilatometer
holding about 94 cubic centim. The volumes corresponding
to the various graduations were determined by introducing a
known weight of distilled water, and determining the level of
the water in the stem—first, when the temperature was a little
below 180,5, the instrument being immersed in a large vessel
of water kept agitated ; and secondly, when the temperature
was a little above 18°"5. In this way the level at 180-5 was
obtained by interpolation. The weight of the contained water
(reduced to a vacuum) being known, the volume in cubic
centimetres occupied up to the level at 18°"5 was calculated
                            W
by the formula V = naQ..nc, ; where V is the volume in cubic
centimetres, W the weight in vacuo, and "998602 the weight
of 1 cubic centimetre in grammes at 180-5 (Kopp). By
making a series of such observations a capacity-table was
calculated for the instrument, expressing the volume in cubic
centimetres at 180,5 for each graduation. A known weight
of the solution to be diluted was then introduced, and the level
at 1 8°"5 obtained by making observations a little below and a
little above that temperature, so as ultimately to obtain the
volume occupied by a given weight (reduced to vacuum)
of solution. Repetitions of experiments gave values accord
ing together within a range of '00003 (3 milligrammes in 94
cubic centim.), and often within much less ; the chief source
of discrepancy being in the correction for reduction to a
vacuum which was altogether about 100 milligrammes, neces
sarily varying with the temperature and barometric pressure,
so that a small error in temperature or pressure estimation
 made several milligrammes difference in weight-correction.
 On the whole, the probable error of the average of some three
or four repetitions of an observation was less than + "00001
 (1 milligramme in 94 cubic centim.).
    A quantity of the solution to be diluted was then weighed
 up in a stoppered bottle and a weighed quantity of water
 added, the weighings being reduced to a vacuum : the whole
 was thoroughly intermixed, and the weight of a cubic centi
 metre of the diluted fluid determined as before in the dilato-
   * The rough values obtained in S 106 (Part V.) led to the conclusion
that on diluting zinc- or copper-sulphate solution with water an increment
 in volume takes place. This is now found to be incorrect, the experi
 mental errors of the rough observations being greater than the volume-
alterations to be measured.

   The curves marked respectively 1, 2, and 3 (fig. 7) represent
these values. It is evident that the contraction with cadmium
solutions is always less than that with zinc- or copper-sulphate
solutions, instead of greater, as might have been a priori anti
cipated from the greater heat of dilution. The difference, how
ever, is in no case very great ; whilst with zinc and copper
solutions the curves almost coincide.
    163. From these values the amounts of contraction on in
termixture of gramme-molecules of two solutions of any one
of the three salts differing in strength are readily calculable
by the formula
                          C^i + cj — 2c3,
parallel with the analogous equation for heats of intermixture
(§ 160) ; where 0 is the contraction on intermixture, and Cj,
c2, and c3 respectively the contractions on dilution to the same
ultimate limit of the solutions MS042aH20, MS042&HS0,
and MS04(a + 6)H20 ; and more generally still the contrac
tions are calculable that ensue when any two solutions of
any pair of the three salts are intermixed. Thus, when A
 gramme-molecules of MS04»?iH30 and B gramme-molecules
of M'S04 ttH20 are intermixed, the resulting mixture is
                   fM)«jn mA + nB-rr, n
 If, then, a be contraction per gramme-molecule on diluting
 the first solution to the strength of the mixture, and b be the
 (negative) contraction ensuing on (negatively) diluting the
 second solution to the same strength, the total contraction on
 intermixture is Ao+B6, and the contraction per gramme-
molecule of the two salts used jointly is    -f           A number

    Since but little difference exists between the contractions
on dilution through given ranges, whether zinc, copper, or
cadmium sulphate be employed, it results that the amounts of
 contraction on intermixture when two different solutions of
 the same salt are mixed will not differ greatly whichever of
the three salts be employed. It would hence seem that there
is a much closer connexion between the amount of contraction
taking place on intermixture, and the potential difference
thereby developed, than there is between either of these values
and the heat-evolution simultaneously taking place. For
varying solution-strengths, the first two values alter fairly
concurrently and to extents not widely different, whether zinc,
copper, or cadmium sulphate be used. But this is by no
means the case with the heat^values, the cadmium value
largely exceeding the corresponding zinc and copper values,
which latter two are substantially identical.

XLIII. On the Solution ofa Class ofEquations in Quaternions.
   By J. J. Sylvester, Savilian Professor of Geometry in the
    University of Oxford*.
THE general equation of the degree to in Quaternions or
        Binary Matrices is obviously a*, but in certain cases
some of these roots evaporate and go off to infinity. The
only equation considered by Sir William Hamilton in his
Lectures is the Quadratic Equation of a form which I call
unilateral, because the quaternion coefficients in it are sup
posed all to lie on the same side of the unknown quantity. I
propose here to show how Hamilton's equation, and indeed a
unilateral one of any order, may be solved by a general alge
braical method and the number of its roots determined.
   It will be convenient to begin by setting out certain general
equations relating to any two binary matrices m, n.
   Writing the determinant of x+ym + zn under the form
                 a? + 2bxy + 2cxz + dy1 + 2eyz +fz2
(b, c, d, e,f thus constituting what I call the parameters of the
corpus m, n), we have universally
m>-2bm + d = 0, n2-2cn+f=0, d(m-1n)s-2e(m-,n)+/=0.
Moreover if m, n receive the scalar increments fi, v; d, e,f
become respectively
           d—2/ib+fi2, e—fic—vb + fiv, f—2vc + vt.
   Let us begin with Hamilton's form, say
                         a?—2px + q=0,
and suppose
                         ^2-2Ba; + D = 0,
where B, D are scalars to be determined.
   Let b, c, d, e,fhe the five known parameters of the corpus
p, q. Then, since
                     (j>-B)-'(,-D)=2*,
we shall have
   4(d + 26B + BV-4(e + bD + cB + BD)x +f+ cD + DJ = 0.
Hence, writing B + 6 = m, D + c=v,
                   d-P=a, e-bc=@, f-cP=y,
we have
        ua + a=\, ww + /3 = 2X(w— b), v2 + y=4\(v—c).
                   * Communicated by the Author,

  On the Solution of a Class of Equations in Quaternions.   393
From the last two equations, eliminating v, there results
   (2\u-2&\-£)2-4\(2Xu-2&\-/9)u + (y-4c\)u2=0.
Hence substituting \— a for u2,
               (4A2 + 4oX-7)(X-«) -(26\+/3)2= 0.
We have thus six values of u, viz.
                            + v/\— a
(where X has three values), to which correspond six values of
v, viz.
and, finally,
            2x=(p — u + b)~l(q—v + c)
                = ((p + by-u>)-1(p + b-u)(g + c-v),
or
                _ P? + (c — v)p + (b—u)q + (b — u)(c—v)
              X~              ~2(&2-d-w2)               5
which equation gives six values for x, and shows that ten have
 evaporated.
    It is easy to account a priori for the solution depending
 only upon a cubic in us.
    For x2 — 2px + q = 0 is the same as y2 — 2py + q = 0, whore
y= —x—2p. But obviously, from the nature of the process
 for determining them, B and C are independent of the side of
 the unknown on which the first coefficient lies. Hence the
 actual B will be associated with B', B' being what B becomes
 when x becomes — x — 2p, which is obviously — B — 2b.
     Hence with any value of B + b which is u is associated a
 corresponding — B— b which is — u.
     I will now proceed to apply a similar or the same method
 to the trinomial cubic equation in quaternions (or binary
 quantity) x3 +px—q = 0, with a view to ascertain the number
  of its roots.
     Retaining the same notation as before, and still supposing
                          a;2-2B# + D=0,
  we obtain
                      ^ + (D-4B2).r + 2BD=0,
  and
                            _ :g + 2BD .

              + 4BJD2-2cBD+/=0.
Hence we may write
         (4B2 - D)s - 26(4B»- D) +d=\,
        2(4B2-D)BD-c(4B2-D)-26BD + e=XB,
           4B2D2-2cBD+/=\D;
from which equations B and D are to be determined. Elimi
nating \ between the first and second and between the first
and third of these equations, we obtain two equations, of which
the arguments are
           D3 ;      B2D», D2 ;      B4D, B2D, BD, D ; 1
for the one,
           BD2; B3D, BD, D; Be, B3, B2, B ;              1
for the other.
   Eliminating D by the Dialytic method between these two
equations, we shall have (using points to signify unexpressed
coefficients) the following three linear equations in D2, D, 1,
viz. :—
           • BD2 +(.B3 + &c.)D + (.B6 + &c.)=0,
           • B3D2 + (• B« + &c.)D + (. B7 + Ac.) = 0,
           . B5D2 + (• B7 + &c.)D + (• B9 + &c) = 0.
   Hence in the final equation B rises to the 15th power ;
and by combining any two of the above equations, D is given
linearly in terms of B ; and, finally, x is known from the
equation
                _ :(p + D-4B2-2&)(g + 2BD)
and has 15 values.
   A like process may be extended to a unilateral equation (of
the Jerrardian form) of any degree, say af° + qx + r—Q.
   Introducing the auxiliary equation with scalar coefficients
as before, viz.
                         *2-2B + D = 0,
x may be expressed as a function of q, r, B, D; and the term
containing the highest power of B in the equation for deter
mining B (of which D is a one-valued function), when a>=4,

                            . B7    B9 -Bu • B13*
and a similar determinant will fix the degree of B in the
resolving equation for any value of a>. Hence the number of
solutions of the unilateral equation in quaternions of the Jer-
rardian form of the degree a> is &>(2a> — 1) or 2a>2 — to, and the
evaporation will accordingly be to*— 2&>2 + «, or
                            (ca2— tu)(&>J + a> — 1).
    Moreover the same method with a slight addition will serve
to determine the roots of the general unilateral equation in
quaternions, the number of which will be a cubic function of
o>, as I propose to show and to give its precise value in some
future communication, either in this Journal, or at all events
in the memoir on Universal Algebra now in the course of
  ublication, under the form of lectures, in the 'American
   ournal of Mathematics't.
     I very much question whether the old method of Hamilton,
as taught by its most consummate masters, Tait in this
country, or the late Prof. Benjamin Pierce in America, would
be found sufficiently plastic to deal effectually with an analy
tical investigation in quaternions of this degree of complexity,
so as to lead to the formula for the number of solutions of the
 unilateral equation of the Jerrardian form above given.
     I invite my much esteemed and most capable former col
 league and former pupil, Dr. Story, of the Johns Hopkins,
and Prof. Stringham, of the University of California, who
carry on the traditions of the Harvard School, to put the
power of the old method as compared with the new to this
practical test.

 D may be determined by means of the following equations :—

    B2D2 - 2{h + 3/SD)BD + dx + 6^ + 9SD2 = D\.
 The order (by which I mean the number of solutions of this
 system of equations) is readily seen to be the same as that of
                         • D3+.B3D+.B4D =0
                         . BD2+-B3D + -B" =0;
 t. e. is the same as the degree in B of B3(B5)2. R, where R is
 the resultant of
               • D2+ • B2D+ • B4 and . D2+ . B2D + • B*.
  Hence the number of solutions is 3 + 10 + 8, i. e. is 21.
     Practically, therefore, we have now sufficient data to deter
  mine the number of solutions of a unilateral equation in
  quaternions of any order to; for it is morally certain that such
  number is a rational function of to ; and as it cannot but be
  of a lower order than to*, we have only to determine a cubic
  function of to whose values for a> = 0, 1, 2. 3 are 0, 1, 6, 21,
  which is easily found to be to3 — <ua + o>; so that the evapo
  ration is to*— g>3 + <o2— to, i. e. (a>2 + l)(a>2— to).
     Practically also wo can solve (subject to hardly needful
  verification) the number of roots of a unilateral equation of
  the special form
                     <P" + q« a? + q9_i x*~ 1 + . . . + qQ = 0.
  For when 0 = to, we know the number is co2; and when 0=1,
  the number is to3 + to2— to ; consequently if the second differ
  ences of the function of {to, 0) which expresses the number of
  roots are constant, the value of this function when 0=to— 1 is
  to3 — to1 + to, which we have found to be the actual number; and
  consequently, if the second differences are not constant, they

                 a Class of Equations in Quaternions.                    397
 must be sometimes positive and sometimes negative, which is
 in the highest degree improbable. Hence in all probability
it will be found that the required number of solutions in the
form supposed is (1 + 0)0)'*— 0m.
    I need hardly add that the nine quantities 2b, 2i1; 2/3 ;
2e, 2eu 2e ; d, S, a\, which occur in the discussion above given
of the general unilateral cubic, or, say, rather the ten quan
tities obtained by adding on to these unity, are the ten coeffi
cients of the determinant to the binary matrix (x+py + qz + ri),
which of course there is not the slightest difficulty in ex
pressing in terms of scalar and vector affections of p, q, r
and their combinations, if any one chooses to regard them as
given in quaternion form.
   Scholium.—In what precedes it is very requisite to notice
that only general cases are considered ; and that there are
multitudinous others which escape the direct application of
this method, and do not conform to the rule which assigns the
number of solutions. Thus, ex. gr., the equation x>+px=0,
besides the solutions x=0,x= —p, will have two others which
will require the method of the text to be modified in order to de
termine. Or take the most elementary case of all, the simple
equation px—q. If pis not vacuous (i.e. if its determinant when
regarded as a matrix, or its modulus when regarded as a quater
nion, is finite), there is the one solution x=p~lq. But if p is
vacuous, then, unless q is also vacuous, the equation is insoluble.
Iiq = 0, there will be two solutions; one of them x = 0, the other
x = conjugate of p in quaternion terminology; or x=                  e'—a*
when p =          ^ in the language of matrices. If, p still remain
ing vacuous, q is vacuous but not zero, a further condition
must be satisfied; viz. if p=c'. £ ana* 1 =y'. g> the condition is
                           aS + ad — by — cj2 = 0 ;
or if p = a + bi + ij + dk and q =a + pi + yj+8k, the condition is
                          ax + bp + cy + d8=0.
When this condition (besides that of q being vacuous) is
satisfied, the equation px=q is soluble, and p~lq becomes
finite but indeterminate, containing two arbitrary constants*.
     So in general if p, q be two simply vacuous matrices of any order,
the condition that the equation px=q may be soluble, or, in other words,
that p-'q (a combination of an ideal with a vacuous matrix) may be non-
ideal, may be shown to be that the determinant to the matrix \p+pq
(where X, /i are scalar quantities^ shall vanish identically—which ( p being
supposed already to be vacuous) involves just as many additional con
ditions as there are units in the order of the matrix.

XLIV. On a Practical Point in connexion with the Comparison
   of Resistances. By W. N. Shaw, M.A., Emmanuel Col
   lege, Camlmdge*.
                               [Plate XIII.]
THE most accurate method at present in use for the com
        parison of two resistances differing only by a small
fraction of an ohm, is that suggested by Prof. Carey Foster
(Journal Soc. Tel. Engineers, 1872). It is a method pecu
liarly suitable for the comparison of standards of resistance
and the determination of temperature-coefficients of coils.
It gives the difference of two resistances compared, free from
errors, which might arise in the ordinary sliding-wire Wheat-
stone-bridge arrangement, from uncertainties as to the con
tacts of the ends of the slide-wire, or from the resistance
of the connecting-pieces between the ends of the slide-wire
and the electrodes of the coils compared. In the process of
making a determination by this method, the two coils X and
Y have to be made to interchange their positions, with
reference to the other resistances of the bridge ; and it there
fore becomes important for the application of the method that
the observer should be able to interchange the connexions of
the two coils with rapidity and facility.
   This is very efficiently and conveniently provided for in the
modified form of the slide-wire bridge devised by Dr. Fleming,
and described in the third volume of the Proceedings of the
Physical Society (p. 174)f. With the ordinary form of bridge
the interchange is more difficult, for the coils to be compared
have generally to be kept in water, and the two pairs of
binding-screws of the bridge are a considerable distance apart,
and thus the shifting of the coils to change their connexions
is a somewhat inconvenient matter.
    At the meeting of the Physical Society on Feb. 23, Prof.
 S. P. Thompson made some suggestions as to the manner in
which the ordinary slide-wire bridge might be adapted so
that Carey Foster's method could be conveniently applied.
    We have, during the past three years, at the Cavendish
Laboratory frequently had occasion to make use of the ordi
nary bridge for comparing coils and determining temperature-
coefficients ; and have accordingly found it necessary to devise
come simple arrangement by which the easy and rapid inter
change of the resistances under comparison could be provided
for.

    I. A simple plan of securing the facility of interchange of
 contacts is to arrange four mercury-cups in a row, as 1, 2, 3, 4
in fig. 1, and connect them, as shown in the figure, with the
 binding-screws A B and C D of the bridge by stout copper rods.
 The mercury-cups should have thick copper bottoms, or, if the
 arrangement is to bo permanent, may be formed conveniently
 of short bars of copper surmounted by pieces of india-rubl)er
 tube, so that connecting-rods can then be permanently fixed
to the copper bars. The electrodes of the coils X and Y are
inserted at 1 and 3, and 2 and 4 respectively, or vice versa, and
 their connexions can accordingly be interchanged with veiy
little motion. The electrodes can be kept in contact with the
bottoms of the mercury-cups by elastic bands.
   This plan of adapting the bridge differs but little from
that described by Prof. Thompson, but is, perhaps, somewhat
simpler.
   II. The second method which we have been in the habit of
using requires a more elaborate apparatus, but has the advan
tage that the contacts of the electrodes of the coils themselves
are not altered during an experiment, the interchange being
effected by means of a key. The coils under examination
can, indeed, be soldered to projecting parts of the key if
necessary, and the requisite contacts are secured by springs
pressing down metal tongues into mercury-cups. The advan
tage of this arrangement is very considerable when experi
ments are being made by observers who are unfamiliar with
the eccentricities of contacts.
   The arrangement of the key is shown in plan in fig. 2, and
in section in fig. 3. Eight mercnry-cups 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
are formed by boring holes in an ebonite plate, about half an
inch thick, and screwing copper plates on the back (shown by
dotted lines in the figure). These copper plates, which are
carefully insulated from each other, connect the eight mercury-
cups in pairs, and are brought out in tongues A, B, C, D, to
which rods, forming connexions with the binding-screws of
the bridge, can be soldered, or temporary contacts can be
made by means of the mercury-cups formed by drilling the
ebonite, as shown in the figure.
   To another plate of ebonite, fixed opposite to these cups on the
same board, four pairs of thick tongues of copper—I, II, III,
IV, V, VI, VII, VIII—are attached, the ends of the tongues
forming springs about 6 inches long. At the end of each
spring a copper plunger is arranged to dip down to the bottom
of the corresponding mercury-cup, into which it is pressed by
a spring, S, as shown in fig. 3. The springs work against the

400                  Mr. H. Tomlinson's Note
crosspiece of wood M, M, and are insulated from the tongnea
by india-rubber.
   A quadruple crank, Q, is arranged to be rotated between
the supports of the crosspiece H, M by means of the handle H.
The crank is put under the tongues at the points where they
are pressed by the springs. By rotating this crank four
alternate plungers (I, III, V, VII) are lifted out of their
mercury-cups, the other four (II, IV, VI, VIII) being pressed
in by the springs; or, on turning the crank through 180°,
the four tongues (II, IV, VI, VIII) are lifted out and the
other four pressed into contact by their springs.
   The electrodes of the resistances to be compared are intro
duced into the mercury-cups a, /9 and 7, 8 respectively, or
they could be soldered to continuations of the tongues with
which these cups are connected.
   Thus rotating the crank determines one of the following
series of connexions:—
    1st position.   Contacts          II. 3 III. 5 V. 7VII.
                    Connexions Aee. B 0.          C 7.   D 8.
    2nd position. Contacts           2 11. 4 1V. 6 VI. 8 VIII.
                    Connexions AS. B 7.          C /8.   D a.
So that the coils X and Y are alternately connected with A B
and C D, and vice versa, by a half-rotation of the crank.
    It is necessary that any method of interchanging the coils
 should not alter the resistance of the connexions. It will be
seen that the arrangement described is quite symmetrical, and
therefore satisfactory in this respect, except for the piece of
 copper connecting I, II with 8 ; and tbe resistance of this, if
the copper be fairly thick, is too small to be appreciable.

 that, with the exception of platinum, the metals stand in nearly
 the same order in both, and that iron and nickel are very con

 the lists. The last-named metal is especially worthy of notice,
 because in it longitudinal traction, when not carried beyond a

 It might then be suspected that the results obtained by Hall
 are capable of receiving an explanation, in the fact that the
 electrical resistance of the strips of metal used by him would
 be altered by the mechanical strain consequent on their en
 deavour to move across the lines of magnetic force. Mr.
 Shelford Bidwell has, however, in his recent interesting com
 munications to the Koyal Society and the Physical Society,
pointed out that " Hall's phenomenon " cannot be thus ac
counted for. Nevertheless, as it seems not improbable that
there is some indirect connexion between the alteration of
electrical resistance produced by mechanical stress and the
" Hall effect," I have little doubt but that experiments on the
" rotational coefficient " of nickel, in which the temperature
is varied up to 100° C, or in which the strips are subjected
   * A + sign attached to a metal signifies that the effect is in a direction
the same as that which the conductor itself bearing the current would
follow if free to move across the lines of magnetic force under the action
of the ordinary " ponderomotive " force.

402               Note on Hall's Phenomenon.
to mechanical traction of varied amount, would assist in deci
ding the question as to whether purely mechanical stresses
are to be regarded as producing the phenomenon. For it has
been shown* that with this metal the maximum diminution of
resistance following from longitudinal traction is at 100° C.
less than one half of that at 15°; and, furtherf, that whilst
traction not exceeding a certain limit produces diminution of
resistance, increase of stress beyond this limit is followed by
increase of resistance. Hall has remarked, in the ' Philoso
phical Magazine ' for September 1881, that the transverse
current obtained with a nickel strip is much increased, other
conditions remaining unchanged, by rise of temperature. But
his experiments in this direction are, I think, hardly conclu
sive; and, indeed, an examination of the numbers given in the
column in which the values of the " rotational coefficient" are
recorded shows, in the first ten out of the eighteen experiments,
evidence that rise of temperature causes a decrease of the
transverse current. Should Hall's phenomenon prove to result
from mechanical strain, 1 incline to the belief that a rise of
temperature from 15° to 100° C. will produce decrease in the
transverse current.
   The experiments of Mr. Bidwell tend very largely to prove
that the " Hall effect " can be explained by the joint action of
mechanical strain and certain " Peltier effects." Should this
be so, we ought, I think, to be able, by means of two thermo
elements connected with each other and with a delicate gal
vanometer, one element being in a cooled region and the other
in a heated region, to put this theory to the test. Or, again,
we might cover the strip with some material of bad thermal
conductivity and watch for a gradual increase of transverse
current with time when the electromagnet is excited, and
gradual decrease when the electromagnetic stress is removed.
Indeed in the actual arrangement adopted by Hall and Bid-
well, it would seem that this gradual increase or decrease
should occur ; for though the strips themselves would rapidly
cool if unmounted and exposed to the air, the nonconducting
material of the mounting would take some little time both to
gain and lose the heat imparted to it by the strip.

 Common Semibles. Die Gemein-Ideen des Oesichts- und Tastsinns
    nach Locke und Berkeley und Experimenten an operirten Blind-
    geborenen. Von Dr. Theodoe Loewt. Leipzig : 1884.
 'PHIS work by Dr. Loewy is partly philosophical, partly physiolo-
       gical in its interest ; treating partly of the theoretical opinions
 of Locke and Berkeley, partly of the experimental evidence for, or
 rather against, an innate relation between the senses of sight and
 touch.
    The question, Are there any ideas common to these two senses,
 or is the coordination of the ideas obtained by them solely a matter
 of experience? was raised by Locke before any experiments had even
 been thought of as practicable ; and the first part of our author's
 work is occupied in the discussion of the views of philosophers upon
 this, at that time, theoretical question.
    Locke taught that certain ideas were peculiar to one sense, as
 light and colour to the sense of sight, so that it was absurd to try
 to give a blind man any notion of light and colour ; but that the
 ideas connected with space, as extension, figure, magnitude, were
 common to the two senses, which are only two different ways of
 getting at these ideas. It is strange that Locke passes so shortly
 over the idea of motion, which introduces the conception of time,
 and dwells so much on the ideas dependent on the conception of
 space ; for if there be a common sensible, or idea common to the
 different senses, it is surely that of interruption, or of rhythm, an
idea dependent purely on time.
    The most interesting part of the philosophical discussion is that
which turns on Locke's answer to the famous question of his friend
 Molyneux. Molyneux asks, " Suppose a man born blind, and now
adult, and taught by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a
 sphere of the same metal, and nighly of the same bigness, so as to
tell, when he felt the one, and the other, which is the cube, which
the sphere. Suppose, then, the cube and sphere placed on a table,
and the blind man be made to see : qucere, whether by his sight,
before he touched them, he could now distinguish and tell which is
the globe, which the cube ? " Prom the point of view of Locke the
answer would seem certain. The ideas involved are those of extension
and form, ideas common to the two senses ; therefore the blind man
made to see would recognize and distinguish the two bodies because
these ideas would not be new to him, he would only have acquired
a new way of getting at them. But this is not Molyneux's answer :
he says, " Not. For though he has obtained the experience of how a
globe affects his touch, yet he has not yet obtained the experience
that what affects his touch so or so must affect his sight so or so,
or that a protuberant angle in the cube, that pressed his hand un
equally, shall appear to his eye as it does in the cube."
   As Dr. Loewy says, we see at once that Molyneux's solution of
his problem is not in harmony with Locke's principles. According

  404                 Notices respecting New Boohs.
  to Molyneux, the visual idea of roundness (or protuberance) is
  quite different from the tactual idea of roundness (or protuberance),
  and no one could, without experiment, ever connect these two
 essentially different ideas with one another.
     The strange part of this discussion is, however, Locke's own
  answer to the problem of Molyneux. He says he agrees with his
 friend, but he expresses his opinion in somewhat different words :
 he says " that the blind man, at first sight, would not be able, with
 certainty, to say which was the globe, which the cube, whilst he
 only saw them ; though he could unerringly name them by his
 touch, and certainly distinguish them by the difference of their
 figure felt."
     The difference between Locke's solution and that of Molyneux
 lies in Locke's reservations "at first sight" and "with certainty."
     It is not easy to determine the precise meaning of these reserva
 tions ; they may be merely surplusage. They do not necessarily
 imply that the blind man made to see could at the second glance,
 or by any number of glances, distinguish with certainty the cube
 from the globe. But they may mean this. Dr. Loewy discusses at
 considerable length and with great acuteness the meaning of these
 reservations, and comes to the conclusion that while they somewhat
 conceal, they do not remove the essential contradiction between the
 notion of common sensibles and Molyneux's solution of his problem.
    There is, however, a possible meaning of these reservations not
 alluded to by Dr. Loewy. Locke may have meant that the variety
 of new sensations suddenly presented to the previously blind man
 would prevent his at first sight concentrating his attention on those
 sensations which corresponded to the common sensibles of figure
 and extension in the two bodies presented to his view, but that
when he became accustomed to them he would be able with cer
tainty to distinguish them. Just as we might say that, if two of
 our friends blackened their faces, we would not be able at the first
glance with certainty to distinguish them, but by attentive study
of their features we could by and by make out, notwithstanding
the confusing blackness, the familiar forms. But while our author
does not expressly mention this possible meaning of Locke's reser
vation, he clearly shows that if Locke meant that by any number
of glances or any amount of looking the previously blind man could
come to know with certainty the cube from the sphere without touch
ing them, then Locke did not agree with Molyneux. Locke there
fore either did not really agree with his friend, or his opinion in this
matter was inconsistent with his own principle of common sensibles.
    Dr. Loewy concludes this part of his essay by a short discussion
of how far Locke's views were modified in works published by him
later ; and gives indications which show that, while he still held to
the doctrine of common sensibles, he avoided its application to
ideas connected with extension and figure.
    The question, however, remains, Was Molyneux right ? Are the
observations of sight so essentially different from those of touch
that there can be no ideas common to them both ?

                    Notices respecting New Books.                    405
   This leads our author to the discussion of Berkeley's views on
this matter ; and he places before us, in a very clear and well-
ordered manner, the arguments which led Berkeley to the opinion
that the ideas derived from sight have nothing in common with
those derived from touch, except that they arise in connexion with
one another in an absolutely invariable way ; and that the supposed
likeness between the ideas themselves is the result of our lifelong
constant experience which has coordinated these essentially hete
rogeneous things.
   But while a priori reasoning such as Berkeley's is interesting, it
is a somewhat unsafe guide in matters of Physiology ; for we have
no means but experiment by which we can find out whether perhaps
these essentially heterogeneous sensations may not be coordinated
by unsuspected nervous connexions quite independently of any
experience on the part of the individual. And indeed the pheno
mena of inuate reflex action, and observations made on the move
ments of the young of many of the lower animals, lead to the
opinion that, in some animals at least, the observations of the dif
ferent senses are coordinated to some extent independently of the
experience of the individual animal. We might therefore naturally
enough suppose that this is a question of degree ; and that man,
who takes so long to learn to use his senses, has less of this innate co
ordination than a bird, which can walk and pick up grains almost
as soon as it escapes from the shell.
    It is therefore with satisfaction that we turn to the third part of
Dr. Loewy's work, the experiments on blind persons who have been
 made to see.
    The first of these is Cheselden's famous case. Our author
gives details of all the cases of similar experiments ; and it is
surprising to note how little the recent cases, observed with all the
modern appliances of science, have added to the information given
by Cheselden. The concurrent testimony of all the carefully ob
served cases confirms the view of Molyneux and Berkeley—the
 blind men made to see did not distinguish the cube from the sphere.
The only fact which the new cases have added to our knowledge is
that this inability to recognize forms is certainly not due to imper
fection in the transparency of the humours of the eye ; as in some
 of them careful ophthalmoscopic observations were made, with the
 result that the optical condition of the eye was found perfect and
 sharp images were formed on the retina.
    But because visible form or size has no necessary relation to
tactual form or size, it does not follow that there is nothing com
 mon to the two senses. Indeed there is an idea which seems to be
 common to all the senses—that is, the idea of duration and succes
 sion. Perhaps it is because this seems at first as if it were altogether
 independent of sensation that it has been overlooked. We are apt
to think that it coexists with the various senses, rather than is
 derived from each or any of them. But leaving out of view this
 metaphysical question, there can scarcely be a doubt that a blind
 man made to see would at once recognize a rhythm with which he

  406                Notices respecting Neto Books.
  was tactually familiar (or which he had heard) when he saw it per
 formed by an intermittent gas-flame. If this be so, and it seems
 impossible to believe that it is not, then, whatever be the source of
 the community, the idea of rhythm, that is of succession and dura
 tion, is common to the various senses.

 an aeolian formation, with the intercalated deposits of lagoons and
 morasses, and indications of old streams and their deposits, and of
 the results of their action on the beds through which they flowed. The
 nature and characters of a»olian formations, and of the sandy desert-
 tracts in differert parts of the world, are carefully considered, and
 brought to bear on the origin and history of the Hawkesbury Sand
 stone ; and the causes of its irregular layers, its ferruginous beds,
 its gravel, and its conglomerates, receive explanation in turn. The
 existence of a wide arid region in Australia in Mesozoic timt-s,
 while to the N. and N.W. there was a Cretaceous sea, and that
 volcanic outbursts succeeded and altered the drainage and probably
the climate, are suggestions advanced by the author, and supported
by him in the interesting discussion, of considerable length, which

    NEW METHOD OF DETERMINING THE MAGNETIC INCLINATION
           WITH THE INDUCTION-COMPASS. BY M. WILD.
 IN the number of the Comptes Bend-us for November 26, 1883*,
      M. Maseart published an article " On a Magnetic Induction-
 Compass," in which he mentions the method which I pointed out for
 the use of this instrument ; but his description might lead to the
 belief that my method is only a somewhat useless complication of
 the old one of M. Weber. I may be permitted here to describe my
 method, in order to show that it has a real advantage over that of
 Weber.
   The method adopted by M. Weber for determining the magnetic
 inclination by means of currents induced in a coil by the horizontal
 and vertical components of the earth's magnetism is an easy and
 exact experiment, and does not require a complicated calculation.
 It is simpler than the modification which M. Maseart and I have
 pointed out, for it does not require a divided circle, while the orien
 tation and the levelling of the axis of the coil are almost the same
 for the three methods. It requires, moreover, less time than the
 determination of the inclination with an ordinary dip-circle, and
 yet gives more constant results. That its use is not more widely
 extended is due to the fact that the apparatus requires more time
 for its installation, as well as a special locality.
    In several observatories where the induction-compass has been
 introduced, considerable differences have been found (as much as
 15') between the inclinations deduced from experiment and those
 obtained with ordinary compasses ; and preference has generally
 been given to the former as implying fewer sources of errors. By
 more thorough researches at the observatory of Pawlowsk, with
 two induction-compasses of different construction, and a very good
 Dover's circle, I showed that this supposition was wrong, and that
 the greater part of the error arose from the induction-compasses.
 One of the two compasses which I used gave a difference of 15'
 and the other only one of 5', in comparison with same compass of
 the ordinary kind. In the memoir (Memoires de VAcademie impe
 rial* des Sciences de Saint Petersboury, vol. xxvi. No. 8, Nov. 1878)
 in which I described these experiments, I showed that the error
 aroee from the fact that the deflections of the galvanometers
 usually employed in these experiments were not exactly proportional
to the strength of the current, even when these deviations only
 amounted to from 2° to 3°-5. Hence, in order to avoid these errors,
it was necessary either to determine the functions according to
which the sensitiveness of the galvanometer varies with the deflec
tion, and to develop the theory of the oscillation of a magnet under
such conditions, or to find a method of working with the induction-
compass which should be independent of this want of constancy of
the sensitiveness of the galvanometer.

   M. Chwolson, of St. Petersburg, and somewhat later M. Schering,
of Gottingen, attempted to modify the theory of the deadening of
a magnet oscillating in a galvanometer, assuming that its sensitive
ness varied with the angle. M. Chwolson, moreover, in his memoirs
on this subject (Memoires de VAcademie imperiale des Sciences de St.
Petersbourg, vol. xxvi. No. 4, 1879, and vol. xxvii. No. 3, 1880),
gave a determination of the functions of the two galvanometers
which I had employed in my researches, and then deduced from his
theory the corrections to be applied to my results. He thus found
that the difference between the indications of the induction-com
pass and the ordinary needle-compass were reduced, for one of the
instruments from 15' to 0-6, and for the other from 5' to 0-6.
   I, on my part, have attempted to get over this difficulty by ex
perimenting in such a manner as to make the deflections almost
equal in the two operations. This is effected by fixing the axis of
rotation of the coil in two positions, which make the same angle on
the two sides of the direction of the total force of magnetization.
The deviation of the deflections of the magnet of the galvanometer
are then changed ; but they are almost equal in the two cases, and
the difference in sensitiveness with the angular deviations is then
eliminated from the result. It is true that, in order to carry out
this method, a divided circle must be added to Weber's apparatus,
so that the angle of the axis of rotation with the vertical can be
read off. If bl and 63 are the angles in the two operations, and <pl
and ^a the constant deflections of the galvanometer, obtained by the
method of multiplication, the magnetic inclination i is given by the
simple formula
                      tan t= &coe6i-?.cog\
                             ^sinftj— ^sinft,'
    Experiments which I made at the observatory of Pawlowsk
(Bulletin de VAcademie des Sciences de St. Petersbourg, vol. xxvii.
May 1881) by this method, taking the inclination of the axis of
rotation only about 1° from the magnetic dip, gave as the mean o£
fifteen observations, during the months of June and July 1880, the
equation
      Induction-compass — dip circle (Dover) = —0' 51" + 11",
where +11" represents the mean error of a comparison.
   In 1881 I still further improved this method by using a galvano
meter whose function of sensibility did not much vary ; taking in
one case the vertical for the axis of rotation (the angle with the
direction of the total force is then 90 — i'), and in the other case a
position which made with the vertical the angle b = 180° — 2i', in
which i' is approximately the inclination of the place. This modi
fication makes the observations far simpler, and the formula then
becomes
^t being the constant deflection of the magnet for the vertical

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.          409
position of the axis. The angle i' is found by measuring b on the
divided circle. Twelve observations, by this method, made at the
end of the year 1881 and at the beginning of 1882 by three dis
tinct observers, gave the result
      Induction-compass — dip-needle (Dover) = — 0' 50" + 9".
The result is thus almost the same, and it will be found that the
accuracy of the method leaves nothing to be desired.
   Moreover a complete determination requires less time than with
a dip-needle. The researches will still be prosecuted with modified
apparatus, and particularly with smaller ones.— Comptes Rendus,

ON THE HEATING OF IRON BY DISCONTINUOUS MAGNETIZATION.
                           BY J. BOKGMANN.
   It follows from the experiments of Joule, Van Breda, Grove,
Edlund, Petruschewsky, Jamin and Eoger, Villari, Cazin, Herwig,
and Trowbridge, that heating takes place in iron when it is exposed
to continuously interrupted magnetization. These experiments
nevertheless leave it open to doubt whether the heating in question
is a direct result of the magnetization, or whether it is simply the
result of the development of induction-currents in the mass of the
iron when the magnetization is interrupted. To solve this ques
tion, the author made a series of simultaneous experiments with
iron and copper tubes of equal dimensions and under the same
conditions. Two glass tubes, 500 centim. in length and 4-5 centim.
in the clear, formed the reservoirs of air-thermometers ; in one
glass tube was placed copper tubes slit lengthwise, and in the other
iron tubes also slit. The increase of temperature of the air in
these glass tubes was determined by the sinking of the naphtha in
the two limbs of a manometer in comparison with the level of the
naphtha in a third limb ; the latter was connected with a reservoir
of great capacity, which was immersed in a large vessel of water in
order to eliminate the influence of the pressure of the air. These
glass tubes were surrounded by others of the same length but
larger diameter. The space between the tubes was filled with run
ning water of the temperature of the room. The reservoirs thus
constructed were placed inside magnetizing spirals made of stout
copper wire (2 milhm. diameter and 540 turns) coiled on thick paper
tubes. The magnetizing spirals were surrounded by induction-
spirals of fine wire. These spirals could be alternately connected
by means of a commutator with a Weber's electrodynamometer.
The two magnetizing spirals and the two induction-spirals were
exactly alike. Both spirals were inserted in the common circuit
of a battery of 4 to 10 Poggendorff's elements. The breaking,
and change of direction of the magnetizing current, were effected
by special commutators which were constructed like those in the
Gramme machine, and were moved by a clockwork by Eichens. By
means of this commutator the current could be opened 5, 10, 20
times in a second, or its direction could be altered as often. From

 observations on the deflections in the electrodynaniometer, under
 the influence of one or the other induction-spiral, it is possible to
 deduce the relative magnitudes of the magnetic moments of the
 iron tubes during the continuously interrupted magnetization, and
 in this way to compare the heat produced with the magnetism
 developed iu the tubes.
    The result of numerous experiments was that there was no heat
 ing of the copper tubes, as must have been the case if the heating
 observed in the iron had been due to an excitation of induction-
 currents in iron. With iron which had been exposed to repeated
 magnetizations, the heat developed changes proportionally with the
 number of breaks in the second, and increases almost proportionally
 (though slower) than the increase of the temporary magnetism. In
 tubes of the same thickness of sides and the same dimensions, but
 not slit lengthwise, the heat developed is 1*5 times as great as in
 tubes which are slit lengthwise.
    Tubes of hard metal likewise become heated, according to a law
 analogous to the laws of the development of heat in iron. Tubes
 of antimony which were subject to a discontinuous magnetization
 showed also traces of a rise of temperature.
    At the end of the article the author favours the hypothesis of
 vortical motion in order to explain the phenomena of magnetization.
 In his opinion the phenomena observed in discontinuous magneti
 zation are a result of the vortical motion of the ajther, and of the
 material of the body in question.—Beibliitter der PhysUc, vol. vii.

     MINOR ACOUSTICAL EXPERIMENTS. BY PROF. F. FUCHS.
   I. Tn order to observe the resonance notes of the mouth which
 determine the vowel sounds, by Helmholtz's methods, a whole
series of tuning-forks is necessary, which are not in general at the
 disposal of teachers and private persons. Hence it may not be out
 of place to communicate the following method for this purpose,
 which may be made with any musical instrument of sufficient
 range. A small india-rubber tube is provided at one end with a
 terminal of glass or horn for inserting in the ear, while the other
end is placed in the mouth. The other ear is closed by a wetted
piece of tissue-paper, if it is not preferred to observe the resonance
tone in both ears by a branch-tube. The mouth is then given the
configuration corresponding to the vowel A, and the various keys
of a piano in good tune are struck, beginning with the highest
notes of the scale.
   The cavity of the mouth acts then as a resonator put against the
ear. If in coming from the higher to the lower notes we strike a
string which accords with tbe special note of the mouth, or is suffi
ciently near it, this, strengthened by resonance, stands out against
the rest of the mass of sound. Proceeding, then, further in the
Bcale, the strengthening proceeds successively for the higher partials
of the strings in the order of their rank. The observation is faci

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             411
litated if, while the string is sounding, the position of the mouth is
altered, as if it were wished to say Papa, or the tube is inserted in
the mouth when adjusted for A, after the string had been struck.
    The production of resonance by the first partial tone occurs with
the piano when the mouth is adjusted for A, in the interval b" to
g", strongly by g'% and a", feebly with g" and b" ; in the octave it
is most perceptible at a, its second, and at d! its third partial tone.
In the ordinary octave, and in that below the line, the maxima and
minima of resonance are more difficult to distinguish. .For the
lower strings have, without exception, one or more partial tones,
which are sufficiently near the special note of the cavity of the
mouth to be able to appreciably excite resonance. Hence by
strengthening those partial notes they all assume the clang of the
vowel A.
    On a second piano I found the maximum of resonance, in accord
ance with the investigations of Von Helmholtz, at b"; and on a
third indifferently at a" and b".
    For those who wish to repeat the experiments the clangs of the
 strings are collated, whose first, second, or the partial tone will
excite the maximum resonance, when the special note of the cavity
of the mouth agrees with the first note of the series :—
     123456                          78        9 10 11           12
     6- v d'n b gj d$ (-> b o# n (-) D$
    If the special note of the cavity is at a certain interval higher or
lower, for instance half a note, the whole pitches of the series are
 to be raised or lowered by the same interval.
    II. Experiments of this kind may also be easily made with the
 monochord, when the numbers of vibrations of the partial notes may
 be directly determined with the aid of a tuning-fork.
    For instance, under a lightly stretched thin steel wire a bridge
 is pushed from one end until the piece of wire between it and the
 end I, when twitched in the middle, excites the resonance of the
 cavity of the mouth most powerfully, which, with a successive pro
 longation of the piece of the string struck, occurs with the first
 partial tone. The limb of a sounding tuning-fork of known num
 ber of vibration, s, is then moved over the string from the bridge to
 the point where, when touched by the rod of the tuning-fork, it
 puts the portion of the wire la between it and the bridge in co-
 vibration. From the data ?„ Za, s, the number of vibrations x of the
 note of the mouth is obtained,
 Thus in an experiment in which a tuning-fork of 444-5 vibrations
 was used,
                           Z, = 18-5, J2=38-5.
 Hence
                    *=^x 444-5=925 (nearly b").

   III. For an amateur the following experiment will appear rather
strange, in which the quality of a strange voice will seem changed
by the resonance of the cavity of the mouth. One end of the
india-rubber tube is again placed in the ear and the other in the
mouth ; the mouth is put in the various positions for a, o, d,
while another person sings or draws out a definite sound such as a.
 With a suitable height of the voice speaking, according to the
position of the mouth, the vowels a, o, a are successively heard.—

     PSYCHROMETRIOAL INVESTIGATIONS. BY J. M. PERNTER.
   Pernter has made psychrometrical observations on the Obir
(6722 feet above the sea-level) with Wild's ventilation-hygrometer,
Begnault's dew-point hygrometer, and Schwackhofer's volumetric
hygrometer. These observations and the theoretical considerations
connected therewith lead to the following results :—
    1. The development of the psychrometer formula under the
assumption of convection does not lead to the goal, for the assump
tion that the inflowing air is cooled by the wet-thermometer bulb
from t to t' does not hold.
   2. The investigation of the psychrometer formula by Maxwell
and Stefan for perfectly still air is quite correct for this condition.
It loses in exactitude if modified for air in motion ; but it gives
the following very close approximation, if we represent by the ex
pression v/(t— t' + l) the "inertia" of the psychrometer when near
saturation (that is, the fact that with moist air the evaporation is
not rapid enough in comparison with the inflowing air) :—
or making v=0°-5 C. and inserting the numerical values,
      a-a-p • 0'00063 { 1 + 1 } { ('-*>>+ r5ri } •
   3. The member which depends on the radiation does not disap
pear, therefore, even with air in violent motion ; with still air it is
as great as that depending on conduction.
   4. The constant a does not change for equal velocity of the air
and for equal pressure. With lower pressure it is smaller, and
probably in the ratio P/760. For 760 millim. we get for a the
value 0^3-0, and therefore for any given pressure P : a=3P/760.
   5. The general result is that an exact formula for the psychro
meter can scarcely be obtained, and that therefore we cannot expect
by means of the psychrometer to determine the pressure of vapour
to within O'l millim.—Beiblatter der Physik, vol. viii. p. 31.

XLVIII. On the Propagation ofan Arbitrary Electro-magnetic
   Disturbance, on Spherical Waves ofLight, and the Dynamical
   Theory of Diffraction. By Professor Rowland *.
                         Introduction.
IN the year 1849 the great paper of Stokes " On the
      Dynamical Theory of Diffraction " was read before the
Cambridge Philosophical Society, and this has remained until
the present day the standard upon this important subject.
   The method of Stokes was based upon the old elastic-solid
theory of light, and gave the following conclusions :—
   First. That when the incident light was plane-polarized,
the diffracted light from a small orifice was also plane-polarized
in such a manner that the displacement was in the same plane
as that of the medium at the orifice. So that if a sphere was
drawn with the orifice as a centre, and meridians drawn on
the sphere, with the axis in the direction of the vibration at
the orifice, then these meridians represented the direction of
displacement in the diffracted light.
   Second. The intensity of the polarized light was repre
sented as follows :—Let 8 represent the angle between the
incident ray prolonged and the diffracted ray, and let <f) be
the angle between the diffracted ray and the direction of the
displacement at the orifice. Then the intensity of the dif-

414       Prof. Rowland on Spherical Waves of Light
fracted light around a very small orifice will be proportional
t0                       (l + cosSysin^.
The presence of the term in tf> indicates that the intensity of
the diffracted light at a given point varies as one rotates the
plane of polarization. In ordinary light the intensity varies
83                            1+008*8.
    Stokes and others have attempted to determine the relation
between the plane of polarization and the direction of dis
placement by means of the first relation ; but they have not
agreed with one another, and this want of agreement has
usually been assigned to the fact that the gratings used have
been ruled on glass rather than in free space, as the equations
 indicate.
    On examining this question from the point of view of
 the electro-magnetic theory of light, I have been led to
entirely different results. But as the elastic-solid theory for
an incompressible solid must agree with the electro-magnetic
theory, I have been led to examine the theory of Stokes, and
believe that I have now discovered an error, which, if it were
corrected, would lead to my result.
    The results which I reach are as follows :—
    First. The plane of polarization of the diffracted light is
 determined as follows :—Draw a sphere around the orifice,
and mark the point on the sphere where the incident light
 enters it. Through this point draw circles on the sphere whose
 planes are parallel to the electrostatic displacement at the
 orifice, and these circles give the direction of the electrostatic
 disturbance in the diffracted beam. Repeat the same for the
 magnetic disturbance, which is at right angles to the electrical
 disturbance, and the circles indicate the direction of the mag
 netic disturbance in the diffracted beam. These two systems
 of circles are orthogonal to one another, as they should be.
    Second. The intensity of the diffracted light around a very
 small orifice is symmetrical around the incident ray prolonged,
 and is proportional to
                            (1 + cosS)2,
 and the same expression applies to ordinary light.
    Although the theory of diffraction forms the most inter
 esting part of my paper, yet I have thought it worth while
 to treat of the general problem of spherical waves of light,
 which I have not seen considered anywhere else. The method
is similar to that used in sound and in the theory of heat-
 conduction.

                          Spherical Waves.
   Let F0, G0, H0 ; Fu Gu &c, be a system of vectors derived
from one another by the equations
                      tj,       dRm    dGm
                                 dy     dz

                          M+1 —
                          m+1    dz
                              ~ —r~     dx'
                                dGm    dFm
                     Hm+i =
                                 dx     dy
Then, as is well known, all this system of vectors necessarily
satisfy the equation of continuity,
                     dFm dGm + dRm _q
                      dx        dy     dz     '
except the primitive ones F0, G0, H0, and even these can be
made to satisfy the equation by the addition of terms of the
form djJ dJ dJ
       dx' dy' dz'
   The equations of light-waves, either on the electro-magnetic
theory or the elastic-solid theory, are of the form
                 —W -Vs!   V \an A5H-—          —
                                           \ + dz>

                               +dG +dR
                       ~ dx        dy   dz1
                           dx1 + dy* + dz1
    In the electro-magnetic theory v is always zero. In the
 elastic-solid theory the terms in v give the wave of normal
 disturbance like that of sound, and can nearly always be
 omitted, as the transverse and normal waves are immediately
 separated when v is different from V, as it always must be.
 As we wish to use the derived functions only, the terms in J
 can also be omitted, as Maxwell has shown ; and hence we
 can write, on either theory,

V indicates the velocity of a plane wave in the medium.
   Each one of these equations is the same as that of sound,
and can be solved in a similar manner. If we have solutions
of these equations F0> G0, H0, which do not satisfy the equation
of continuity, then we can get other solutions Fm, Gm, Hm from
these which shall satisfy this condition. Denote s/ — 1 by i,
and let V-(n+i) be a solid harmonic. Then, as V_(n+i) is a
homogeneous function of x, y, and z of the degree — +
we have
    -^Pa + f^ + -^— (•+!)<U+25BC>-*«»

Make                 Fo=CBp-V_(,+1)e(a-<t^-v'>,
where C is a function of p of a complex form,
                            C„=A.-tB„,
This form has the advantage that, by the addition of another
term of the same form in which t has a negative value, the
sum will reduce to a real form with circular arcs instead of
powers of e ; a is introduced for generality. Substituting
this form, we have for the determination of 0 * the equation
              _+2(q-^)—                     p-C=0.
  #Making                   C=lVt.-P(.-»)l

  If we replace p by a new variable equal to t(o — A)p, this reduces to the
equation of Bessel's functions. Hence we can write
                    D„=J(n+j)(6-)-fa)p,
                 F0={J(n+j)(64-l'a)p}p»+iV_(„+i,f-V<(a-<4))
witb similar terms for G0 and H0.
  Hence              Cn = C0'ple-P(a-*)Jin+i)(b+ia)p,
where C0' is a function of n to be determined, and one must add a corre
sponding term with — » in place of +»'.

      Writing c=a—ib we readily find, as others have found

   The series ends after n + 1 terms ; and so we can put it in
   the form
   a=(-l)-(l.3.5...(2n-l))^{l-v + T2-2^^

     The following properties of the functions C» are useful.
   Writing c=a—ib, we have

0^-0.(1-^) + 1^-.
          \      cp /     c dp
     Putting cp=cp\/l + 2s, we have
                        Jn+l      ^n+l„2n+a
  Extending the notation so that we should write CB(p) in the
  place of (J„ as above, we have, if we put pcs = q,
       C0^=e^{co + fCo + ^2C1(?) + r-|-3C3(?) + &c.},
     These expansions are useful in many calculations from the
  equations, and I believe they are given here for the first time,
  together with the differential expression from which they are
  derived.
     Hence we have obtained a complete solution of one of the
  equations. Now the general value of V-(B+d is
                V        -( 11"         d"       1
                 v -(»+!>-(. i) dfll,dh1,...dhnp'
  By varying the axes A,, h2, h3, &c, the value and form of
  V_(„+i) will change, and can thus have many values while C

418      Prof. Rowland on Spherical Waves of Light
remains unaltered.    Select three of these forms, and we can
thus write
            H0= C^V!MA«».^ Y^-vo,
where Y„, Y|i, Y« are surface harmonics.
   These do not satisfy the equation of continuity, but the
series of derived vectors Fm, Gra, Hm satisfy both the equation
of continuity and the equations of light.
   One of the best forms for these spherical harmonics is to
assume one of the axes in each of them parallel to one of the
coordinate axes. We can then write
In this case the vector represented by the components Fj,
G0, H0 is perpendicular to the surface V _»= constant.
   Now the components of this vector do not satisfy the equa
tion of continuity, and so, although it may represent the
vector potential on the electro-magnetic theory, it cannot
represent either the electric current or magnetic force, and is
almost without direct use on the elastic-solid theory. Hence
the derived vectors are of more general use. These are
          ^{^h                                                -

where
        Jo= -ncGn.^Y-n^P-^,
        F0= -c2Fu &c.
   The remaining derived vectors are simply repetitions of
these with only change in the constants.
   These derived vectors can represent the vector potential,
the electric displacement, the electric current, the magnetic
displacement, or the magnetic force in the electro-magnetic
theory, and the displacement, the velocity of the particles, or
the rotational displacement or velocity of rotation, on the
elastic-solid theory.

 And the other terms are readily obtained from these as
 follows:—
                        -[(a2-&2)B„-2a6AB] sint(/»-V<)},
   N,= 2sin0Q^(°-^)%.(p-v<) | [(a»_j?) AB-2a6BB]co860)-V0
                          -[(a,-62)B„+2aJAll] sin^-VO}.
     As these quantities constantly return again to the same form
 with only a change in the constants, there will be only two
 cases, when the vector potential, or its analogy in the elastic-
 solid theory, is made equal to the even or odd vectors. Let
 us take the first case, making the components of the vector
 potential equal to ©0 and P0. The magnetic induction will
 then be Nu and the components of the electric current
                          02 and P> -
                         47T/K.       4tT(1
 Hence, in this case, the magnetic induction is in circles around
 the axis, and the electric currents in planes passing through
 the axis. At a great distance from the origin the electric
 currents are on the sphere, but the normal component must
 still exist in order that the equation of continuity may be
 satisfied. The case of plane waves is the only one where the
 normal component entirely vanishes.
    When we make the vector potential equal to Nx the electric

           and the Dynamical Theory ofDiffraction.        423
currents are in circles, and magnetic induction in planes
passing through the axis.
   Let us consider the first case. We shall find it much more
convenient to continue with the imaginary form, remembering
that a similar term with i changed in sign is always to be
added except where it has already been done. We shall then
have:—

   Let now a sphere of radius R be circumscribed about the
origin, and an arbitrary uniform displacement take place in
the interior of this sphere of a value equal to
             6           °°27r6R2           \    6RJ
Taking this value for the displacement inside the sphere and
the previous values for the outside, the equation of continuity
is satisfied for the electric displacement and for the magnetic
induction. If the sphere is very small indeed, we have
                          T,_tTKC0
                              ~ Stt^R3'
Whence we have, on substituting the value of C0 from this
equation in the others and replacing $ttR3 by dv, the magnetic
induction
                 w,_             sing Ci tt(p

of finding the disturbance at any point due to any arbitrary
electrostatic disturbance throughout the medium. And it is
to be noted that these equations are rigidly exact for all dis
tances from the disturbance, and only have to be integrated
to give the effect of any disturbance.
   Had the disturbance been magnetic, we should have had for
the magnetic induction,

                         ~ K* \       bR)
Whence, as before,
And so we have in this case for the magnetic induction,

 and for the electric displacement,
                        32^p        C06
 These equations give the complete solution of the disturbance
 throughout the medium due to an arbitrary magnetic dis
 turbance at any point.
   Although the disturbance is harmonic, yet we know by
 Fourier's theorem that any disturbance can be represented by
 a series of harmonic terms with the proper coefficients ; and,
 indeed, we can replace the harmonic term by any function of
 p — Yt or p + Vt. Should the disturbance not be parallel to
 the axis of X, we merely have to divide up the disturbance
 into its components and compute the effect of each, and then
 add the components of the computed disturbance. In this

426            Prof. Rowland on the Propagation of
way we readily find the effect of a general electric or magnetic
disturbance.
   Let the components of the arbitrary electric displacement be

      Z'eiivt,                                   Z"e»v<;
where, in general, we must replace X', Y', Z', and X", Y", Z",
by a quantity of the complex form, and add another quantity
with — i in place of +t. Patting D + iE for X', and adding
the other term, we should have the real form
   (D + t'E)el4V< + (D-tE)e-i4V'= 2 {D cos iV<-E sin bVt\ ,
which expresses the disturbance in any phase. But this is
only necessary when we descend to actual calculation. The
effect of this general disturbance is then found to be :—
   The electric displacement,
    F'=g^p3{x/(2C„+Cjy-3S'C^
    &= g^-, { Y'(2C0+ ay-as'Ctf

where I have written
                      S' = X'« +Y'y + Z'z,
                      S"=X"x + Y"y + Z"z.
   For a general expression the term e~a{p~vt^ must be replaced
by any function of p — V< or p + Yt, as before.
   Before integration, one must of course substitute (a: — a/),
(y—y1), and \z— z') for the x, y, and z of the formula. It
is evident that the components of the electric displacement
can be replaced by the true convection-displacement of elec
tricity as carried along by the actual motion of the medium,
and the disturbance due to a moving magnet can be calculated
in a similar manner.
   To obtain an idea of the relative magnitude of the quantities
which enter into these expressions, I may remark that the value
                           277-
of b in wave-lengths is — . Hence, for any ordinary calcu-
lations with respect to light, the distance need be only a few
inches, or, indeed, one inch, to cause the values of Cj, C8, &c.
to become constant and equal to C0. But if we are treating
of longer waves, we must retain such terms.
   I have already given the proper expansion into series of
the quantities here involved ; but it will be better to put them
in a reduced form,
               c=—ib;      p=p*/l + 2s;      cps=q.
         n / \      n f -i    nn + 1  «(nJ— 1) n + 2

                                 n(n'-l)(n'-2)n + 3       . \

428           Prof. Rowland on the Propagation of
            B,=*>+y» + *»       and    r,=*/*+i/*+zn.
Hence one can write
                           _    xz'+yy' + zz'    r2
              p-K;       s                    + 2R?;
                       xa/ + 111/ + zz! ,  r2
When R is great and r is small, the last term will vanish and
leave a very convenient form for many cases.
   But it is not necessary to always perform the calculation at
a finite distance ; for we have the following theorem, which I
believe to be new.
   Theorem. Supposing the sources of light to be continuous,
and knowing the light over a sphere at an infinite distance, it
can be determined for all space by the following process :—
   Let F, G, and H be the components of any of the vectors,
such as the electric displacement &c, and suppose them known
over the infinite sphere. Express them in terms of series of
harmonics, thus
          F= ^— {E0Y0'+E1Y1' + EsY3' + &c.},
          G= Cne*f~Y°{E0Y0" +              + E2Y/' + &c. },
                   P
          H= ^— {E0Y0"/ + E1Y1'" + E2Y2W+ &c.}
   At any other point of space the equations must satisfy the
equations of light motion and also the equation of continuity.
Referring to the equations of p. 418, we see that if we multiply
each term by the corresponding quantity C„, the equations of
light will be satisfied, and if the surface harmonics are of
the form
             y-"=K--^r- -*%-}>
the equation of continuity is also saiisfied. Hence the com
 ponents of the vector at any point of space are

           an Arbitrary Electro-magnetic Disturbance.          429
         F= —        \ C0E0Y0' + CxEjY/ + C2E2Y2' + &c \,
                P
         G= ^— {C0E0Y0" + dEiY/' + C2E2Y2" + &c. \,
        H=            C0E0Y0"' + C1E1Yl"' + CiEiY3"' + &c.}.
 The best point for the origin will be somewhere near the
 centre of gravity of the illuminated body.
    That the light is perfectly determined in this way for all
 points outside a sphere around the origin which does not cut
 the illuminated body is evident from the fact that we might
 reverse the motions so as to make the light return along its
 previous path.
    These expansions and this theorem entirely change the
 ideas of those who have only been in the habit of regarding
 light from the point of view of rays of light. For we hero
 see that light coming from any source may be replaced by
 light from another source; so that the true source might be
 entirely invisible, and we " see " only the false source. This,
 however, could only happen for a point outside a sphere
 drawn around the false point and the real point, and we could
 always detect the deception by making a complete spherical
journey around the real point and inside the false point.
    As an illustration, let us compute the effect of a circular
 electric current which is caused to vibrate back and forth
 according to a simple harmonic function, so as to make tbe
 displacement C0e~cV<. In this case we must make
          0=X'=X"= Y" = Z" ; Y'dv = - C0r sin ada ;
                          Z/ = C0r cos ada,
where r is the radius of the circle.
    From the symmetry around the axis of x we have F'=0,
and can write for the component of the electric displacement
around x at a distance R sin 6 from that axis,
 w         r6V<v'f2* f 2C„+C2 .             3RrC2sin0 . >          ,
                   p2=R2-2Rr sin 6 sin a + r1.
   Integrating the first term by parts, taking sin ada for one
part, we have, since the first part disappears,
        1 —        = e" sin ada= I      .1 —5     e" ) cos ada.

               Dynamical Theory of Diffraction.
     When a ray of light strikes upon a screen in which there
  is an opening, a disturbance takes place in that opening, whose
  effect can bo calculated by the preceding formulae. Maxwell
  has shown that in a plane wave the energy is half magnetic
  and half electrostatic, and that the magnetic and electric dis
  placements are at right angles to each other and in the same

             and the Dynamical Theory ofDiffraction.             433
      Stokes's solution is based upon the displacement and rate
   of displacement of his elastic medium. But in an elastic wave
  there is not only displacement, but rotation also; and the com
  ponents of this rotation must satisfy the equation of continuity.
  But when a wave is broken up at an orifice, the rotation is
  left discontinuous by Stokes's solution, and hence it cannot
  be exact. The equation of propagation of the rotation is the
  same as that of the displacement, and the two are at right
  angles to each other, and they are both equally important.
      Hence, on the elastic-solid theory as well as the electro
  magnetic theory, the true solution of diffraction will depend upon
  the sums of two similar terms.
     When we take account of both the terms, the fundamental
  properties by which Stokes attempted to obtain the direc
  tion of the motion of these particles vanishes, and that
  problem is impossible of solution by this means.
     In the general equations of p. 426 let all the disturbances
 vanish except X' and Yv, so that the electric disturbance
  is in the direction of X and the magnetic in that of Y.
     In order that the energy coming from the two disturb
  ances may be equal, we must have

 For showing the peculiarities of the case, polar coordinates
are best. Let 6 be the angle made by p with the axis
of z, and <j> the angle around it from the plane XY. Let
0',            <&", and P', P" be the components of the electric
displacement and magnetic induction to increase these angles
and in the direction of p respectively. Then we have for
the electric displacement,

 In these v is the thickness of the disturbed stratum, so that
 vds=dv. The electric displacement within the stratum is
 XV4V<.
    When bp is very large, the disturbance is in the spherical
 surface; and indeed it only requires a fraction of an inch from
 the origin to be able to omit the terms in bp, and also F
 and P". The equations then become very simple, as follows.

    From either of these expressions or the more exact ones
 we see that the distribution of the magnetic induction is
 exactly the same, but turned around the axis of Z 90°, as the
 electric displacement. As this result would also apply to the
 elastic-solid theory, we conclude that diffraction gives no meant
 of determining the relation between the displacement and plane

           and the Dynamical Theory of Diffraction.          435
ofpolarization. Had we only taken the original disturbance
as electrical alone, we should have arrived at Stokes's result.
   Squaring the coefficients of the time-function and adding,
we find
Hence the light is symmetrical around the axis of Z, and
varies from 4 in the positive direction to 1 in the plane X Y,
and 0 in the negative direction.
   It now remains to connect the arbitrary displacement X'v
with the intensity of the original wave.
   Let the arbitrary displacement X've'4V', with the corre
sponding magnetic quantity, exist throughout the plane X Y.
From considerations of symmetry, the electric displacement
throughout space must be parallel to the axis X; and so we
can write
    F'= fKr£a {(2C0 + C2)p2-3Cs^ + 3ClF}e-^-v'^,
                z = constant,

The general and exact integral is
For positive values of z this gives, between the limits p = ao
and p = z,

But for z negative it is zero. Hence such an arbitrary dis
turbance produces a wave in the positive direction, but none
in the negative direction.
   No approximation has been made in obtaining this quantity,
and it evidently applies to a plane of any size, even infinitesi
mal, provided the point under consideration is infinitely near
to it. The displacement near the surface therefore differs in
phase      from the arbitrary disturbance, but is dependent
upon its value at that particular point.
   Hence we can replace any particular wave-surface by a sur
face of arbitrary disturbance whose phase differs \-rr from that
of the wave. Such a surface of arbitrary disturbance then

436       Prof. Rowland on Splierical Waves of Light
produces the same effect at all points of space as the original
wave. Should the wave be spherical and of short radius, the
normal component will enter and complicate the result, though
the solution can be obtained, but would evidently be compli
cated. But if the wave have a radius of an inch or even less,
the displacement is practically perpendicular to the radius,
and the solution here given will apply.
   Let I, m, n be the direction-cosines of the normal to such a
wave, and I', m', and n' the direction-cosines of the electric
displacement which is represented by
                             Jg-^R-V^
Then the values of the arbitrary displacement and magnetic
induction to substitute in the general equations of p. 426 to
produce such a wave will evidently be

   Eeturning again to the equations of p. 433, we see that the
polarized light is diffracted equally in all directions from a
very small orifice and independent of its plane of polarization.
Furthermore, the plane of polarization at any point is found
by drawing a sphere through that point with its centre at the
orifice, and then drawing a plane through the given point and
the point where the incident light first cuts the sphere, and
cutting the plane of polarization of the incident light in a line
perpendicular to the incident ray. The intersection of the
plane and sphere then give the direction of the polarization.
   It is seen that in both these particulars my solution difters
from that of Prof. Stokes, and the construction is the same
whether one takes the electric or magnetic quantities as the
direction of polarization.
   The system of planes for the electric and magnetic quan
tities form a system of orthogonal circles on the sphere.

            and the Dynamical Theory ofDiffraction.            437
   The following constructions can also be used for obtain
ing the direction of the electric and magnetic quantities.
Draw a sphere around the orifice and draw an axis through
the sphere in the direction of the incident light. Then rule a
sheet of paper with a series of lines at right angles to each
other. Out a star-shaped piece out of the paper with its dia
meter equal to the circumference of the sphere, and having a
very large number of points. Place the centre of the star
on the sphere at the end of the axis where the light leaves
the sphere, and wrap the points around the sphere, the points
meeting around the incident ray. The marks on the paper .
then give the required directions.
    We can also construct the curves of polarization by noting
that the stereographic projection of the lines on a plane is
merely a series of straight lines.
    The equations become very simple at many wave-lengths'
distance from the orifice, especially when the orifice is small.
 If the radius of the original wave is large, it is usually suffi
cient to consider the periodic factor as the only variable. In
 this case we can write
              4/sB ~ itp 8in ft1 + cos ^JJe~<4(f"v<)^
               Py=0,
where I is the coefficient of the original vibration, and there
fore its square is the intensity of the original light. The
intensity of the refracted light is simply proportional to the
 sum of the squares of 0' and O'. This is the expression
 ordinarily used except the term in 0. Thus for a circular
 orifice we have the vibration expressed in Bessel's functions,

    It is impossible to pass from these expressions to the case of
 a plane wave, since they are only for the case of a great
 distance from a small orifice.

  XLIX. On a Determination of the Horizontal Component of
     the Earth's Magnetism at Oxford. By R. H. M. Bosan-
     quet *.
  THE present investigations arose from the discovery that
          tangent galvanometers gave different indications in
  different parts of my laboratory, so that it was clear that
  determinations of the horizontal magnetic force H were
  necessary. For the purpose of testing the system employed,
  as well as on account of the interest of the data involved, use
. has been made of a room away from the laboratory, which
  has been made free from iron for the purpose of magnetic
  experiments. The data here obtained may therefore be
  regarded as having their undisturbed geographical values.
     Making the observation that the determination of the
  values of small corrections from the observations themselves
  is a very uncertain process, I have endeavoured to determine
  the coefficients of the small quantities concerned in a direct
  manner, and thus to lessen the demands on the accuracy of
  the principal observations.
     I will first consider the process of comparing M (the
  moment of a magnet) with H by causing the magnet, placed
  at a distance r in the E.W. line, to deflect a needle.
     Using Maxwell's notation, if D be the mean of the tan
  gents of four deflections, and the experiments are made at
  two distances, then the application of the equation
                               2M_r3tanfl
  leads to the solution
                2M_D1r?-D,r5a
                 H- r\-r\ > As-D1rf-D3r|rirS-
     There is a misprint in Maxwell's A2, the denominator of
  which is written r\ —r\, thus equating A2, which is a square
  quantity, to an expression of the fifth order. This appears
  to have escaped the revisers of the second edition.
     I regard the question of certainty as follows :—The deter-
                 2M
  mination of -vy- depends on the quantity r3 tan 9, and on the
  factor containing A2. The determination of A3 from pairs of
  observations is of a very uncertain character. In fact, the
  numerator of the above expression for A2 consists of the

  lean Society, March 10, 1884.

Horizontal Component ofthe Earth's Magnetism at Oxford. 439
difference of two quantities which are nearly equal ; so that
the effect of experimental errors is very large. This is
illustrated by the following set of four double observations
(the constants are uncorrected, so that nothing depends on
the absolute values) :—
               Distances 100 centim. and 75 centim.
                                   M.           H.      A2.

                 (2) .... 12065              -18079    117
    It is extremely improbable that A3 varies thus. Physically
it is 2L2, where 2L is the distance between the poles of the
 magnet.
    As a guide to the certainty of single observations, the four
 observations of the above set at 100 were reduced with
                                            2M
 A2 = 0, t. e. by the approximate formula -^.- = r3 tan 6.
                                                  H.

                         (2)                   -17980
 The consistency of the single observations is therefore good.
    To determine A2 independently, we have to find 2L, the
 effective distance between the poles. Now the conception of
 poles is not perfectly true. I have therefore taken the mean
 between two measures.
     The first is the distance between the points where the lines
 of force are at right angles to the magnet. My magnets are
 nearly 20 centim. long, and this distance was 18-6 centim.
 The other measure is obtained by combining the expression
  for the moment ( = 2L/i) with
                        number of lines of force
                                   47T
 which would be true if the lines of force were radii of a
 sphere.
     (For a unit polo would have 47r lines of force, and pole /*
  would have 4ir/i lines of force.)
     The lines of force in the magnets were measured by com
  parison of their inductive effect on a coil of 4 turns with that
  of H on a large coil of 21 turns, turning through half a
  revolution so as to cut H twice. The method is in substance
  that of Rowland. Mean radius of coil =25-65 centim. The

440        Mr. E. H. M. Bosanquet on the Horizontal
effects were measured by the throw of a nearly astatic gal
vanometer, with mirror and scale. A rough preliminary
experiment, with approximate value of H, gave 151 centim.
for 2L from the above formula. A more careful series gave
15*5 centim.
    The mean of these measures, 18*6 and 15"5, is 17 nearly,
corresponding to A2 = 145, with which value all the observa
tions were finally reduced. The observations at different
distances were, on the whole, better satisfied by this than by
any other of the numerous values tried.
    This ratio,    of the length, lies between Joule's values,
which are from f to £ of the length.
    The deflection-observations were made with two instru
ments. One has a small brass circle, needle-point suspension,
and scale up to 80 centim. on either side. The other has a
wooden circle with paper scales divided to 10', silk suspen
sion, and mirror reading. The scales were divided on the
lathe, the degrees being £ inch, which could, after some
failures, be accurately done. The circle was turned by trial
till the paper scales exactly fitted round it. This is a much
more accurate instrument than the other ; but it is a great
object to use the smaller instrument. As it is only possible
to read to tenths of a degree with this, it is necessary to use
larger deflections. But when this is done allowance must be
made for their effect, as has been pointed out to me. As I
do not know of any discussion of this, I give it here.
   Let R be the force at distance r, then R = -^y.     Let 2A be
the distance of the poles of the deflected needle, ji their
strength, so that 2A/ct = m.
   Forces on poles of needle are

From these arise a resultant of translation and a couple.

   The resultant of translation may become important if large
deflections are used with a silk suspension. I use two
magnets applied on opposite sides (Joule), in which case the

         Component of the Earth's Magnetism at Oxford.     441
resultant of translation vanishes. But the bracket in the ex
pression for the couple forms a correction factor which must
be taken count of. The whole formula is then,
   The two magnets evidently act inductively on each other.
The field about each due to the other is —^j1— .   In speaking
of the earth's induction I shall show how I evaluate this.
 For my magnets the effect begins to be sensible at about
 60 centim.
    Some details about the magnets. I have used Joule's
 method for eliminating the earth's induction during vibration,
 by fixing two magnets on one stem at such distance that each
 neutralizes the earth's action on the other. The magnets
 must be equal. They are similarly shaped out of the same
 bar, and magnetized on the Gramme machine. This gives
 them at once a larger charge than they can permanently
 retain.
    If they are very unequal, one will be found to be not quite
 hard. It is only by making them quite hard that they can
 be got to take fairly equal charges. It is not much use
 trying to make the charges perfectly equal, as the moments
 continue to fall for a long time after magnetizing, and similar
 treatment is more likely to make them equal in the long run
 than attempts at subsequent magnetizing or demagnetizing.
    In the vibration experiments the two magnets, which have
 small holes through their centres, are suspended on a brass
 stem at the proper distance apart.
    The magnets weighed over 400 grammes each ; they were
  suspended by about 6 feet of bifilar wire. I distrust silk in
  vibration experiments. It never seems to give definite values.
  The torsion of the wire used was determined by means of two
  rectangles of lead, one having the weight of the double
  magnet, and one that of the single one. The torsion was
  421) C.G.S. units of couple for the larger, and 35'8 for the
  smaller weight. There is no doubt about this difference of
  torsions for different weights. It has been observed re
  peatedly.
     The moments of inertia of the magnets were determined by
  comparison with a rectangular brass bar 30 centim. long,
  having nearly the same weight as one of the magnets. The
  moment of inertia thus obtained differed considerably from
                            See Postscript.

442        Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on the Horizontal
that obtained by direct measure. The magnets were distorted
by hardening and cannot have been homogeneous, so that
the direct measure was untrustworthy. The brass bar was
put in the place of each of the magnets in turn, and the times
of vibration of each magnet observed with and without the
brass bar. This is the least satisfactory part of the whole
process. It is impossible to get rid of disturbance due to
temperature and changes of H, and these affect the calcula
tion considerably. The following experiments were used to
determine the moments of inertia.

These were taken at a temperature averaging about 60°.
   The vibrations of the magnets were observed by placing
a small plane mirror on the brass-wire stem by which the
magnets are supported. A circular scale of degrees is placed
in front of it, and an upright wire in front of the scale
adjusted to the position of rest. Then the arc can be read off
in degrees and adjusted to a suitable amount, and the obser
vations of the passage of the wire over a black silk cross on
 the mirror are convenient to make. The clock employed
 during these observations had a losing rate of about 8 seconds
per day. It was checked by comparison with a good clock
which has a losing rate of '66 seconds per day, as determined
 by comparison from the Kadciiffe Observatory.
   The readings generally included about an hour, so that the
five places in the period were pretty well determined. An
inconvenience of this long duration is, however, that changes
of temperature or changes of H sometimes set in which
rendered the different parts of the time nonconformable. In
these cases the period deduced from the first ten minutes or
half-hour would not correspond with the whole or with that
deduced from the last half-hour. Such observations had to
be rejected.
   The observations were made by the method indicated by
Maxwell : six observations of passages to the right and five
to the left were used to form each normal time ; one of these
sets was usually made at starting, and others after ten
minutes, after half an hour, and an hour. No doubt it is an

           Component of the Earth's Magnetism at Oxford.                    443
advantage of smaller magnets that this determination occupies
less time.
    The results of the whole work are exhibited in the following
Table. We may particularly notice the continual fall of the
moments*. The magnets were prepared about Feb. 8. In
view of this continual change it seems unlikely that measuring-
instruments, depending on permanent magnets, can be relied on.

444        Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on the Horizontal
    In considering the mean value of H we must remember
that this quantity itself is in a perpetual state of change. If
 we go to the Greenwich observations, we see that the mean
 value for the day varies generally from day to day with a
 certain regularity. The diurnal changes are considerable,
 and are superposed on the others ; and the whole mean value
is increasing regularly at the rate of about "00027 per year.
So that all we can say is that, at the beginning of March
 1884 a mean value of H was found at Oxford which was
about -18011.
   The only other information that I have been able to obtain
about the values of the magnetic constants at Oxford is
derived from the differences of Gauss's tables applied to the
known Greenwich values.
   In Gauss's 'Atlas des Erdmagnetismus ' there is a table of
the magnetic elements for points differing 10° in longitude
and 5° in latitude. Forming the differences appropriate to
Oxford, taking its position to be 1£° west and ^° north of
Greenwich, and finding the Greenwich quantities from the
data in Everett's book of Units, I get,
         Mean Greenwich value of H for")

   It appears therefore that the observed res ult is somewhat
nearer the Greenwich value than the indications of Gauss's
differences would lead us to suppose. We shall see that this
is also the case with the dip and vertical force.
   Although the effect of terrestrial induction on the magnets
during vibration is eliminated by the process I employ, it is
yet of interest to determine its amount ; if for no other reason,
because in the deflection-experiments the two magnets are
not so far removed from one another but that they are within
each other's influence. In this case the approximate field
about the needle east and west, due to one of the magnets, is
H tanj? And} gince the field produced varies inversely as r3,
    it
and the other magnet is at twice the distance of the needle,
the field about one of the magnets due to the other is
^ tan ®. As the induction due to H itself is small, this is
   lb

         Component of the Earth's Magnetism at Oxford.                445
not likely to be troublesome ; but still it is as well to have
some idea of its amount.
   In determining this I have used the direct method. I have
wound 100 turns of wire about the middle of the magnet, and
joined this up with the circuit of the ballistic galvanometer.
In the same circuit, and so arranged that the magnet can be
inserted, are the four coils used to determine the number of
lines of force of the magnet. The vertical component of the
earth's magnetism is used, as being larger and more con
venient than the horizontal. The magnet standing upright
is first turned upside down. This produces a deflection due
to 200 times the induction. The magnet is then reversed,
and half the difference of the readings is taken. The magnet
is then inserted in the four coils, which gives a deflection due
to four times the number of lines of force in the magnet. It
is then taken out again, and half the difference of the readings
taken.
   In my determination the deflections were as follows : —
            orvw a »•      4 x total lines       ratio     induction by H

    II. . . 117'-0            339'-0           -00283
   The observations were very difficult, especially with mag
net I. It seemed as if at a certain moment spontaneous
alterations began to take place in the magnet, which kept the
scale of the galvanometer flying about so that no observations
could be made. I thought this might be due to variations of
the terrestrial force, and laid the magnet at right angles to
the magnetic meridian ; but the changes went on as before
though their direction was altered. It appears therefore that
when such a magnet is exposed to such a force as that of
the earth's magnetism, the charge continues for some time
to work its way irregularly among the non-homogeneous
material of the magnet, and on withdrawal of the force its
effect subsides in the same way.
   The above expression for the effect of terrestrial induction
is most convenient for the purpose of such calculations as
those we are dealing with. But it is of more general interest
to express this effect by means of the quantity magnetic
resistance, which I have introduced to denote the quotient of
magnetic potential by lines of force per unit surface, or mag
netic induction. These quantities are, as deduced from the
above determinations,

    We may dissect this quantity roughly by observing that,
if the steel have a permeability of about 30, which is a value
such as is believed to occur, the resistance of the length of
each bar (20 centim. nearly) would be about §g or "66
centim. The resistance due to the shape is probabty about -2,
 though this is a matter I have not gone into with square bars ;
 but if this is so, the permeability might be more like 40,
 so that *5 centim. resistance would be due to the metal and
 •2 to the shape. Observe the practical importance of this.
 What a thing it would be to be able to tell beforehand, ever
 so roughly, what the coefficient of induction of a magnet will
 be. It is with a view to such practical objects that I have
 introduced the idea of magnetic resistance.
    The dip can be obtained by these inductive methods so as
to give the vertical component when the horizontal is known,
with sufficient accuracy lor practical purposes. The ratio
  vertical
,-—;
horizontalr of the components
                       r        is the tangent
                                          or   of the dip.
    I have a coil wound round a wooden circle. This is placed,
 first so as to cut the horizontal lines of force twice when
turned through half a revolution, secondly so as to cut the
vertical lines of force twice when turned through half a revo
lution. The ratio of the throws of the ballistic galvanometer
in the two cases is the ratio required.
    The deflections obtained in such a determination were 913'
and 374' respectively. The ratio of these is tan 67° 43'*4,
which may be taken to be the observed dip.
    The vertical force must be obtained from the horizontal by
multiplying by tan dip. As I have no determination of H
on the day on which the dip was observed, I must take the
mean value -18010, whence the vertical force is found to be
•43968.
    The comparison of these numbers with the Greenwich
values and those deduced from Gauss's table is as follows :—

value of H determined by his differences, and the dip also so

     Postscript.—To obtain satisfactory accordance between
observations of deflection at short distances, it is desirable to
take count of additional terms in the series proceeding by
powers of r~a. The complete formula then stands,

is quite satisfactory.

I COMMUNICATED to the Berlin Royal Academy of Sci
       ences last April t the results of an investigation of the
 pressures exhibited by insulating liquids in an electric field,
when they are electrified like the glass of a Leyden jar.
    The general result obtained was the production of a tension
 parallel to the lines of electric force, and of a nearly equal
 pressure at right angles to the lines of electric force, which
 were proportional to the square of the electric force at the
 Joint of the electric field in question, and proportional to the
  ielectric constant of the fluid experimented upon.
    I have now completed a similar investigation for magnetic
 and diamagnetic fluids, employing, to some extent, similar
 methods. If dielectric and magnetically polarized substances
 behave similarly, as is required by the theoretical views of
 Faraday }, Maxwell §, and Helmholtz ||, we must have with
 magnetic fluids under the influence of magnetic forces, just
 as with insulating fluids under the influence of electric forces,

448     Prof. G. Quincke on the Measurement of Magnetic
field in question, and R is a constant corresponding to the
so-called dielectric constant, and which on that account I
propose to call the diamagnetic constant.
   The diamagnetic constant of atmospheric air is 1, as is also
its dielectric constant. If a magnetic fluid is bounded by air,
the magnetic difference of pressure in the fluid and in the
air may be expressed by a hydrostatic pressure, and thus
      1 may be measured.
   In my experiments I employed either a RuhmkorfTs electro
magnet having plane circular pole-surfaces of 140 millim.
diameter, at a distance from each other of 1*7 to 50 millim.;
or the large electromagnet of the physical collection of the
Royal Academy, with plane round pole-surfaces of 24 millim.
diameter and 3"5 millim. apart. The first of these was excited
by a battery of one, three, or ten Bunsen's elements arranged
in series ; and the second by a battery of one, two, or three
such elements. The magnitude of the magnetic force Hj of the
magnetic field between the poles was nearly constant, and was
measured by means of the induced currents in a small flat
spiral of 30 millim. or of 8 millim. diameter, and of one or
five coils of thin copper wire which was drawn out of or
pushed into the magnetic field. At the same time a large
induction-spiral of eleven coils and 490 millim. diameter was
included in the circuit leading to the galvanometer at a dis
tance of 15 metres, in which, by revolution about a vertical axis,
the horizontal magnetic force of the earth produced induction-
currents.
   If we call the surfaces of the induction-spirals F and F1;

induction-spiral is revolved through 180°, being at right

magnetic force of the magnetic field is
   The horizontal component of the earth's magnetism was
measured by Dr. Walter Konig with a portable magnetic
theodolite of Meyerstein's, at the position of the large induc
tion-spiral, and was found equal to 0*1935 C.G.S. units.
   The magnetic force of the magnet-field varied between
300 and 3000 C.G.S. units in the case of the RuhmkorfTs
electromagnet, and between 6000 and 12000 C.G.S. units in
the case of the Berlin electromagnet. For the sake of com
parison, I may mention that in the well-known experiments

              Forces by means of Hydrostatic Pressure.                 449
 of Verdet *, with a similar electromagnet, on the electro
 magnetic rotation of the plane of polarization of light, the
 constant magnetic field did not exceed 3500 C.G.S. units.
 When the poles were brought nearer together, the magnetic
 force of the magnetic field increased only slightly.
    The residual magnetism—the magnetic force of the mag
 netic field between the poles after interruption of the electric
 current—was also measured and taken into account. This
 residual magnetism is nearly independent of the strength of
 current, and depends only on the distances between the pole-
 surfaces, being greater the nearer the poles stand to each
 other. The residual magnetism varied in the case of the
 RuhmkorfF magnet between 15 and 540 C.G.S. units; and in
 the case of the Berlin electromagnet between 400 and 500
 C.G.S. units.
    From the deflection of a declination-needle in the neigh
 bourhood of the electromagnet, we can determine only the
 magnetic moment of the whole electromagnet, not the
 magnetic force of different points of the space in the neigh
 bourhood of the pole-surfaces. With the Berlin electromagnet,
 the squares of the magnetic forces of the magnetic field
 between the pole-surfaces were nearly proportional to the
 power | of the magnetic moments of the whole electromagnet.
 The pole-surfaces of the RuhmkorfF electromagnet could
 be placed either vertical or horizontal, so that the lines of
magnetic force of the magnetic field between the pole-
 surfaces were either horizontal or vertical.
   A square trough of nickel-plated brass-plate, with vertical
sides of plate glass, and a round iron base of 150 millim. dia
 meter, was placed upon the lower horizontal pole-surface of
the RuhmkorfF electromagnet, the upper pole-plate brought
within a distance of 1*7 millim. or 3 3 millim., and the trough
 was then filled with different magnetic fluids (sulphates and
chlorides of manganese, iron, cobalt, and nickel in water). Con
tact of the pole-surfaces upon magnetization was prevented by
meansof three piecesof plate glassorof brassof equal thickness.
A central opening in the upper pole-surface was connected
by means of a thin brass tube with a sulphide-of-carbon
manometer, and a long india-rubber tube provided with a
tap, as in the experiments upon pressures produced by elec
tricity      A flat bubble of air was introduced by means of
the tap into the space between the horizontal pole-surfaces, so
as to be in contact with both; the tap was closed, and the

sulphide-of-carbon manometer observed with a cathetometer-
microscope *.
    When the electromagnet was excited, the difference in
level between the two limbs of the manometer increased by
an amount h ; the manometer showed an increase in pressure
of the air included in the flat air-bubble, which was nearly-
independent of the diameter of the bubble, proportional to the
square of the magnetic force Hx of the magnetic field, and of
different magnitude with different liquids.
    If we denote the specific gravity of the fluid in the mano
meter by <7, the difference of magnetic pressure on the unit
area within the fluid and the air-bubble will be
                           A^fclH,'                                (2)
    Instead of sulphide of carbon, we may also use the magnetic
fluid itself as manometer-fluid.
    The pole-surfaces of the Ruhmkorffs electromagnet, being^
the same distance apart as before, were placed vertically and
opposite to each other, and the narrow vertical limb of a
 U-shaped glass tube was brought into the magnetic field, of
which the other vertical limb, of 25 millim. diameter, was placed
 outside the magnetic field at a distance of 200 millim. The
 U-shaped tube was so far filled with the magnetic fluid that the
 meniscus in the narrow limb lay in the middle of the magnetic
 field, and could be observed with a cathetometer-microscope.
 When the electromagnet is excited, the magnetic fluid rises
 by such an amount that the increase of hydrostatic pressure is
 equal to the increase of pressure observed in the flat air-bubble
 by means of the sulphide-of-carbon manometer. The increase
 of pressure is again determined by equation 2 : if A denote
 the increase in the difference in height of the fluid in the
 limbs of the U-shaped tube, and a the specific gravity of the
 fluid, this increase in pressure takes place in a direction at
 right angles to the lines of magnetic force.
     We find the same increase in pressure on exciting the
 electromagnet, when we place the lines of magnetic force
 between the poles vertical, and introduce the one leg of the
 U-shaped tube through the central perforation of the pole,
  so that the meniscus of the magnetic fluid is in the magnetic
  field, and is displaced parallel to the lines of magnetic
 force. The increase of hydrostatic pressure under the
  influence of magnetic forces proved to be independent of
  the diameter and length of the U-shaped tube, so long as

            Forces by means of Hydrostatic Pressure.          451
the magnetic force was constant at all points of the fluid
meniscus.
   If a flat bubble of air in a magnetic fluid is placed below
the upper horizontal pole-surface, so that it does not touch
the lower pole-surface, and the bubble of air observed with a
horizontal cathetometer-microscope, the form of the air-
bubble does not change when the electromagnet is excited.
   The capillarity constant of the magnetic fluid at its junction
with air is therefore not perceptibly altered by the magnetic
forces. The increase of the pressure on the air-bubble within
the magnetic fluid, produced by the magnetic forces, is
the same parallel and at right angles to the lines of magnetic
force.
   A similar air-bubble in an insulating fluid between the
horizontal plates of a condenser, changes its form very con
siderably when the condenser is charged, becoming longer
when parallel to the lines of electric force, and narrower at
right angles to the lines of electric force. In order to observe
this difference between the stresses produced by electricity
and by magnetism also in the stronger magnetic field of the
Berlin electromagnet, the great weight of which (eight
hundredweight) permitted no alteration in the position of
the horizontal lines of magnetic force, a different method was
adopted. A thin solid flint-glass thread was bent at right
angles and placed with the vertical portion cut off at right
 angles between the vertical pole-faces of the electromagnet,
 and a drop of fluid was hung at the lower end of the thread.
 The hanging drop, illuminated from above, was observed from
 beneath by means of a right-angled prism and the catheto
 meter-microscope. When the electromagnet was excited by
 means of three Bunsen's elements, the horizontal diameter of
 the drop remained unaltered parallel and at right angles to
 the lines of magnetic force, with the magnetic fluids
             Manganese sulphate of sp. gr. T4688
             Manganese chloride              1'3695
              Ferric chloride                l-5083
              Cobalt sulphate                1-2584
 and with the diamagnetic fluid water.
    Further, a drop of iron amalgam, hanging on to an
 amalgamated copper-wire, retained the same diameter parallel
 and at right angles to the lines of magnetic force. If any
 difference exists, it cannot amount to so much as £ per cent.
    There is, however, a considerable change of form in the
 hanging drop if the magnetic field does not possess equal
 magnetic force at all points. The fact that insulating fluids

  152    Prof. Gt. Quincke on tlie Measurement of Magnetic
 in the electric field become doubly refractive, whereas no
 double refraction could be detected in magnetic fluids in- the
 magnetic field, is in harmony with the difference already
 mentioned between electric and magnetic forces.
                                II.
    It follows from these experiments that, under the influence
 of magnetic forces, the hydrostatic pressure at the bounding-
 line of air and magnetic or diamagnetic fluids, parallel and at
 right angles to the lines of magnetic force, suffers the same
 increase or decrease ; that the pressure resulting from the
magnetic forces is of equal magnitude parallel and at right
 angles to the lines of magnetic force.
    In a homogeneous fluid in a magnetic field of constant
 magnetic force the magnetic pressures must be in equilibrium.
There can only be a difference of pressures at the boundary
of two heterogeneous fluids.
    I have measured this difference of pressure for various
magnetic and diamagnetic fluids at the bounding-surface
with atmospheric air in U-shaped glass tubes, when the fluid
in the vertical narrow limb of the U-shaped tube was placed
between the vertical pole-surfaces of the Berlin electro
magnet in a magnetic field of the constant magnetic force Hi,
the other wide limb being outside of the magnetic field, or in
a magnetic field of magnetic force 0.                            •
    The U-shaped tube was adjusted until the fluid meniscus
was in the middle of the magnetic field. Upon interrupting
the exciting current, the level of a magnetic fluid sank, and
the level of a diamagnetic fluid rose, by an amount A, and
the pressure decreased or increased by an amount

ha expresses the pressure in grammes on a square centimetre;
if h is expressed in centimetres, Hj is also expressed in the
C.G.S. system ; f corresponds to the quantity —J-— of equa
tion (2).                                        8w
    The magnetic increase in height h in my measurements
attained the magnitude 32 millim. and more with magnetic
fluids; —0'7 millim. with diamagnetic fluids. In thecaseof the
smaller heights, the measurements were made with a catheto-
meter-microscope; for the greater heights, an ordinary catheto-
meter was employed.
    With an electromagnet belonging to the Carlsruhe Poly
technic, excited by an electro-dynamic machine and manga
nese-sulphate solution of spec. gr. 1-4165, between square

            Forces by means of Hydrostatic Pressure.         453
pole- surfaces of 30 millim. in the side and 6 millim. distance
apart, I have even observed a magnetic rise of 95 millim., which
•would correspond to a magnetic force of 20,000 C.G.S. units.
I am indebted to Herr F. Braun for the use of the apparatus.
   In Table 1. 1 have given the magnetic rise in the magnetic
field of the Berlin electromagnet, between the pole-surfaces of
24 millim. diameter and 35 millim. distance apart, when excited
by three, two, or one Bunsen's elements, giving respectively a
magnetic force of 12510, 10700, and 6383 C.G.S. units in the
magnetic field.
   Ihe temperature of the room was maintained as nearly
constant as possible, and varied between 18° and 20° C.
   The constant f is equal to the difference in the diamagnetic
constants of the fluid and atmospheric air divided by 87r.
The numbers in the column headed f . 1010 give the increase
in pressure in grammes per square centimetre of the bounding
surface between the fluid and atmospheric air in the interior
of the fluid, when the narrow limb of the U-shaped tube with
this bounding surface is placed in a magnetic field of in
tensity 100,000 C.G.S. units. The last column gives the
arithmetic means of the values found for f for the different
magnetic forces. These differ with the concentration of the
solution and the nature of the substance dissolved.
   We may also observe A, and from that, by means of
equation 3 and the values given in Table I. for the quantity
f, we may calculate the value of the magnetic force Hj of
the magnetic field. Variations in the magnetic force, due to
variations in the strength of current furnished by a dynamo-
electric machine to excite the electro-magnet, become visible
by momentary variations in the meniscus of the magnetic
fluid. This method of observation might therefore be useful
in determining the intensity of a magnetic field.
   If the greatest possible accuracy is not required, the
magnetic fluid might, for such measurements, be contained in
a long narrow horizontal glass trough, and this be placed
partly within and partly outside of the magnetic field. A
strip of black paper may then be plunged vertically in the
glass trough, so that the curve formed by the surface of the
fluid is marked on the paper, from which, making allowance
for capillarity, the intensity of the magnetic field may be
roughly determined.
   The same method may be employed with gases, by re
placing atmospheric air above a diamagnetic fluid by other
gases. I reserve the results of this investigation, with which
1 have been for some time engaged, for a later communi
cation.

     These magnetic pressures may also be employed for the
  calculation of the quantity which Herr G. Wiedemann * has
  called the atomic mannetism of the metals, in a series of salts
  of similar chemical composition.
     The increase of pressure Ap produced in a saline solution by
  magnetic forces consists of two portions, Apt and Apt. The
  first portion, Apu depends upon the water (or other solvent)
  contained in the unit volume of the fluid ; the second portion,
  Ap2, upon the anhydrous salt in the same unit volume.
     If we denote by
  G the percentage of anhydrous salt in the solution ;
 A the chemical equivalent of the salt ;
 Hj the magnetic force of the magnetic field ;
 <r the specific gravity ;
 h the magnetic increase in height of the fluid ;
 au the specific gravity of the water ;
 h„ the magnetic increase in height of water for the same
     magnetic force Hx ;

 and therefore
21 is the magnetic pressure in grammes per square centi
metre by which the pressure upon the anhydrous salt would
exceed the atmospheric pressure in a magnetic field of unit
intensity, if A grm. of anhydrous salt were diffused through
the unit volume, or so many grammes of the salt as is ex
pressed by the chemical equivalent of the salt.
    The quantity termed by Herr G. Wiedemann the atomic
magnetism must be proportional to the constant 21 of equa-
tion 7.

altogether free from iron; and a very small contamination
with iron would produce a disturbiDg effect, especially with
small values of 51, which would be greater the smaller the
concentration of the salt solution.
   51 is nearly the same for the different protosalts of Mn, Fe,

LI. Note on an Easy and Rapid Method of Determining the
   Specific Gravity of Solids. By James J. DoBBlE, M.A.,
   D.Sc, and John B. Hutcheson, Assistants to the Pro
  fessor of Chemistry, University of Glasgow *.
THE specific gravity of a substance is the weight of a
       volume of that substance compared with that of an
equal volume of some other substance selected as standard
and measured under the same conditions of temperature and
pressure. Water is the standard universally employed for
solids and liquids. Hence, in taking the specific gravity of a
solid, the data which have to be determined experimentally
are the weight of a volume of the solid and the weight of
an equal volume of water. The weight of water is usually
determined by making use of the well-known principle that
a solid when weighed in a liquid weighs less than in air by
the weight of the volume of liquid which it displaces. By
subtracting therefore the weight of the solid in water from
its weight in air, the weight of water displaced, i. e. the
weight of a volume of water equal to that of the solid, is
found. For accuracy this method leaves nothing to be
desired; but the operation of weighing a solid in water is one
which always involves                         frequently requires
some delicacy of manipulation. And in the case of solids
which are soluble in water, the weighing must be performed
in some other liquid, and, the gravity having been found
relatively to that liquid, must be reduced subsequently to the
standard of water. In the case, too, of a solid which is
lighter than water, the weighing must either be performed in
a liquid of less specific gravity, or else a heavy body must be
attached to sink it in water. Whichever method be em
ployed, additional weighings are required and subsequent
calculation is involved.
   The method which we now propose briefly to describe, and
which we have employed for some time in this laboratory, is
applicable in all cases, and gives results which agree as closely
with those obtained by the ordinary method as two different
determinations by the ordinary method usually agree with
one another.
   Instead of finding the weight of water in the usual manner,
we find the exact volume of water displaced by the solid.
   The accompanying figure shows the apparatus which we
employ, which may be termed a specific-gravity burette. It
consists of a U-tube, one limb of which (a) is of small diametei
                  * Communicated by the Authors.

 460     Messrs. Dobbie and Hutcheson on a Method of
 (about i3ff of an inch), the other (6) of large diameter. A
 piece of tubing c, of the same diameter as b, and furnished
 with a stopcock, is joined to b by means of a piece of rubber-
 tubing g, so that it can be quickly disconnected and joined
 again. A piece of cork or wood, d, with a groove cut in it,
 serves as a stand for the apparatus, which is further sup
 ported by the metal upright e.
   The small tube a is graduated from the point indicated on
the figure to cubic centimetres ( = grammes), or grains of
water. Several lines are engraved on the tube b, at the
same level as the beginning of the graduation on a. The
tube is filled with water up to one of these lines. The
substance whose specific gravity is required, having been
weighed, is placed in the tube b, when it of course displaces
its own volume of water.
   The tube c is then attached ; the stopcock is opened, and by
blowing through c the level of the water in b is depressed below

the beginning of the graduation. By means of the stopcock it
is allowed to rise slowly again, till it reaches the level at which
it stood before the solid was introduced. In this way the
total bulk of water displaced is measured in the tube a,
which being of small diameter admits of the volume being
measured with great accuracy. The tube may be graduated to
trains or grammes ; and the specific gravity is then found
  irectly by dividing the weight of the substance in air by the
number of grains or grammes indicated.
   The Messrs Gray, of the Physical Laboratory of this
University, suggested to us that by attaching to the tube b
a small tube in the form of a loop, so placed as to have its
limbs nearly at right angles to b, we should be able to bring
back the water in b to its original level with much greater
accuracy than by reading directly on the wide tube, even
with the aid of a float, since a small alteration in the level of
the water gives a large horizontal displacement in the loop-
tube.
   The following table will exhibit the degree of accuracy
which can be attained by the method we have described.
Obviously, to obtain good results with bodies of high specific
gravity, as large a piece of substance as possible should be
used.

   The advantages of the method are twofold :—
   (1) Its rapidity. Several determinations can be made by
it in the time required for a single determination by the
ordinary method.
   (2) It is applicable to all solids. In the case of bodies
lighter than water or soluble in water, the tube has only to
be filled with the liquid appropriate to the substance. In

every case, no matter what liquid is employed, the amount of
rise in the tube will give the volume, and therefore the
weight of water which the solid would displace. The rule
for finding the specific gravity is always the same :—Divide
the weight of substance in air by the number of grains or
grammes read off upon the burette.
   For entering into a detailed description of so simple a
contrivance, we make this apology. It is to be regretted,
both on scientific and practical grounds, that chemists so
seldom determine the physical constants of the numberless
new salts and other substances which pass through their
hands. The reason undoubtedly is that physical experi
mental methods are usually both troublesome and tedious.
We have endeavoured to simplify one of the simplest and
most beautiful of these methods, and shall be pleased if the
apparatus we have described should facilitate the systematic
description of the physical properties of new substances.

        L1I. On Eutexia.        By Frederick Guthrie*.
                                  VII.
 JNTRODUCTION.—Although this memoir does not treat
      directly of the relationship between water and salts, the
 subject is so analogous with that examined in my memoirs on
 " Salt-Solutions and Attached Water," that I have numbered
 the paragraphs in sequence with those of memoir VI. on that
 subject (Phil. Mag. vol. vi. p. 115).
    The main argument of the present communication hinges
 upon the existence of compound bodies, whose chief charac
 teristic is the lowness of their temperatures of fusion. This
 property of the bodies may be called Eutexia t, the bodies
 possessing it eutectic bodies or eutectics (eC tijk€iv). It is
 at once apparent that the cryohydrates are essentially eutectic.
 It will, however, perhaps be better to make the term more
 useful by limiting its application. I shall use it, and I should
 like it to be used by others, for bodies made up of two or more
 constituents, which constituents are in such proportion to one
 another as to give to the resultant compound body a minimum
 temperature of liquefaction—that is, a lower temperature of

 use in Chemistry, this employment of wrd is not strictly admissible.

liquefaction than that given by any other proportion. Here,
again, the cryohydrates completely satisfy the definition.
But it will be shown that they constitute only one term of
a series ; that their melting or liquefaction is quite continuous
with the so-called fusion of mixed metals or salts ; and that
the eutectic alloys of metals, many of which have been long
imperfectly known, and the eutectic alloys of salts, which I
shall describe (§§ 207-229), are the perfect homologues of the
cryohydrates. Let me, in a word, invite my readers, while
looking upon water as fused ice, to trace the analogy between
the behaviour towards solids of water on the one hand, and
some other fused substance on the other.
                      Eutectic Metallic Alloys.
    § 195. Metals mix with one another in various proportions
forming Alloys, many of which are in extensive use in the
arts. Amongst the most instructive aspects of alloys is cer
tainly that which results from a comparison of the properties
of the alloy with those of its constituents. And, further to
 specialize, the discussion of the relation between the tempera
 ture of fusion of the mixed metal and the temperatures of fusion
 of its elements forms a chapter of the highest significance.
    § 196. In studying this chapter, I employ Bismuth as one
 of the elements on account of its low melting-point, and
 because it can be got very pure. Fused bismuth will be the
 homologue of the water or fused ice of my previous memoirs,
 and the metal with which it forms alloys will be the homologue
 of the salt. The bismuth used in the following experiments
 melted at 263° C.
    § 197. Bismuth and Zinc.—It has been asserted that when
 bismuth and zinc are melted together two alloys are formed
 which do not mix, the upper being an alloy of 2*4 bismuth
 and 97*6 zinc, and the lower of from 8'6 to 14'3 bismuth and
 from 91*4 to 85-7 zinc (see § 206). Such a condition and
 such a ratio may accidentally exist ; but is only occasional.
 Let bismuth be fused and heated to about 350 , and let as
 much melted zinc be added in small quantities at a time as
 the bismuth will form a liquid alloy with at about that tem
 perature. Let now the temperature be watched until it has
 sunk to about 250°. The liquid is run off and a little bismuth
 is added to the contents of the crucible, which is heated until
 fusion ensues, and a second amount of liquid at 250° is again
 obtained. This and the quantity obtained by the first process
 are melted together and allowed to cool gradually. The
 temperature sinks almost immediately to 248°, and remains
 constant at that temperature. The alloy maintains the same
                                 212

metals. It showed on analysis :—

                Zn . . . .          7-15/ 248 *
Of course this eutectic alloy is now to be made by melting
the metals together in the above ratio ; but on account of the
oxidation of the zinc at about its melting-point, it is better
to provide a little excess of that metal and to remove the
excess by the above method.
   § 198. Bismuth and Tin.—In forming the eutectic alloy
of these, the bismuth need be only just fused. A roll of tin
foil is stirred into the bismuth, and in spite of the cooling
effect, the alloy which is formed remains liquid. When the
temperature reaches about 150°, the roll of tin is withdrawn,
and the temperature is watched as the alloy cools. The
temperature ceases to fall at 133°, which is the fusion tem
perature of this eutectic alloy. Having satisfied oneself of
this, the whole may be remelted, and about a quarter having
been allowed to solidify at 133°, the rest is poured off, and is
pure. This alio)- is very finely crystalline when quickly cooled ;
it is very brittle and its freshly broken surface closely re
sembles that of cast iron. It showed on analysis :—

manner as with tin, a fixed temperature of 1220-7 is reached.

to obtain an alloy whose melting-point is 144° C. It shows,

   These weight-ratios are none of them simple atomic weight-
ratios. Of course, in many cases, metals can be fused together
in simple multiples of their atomic weights, but in most such
cases, on cooling the alloy, one of the metals will separate out
first and so destroy the ratio. In other cases an alloy richer
than the original alloy in regard to one of the metals, and
therefore a homologue of a subcryohydrate, separates, and
the original ratio is again disturbed. When we are dealing
with metals which, like antimony or arsenic, on the one hand,
are themselves halogenous, or with such strongly chemico-
positive metals as sodium on the other, we may and do get alloys
of atomic composition—metallo-metallic salts. But the tem
peratures of fusion of these are never, as far as I am aware,
lower than that of either (both) of the constituents. They are
not eutectic. Nor is it easy to see any reason whatever why
they should be so. On the contrary, we should expect such
an alloy to be soluble in one or other of its elements, with de
pression of temperature. The statement therefore that alloys
of minimum melting-points are got on mixing the metals in
certain simple ratios of their atomic weights, is presumably
to be put on one side. As the cryohydrate forms itself when a
salt-solution of any strength loses heat, so the eutectic alloy
forms itself when an alloy whose constituents are in any ratio
is cooled. The only exception to this is when the constituents
are in the ratio homologous with that between the consti
tuents of the subcryohydrate. So-called " fusible alloys," or
"fusible metals/' are imperfect eutectic alloys. And it is
seen that the melting-points obtained by previous experi
menters with bismuth-tin and bismuth-lead are considerably
higher than those above shown (see also § 206).
   § 202. Further, if we take the eutectic alloy of bismuth-tin
and that of bismuth-lead, and treat them together as though
they were single metals, we get the eutectic alloy of the three
metals ; or either of these alloys with bismuth-cadmium gives
a corresponding tri-eutectic.
   These and certain other tri-eutectic alloys may form the
substance of a further communication. They stand in the
closest connexion with the cryohydrates of mixed salts, which
were discussed in §§ 109-116.

466               Frederick Guthrie on Eutexia.
   § 203. Again, a tetra-eutectic is obtained either by building
up from the tri-eutectic and a metal, or from three eutectics ;
or perhaps more readily, although with greater waste of metal
in the first tentative experiment, by fusing the four metals
together. The three eutectic bismuth alloys above described
were fused together in considerable quantity and in indefinite
ratio. As the mass had only partly solidified at 100°, it was
pressed in a linen bag under boiling water. The liquid por
tion was further cooled. A large amount remained liquid at
 71° C. ; at which temperature the thermometer thenceforth
stood until the whole was solid. On remelting several times,
and collecting that which remained liquid after about a fifth
had solidified, the eutectic alloy of bismuth-tin-lead-cadmium
was obtained pure. It showed the following composition:—
           Bismuth .... 47-45                          47-38
           Lead                      19-39             19-36
           Cadmium .... 13-31                          13-29
           Tin                       20-00             19-97
                                   100-15             100-00
   The question, very interesting to mineralogists, immediately
arises, Can a tetra-eutectic alloy be made without loss by
mixing three dieutectic alloys in some proportion with one
another ? The answer is in this case certainly in the negative.
For according to § 199, 19-36 of lead require 24-25 of bis
muth. Again, according to § 200, 13-29 of cadmium require
19-27 of bismuth, and according to § 198, 19-97 of tin require
17-08 of bismuth. So that to satisfy the three metals lead,
cadmium, and tin eutectically, 60*52 of bismuth would be re
quired, instead of 47-45.
    The above alloy is extremely closely grained and brittle.
 It may, however, be bruised and rolled. It takes a high polish.
 When in some thickness its fracture is conchoidal, exposing
 steel-grey surfaces. This highly eutectic alloy may find uses
 in the arts, as with the exception of alloys containing mercury,
 and those of potassium and sodium, it has a melting-point
 lower than any alloy before described.
    § 204. The above experiments, in which bismuth replaced,
 the ice of my previous experiments with salt-solutions and
 some other metal replaced the salt, are of course only a few
 of an innumerable series of series. But they will serve to
 show the genesis of bodies of this class. I have already*
 pointed out how the " de-leading " of the lead-silver alloy in
 Pattinson's process is really analogous to the separation of
                   * R. Inst. Lecture, Feb. 16, 1877.

                  Frederick Guthrie on Eutexia.               467
ice from a salt-solution. The residual liquid alloy should have
a composition analogous to that of a cryohydrate, and should
be the eutectic alloy of lead-silver. If this be so, its tempera
ture of fusion should be lower than that of lead itself ; and
that it is so is proved by the separation of solid lead from the
melted mass. It is well known that Pattinson's process may
be " pushed too far." According to the above interpretation,
this simply means that when the fusion-temperature of the
eutectic alloy is reached, this body solidifies as a whole and is
raked away as the lead had been. A pyrometer, an air ther
mometer, in the mass would be an absolutely trustworthy
guide as to the proper time for cupellation to replace " de-
leading."
   § 205. That certain metals may and do unite with one
another in the small multiples of their combining weights may
be conceded. To such bodies the eutectic alloys bear the
same relationship as the cryohydrates bear to the common
hydrates, and, like the latter bodies, their constituents are not
in the ratio of any simple multiples of their chemical equiva
lents. But their composition is not, on that account, the less
fixed, nor are their properties the less definite. Many of these
eutectic alloys have been known in partial purity for ages,
having been nearly reached by repeated trial or by assuming
a molecular ratio. But they have not been recognized as a
class numbering merely as dieutectics several hundred (say
 1700), which can be obtained, as above shown, systematically
and in a state of great purity. Nor does the fact that several
 instances are known in which metals combine with one another
in the chemical sense—that is, in simple multiple ratio by
 weight of their combining weights and with liberation of heat
 —at all diminish the possible number of such eutectic alloys.
 For, firstly, as a salt may unite with water, as when anhydrous
 chloride of calcium does so, to fix the water as crystalline
 water, and also may unite with water as a cryohydrate, so two
 metals may unite in one proportion while they form a definite
 eutectic alloy in another. Secondly, the very bodies resulting
 from the chemical union of the two metals will possibly, ana
 probably, furnish starting-points of new series of eutectic
 alloys, consisting of a single metal on the one hand and the
 chemical alloy on the other.
    § 206. It will be instructive to compare the results given
 above with results obtained by some previous experimenters
 who have examined bismuth alloys.
    According to Kose, one part by weight of lead, one of tin,
 and two of bismuth melt at 93°* 75. That a part of it may
 melt, and so the whole soften at that temperature, need not be

468              Frederick Guthrie on Eutexia.
questioned. But that the whole should melt from first to
last at any fixed temperature, is so highly improbable as to
be practically impossible on account of the simplicity of the
proportion.
    According to Matthiessen and v. Bose zinc and bismuth form
two alloys, one containing 97*6 of zinc, and the other from
8*6 to 14*3 (instead of 7*15), which two alloys are immiscible.
 The melting-points do not appear to have been given. In
deed, as neither of these is eutectic, so neither has a proper
 melting-point.
    The nearest approach to an eutectic alloy appears to have
 been made by Budberg, who, on melting together 177 parts
 by weight of tin, and 213 of bismuth (tin =45-38 per cent.,
 bismuth =54*62 per cent.), obtained an alloy which is said
 to have a constant melting-temperature of 143°. Budberg
 further states that all other ratios have higher melting-points,
 and that, on cooling, the liquid portion reduces itself to this
 ratio. The above ratio is intended for that between three
 "atoms" of tin and two of bismuth. For if the atomic
 weight of tin be 118 and that of bismuth 210 (Budberg takes
 tin 56, bismuth 106*5), we should have in Sn3Bi2 the per
 centage, tin =45' 74 per cent., bismuth =54*26 per cent. It
 has been shown above that the true eutectic alloy has a melting-
 point 10° lower than Budberg's, and the composition, tin = 53*9,
 bismuth =46*1 per cent.
    Again, it is stated that when lead and bismuth are fused
 together, in the proportion of three atoms of lead to two of
 bismuth, an alloy is obtained whose melting-point is con
 stant at 129°. This ratio requires lead 42*49, bismuth 57*51
 per cent. The true eutectic alloy has a melting-point 6°*3 C.
 lower, and, as we have seen, has the composition, lead 44*42,
 bismuth 55*58.
     The preconceived notion that the alloy of minimum tempe
  rature of fusion must have its constituents in simple atomic
 proportion,—that it must be a chemical compound,—seems
 to have misled previous investigators. Such misconception
  could scarcely have arisen if the existence and properties of
  the cryohydrates had been known.
     § 206 A. It was shown many years ago (about 35) by my
  brother Francis, that if two counties are only then supposed
  to be in contact when they have linear common boundary,
  to colour a map so that no two counties in contact shall be
  coloured alike, four colours at most are needed. Taking the
  special case in three dimensions it is clear that five, but no
  more spheres, may touch one another (each touching all). If
  there be such things as atoms, and if they be spherical or of

                 Frederick Guthrie on Eutexia.                469
one curvature, not more than five can touch, each touching all.
Chemical compounds are known containing more than five
elements. But this circumstance does not obliterate the limit
of the eutexia of alloys, which are neither atomic nor molecular.
                            Salt Alloys.
   § 207. It cannot be gainsaid that, vast as is the importance
in the arts of the elementary metals and their alloys, yet in
terrestrial nature the interaction and relationship of compound
bodies is at least of equal importance, and of far wider scope;
for the science of such interaction and relationship constitutes
the greater part of chemistry and petrology.
   Amongst the non-metallic elements we should expect the
class analogous with the eutectic alloys to be very restricted
in number, on account of the chemical attitude of such ele
ments towards one another, that is their tendency towards
chemical union.
   Chemical compounds, however, all of which may forbrevity's
sake be called salts, can give rise to an indefinite number of
eutectic bodies ; indeed to an indefinite number of series of
such bodies. The whole of the preceding memoirs on Salt-solu
tions and Attached Water are in fact mainly a study of one such
series. The cryohydrates are nothing else than eutectic alloys
 of the one salt called water with the various other salts. If
 instead of fused ice (water) we employ another fused salt, say
 fused table salt, we may expect to find it forming eutectic
alloys with other salts, whose characteristic should be fusi
bility at a temperature lower than that of either (both) of its
constituents.
    § 208. In choosing salts whose behaviour under such ex
amination shall be as free as possible from ambiguity we
must avoid :—
    First, those which are decomposed when heated by them
selves to anything like the temperature to which they are to
be exposed in the experiment. And we are safe in this respect,
if we confine ourselves to those which are not decomposed on
fusion. For the bodies we are seeking should have tempera
tures of fusion below the temperature at which that one
of its constituents fuses whose temperature of fusion is the
lower of the two—it should be eutectic.
    Secondly, must be avoided those which react on one another
 chemically, either in the sense of suffering double decomposi
tion, or in that of direct combination whereby double salts
are formed. It will be shown in § 225-227 that it is not always
necessary to avoid the first of these contingencies. The possi
bility of double decomposition is of course avoided when the

470              Frederick Guthrie on Eutexia.
two salts used have either a common basic, or a common acid
constituent.
   Thirdly, are to be eschewed those salts which attack at high
temperatures the vessels employed.
   Amongst all salts perhaps Nitre answers these requirements
best, as the body whose homologue is ice in the previous
memoirs of Salt-solutions and Attached Water. Nitrates do not
form double salts with one another, nor with other salts (com
pare, however, Karsten). Nitre may be raised without suf- '
fering decomposition to a temperature far above its temperature
of fusiou ; possessing in this respect a wider range of available
temperature than nitrate of ammonium, which might otherwise
be preferable on account of its lower melting-point.
   § 209. In the following paragraphs, from § 210 to § 227,
temperatures up to 280° C. were measured by means of a
mercurial thermometer. Those above that range were deter
mined by an air-thermometer with a horizontal stem about
three feet long. The index was a plug of mercury. The
total range was from about 0° to 380° 0. As most of the
experiments in which the air-thermometer was used were
made on days on which the barometric pressure was nearly
the same, no correction was needed. On other days the air-
thermometer was standardized at the temperature of boiling
water, with the mercurial one placed by its side in the water.
   § 210. Nitre.—I find that the temperature of fusion of
pure nitre is 320° G.
   § 211. Nitre and Chromate of Potassium.—If nitre be fused
in a large porcelain crucible and neutral chromate of potas
sium be added, some of the chromate is dissolved. The higher
the temperature the larger the quantity. On suffering the
solution to cool slowly, chromate of potassium separates out
in fine powder, which sinks through the fused mass. The
temperature falls till it reaches 295°, at which it remains
constant ; and the liquid begins to solidify. The liquid por
tion is poured into a fresh crucible; and this may be repeated
any number of times. The temperature of solidification is
constant. The liquid being poured upon a cold slab solidifies
to a mass, which has when cold precisely the colour of sulphur.
Of this alloy 2'4881 grams gave 0*1226 chromate of barium.
This corresponds to 0*0936 chromate of potassium, which is
3*76 per cent. Accordingly this alloy is:—

furnishing nitrates alloyable with nitre. The method of expe
riment was precisely as before, the nitrates having been
rendered anhydrous before they were added to the fused nitre.
The bases were all separated and weighed as carbonates.
   The eutectic alloy of nitre with nitrate of calcium has a
melting-point of 251°. Of this, 1-8300 gram gave 0*2830
carbonate, or 0*4641 gram nitrate of calcium. This corre
sponds to 25*36 per cent.
   § 213. The eutectic alloy of nitre with nitrate of strontium
has a melting-point of 258°. Of this, 1-9490 gram gave
0*3498 gram carbonate, or 0-5031 gram nitrate. This corre
sponds to 25-81 per cent.

melts at 278°-5. Of this, 2-6100 grams gave 0-5860 gram

    In this group strontium holds its accustomed intermediate
 place between calcium and barium ; but, both in regard to
the melting-point and to the composition of its eutectic alloy,
it more closely resembles the former than the latter.
    § 215. Nitre and Nitrate ofLead.—The eutectic alloy formed
by these salts is of great interest, not only because the lead
element, like the chromate of potassium and the nitrates of
barium and strontium, cannot be fused alone without decom
position, but because it, the alloy, has a remarkably low melting-
 point, and because either constituent in excess of its quantity
 in the eutectic alloy raises the melting-point in a manner easy
 to be followed. To the fused nitre the dry nitrate of lead is
 added, and on cooling one or other separates out in crystals
 easy to distinguish. More of the salt which is in fusion is
added, until this is in its turn the one which separates on cool
ing. The same process having been repeated three or four
times, the whole is allowed to lose heat as before. The tem
perature soon settles at 207° C, and thereupon the liquid
begins to solidify as a beautiful white opaque porcelain-like
 mass, startlingly like the cryohydrates. The temperature
may at first sink to 203° 0.; and when in this condition of
supersaturation, solidification is not to be induced by the intro

duction of dust of either of the nitrates, but begins when dust of
the solid eutectic alloy is introduced. The temperature there
upon rises to 107°. This presumably proves that the alloy has
a crystalline form of its own, different from those of its two
constituents. Its composition was as follows, the lead being
weighed as sulphate. The two specimens were from sepa
rate preparations, the only criterion of identity of composition
being identity of melting-point.
   (1) 2-8625 grams gave 1-2150 of sulphate of lead, or 1-3276
gram of nitrate of lead, or 46-38 per cent, of nitrate of lead.

or 1-0892 gram of nitrate of lead, or 47-34 per cent. Taking
the mean, we have

   § 216. Nitre and Sulphate of Potassium. — Anhydrous
neutral sulphate of potassium dissolves in fused nitre, and sepa
rates out therefrom as the fused mass cools in the form of a fine
powder. It is advantageous to allow the mass to lose heat
very slowly. As soon as the porcelain-like eutectic alloy
begins to be formed, the liquid is transferred into a fresh
crucible, and the solidification is continued. An alloy is thus
finally obtained of the constant melting-point of 300°.

losing heat ; those which are poorer give up nitre, until in
both cases the eutectic alloy is reached. The eutectic alloy is
the exact analogue of the cryobydrate; and just as in the
preceding memoir curves were drawn showing, on the one
hand, the temperatures at which ice separates from salt-solutions
of various strengths, weaker in salt than the cryohydrate, and,
on the other, the temperature at which the salt, or occasion
ally a subcryohydrate, separates from such solutions as are
stronger in salt than the cryohydrates, so, doubtless, the ana
logous curves could be drawn connecting the temperature at
which solidification begins with the fused mixtures of salts
(see § 223). And, again, as there are always two strengths of
an aqueous solution, one stronger and the other weaker than
the cryobydrate, which are both saturated at the same tempe
rature below zero, one in respect to the salt and the other in
respect to the ice, so with these fused mixtures there must be
two such mixtures, from both of which a solid begins to sepa
rate at any given temperature between the melting-point of
the most easily fused constituent and that of the eutectic alloy.
§ 223 is devoted to the tracing of this inquiry.
   § 218. The analogy is so perfect between the two groups of
bodies (eutectic alloys and cryohydrates), that we may look
with great confidence for homologous phenomena. The freez
ing mixture, or cryogen of my former memoirs, has its perfect
counterpart amongst the salt-alloys, as follows :—
   A layer of powdered nitrate of lead (46 parts by weight) is
placed in the bottom of a wide test-tube. On this is laid a
thin disk of mica, having a hole in the middle. A thermo
meter is fixed through the hole so that its bulb is half covered
by the lead salt. Upon the mica, and so surrounding the top
of the bulb, is piled some powdered nitre (54 parts). This
tube is plunged into a bath of melted nitre, which is heated
some few degrees above its melting-point, and until the ther
mometer registers about 250°. The thermometer is then used
as a stirring-rod to mix the two salts. The mercury sinks to
207°, and remains pretty constant for a time at that tempera
ture. The contents of the tube liquefy, and solid nitre is
formed upon the outside of the tube. Now substitute ice for
nitre, and perform the analogous experiment. The nitrate of
lead and ice in the inner tube will form a freezing-mixture
when stirred together, and this will cause ice to form on the
outside, if the melted ice (water) in contact with it be not too
warm.
   § 218a. Just as the eutectic metallic alloys had been nearly

474               Frederick Guthrie on Eutexia.
approached by Rudberg and others, so approximations to
eutectic salt alloys have not been unknown. Thus M.
Maumene" (Comptes Rendus, 1883, xcviii. p. 1215) makes the
very interesting statement that while neither nitrate of barium
nor nitrate of lead can be fused per se without decomposition,
they can both be so fused beneath a mass of nitrate of potas
sium or nitrate of sodium or a mixture of both. He states
that an equivalent mixture of the nitrates of barium and
sodium melts at about 370° ; and that when equal weights are
taken, crystallization begins at 322°, and solidification takes
place at 288°. Again, according to M. Maumend, equal
weights of the nitrates of lead and sodium have a melting-
point (point fixe) at 282° [we have seen that the eutectic
alloy of these two fuses at 268° and contains 42*84 per cent.
of nitrate of lead (see § 221)]. And again, M. Maumene, on
taking equal weights of nitrate of sodium, nitrate of potas
sium, and nitrate of lead, finds the melting-point 259 . [I
find (§ 215) an eutectic alloy melting at 186° and containing
43-34 nitrate of lead.] It appears that none of the propor
tions given by M. Maumene" are those of the eutectic alloys,
and that accordingly the temperatures of solidification which
he gives cannot be constant.
    § 219. Eutectic Salt Alloys of Nitrate of Sodium.—Nitrate of
sodium fuses at 305°, and we might perhaps expect that its
eutectic alloys would have lower fusing-points than the corre
sponding nitre alloys. The following experiments show that
this is by no means the case.
   § 220. Nitrate of Sodium with Nitre.—Obtained by the
method above described, the eutectic alloy of these two salts
has the fusing-point of 215° C. Of this alloy 3*8885 grams
were converted into neutral sulphates, having the joint weight
3-3135. This implies 2-5093 grams nitre and 1-3792 gram
nitrate of sodium ; or

   § 221. Nitrate of Sodium with Nitrate of Lead.—Thiseutectic
salt alloy has a melting-point of 268°. A weight of 3-3040
grams gave 1'2955 grams sulphate of lead, which corresponds
to 1-4156 gram nitrate of lead.

the alloy in § 219 to be a single salt, and find the eutectic
alloy between this and nitrate of lead. The lowest melting-
point is found to be 186° ; and the composition of the alloy,
derived from the result that 2*9280 grams gave 1*1613 gram
sulphate of lead or 1*2690 gram nitrate of lead, is as follows :—
                                              Per cent Melting-point.

    This of course implies that the above is the eutectic alloy of
 these three salts. The eutexia of salt alloys of more than two
 salts is a very wide question upon which I can only here touch.
    § 223. The following experiment completes the analogy
pointed out in § 218. Mixtures of nitre and nitrate of lead,
both in the form of powder, were made in different ratios from
 95 nitre and 5 of nitrate of lead, 90 of nitre and 10 of nitrate
 of lead, and so on ; these were put into test-tubes and heated
 in an oil-bath, which was kept continually stirred. The mix
 ture was completely melted, and the temperature at which
 solidification began was observed. The observations, being
 repeated many times, gave the following results :—

      alloys of nitre with nitrate of lead of various strengths.

     It is of course necessary to heat the mixed powders, in each
  case, beyond the temperature which proves to be the initial
  solidifying point of the mixed mass. On heating the column
  of powder it is noticed first to shrink and cake together to
  about a quarter of its former volume, reminding one of the
  baking of clays. Indeed all phenomena of so-called incipient
  fusion of compound bodies (the pasty state) may be due to
  what takes place here, namely the formation of an eutectic alloy.

tures not very much higher than 320°, puts a limit to the
tracing of this curve further, but its general aspect is quite
like that of the salt-solution (water) cnrres below zero, of
which so many examples have been given in previous memoirs.

   Mixtures consisting of 20 per cent, nitre and 80 per cent,
nitrate of lead, and even 10 per cent, nitre and 90 per cent,
nitrate of lead, fuse together into clear liquids without decom-
Eosition, hut I have not determined the melting-points. At a
  igher temperature the red peroxide of nitrogen is evolved,
but I do not know whether it is or is not accompanied by
oxygen.
   In the figure curve (1) shows the solidification-temperatures
of mixtures of nitrate of lead and fused ice (§ 152), and curve
(2) shows the solidification-temperatures of mixtures of nitrate
of lead and fused nitre. The abscissa? are on the same scale
(1 millim. to 1 per cent, of lead salt). The ordinates are in
(2) 1 millim. to 1° C. ; in curve (1) 1 millim. to 0°-I. The
curve (2) is fetched down so that the two have a common
origin-
    § 224. One of the widest generalizations with regard to
the behaviour of compound bodies towards one another is
that which assumes, in the case of two salts, that the bases are
shared in the first place by the acids, and that the result which
often ensues, that one base and one acid are ultimately found
in union to the exclusion of all others, is due to the succes
sive withdrawal of such a combination when formed, either by
its insolubility or volatility. Accordingly we must not be
surprised that when the conditions of insolubility are varied,
the final selection may be wholly changed. The salt alloy
described in § 215, namely the eutectic alloy of nitre and
nitrate of lead, when mixed with the eutectic alloy of nitre
and sulphate of potash, § 216, and heated, forms a perfectly
transparent liquid. Sulphate of lead, which is so insoluble in
water, is soluble in fused nitre (see § 225) ; and a mixture may
be got identical with that got on heating nitrate of lead with
sulphate of potassium in. the presence of nitrate of potassium.
There is iu both cases equilibrium between the bases and acids.
When sulphate of lead is dissolved in fused nitre, it is to be
noticed that, at a considerably increased temperature, the red
oxide of nitrogen is given off, as when nitrate of lead is heated
by itself. Both nitre and sulphate of lead, when heated by
themselves, require a much higher temperature for their de
composition ; this seems to show the existence of nitrate of
lead in the fused mixture. The liquidness of the fused alloy
 does not show that no sulphate of lead is present : a certain
 amount of lead is no doubt in union with sulphuric acid, but
 is soluble in nitre as other salts are soluble in water.
    § 225. Nitre arid Sulphate of Lead.—On adding pure dry
sulphate of lead to fused nitre, solution ensues the more
abundantly the hotter the liquid. The amount of sulphate of

lead dissolved is, however, small, and the fusing-point is only
lowered about 5°, standing now at about 315°. At temperatures
above its melting-point, it would be unjustifiable to call such
a liquid an alloy, because its composition, in all probability,
depends upon its temperature in as far as that composition is
referred to the distribution of acids and bases. As it cools it
gives up sulphate of lead in little crystals which sink. At
the temperature of 315° general solidification begins, and is
completed.
    Of this alloy 4*2725 grams were treated with water and a
 little alcohol, and the insoluble sulphate of lead was found to
 weigh 0*1968 gram, corresponding to 4*61 per cent.
     Sulphate of lead requires for fusion per se a bright red,
 almost white heat. But it is thus found to dissolve in hot
 fused nitre, and it separates as such on cooling the fused
 liquid. For the geological value of this fact see § 230.
    § 226. Sulphate of Calcium behaves in a similar manner.
 Highly refractory by itself, it dissolves in fused nitre. The
 cooling mixture, after shedding the excess of sulphate above
 that required for the eutectic alloy, solidifies at a constant
 temperature of about 315°. The lime, separated as oxalate
 and weighed as carbonate, showed a percentage of sulphate
 of 0-93. For 3*4832 grams of alloy gave 0-0238 gram of
 carbonate, or 0*03237 gram of sulphate.
     § 227. Nitre and Sulphate of Barium.—Even the sulphate
 of barium, which is typical of aqueous insolubility, dissolves in
 fused nitre, depressing the solidifying point, however, almost
 inappreciably. A little separates on cooling, and 8*54 grams
 of the eutectic alloy, when boiled with water, gave 0*0852
 gram of the insoluble sulphate, or 0*98 per cent. It may be
 noticed in passing that, as is well known to analysts, sulphate
  of barium is soluble to an appreciable extent in another fused
  nitrate, namely nitrate of hydrogen.
     § 228. Specific Gravity of the Eutectic Alloy of Nitrate of
 Potassium and Nitrate of Sodium.
     Slabs of nitre, nitrate of sodium, and the eutectic alloy of
 the two were cast upon a surface of cold metal, the liquids
  themselves being when poured only a few degrees above
  their melting-points. Their specific gravities were found by
  weighing them in oil of turpentine of ascertained specific
 gravity. I found the

 If the two were to mix without either gain or loss of volume

in the proportion found in § 220, namely 32'9 of nitrate of
sodium and 67'1 of nitrate of potassium, the specific gravity
of the alloy would be 2'149. The density found shows that
there has been an expansion on the two associating themselves
together to form the alloy. And this expansion is presumably
in near connexion with the lowering of the melting-point.
   § 229. The generalization of Berthollet is only one aspect
of the question of distribution. When a compound body a x,
and another compound body by being brought together in
watery solution give rise to an insoluble body ay and a
soluble one b x, we have no more right to say that the change
is brought about in virtue of the insolubility of ay than that it
is due to the solubility of b x. Strictly speaking, it is due to
the difference in solubility of the two. For the solubility of
the one is as much concerned with the separation of the two
new compounds as in the insolubility of the other. It is on
this account that eutexia, without water, and as it exists in the
case of two fused metals or anhydrous salts, may and must
have a determining influence on the arrangement in ratio or
kind of the constituents.
   § 230. Geological and Mineralogical Significance ofEutexia.
—How the temperature of liquefaction of rocks may be lowered
by the introduction of even small quantities of water will be
discussed in my next memoir. It has been very diligently
considered by Daubree. Let us briefly examine the question
of the interaction of rocks and their constituents, without, of
necessity, the intervention of water.
   In reviewing the analyses of Felspathic minerals, most of
which, unless weathered after solidification, appear to be
essentially anhydrous, we find them to be silicates of potassium
and aluminum, in which, to use the common expression, the
potassium is partly replaced by sodium, calcium, magnesium,
and manganese, the aluminum by iron. That water is not
essential to the formation of this kind of mineral, is proved
by the occurrence of it in copper and iron furnaces. Mica, on
the other hand, appears always to contain water, sometimes
as much as three or four per cent., with a lesser percentage of
silica than felspar ; it contains generally a far larger pro
portion of aluminum and of iron ; the abundance of the latter
element may indeed be considered, together with its defi
ciency in silica, as its distinguishing characteristic, chemically
speaking, from orthoclase.
   Silica—the great earth-acid, a title which it shares with
carbonic acid, whose other realm is the air, and to some
extent with hydrochloric acid, whose proper region is the sea
— appears both in the anhydrous form and with as much as

 eleven per cent, of water. By its nnion with alumina it gives
 rise to clay, slate, and the minerals staurolite, andalosite,
 kyanite ; with lime to Wollastonite ; with magnesia (and iron)
 to bronzite ; with lime and magnesia (and iron) to augite and
  diallage ; with magnesia and iron (and lime) to hypersthene
 and olivine ; with magnesia, lime, and iron to hornblende ; with
 iron to Fayalite, and so on.
     If, now, we adopt the often-asserted theory that variations
 in minerals belonging to the same class are brought about
 by the exchange of more or less of one base by another, the
 analyses land us in a difficulty, which seems insuperable.
 Let us suppose, for instance, that we have pure Wollastonite,
 consisting of
                 Silica                      51-73,
                 Lime                        48-27.
 Replacing part of the lime by magnesia and iron, say 23-51
 by 18*55 magnesia and 0'99 protoxide of iron, the silica
 rises to 55*15, and gives us an excellent example of augite
 (neglecting the manganese and alumina of that body).

    These bases, neglecting the water and hydrofluoric acid,
require together 51*83 of silicic acid, instead of 60. No pro
cess of exchange of one base for another can make hornblende
out of Wollastonite. It is essentially acid, unless in those
varieties of amphibole which contain a considerable proportion
of alumina ; these, indeed, may be basic, acid, or neutral,
according as the alumina is considered as a base saturating

the silica, or an acid saturating lime or magnesia, or partly in
the one predicament and partly in the other. As Wollastonite
occurs along with amphibole and augite, there does not appear
sufficient ground for this essential difference on the replace
ment theory.
   I submit that, according to analogy, we should regard com
pound rocks and minerals, other than sedimentary rocks, as
representing various kinds of eutectic alloys. We may for
the sake of argument start from some known definite rock
which is a true chemical compound, such as orthoclase, and
trace the probable reactions between this and other rocks ; or
we may take a rock, like granite or syenite, of indefinite compo
sition, and examine the probable assortment of its constituents
on cooling. Starting with the melted mass, my experiments
with salts have, I maintain, established that the clear molten
granite will in cooling throw off as solids atomically definite
salts, the last alloy to remain liquid being the eutectic alloy,
which is constant only in composition in the sense in which
such a body is so. It would follow therefore that the micas
are the eutectic alloys of the proximate elements, or salts of
the melted granite. Quartz and felspar being both molecu-
larly constituted, undergo solidification before mica. On
account of tho enormous effect which even a little water has
in reducing the melting-point * and because silica is soluble
in water, it is probable that the order of solidification is first
felspar, and then quartz, and lastly mica. Quartz is thus
speaking en gros pseudomorphic to felspar, and mica to both ;
all three are sometimes in this mass-sense pseudomorphic to
slate, and mica is especially so. If fused nitre be saturated
with nitrate of lead and sulphate of potash, and gradually
cooled, sulphate of lead first separates, then sulphate of potash
with sulphate of lead, then the eutectic alloy of all three.
The sulpnate of lead represents the felspar, the sulphate of
potash with sulphate of lead represents the quartz, and the
eutectic alloy represents the mica (see also § 38, Phys. Soc.
 1874). Tourmaline and hornblende are probably both eutectic,
 whilst olivine is probably not.
   § 231. As to the great rock-masses themselves, if we assume
that the earth is a drop of fused rock alloy with a solid crust,
and that its history had been one of gradual undisturbed
and symmetrical cooling, it is clear that, apart from sedimen
tary formations, the oldest solid rocks are those formed nearest
 the surface. But the disturbing causes are manifold : the earth-
crust is under stress on account of the loss of volume on
cooling. This strain is unequally distributed, on account of

                          [Plates XIV. & XV.]
 ON June 10th, ]882, I communicated to the Society a
        design for an integrating anemometer, and exhibited a
working model f. I have now to describe the instrument
itself, which I have had made by Messrs. Elliott, with the
assistance of a grant from the Royal Society. The mecha
nical part of the instrument is seen in perspective in Plate XIV.
fig. 1. The base is of iron, and the rest of the instrument is
chiefly of brass. On the base stand four columns 0, of which
 only two are shown in fig. 1. These hold a table 0, of which
 fig. 2 gives a view as seen from above. The tops of the
 columns C are seen in fig. 2. The table supports four columns,
 D, of which only two are shown in fig. 1, and of all of which
 the positions are shown in fig. 2. The pillars D hold the sup
 ports of a spindle A, fig. J , which is to be connected with a
 vane. There is another spindle, B, which is to be connected
 with Robinson's cups, and which turns, by means of cogs, the
 large horizontal disk X, so that X will revolve with a velocity
 which may be taken as proportional to that of the wind. The
 spindle A carries a horizontal bar G, which is to be kept by the
 vane in the direction of the wind, and which, by means of a
 forked end, holds a vertical pin rising from the centre of the
 bar F. This bar is pivoted at E to the centres of two trucks H,
 each of which runs by means of five wheels (U) between tram
 lines (M) placed so as to form a cross with the arms directed
 towards the cardinal points (compare figs. 1 and 2). The
 centre of the cross is vertically over the centre of the disk X.
  Centrally between the tram-lines M are slits S through the
 table 0. The object in having five wheels ( U) placed as shown
 in fig. 1 (see also fig. 3) is to enable each wheel of the truck H

 to pass over the slits S, and yet always to keep the pivot E
 well within the base formed by the remaining four wheels, so
 that it may be perfectly steady. On the underside of the
 table 0 are similar tram-lines, N; and trucks (K) run in these
 tram-lines, each on five wheels, V. Fig. 3 shows one of these
 trucks seen from below, with portions of the tram-lines N.
     Fig. 4 is an elevation showing an end view of the trucks
 H and K, with a portion of a section of the table 0 across a
 slit S. Two rods, T, of which the ends are shown in fig. 3,
 and of one of which a side view is shown in fig. 4, are rigidly
 connected with H and pass through the slit S and through
 holes in K. Spiral springs surrounding the rods T and rest
 ing on the heads of the rods press K upwards, and make it
 keep its position exactly and firmly under H. Each truck, K,
 carries firmly fastened to it two pieces of brass, L (see figs. 1,
 3, 4); and between these pieces is pivoted a bar with arms J,
 and between these arms is pivoted a wheel W, which is carried
 in a vertical position also at right angles to the slit through
 which T passes. A rod I connected with K is surrounded by
 a spiral spring which presses on J, and so keeps a steady
 pressure between the wheel W and the disk X. The pivots
 of J and W are so placed that, when W touches X, these
 pivots all lie in one horizontal plane, and the point of contact
 of W with X is vertically below the centre of the pivot E
 (figs. 1,2).
    Now suppose the wind to lie between North and East, and
 the direction from which it blows to make an angle 6 with
 North. Let ft be the velocity of the wind. Then the resolved
 parts of the wind towards North and East will be ft cos 6 and
 ft sin 6 respectively. But if 8 be the length of the bar F
 (fig. 2) measured between the centres of its pivots E, it is
 easily seen, from the diagram in the margin, that the distances
 of the wheels W from the centre
of the disk X (fig. 1) are 8 cos 6
and S sin 6 towards the North and
East respectively.        Now the
speeds of the wheels W are pro
portional to the speed of the disk
X on which they roll multiplied
by these distances, and the speed
of" the disk X is proportional to
the velocity ft of the wind.
Hence the speeds of the wheels

       8 sin            to Scosfl.ft
             8.Q respectively ; that            n

is, they are proportional to ft cos 6 and ft sin 6, which are the
resolved parts of the velocity of the wind.

484                     Mr. W. Baily on an
   If, now, we were to add a mechanical counter to each of the
wheels W, the increase of the readings of these counters would
give the integral of the resolved parts of the wind towards the
North and East ; and inasmuch as the wheels W revolve in the
contrary direction when they have passed across the centre of
the disk X, South winds would act on the counters as nega
tive North, and West winds as negative East. Two counters
would be sufficient, as a preponderance of South wind would
be indicated by a decrease in the reading of the North counter,
and a preponderance of West wind by a decrease in that of
the East counter.
    It was found, however, much more convenient to make
each wheel W complete an electric circuit at each revolution,
and to use an electric counter; but inasmuch as such a counter
will not distinguish in which direction the wheel is turning,
it was necessary to have separate counters for North and
South, and to shunt the circuit from one counter to the other
as the wheel W crossed the centre of the disk X, and to make
a similar arrangement for East and West.
    I will now describe the electric system adopted:—Parallel
with the tram-lines M (fig. 2) are insulated rails R, one of
which is seen in section in fig. 4. Each rail, R, is connected
by an insulated wire with an insulated binding-screw er. Each
truck, H, bears a thin insulated plate of brass, P, seen in face
in fig. 2 and edgeways in fig. 3; and each end of the plate P
carries a small wheel, Q. At any moment, except when the
truck is passing the centre of the cross, one of the wheels
 Q rests on a rail R, and the other is in the air. This is
clearly seen in fig. 3. At the moment when one of the
trucks H (say the North and South one) passes, say, from
North to South across the centre, the wheel Q on the North
rail R runs off it, and the other wheel Q rans on to the South
 rail R, so that the plate P of the truck is always in electrical
 connexion with the binding-screw a belonging to the cardinal
 point towards which the truck lies. The rails R have for their
 upper edge a thin rail of platinum. This was added to the
 broad rail of brass, as it was found that points of dust or corro
 sion sometimes made accidental breaks in the electrical contact
 between R and Q. In the truck K which runs below H are
 two parallel tongues Y, Z, very near one another (see fig. 3,
 in which the full length of Y is seen, but only the end of Z).
 Both are fixed to J ; but Z is also insulated from J, and is con
 nected by an insulated wire, which passes through the slit S
 (fig. 4) and through a hole in H, with the insulated plate P.
 The tongue Y is electrically connected with K, and so through
 various points of contact with the table 0. There is a pro

                     Integrating Anemometer.                 485
jection from the axle of the wheel W (fig. 3), which once in
every turn of the wheel pushes against the tongue Y and
brings it into contact with the tongue Z. On the table 0
(fig. 2) is another binding-screw p, which is not insulated.
Now suppose a truck H to be upon the North arm of the
cross. Its tongue Z is in electric connexion with the North
binding-screw a, and the whole of that part of the system
is insulated from the table 0. Eveiy time the wheel W
turns round, contact is made between Y and Z; and the
effect is that the North a is put into electrical connexion
with the table 0, and therefore with the binding-screw p. The
general electrical system is shown in Plate XV., which gives a
front view of the box of counters, and a diagram of the anemo
meter, batteries, and wires. The box contains four counters
lettered according to the cardinal points, and from the binding-
screws on one side (the right in the figure) insulated wires
pass to the corresponding insulated binding-screws a on the
anemometer. From the binding-screws on the other side of
the box of counters insulated wires also proceed. The North
and South wires are connected with one pole of a battery, and
the East and West wires are connected with the same pole of
 a similar battery. The other poles of the batteries are con
 nected by a wire which returns to the .anemometer to the un-
                                If more convenient, the return
wire may of course be omitted, and the batteries and anemo
 meter be connected to earth.
    Let us now suppose the wind is blowing from about North
 east. The trucks H, K are now on the North and East arms
 of the cross. The circuit through the South counter is complete
 from the tongue Y through the table 0, the return wire, the
 South counter, and then to the South binding-screw a and
 South insulated rail R; but there it stops, and no current can
 therefore pass through the South counter. The west circuit
 is stopped in a similar manner. But in the case of the other
 circuits, the insulated rail R is in contact with the wheel Q,
 and so through P the circuit is carried on as far as the
 tongue Z. hence in the circuits through the North and East
 counters a current passes whenever the corresponding tongues
 Y and Z are pressed together, and the corresponding counter
 marks one.
    To determine the value of the readings of the counters, we
 may resort to measurements of the instrument or to direct
 experiment. If we place one truck at its furthest distance
 from the centre and rotate the spindle B a certain number
 of times, and then note the increase in the reading of the
 corresponding counter, there will be found a constant ratio k

486              On an Integrating Anemometer.
between them, so that an increase of n on the counter denotes
kn revolutions of B.
   Letting 8, as before, be the length of the bar F between its
points E (fig. 2), S is the greatest distance which the wheel
W can go from the centre. Put e for the radius of W, £ for
the number of cogs on the edge of the disk X, and t] for
the number of cogs on the spindle B ; we have
             Speed of X : speed of B =77 : 5,
                „      W:      „      X=S:e,
                „      W:      „      B=oV:e!=l:k,
which gives us k=
   If we place the arm G in any other position and turn the
spindle B for some time, and then read p and q as the increase
in the readings of the counters of the adjacent cardinal points,
the resultant reading for magnitude is \/p* + q'1, and the
number of revolutions of B will be k\/p* + q'J, where k has the
same value as before. The direction of the bar G may be
determined by taking 0 as the angle between the bar and the
cardinal point to which p relates. Then
                      p : q=cos 0 : sin 0;
whence
                       tan 0 = P.
                                9
Of course if B is rotated a certain number of times (say 500),
the value of \/p1 + q1 must be the same in -whatever position
G has been fixed throughout the experiment.
   By repeating this experiment with different positions of G,
we get a means of testing the amount of error to which the
instrument is liable.
   When the anemometer is connected with a vane and with
Robinson's cups, lot us suppose the wind to remain in one
direction for some time; or, if that cannot be secured, let us
either tie up the vane, or disconnect it from the spindle A
and fasten the spindle. Let I revolutions of the cups indicate
one mile of wind, and m revolutions of the cups give one revo
lution of the spindle B. Let p and q be the readings of the
counters, then the miles of wind indicated will be

ings of all the counters; let these be represented by n, s, e}

 Die physikalischen Grundlagen der Mechanik. Von Dr. Heinrioh
                  Stbeintz. Leipzig : Teubner, 1883.
 TT is not an easy matter to characterize this book ; for, though the
     author abjures, in the most defiant manner, all aid from the so-
 called " Erkenntnisstheorie," it cannot be said that he is always quite
 free from those metaphysical subtleties which loom so large and
 mean so little. Yet, on the whole, the genuine physicist shines
 out, though occasionally through the clouds of vain imagination.
 We will therefore confine our remarks to that part, by far the
larger part, of the work which is free from this earth-born con
 tamination.
   The author's object is "to discuss the fundamental laws of
 Dynamics—what we are accustomed in this country to call Newton's
Laws of Motion. But much more than half of the work is devoted
 to the First Law, or Galilei's Principle as it is justly entitled. This
 discussion is extremely interesting, especially from the historical
 point of view ; for the author has evidently read much, and is not
only always a keen, but usually a really discriminating, critic. His
citations from the works of C. Neumann, who is well known as an
expert mathematician but by no means known as a sound physicist,
are to be justified only on the ground that lie was a student under
that Professor. But his citations from Schell and other authors
(or rather, compilers) of little note are quite unnecessary, especially
as he has found far higher game in men like Euler, Poisson, Laplace,
 Lagrange, Kirchhoff, and Clerk-Maxwell. There can be little
doubt that he has succeeded in showing that each of these men,
some of them on more than one occasion, has been guilty of false
logic, or, at least, of inconclusive reasoning in parts of the very
elements of Dynamics. Those who are curious to find what these
errors are, must be referred to the work itself ; it is sufficient that
we indicate that they are to be found there.
   Every one knows the fundamental difficulty which arises when
we try to think of absolute, as distinguished from relative, position,
velocity, or acceleration. Euler endeavoured to realize the unthink
able, in this case, by a process which virtually amounts to making

488                 Notices respecting New Books.
space a substance ; thereby all but reproducing one of the wildest
vagaries of Descartes, though from a totally different point of view
and for a totally different purpose. The remarks of Clerk-Maxwell
on this subject are well worthy of reproduction here. He says :—
   "When a man has acquired the habit of putting words together, with
out troubling himself to form the thoughts which ought to correspond
to them, it is easy for him to frame an antithesis between this relative
knowledge and a so-called absolute knowledge, and to point out our igno
rance of the absolute position of a point as an instance of the limitation of
our faculties. Any one, however, who will try to imagine the state of a
mind conscious of knowing the absolute position of a point will, ever after,
be content with our relative knowledge.
    But, granting at once the truth of this remark, in what sense are
we to understand the First Law of Motion ? As Newton gives it,
it runs :—
   " Corpus omne perseverare in statu, sua vel quiescendi vel movendi unifor-
miter in directum, nisi uuatenus illud a viribus impressi) cogitur etaturn ilium
mutare."
    There are here two difficulties, one of which is double-headed :—
(1) The nature of Force (ois impressa) ; (2) Uniform motion in a
 straight line, of which rest is merely one particular case. We will
 defer, for a moment, the consideration of (1). As to (2), since we
 can conceive of relative motion only, what must be tho properties
 of the system, relative to which a body unacted on by forces moves
 uniformly in a straight line ? And this difficulty involves another,
 which may be stated in either of two forms—What is uniform
 motion? or, How can we compare intervals of time? The latter
 difficulty is shown to have been fully overcome by D'Alembert,
though the first precise exposition of his method is due to Poisson.
      The reference-body (Fundamental-Kdrper) required for the
 Galilei-principle is then shown to be any body, unacted on by force
 and free from rotation.
     [Newton hail shown, in the Principia, how to detect by physical
 processes the existence, and the sense, of absolute rotation ; but his
 hope that something similar might possibly be done for absolute trans
  lation seems to be quite unrealizable.]
     It is shown that any number of such bodies necessarily behave
 Galilei-wise with regard to one another, and therefore that any one
 of them may be taken as a reference-body ; while three lines, fixed
 in it and mutually at right angle3, supply the requisite system of
 coordinates (Fundamental-System). There can be no doubt of the
 accuracy of these results ; but they follow so directly from the mere
 inspection of the differential equations, formed as a translation of
 Newton's words, that the proof given by the author is unnecessarily
 tedious.
     The author, however, seems to be the only one who has of late
 years taken the trouble to master the history of this part of the
 subject (save, perhaps, Diihring ; but all his writings show extrava
 gant bias) ; and, though we cannot estimate at quite so high a
 value as he himself seems to put on them, the originality and the

                    Notices respecting New Books.                   489
usefulness of his final conclusions, we must at least allow that he
has put together his own ideas, along with what is best in those of
other people (showing with great acuteness what parts of their
work are defective), and has arrived at a statement of the matter
which may probably not be materially improved for some time to
 come.
   It is well that we should occasionally find a man obviously
capable of higher work, ready to devote himself to the improvement
of our views of elementary matters. Things like this have but
little influence on the advance of science. Every man who is really
scientific knows them well enough to avoid mistakes of application ;
still it is useful to have our attention called to the slips which even
the greatest physicists are liable to make in the language they
employ when dealing with matters which appear to them all but
self-evident.
   Most of the faulty passages detected by the author appear to owe
their origin to some form or other of the pernicious doctrine called
the Principle of Sufficient Reason, a piece of metaphysics which has
choked off from true science many a man who might have done it
genuine service. When an uncogged die is thrown there is no
reason, to our knowledge, why it should give 1, rather than 2, or
any other number of points up to 6. This all will allow. But
would any one think of arguing from it that the die should, when
thrown, stand on one corner so as to avoid preference where all
choices are equally likely ? The analogy is rather overdrawn, but
it is quite near enough to show the essential fallacy of the so-called
doctrine or principle.
   As to "Force," the question of its non-objectivity has been
briskly discussed in this country of late years ; and Dr. Streintz's
remarks on this part of the subject seem to accord, at least fairly,
with those newer views in which what is commonly called force is
looked upon as a mere indication of sense which, like sound or light,
is something totally different from the objective reality. Put in a
word or two, his point of view is that a body's motion undergoes
acceleration to an amount, and in a direction, depending on the con
figuration of the system of which it forms a part. But we cannot
help expressing the conviction that the author would have much
strengthened his case, had he at once accepted (as a result of ex
periment) the Conservation of Energy in its full extent. Till that
is done, it seems to us that one of the most important factors of
our final determination is left entirely out of court.
   We conclude by recommending the work to the careful and
serious attention of all who have to deal with the physical bases of
our whole scientific knowledge, which are, and must ever be, the
only genuine ones.

ON THE BOILING-POINT OF OXYGEN, OF AIR, AND OF CARBONIC
   OXIDE UNDER THE ORDINARY ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE. BY
   M. S. WROBLEWSKI.
TN my Note presented to the Academy on the 31st December,
      1883, I showed that by expanding liquid oxygen a fall of tem
perature to — 186° C. is easily obtained. Since then I have directed
my attention to the methods for measuring low temperatures.
   It is clear that the use of the hydrogen thermometer, which served
in my researches on the liquefaction of oxygen, must have a limit.
It is needless to say that, as we approach the temperature at which
hydrogen liquefies, any calculation of temperature based upon the
pressure exerted by the gas becomes illusory. But there is another
circumstance which, in such cases, lessens the degree of certainty
necessary for these measurements.
   The thermometer based on the expansion of gases under a
constant volume consists, as we know, of a bulb immersed in the
medium whose temperature is to be determined, and of a narrow-
tube connecting this bulb with the manometer. In many cases
the temperature of this tube cannot be accurately determined; and
the exactitude of the measurements is changed when the volume
of the tube becomes comparable to that of the bulb. This is the
case in experimenting with gases so difficult, to liquefy as nitrogen,
atmospheric air, or carbonic oxide, where the thermometric bulbs
cannot have the necessary size. Comparing several hydrogen
thermometers, constructed with bulbs of different magnitudes, with
Jolly's air thermometer, I observed that the uncertainty of the
 measurements increases as the bulb is smaller, and as we get away
 from the zero of the thermometer. This uncertainty is still greater
 when we want to determine at a given moment, by means of such
a thermometer, the temperature of a medium which is not in the
stationary state, and which becomes heated or cooled. Hence all
determinations of the solidifying point of liquids made with the
 hydrogen thermometer cannot be exact.
    For the same reason I decided to base the methods for measuring
low temperatures on the thermo-electrical properties of metals. By
using aperiodic galvanometers of great resistance and great sensi
tiveness, it is easy to measure the electromotive forces due to
 differences of temperature. It is sufficient then to compare the
indications of such an apparatus with those of a hydrogen ther
mometer of large size, and at constant temperature, to have a
certain and sufficiently delicate method of determining any change
of temperature, even when very sudden and of Bhort duration.
In order to give an idea of the delicacy of the method, I may say
that, working at temperatures of about —200° C, 1 can measure
j^Jj^ of a volt, which represents a change of temperature of £
of a degree.
   Thanks to this method I have been able to messire the boiling

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.           491
point of oxygen, of air, of nitrogen, and of carbonic oxide under
the ordinary pressure. I obtain all these gases as statical liquids
under the atmospheric pressure in the following way. I lead the
gas, which is in a metal receiver already compressed to 100 atmo
spheres, into a glass tube closed at one end and immersed in liquid
oxygen. By expanding the oxygen I liquefy the compressed gas.
When the expansion is complete, I break the connexion of the
tube with the receiver, and bring it slowly in connexion with the
atmosphere. The liquefied gas is then under the atmospheric pres
sure, and boils at a temperature corresponding to this pressure.
   Oxygen.—Perfectly pure oxygen was used for these experiments.
It left no crystalline residue at the bottom of the tube. The
boiling-point is — 184° C.
   By combining this number with those previously published, we
get the whole curve of the liquefaction of oxygen. It is repre
sented by the following table :—

    Air.—The boiling-point of air is — 192°-2 C.
    Nitrogen obtained from air by copper, as in my former experi
 ments on its solidification, boiled at — 1930,1 C. It contained
 possibly traces of oxygen; for, supposing that the boiling-point of
 a gaseous mixture depends on its composition, we should expect
 — 194°-3 C. In any case it is seen that the constituents of air do
not separate when they are liquefied.
    Carbonic oxide.—The gas was prepared from oxalic acid, and
 contained 6 per cent, of carbonic acid. Its boiling-point was
 — 186° C. Assuming that the boiling-point of carbonic acid is
 —80° C, we have for pure carbonic oxide —193° C, that is the
 same temperature as for nitrogen.
    Evaporating these gases in vacuo, we sink to some degrees below
 -200° C.
    As regards hydrogen, which I have only hitherto been able to
 obtain in the condition of dynamic liquid, I have found a method,
 which I am about to try, to obtain it as statical liquid, using
 hydrogen itself as refrigerator.
    It follows from these researches that, of all gases, atmospheric
 air will be the refrigerator of the future.
    It need not be prepared, and it produces almost the greatest
 cold. To use it it is compressed to the pressure of liquefaction
 into metallic receivers. By letting it then pass into other re
 ceivers already cooled it will be liquefied, and can then be allowed

to flow out as is done with sulphurous acid. Science thus pos
sesses in this new refrigerator powerful means of investigation.
   The question, as a whole, has no technical difficulty to overcome ;
its realization from the present is only a question of the material
means at the disposal of the experimenter.—Comptes Rendus, April

  ON ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY AND THE SUN's ACTION AT A
                      DISTANCE. BY W. HOLTZ.
   The author refers to the papers on this subject by "W. Siemens
in which no mention is made of him, although he had in 1877
already expressed the opinion that the electricity of storms is per
haps to be attributed to an electrical action of the sun at a distance.
Incited by Siemens's memoir to further thought on the matter, he
is led to the following view, which materially differs from that of
Siemens.
   The sun, as Zbllner showed, could only act at a distance in case
one of the electricities developed in it were dissipated in space.
Assuming that the latter is the negative electricity, both the earth
and the moon will acquire it. The earth is thereby exposed to the
action of positive electricity at a distance from the sun, and the
negative action from the moon. In consequence of the former,
the surface of the earth must be constantly negatively electrified
during the day and positively electrified on the night side. The
action of the moon in reference to the side turned towards it and
away from it would be similar, not opposite ; so that at the time of
the new moon there would be an enfeeblement, and at the time of
full moon a strengthening of the inductive action. Aqueous
vapour, as it forms, takes with it the electricity of the earth, and
this is led to the upper regions of the air. If any horizontal layer
is electrified even to the smallest extent, the atmosphere in which
countless such layers are heaped up may show appreciable pheno
mena of tension. The greater violence of the storms in equatoreal
regions is due to the fact that the inductive action is here of course
the strongest, and also the evaporation most abundant. The aurora
boreales are to be explained by the fact that it is preferably the
poles at which opposite electricities meet.
   The difficulty of establishing this hypothesis by experimental
observation is increased by the fact that all the causes above men
tioned act simultaneously, as well as by the fact that, along with
this, secondary inductive actions of the already electrical masses of
air come into play. Only in specially constructed buildings and by
the aid of special apparatus would it be possible in the course of
time to decide this question. The author proposes therefore to
arrange electrical observatories (that is, special institutions for ob
serving the electricity of storms), which at the same time would
lead to a solution of the important astronomical question of the
sun's electrical action at a distance.—Beiblatter der Physik, vol. viii.

LVI. On the Magnitude of tlie Unipolar Induction of the
    Earth. By E. Edlund, Professor of Physics at the Royal
    Academy of Sciences of Sweden*.
                                    §1-
I ENDEAVOURED to prove in a previous memoir t that
       the unipolar induction produced by the rotation of the
earth upon its axis is the principal cause of the electricity of
the air, of thunder, and of the aurora borealis. If, now, for
a long time, these telluric phenomena have failed to find
their explanation in this induction, the reason undoubtedly
lies in the incorrect notions which have been formed as to its
real nature. The old theory of unipolar induction is, in
fact, in flagrant opposition to the principles of the mecha
nical theory of heat, and it was consequently impossible
that it could be true. It was necessary then, first of all, to
establish a new theory of unipolar induction, in which it was
of course necessary to show not only that it explained all the
known phenomena of unipolar induction in their details, but
that, on the other hand, it is in perfect harmony with all that
is known of the manifestations of electricity. This is what I
have endeavoured to do in the memoir referred to. The theory
once formulated, the application to the earth is easy. Pro
bably no one will doubt for the future that unipolar induction
plays an important part in the production of the electric phe
 nomena in question ; but since, as far as our knowledge of it
extends at present, the effects of this induction have shown

494              Prof. E. Edlund on the Magnitude of
themselves very feeble, the question arises whether unipolar
induction is sufficiently powerful to contribute in any essential
degree to the production of the phenomena mentioned.
    My previous memoir did not contain any quantitative cal
culations on this point. I was then more particularly occupied
with qualitative considerations. Nevertheless, since several
writers * who have noticed the previous memoir do not appear
to have appreciated at its full value the arguments which I
adduced against the correctness of the old theory of unipolar
induction, I think it desirable to reproduce briefly these argu
ments in a modified form.
                                   .§ 2>
     Let us suppose a vertical magnet, having its upper
extremity a south pole, capable of turning easily about its
 geometric axis, and that this magnet is concentrically sur
 rounded by a cylindrical metallic envelope also capable of
motion upon the same axis, but not in any manner electrically
 connected with the magnet. If a galvanometer be inserted
in a metallic circuit, one end of which presses against the
 cylinder, above one of the poles of the magnet, the south
 pole for example, and the other against the middle of the
 cylinder, the galvanometer indicates the production of a cur
 rent as soon as the cylinder is put into motion. If, when seen
 from above, this motion is in the same direction as the hands
 of a watch, the current passes through the galvanometer from
 the middle of the cylinder to its upper extremity.
     When the cylinder moves in the opposite direction, the
 current also passes in the opposite direction, and in both
 cases its intensity is proportional to the velocity of rotation.
 According to the old theory, induction in both cases takes
 place in the cylinder itself, whilst the electrodes act only as
 conductors. If, on the other hand, we turn the magnet with
 the same velocity and in the same direction as the cylinder—
 for example, by fixing the one to the other—induction, accord
 ing to the same theory, does not take place in the cylinder, as
  in the first case, but in the fixed conductor, and the cylinder
  acts only by conducting the current. In one word, according
  to the old theory induction can only take place in the portion
  of the conductor of which the position relative to the magnet
  is modified by the rotation, without taking into account
  whether or not this modification is produced at the expense
  of mechanical work. It is useless for our purpose to consider
  further the details of this theory.
     Let us now suppose that the galvanometer has been removed
    • Tidsskrift for populaere Fremstillinger af A'aturvtdetukaben, 2' livrai-
 son, p. 101, note.

               the Unipolar Induction of the Earth.            495
from the circuit and replaced by a galvanic battery of suffi
cient power. Experiment shows that the moment the circuit
is completed the cylinder commences to rotate in the one
direction or the other, according to the direction of the current.
In order to stop the cylinder it is necessary to oppose to the
motion a certain resistance proportional to the product of the
magnetic moment and the intensity of the current.
    The rotation of the cylinder is evidently produced by the
action of the magnet upon the current passing in the cylinder
itself. In order to make the cylinder rotate in a direction
opposite to that caused by the battery, a certain amount of
mechanical work must be done. The magnet, on the other
hand, remains unmoved : it may be turned in the one direc
tion or the other at pleasure without meeting any resistance
from the current. Hence the current through the circuit, no
matter how produced, is able to put the magnet into rotation.
    If we remove the battery and make the cylinder turn by
exerting mechanical energy, a current is produced by unipolar
induction, and the heat produced in the circuit is equivalent to
the work done in causing it to rotate. If the magnet is made
to turn at the same time as the cylinder, experiment shows
that there is no change produced in the intensity or direction
 of the induced current, and this rotation is effected without
consumption of any energy due to the current. But, in order
 that it may be possible to produce a current by the displace
 ment of a magnet in the neighbourhood of a closed circuit, or,
 vice versa, by motion of a closed circuit in the neighbourhood
 of a magnet, the mechanical theory of heat requires as a
 condition absolutely necessary that the induced current shall
 provoke a resistance to the displacement which requires the
 consumption of mechanical energy to overcome it. Now, in
 the case in question, it is possible to turn the magnet about its
 axis without consuming energy; and consequently this rotation
 is as incapable of producing rotation in the cylinder as in the
 fixed circuit. It is the energy consumed which gives birth to
 the current. The rotation of the magnet about its axis is
 therefore altogether indifferent to the induction, or, in other
 words, the magnet produces the same inductive effect whether
 it turns on its axis or not ; the induction depends only upon
 the mechanical energy consumed in the rotation of the cylinder.
 The chief error of the old theory consists, then, in the suppo
 sition that indnction may be produced in the present case by
 the alteration of the relative positions of the magnet and the
 circuit, even if there is no consumption of energy in this alter
 ation. Now, according to the mechanical theory of heat, such
 an admission is an absurdity, since it would follow that the
                                2L2

496            Prof. E. Edland on the Magnitude of
current and the heat produced by it would be created out of
nothing. The theory of unipolar induction which I have
proposed in the memoir referred to, on the other hand, is
perfectly consistent with the mechanical theory of heat : it is
based only upon known properties of electricity, and it explains
all the known phenomena of unipolar induction, qualitatively
as well as quantitatively.
    We arrive at the same result by the following reasoning.
At a given point in the magnetic field which surrounds a
magnet, a small freely suspended magnetized needle takes up
its position along the line of force which passes through the
point in question, and the force with which the magnet acts
upon the magnetized needle is proportional to the intensity of
the magnetic field at the same point. Let us now imagine a
vertical magnet and a small magnetic needle suspended near
it: the needle places itself along the line of force passing
through the point of suspension of the needle. If, now, the
magnet is made to rotate on its axis, we know by experiment
that the magnetized needle does not change its position, or,
in other words, that the lines of force are not changed in posi
tion by the fact that the magnet has been put into rotation on
its axis.
   The intensity with which the magnet acts upon the poles of
the magnetized needle is thus independent of the rotation.
The rotation, then, exerts no influence either upon the positions
of the lines of force or upon the intensity of the magnetic
field. If a conductor moves in a uniform magnetic field, such,
for example, as that produced by the horizontal component of
the earth's magnetism, it is generally admitted *, and experi
ment shows the justice of the conclusion, that the electro
magnetic force of induction produced in the conductor is
determined by its velocity, by the angle between the direc
tion of its motion and the lines of force, and finally by the
intensity of the magnetic field. The same rules will of course
hold good also in the case where the magnetic field is produced
by a magnet placed in the neighbourhood, although the inten
sity of this field diminishes then with the increasing distance
of the magnet, and the lines of force are not parallel, as was
the case in the terrestrial magnetic field, but converge towards
the poles of the magnet. If, consequently, a conductor is in
movement in the magnetic field surrounding a magnet, the
electromotive force produced in the conductor depends upon
its velocity, on the intensity of the magnetic field at the points
  * See, amongst others, Blavier, Des grandeurs ileclriques, p. 411
QVis, 1881).

                the Unipolar Induction of the Earth.          497
 passed over by the conductor, and the angle which the direc
 tion of movement makes with the lines of force. Now, as we
 have already said, the positions of the lines of force and the
 intensity of the magnetic field are independent of the circum
stance whether the magnet is, or is not, in rotation on its axis.
 It follows, therefore, that the electromotive force of induction
 produced in the moving conductor is altogether independent of
 the rotation of the magnet on its axis.
    After this preliminary exposition we may pass on to the
 principal subject of this memoir.
                                 §3.
    If we only wish to calculate roughly and in general terms
the effect of the unipolar induction of the earth, we may assume,
 for the reason considered in the memoir quoted, that the mag
 netic phenomena of our globe are produced by a magnet which
 traverses the centre of the earth at an angle of 17° with the
 axis of rotation. For the following argument we may suppose,
 for the sake of greater simplicity, without introducing any
 error affecting the result, that the magnet imagined is coinci
 dent with the axis of rotation. The magnitude of the uni
 polar inductive action of the earth upon a vertical prism of
 unit section and length Ar, situated at the equator in the
 neighbourhood of the terrestrial surface, may then be deter
 mined as follows :—
    Let r be the radius of the earth, 2p the distance between
 the poles of the terrestrial magnet, M the magnetic intensity
 of these poles, a> the velocity of rotation of a point upon the
 surface of the earth under the equator, and k a constant, we
obtain, by the method explained in the memoir quoted, as the
 value of the force x, by which unipolar induction tends to urge
 the aether (positive electricity) of the prism Ar in the direc
tion of the terrestrial radius,
                           ^UMpvAr                            (1)
In this equation k, M, and p are unknown quantities. If we
suppose that the radius of the equation is ^0(5 longer than that
of the axis, w will be equal to 466 metres per second, the time
of rotation of the earth being 23 hours 56 minutes.
   The horizontal component of terrestrial magnetism under
the equator exercises upon a magnetized needle capable of
motion in a horizontal plane, and forming the angle « with the
magnetic meridian, a directive force, which, when the poles
are distant 2\ from each other and have an intensity fi, may

                                §4.
     (a) A round steel magnet, 125 millim. long and 10 millira.
  in diameter, concentrically surrounded by a cylinder of brass,
 was fixed in a vertical position upon a rotatory apparatus, by
 means of which the magnet and cylinder could be put into
 uniform rotation about their common axis. Two brass springs
 press upon the cylinder, the one above one of the poles, the
 other midway between the poles. These springs were con
 nected with a galvanometer, the deviations of which were read
 by means of a telescope and scale in the usual manner. The
 radius p of the cylinder was 0 0175 metre, and /, or half the
 distance between the poles, was fixed at 0*062 metre. When
 the magnet with its envelope performed five complete revolu
 tions per second, a current was obtained which gave a constant
 deflection of 102-0 divisions of the scale. The resistance in
 the entire circuit was 21*4 ohms. With a resistance of
 100,000 ohms, one Daniell cell gave a deflection of 419-5
 divisions. Consequently the electromotive force of unipolar
 induction was    jj^f^ D=A, where D denotes, as usual, the
electromotive force of a Daniell cell.
    (b) In order to determine the ratio between the magnetic
moment of this same steel magnet and the horizontal compo
 nent of the earth's magnetism, the magnet was placed, as de
scribed above, at right angles to the magnetic meridian, so as
to produce a deflection in a small magnetized needle suspended
by a silk fibre, the deviation of this needle being read in the
ordinary way by means of reflection. The observations (which
 were made in the court of the buildings of the Academy of
 Sciences, to avoid all disturbing influences of magnetic sub
stances) gave the following results:—
          For a = 0-724 metre we obtain m = 2° 41' 5",
          For a= 1-046        „     „     u = 0°52'20";
whence we have in the first case ^^-' = 56-19 metres, and in
                                      a3
the second ^^=57-40 metres, giving a mean of 56-8 metres.
    The horizontal intensity of terrestrial magnetism at the
equator may be taken as twice that at Stockholm j and the
above calculation being for a point on the earth's surface at
the equator, this result must be multiplied by 2, giving 113-6
metres.
   According to the values given for I and p, ^         will be

 500          Prof. E. Edlund on the Magnitude of
 equal to 0-1326 metre, and r=2-5?r= 31-416. From these
 determinations we obtain, by means of equation (7),
                        x= 0-02325 D.Ar.
   The same determination was repeated on a subsequent occasion
 with another magnet, of the same length as the first, but having
 a diameter of 15 millim. The same cylinder was employed,
 and the velocity of rotation was the same as in the first expe
riment.    These determinations gave ^^=56*0. The current
due to unipolar induction gave a deviation of 87*0 scale-divi
sions; and one Daniell cell, with a resistance of 100,000 ohms
in the current, gave 357 scale-divisions. The numerical infe
riority of these deviations in proportion to those first obtained
is due to the smaller distance between the mirror and the scale.
                               5*2151
These observations give A= ^5 D. With these values of
the unknowns we obtain #=0-02297 D Ar; and, consequently,
for the mean of the two determinations
                        #=0-0231 D Ar.
 This equation refers to points of the terrestrial surface in the
 neighbourhood of the equator, where the vertical component of
 the force of unipolar induction of the earth is at its maximum,
and whence it diminishes as we approach the magnetic poles,
where its value becomes zero. The horizontal component of
 the same force, on the other hand, is zero at the equator, but
augments as we recede from the equator, acting, as I have ex
plained in the memoir cited, in the northern hemisphere towards
the north, and in the southern hemisphere towards the south.
Although r and <u of equation (1) are modified when we recede
from the terrestrial surface in a vertical direction, either above
or below the surface, we may consider these values as nearly
constant, if the distance does not exceed a few thousand metres.
For distances much greater from the surface of the earth, the
induction gradually approximates to zero, because the to of
the numerator only increases in proportion to r, whereas the
denominator increases nearly in the ratio of the cube of the
same quantity. For great distances below the surface of the
earth, equation (1) can scarcely be considered as applicable,
seeing there is room for doubt whether the electromagnetic
force there can be supposed to be approximated by a magnet
situated in the axis of the earth.
                               §5.
   In ench horizontal layer of air of 1 metre thickness (Ar = l)
there exists, as explained above, an electromotive force of the

              the Unipolar Induction of the Earth.          501
intensity O0231 D, a force causing positive electricity to move
upwards. The sum of electromotive forces in a layer 1000
metres in thickness is 23-l D, as against 231 D in a layer
of 10,000 metres. Now, if the air were an absolute non
conductor, the production of a difference in electric tension
between the air at the surface of the earth and the air of the
upper regions would be totally impossible. But this is only
the case when the air is perfectly dry. If, on the contrary, it
is saturated with moisture, it forms a comparatively good
conductor of electricity, as is proved, amongst other things,
by the impossibility of maintaining an electric charge, how
ever feeble, on a body surrounded by air of which the relative
humidity is considerable. Thus, when the air is moist, the
difference of tension may soon attain the limits mentioned ;
but when the electricity has reached a certain distance from
the equatoreal plane, it is conveyed, by the horizontal force of
unipolar induction, towards more elevated latitudes—towards
the north in the northern hemisphere, and towards the south
 in the southern hemisphere. The force of unipolar induction
 is always the same, where not subject to small variations
 produced by those of the terrestrial magnetism; but the con-
 ductibility of the air depends upon the changes which take
 place in its humidity. The result is a perpetual variation in
 the electric condition of the air. If the electric tension, at
 any point under a high latitude, becomes greater than that
 which, corresponds to the vertical component of unipolar induc
 tion at the same point (which is possible, since electricity
 is brought there from points situated in lower latitudes), part
 of the electricity will flow from the air to the earth. As is
 shown in the preceding memoir, this takes place especially
 in the zone surrounding the magnetic poles, where we meet
 with the aurora borealis. If the air is highly saturated with
 moisture, and if this saturation extends through some con
 siderable space, the air will become more highly electric than
 when the air is relatively dry. Consequently the air will
 generally be greater in winter than in summer, after cooling
 at night. The air usually attains its maximum relative
 humidity in the early hours of the day, diminishing in the
 morning as the air becomes heated, attaining its minimum
 soon after noon, and then increasing in intensity towards the
 evening. All this is in complete agreement with well-known
 observations. On the other hand, it appears more difficult to
 explain the minimum of aerial electricity which, according to
 certain observations, is produced in the course of the night ;
 at least if we do not admit that, in those regions where this
 minimum has been observed, local causes have produced a

 502               Prof. E. Edlund on the Magnitude oj
 disturbing effect. It is much to be regretted that observa
 tions upon the electricity of the air are two few and imperfect
 to permit of a more detailed comparison between theory and
 experiment.
     The quantity of electricity which, in accordance with the
  preceding, should exist in the earth's atmosphere in conse
  quence of the unipolar induction of the earth is sufficient, in
  my opinion, to account for the indications of the electric
  condition of the air, given under normal conditions by the
  instruments employed for this purpose. It is true that the
  electric tension of the lower layers of the air is not great
 under normal conditions ; but it increases with the height
 above the earth's surface, so that the quantity of electricity
 contained in the atmosphere is considerable in all cases. It
 is by the induction of the atmospheric electricity that the
  instruments are affected, and not, or only to a trifling extent,
 by direct communication with the layers of air in immediate
 contact. The magnitude of the electric tension shown by the
 instruments does not depend, then, or at least only to a very
 small extent, upon the electric tension of the layers of air
 close to them. The electric tension indicated by the instru
 ments may therefore be many times greater than that of the
 layers of air in question.
                                      §6.
    The origin of the large quantities of electricity which the
 atmosphere appears to contain at times of storm may also be
 explained without difficulty by the unipolar induction of the
 earth. Although in a lightning-flash the electricity possesses
 an enormously high tension, it is nevertheless easy to show that
 the quantity of electricity which takes part in it may be less
 than there is a disposition to admit in certain quarters*.
    A galvanometer with mirror-attachment, especially con
 structed for electric discharges, was combined with a Holtz's
 electrophorus, of which the two jars had each an exterior
 and interior covering of 79 square centimetres. With one
 rotation per second, the galvanometer indicated a mean devia
tion of 7 scale-divisions. Four electric sparks of a length
of 1 centimetre passed between the terminals per second.
The galvanometer being then connected with the electrodes

berichte der Akad. der Wissensch. zu Berlin, May 1883, p. 638 ; Phil.
Mag. xvi. p. 173):—''The sudden appearance of such enormous quantities
of electricitv, as seen in tropical storms for example, negatives the hypo
thesis that it can have been present in the feeble electric charge of the
comparatively small quantity of air which carries the thunder-cloud.
There must be more important sources from which they are derived."

                 the Unipolar Induction of the Earth.             503
  of one cell of Daniell's battery, and the resistance of the
   circuit increased to 5000 ohms, by insertion of a rheostat
  we obtain a deviation of 37 scale-divisions. Thus in the last
   case the deflection would have been 7 scale-divisions if the
  resistance of the circuit had amounted to 22857 ohms. Now
  if we estimate the electromotive force of one Daniell cell at
   1*079 volt, it follows that the quantity of electricity dis
  charged in each of these sparks of 1 centimetre long was not
  greater than O'OOOOllS coulombs. If it were possible to put
  so much as one coulomb into the jars in question, and if we
  suppose also that the length of the spark increased in propor
  tion to the electric density, we should obtain, with the quantity
  of electricity mentioned, a spark about 850 metres long. It
  would in fact be still longer, for the known reason that the
  distance of discharge for large quantities of electricity increases
  more rapidly than the tension. Consequently, if the electric
  tension is very great, it is possible to have a great distance of
  discharge, but a relatively small quantity of electricity, for
  one coulomb only contains in reality the quantity of electricity
  furnished by 1 volt in 1 second, when the resistance of the
  circuit is 1 ohm.
      Between the earth and the clouds, whose height we may
  here estimate at 1000 metres, there exists, in consequence of
  the earth's unipolar induction, an electromotive force equal
  to that of 23 Daniell cells. If the moisture of the air is
  great, and its electrical resistance consequently comparatively
  small, this electromotive force acting upon a surface of vast
  extent, and during a time counted by hours instead of seconds,
  ought to be sufficiently powerful to conduct from the earth
. to the region of the clouds a quantity of electricity corre
  sponding to a considerable number of coulombs.
     But this electricity is only of small density. We may
  observe, on the other hand, that dry air is almost altogether
  non-conducting, and that it is the moisture which it contains
  which renders it conducting. Let us suppose now that we
  have, in the regions of the clouds, a volume of air nearly
  saturated with moisture, and containing a quantity of elec
  tricity represented by a number of coulombs, greater or less.
  If this volume of air becomes cooled in any way, its aqueous
  vapour will liquefy in greater or less quantity. When, for ex
 ample, the temperature of the air reaches 20°, the vapour of
  water with which the air is saturated occupies a volume 57000
  times greater than thatof the water which furnished the vapour.
  If the temperature is only 10°, the volume of the vapour is
  105,000 times greater than that of the corresponding quantity
  of water. When liquefaction takes place the electricity is

504            Prof. E. Edlund on the Magnitude of
forced to follow the water, since this is the sole medium of
conduction. The passage from vapour to liquid water con
sequently produces an enormous condensation of the electricity
contained in the water.
    We may remark, further, that the electricity is not distributed
in a uniform manner in the liquefied water, but that it is con
tained upon the surface of the drops formed, whence it follows
that its density may become much greater than the figures
given by way of example. The greater the number of drops
formed in the liquefaction of the vapour, the greater is also
the sum of the surfaces of these drops. When, further, a
great number of small drops unite to form a small number
of large drops, this change produces a condensation of the
electricity which they contain, the total surface of the drops
being diminished by the union. If, now, the air saturated
with moisture is considerably extended, and a small quantity
condenses only slowly at a certain point, the electricity which,
condenses there is conducted without producing sensible sparks
to other parts of the saturated layer. When, on the contrary,
the saturated mass is divided from other masses of like nature
 by layers of drier air, and a rapid liquefaction of the vapour of
 water takes place, the high electric tension resulting from the
 liquefaction cannot be maintained, and the electricity passes
 by disruptive discharge to the neighbouring clouds, or to the
 earth when the tension is less. Hence, according to this view,
 intense and violent liquefaction of the aqueous vapour of theatmo-
 sphere is the principal cause of the enormous electric tension
 occurring in the disruptive discharges of thunder-storms. In
 most cases this liquefaction is accompanied by a violent fall
 of rain or hail ; but we may nevertheless suppose that under
 certain conditions the condensation induces only the formation
  of clouds, accompanied by electric discharges without the fall
 of water. The liquefaction of the vapour of water does not
 increase in any way the quantity of electricity existing in the
 air, but increases its tension in a high degree*.
    * Kantz has already admitted that the liquefaction of the vapour of
 water is necessary to the production of thunder-storms; he attributed the
 production of electricity principally to evaporation taking place upon the
 earth's surface, as well as to the processes of vegetation and combustion
 (vide Kantz, Lehrbunh der Meteorologie, p. 468, Halle, 1832 ; and
  Vorlesungen iiber Mettorologie, pp. 3U6 and 427, Halle, 1840). At
 this time the impossibility of the atmospheric electricity originating
 under these circumstances had not been demonstrated. Sir John Herschel,
 following Kantz, assumed evaporation as the principal cause of the elec
 tricity of the air. He saw also in the condensation of aqueous vapour
 the cause of the high electric tension in times of storms. Compare Her-
 schel's 'Meteorology' (Edinburgh, 1862), p. 122.

               the Unipolar Induction of the Earth.                   505
   It is probable that the electric tension is modified to a
certain extent by the influence of the clouds near. In general
the upper clouds possess, as explained above, a higher electric
tension than the lowernebulous layers, and the free positive elec
tricity contained in the last is increased by this tension. When,
at the moment of liquefaction of the aqueous vapour, the free
positive electricity of these clouds is disruptively discharged,
the negative electricity produced by the induction of the upper
clouds follows the drops of water to the earth, and these in
consequence frequently prove to be charged with negative
electricity. The intimate connexion between the condensa
tion of aqueous vapour and the disruptive discharge in all
cases is shown by an observation which we have repeatedly
had occasion to make, and which without doubt is known to
most people*. When a thunderstorm bursts in the imme
diate neighbourhood of the place where one happens to be,
especially if vertically above one's head, we see first the flash,
then immediately after hear the thunder. A few seconds later
the fall of rain or hail commences, of longer or shorter duration
according to circumstances. If it has already commenced to
rain or to hail when the flash takes place, the fall generally
becomes much heavier a few seconds later. The same thing
is repeated many times during the storm. Nevertheless it
happens sometimes that one observes no sudden increase in
the fall of rain or hail, although the discharge has taken place
close at hand. These cases seem to show that the tension neces
sary for the electric discharge may arise either under the influ
ence of two electrified clouds, or from an actual liquefaction of
aqueous vapour, although this liquefaction may not have pro
ceeded far enough to produce any appreciable increase of rain
or hail. This theoretical explanation is in complete accord
with observation ; the liquefaction of aqueous vapour is the
first operation which takes place, and with it commences the
fall of atmospheric water as rain or hail. This liquefaction
brings about the condensation of electricity and with it occurs
 disruptive discharges. The noise produced by the discharge
 requires a certain length of time to reach the surface of the
 earth, but the fall of atmospheric water requires a still longer
 time, and hence these three phenomena are observed in the
order indicated.
    The following observation of Armstrong's t may perhaps
be considered as an experimental proof that the liquefac
 tion of water greatly increases electric tension. In the well-
known hydroelectric machine invented by him, the vapour of

 506    Magnitude of the Unipolar Induction of tlie Earth.
 water which issues mixed with a certain quantity of lique
 fied water becomes electro-positive under ordinary conditions.
 Armstrong mentions, in the account which he gives of his
 experiments, that if we place the metallic points intended to
 collect the electricity near the orifice of issue, we obtain a
 large quantity of electricity, but of a very small tension. If,
 on the other hand, we put the points three or four feet off
 from the orifice, the quantity of electricity is smaller, but the
 tension, by way of compensation, is now much greater than
 at the shorter distance. Armstrong does not point out the
cause of this phenomenon, but it is easy to discover it, by
applying to the case the principles which have been explained.
 In the immediate neighbourhood of the orifice of issue, the
vapour contains an insignificant quantity of liquefied water ;
at a greater distance, on the other hand, a considerable pro
portion of the aqueous vapour has become liquefied in conse
quence of the cooling which occurs during the passage ; it
follows hence that the electricity conveyed by the vapour has
attained a higher tension, although a portion has been lost
 during transport.
   Another well-known circumstance favours intimate con
nexion between the liquefaction of aqueous vapour and a great
increase in the electric tension of the air, viz. that we never have
thunder in those regions of the earth's surface where no fall
of atmospheric water occurs, nor formation of clouds. Such
is, for example, the case in Peru, in the Sahara, and in the
deserts of Asia. In general, thunderstorms are more frequent
after midday and in the evening.
   The ascending currents, which occur especially during the
morning, carry a considerable quantity of aqueous vapour into
the higher regions of the atmosphere ; there this vapour
quickly becomes cooled in consequence of the low temperature
which exists there, and forms cumuli, which resolve themselves
into rain or hail if the liquefaction continues, and are distin
guished by their high electric tension. If the terrestrial sur
face is strongly heated by the solar rays, the ascending currents
of air become greater, and carry with them a larger quantity
of moisture. It will be understood without trouble that these
currents facilitate the transport of electricity into the higher
regions. A thunderstorm which occurs during the evening
is therefore often preceded by a hot morning, and the air is
saturated with moisture which renders it oppressive and suf
focating. The rapid liquefaction of the vapour, attended by
a heavy fall of atmospheric water in the form of rain or hail, is
produced also in cyclones, whence it follows that these pheno
mena are also accompanied by thunder.

            LVIL On a Modified Resistance-Balance.
       By Professor Silvanus P. Thompson, B.A., D.ScS
                               [Plate XVI.J
SEVERAL forms of Resistance-Balance modified for the
        purpose of facilitating the accurate measurement of small
resistances or small differences of resistance are known. The
modification due to Prof. Fleeming Jenkinf, and the Double-
bridge of Sir W. Thomson J are perhaps the earliest and
least-known of these. KirchhofFs arrangement, as further
modified by Matthiessen, is well known under the name
of the " divided-metre " bridge. The method of using this
form of balance suggested by Professor G. Carey Foster §, in
which the difference between two nearly equal resistances is
expressed directly in terms of a length of a graduated wire
whose resistance is very accurately known, is so extremely
reliable, that probably no one who once adopts this method of
testing resistances will ever go back to the cruder and less
accurate methods. The essence of the method lies in arranging
 the coil whose resistance is to be measured and the standard
 coil to which it approximates in series with the graduated
wire, in such a manner that the positions of the two coils can
be interchanged. The points of the wire at which the poten
 tial is the mean between the potentials at the two ends of
 the series having been determined, both before and after the
 interchange, the resistance of the length between these two
 points is the desired difference. A special modification of
 the balance for facilitating Foster's method was described to
 the Physical Society in Dec. 1879 by Dr. J. A. Fleming ||;
 and has been since then systematically used in the Cavendish
 Laboratory by the Committee on Electrical Standards for
 the comparison of standard coils. Although extremely con
 venient, Dr. Fleming's Balance appears to me to be open
 to several objections. In the first place, the interchange of
 the two coils, though much more easily accomplished than in
 the older divided-metre form, is effected by lifting the termi
 nals of each coil out of one of two pairs of mercury-cups, and
 removing them to the other pair. This operation is not

arrangement, though I have heard no complaint of its
practical efficiency, is open to two objections. It must be
much more difficult to lay the wire with an even stress at all
points than is the case with a straight wire stretched between
two points. The range of resistances measurable by this
bridge is limited to something less than the actual resistance
of the graduated wire. Lastly, a circular scale having about
300° divided into 1000 parts is not so easily obtained as a
straight metre-scale.
    I have therefore designed a form of resistance-balance
which meets the desiderata. It consists of two parts—a
divided wire or rheocord, and an arrangement of mercury-
cups, connecting-pieces, and terminals to be attached at the
 back of the rheocord part. The figure 1, Plate XVI., shows
the general arrangement of these two parts ; the connexions
between the two parts being made by strips of copper 3 millim.
thick, secured under clamping-screws. X is the coil whose
resistance is to be measured, and S the standard coil. The
terminals of each of these coils dip into two large mercury-
cups turned in solid copper ; these are shown half size in fig.
2, and are marked m n and ml nf respectively. Between
these cups lie four parallel bars of solid copper a a', bb1, c<fy
and dd', the ends of which terminate also in mercury-cups.
The bars a a' and b If communicate by stout copper con
nexions with the two ends of the rheocord part. The other
two bars communicate with the battery terminals and with
the terminals for the two balanced coils A and B. In all
accurate tests these coils should be approximately equal to
the X or S, and should be very nearly equal to one another.
 As they are not required to be interchanged, they are simply
 clamped with copper connexions under flat-headed terminal
 screws. Short stout pieces of copper, amalgamated at the
 ends, serve to connect the mercury-cups as shown in fig.
 1, m being connected with a, n with d, m! with b', and n'
 with d . The connexions being thus made, an observation
 is taken, and the distance x along the scale of the point of
 contact with the galvanometer-circuit is recorded. Then the
 connexions are altered, in being placed in communication
 with b, n with c, m! with a', and n' with d'. This has the

                   Modified Resistance-Balance.               509
same effect as if X and S were bodily interchanged ; and
without lifting either of those coils as in Fleming's instrument.
Balance having been once more obtained, and a new reading
a/ of the scale having been taken, the length x—af, multiplied
by the resistance per centim. of the divided wire, is equal to
the actual difference between X and S.
   The switch-board part is made of such dimensions that it
can be attached on to any of the ordinary pattern of metre-
bridges. The ordinary metre-balance is, however, limited in
its application, so far as Foster's method of comparison is
concerned, to the comparison of resistances which do not
differ by a greater amount from one another than the actual
resistance of the wire of the rheocord part. To facilitate
the comparison of coils of high resistance whose resistances
differ by several ohms, I have adopted the following arrange
ment of the rheocord part. Two wires are selected, each
two metres long, one having a resistance of about a quarter
of an ohm, the other from eight to ten ohms. They are
stretched parallel upon a board 213 centim. in length,
provided with a two-metre scale, which should be divided
into millimetres. Either of these wires can be used at will,
connexion being made to either at one end of the bridge by
a stout copper link dipping into mercury-cups drilled in the
wood and lined with copper. Stout copper rods of about 1
square centim. section lead from the ends of the stretched
wires to the screws, by which the switch-board part is con
nected with the rheocord part. The galvanometer-contact
is made by means of a sliding key shown separately in fig. 3,
which is provided with a vernier, and which by a simple
arrangement can be set so as to make the contact with either
the thick or the thin wire, as may be desired. In the instru
ment exhibited to the Society the stout wire is of german-
silver 2*1 millim. in diameter, and of 0'2385 ohms resistance.
The thin wire is of silver-platinum alloy; its diameter is 0 33
millim., and its resistance 8*21 ohms. The form of slider
adopted is a much more well-conditioned arrangement than
the usual heavy medal sliding key standing on three legs,
and is more convenient in practice. The greater length of
rheocord, though it renders the instrument less portable,
increases the range of the instrument without affecting its
sensitiveness.

LVIII. On the Failure of the Attempt to deduce Inductive Prin
   ciples from the Mathematical Theory of Probabilities. By
   Sophie Bbyaot, B.Sc*
                                I.
THE assumption, originally made by mathematicians, and
       used to furnish a basis of inductive inference, namely
that the various probabilities which may be assigned to an
event are themselves equally probable, was first definitely
called in question by the late Dr. Boole, who proposed the
alternative assumption that all constitutions of the Universe
are, to our ignorance, equally probable. In other words, if
we take up the position of total ignorance respecting the
principles on which the Universe is ordered, any one order of
events is as probable as any other. This principle of the equal
probability of all arrangements in time, prior to the formula
tion of laws declaring some arrangements to be and others not
to be, as a matter of fact, commends itself to common sense as
the faithful expression of that impartial ignorance from which
it is always trying to escape. This impartial ignorance, which
is the fundamental pre-supposition in all applications of the
Mathematical Theory of Probability, was supposed, however,
before Boole's time, and to a large extent is supposed still, to
be expressed in the older assumption of Quetelet and Laplace ;
and, though an appeal to common sense would probably decide
in favour of Boole's view at once, it may be worth while to
establish the plea for rejection of the alternative assumption
more firmly, on the ground of certain intrinsic inconsistencies
which it can be shown to involve. This step I propose to take,
as preliminary to a deduction of various consequences from
Boole's hypothesis (or rather, as I prefer to call it, hypothetical
expression of our fundamental pre-supposition), which involve
a generalization of the consequence that Boole himself deduced,
and which illustrate in detail the same logical conclusion.
   The only proof of which hypothetical expressions of this
kind are susceptible is proof of their perfect internal consist
ency. They can, therefore, be completely established only by
a complete development of results which prove to be mutually
consistent. The development of Boole's hypothesis which
will presently follow constitutes, it is believed, a partial proof
of this internal consistency. Complete proof is difficult to
obtain; but complete disproof is easy. A single case of incon
sistency is all that we require. Such inconsistency the older
                   • Communicated by the Author.

            On the Mathematical Tlieory of Probabilities.              511
  hypothesis can be shown to involve; and its consequent rejec
 tion clears the way, at least, for the establishment of the
 newer mode of stating the case.
     In a volume recently published of ' Studies in Logic,' Mr.
  C. S. Peirce raises this question of inconsistency, and shows
 in a particular case that, if all frequencies of the event Y are
  equally probable, the frequencies of the event which consists in
 a Y following a Y or an N following an N are not equally
  probable. The hypothesis is thus shown to be inconsistent,
  since it cannot simultaneously be applied to these two unknown
 events of Y and Y repeated. The demonstration of inconsist
 ency which follows is suggested by Mr. Peirce's, but differs
  from his in its generality both of method and result, and also,
  I venture to think, in the strictness with which it keeps
  within the limits of the hypothesis in question. Mr. Peirce,
  it appears to me, uses Boole's conception in proving the incon
  sistency of the rival conception. While following his therefore
 in essentials, my proof differs altogether in details.
     Let x denote the occurrence of an event,
          x „         its non-occurrence ;
 and, for brevity, let
          x* denote the occurrence of the event in n cases out of
             n possible cases,
          xn~xx denote the occurrence of the event in n— 1 cases
             out of n cases,
          «"_si2 denote the occurrence of the event in n— 2 cases
             out of n cases,
and so on.
     It is required to investigate the probabilities of the various
 relative frequencies of the event which consists in x following
 x, or x x, i. e. the probabilities of all the conceivable proba
 bilities of this event.
     If xn occurs, xx occurs n — 1 times out of n — 1.
     If xn~1 x occurs, two cases have to be considered. Either
sc is last in the series, or it intervenes between two x's. In the
 first case x x occurs n — 2 times; in the second case it occurs
 n — 3 times. Now our assumption gives us no clue to de
termining the respective probabilities of these two cases. A
new assumption seems necessary, and the suggestion of Boole's
would, I think, naturally arise here*. We resist the sugges
tion, however, and, keeping strictly within the prescribed
limits, are driven upon indeterminateness. Call the proba
bility that x is last in the series X1; and the probability that x
    • By its implicit use Mr. Peirce arrives at a determinate instead of an
indeterminate result.
                                  2M2

512 Mrs. S. Br}rant on the Deduction of Inductive Principles
is not last x2. X1+\2 = l, and the X's, otherwise, are indeter
minate. Hence if a"-1 x occurs,
           (1) xx occurs n— 2 times withprob. \1;
           (2)      „     n— 3 times with prob. Xj.
   Also if a-"-3? occurs, xx may come last in the series, in
which case x x occurs n— 3 times ; or it may come any
where else, or only one *• come at the end, in both which
cases x x occurs n — 4 times ; or the two x's may occur sepa
rately and neither at the end, in which case xx occurs n— 5
times. Let the probabilities of these three cases be        n^, /*a
respectively, where /*i + /x2 +/*3= 1. Then, if x"~2 x2 occurs,
           (1) xx occurs n — 3 times with prob.
           (2)        „     n-4       „       „      fi.3,
           (3)        „     n-5       „       „      fi3.
   The other cases can similarly be analysed, but it is Dot
necessary for our purpose to go further.
   Now, by hypothesis, x*, x"~* x, &c. are all equally probable.
Let p = their probability. Then it follows at once from the
above that
                   p — prob. that xx occurs n—l times,
                \P=        „       „          n—2 „
         (pi + \i)p=       „       „    „     n-3 „
         (vi + fh)p=       „       „    „     n-4 „
                Ac. = &c.
   With the exception of the first, these are all indeterminate,
and they cannot be equal unless \1=fi1=y1 = ..,= l) a sup
position which is plainly inadmissible, as perfectly arbitrary.
The hypothesis is therefore, in the first place, inadequate, and,
in the second place, inconsistent as applied to all events indif
ferently. It must therefore be rejected.
                                 II.
   Accepting, then, Boole's hypothesis, the question arises—
How does our mere knowledge of the past enable us to deter
mine our expectancy of the future? and, further, what warrant
in general does the known occurrence of an event give us for
inferring its occurrence in cases unknown? From the hypo
thesis of equally probable probabilities, it was, as is well
known, inferred that if an event has occurred m times in suc
cession, the probability of its occurrence the (m + l)th time is
                             m+l
                             771 + 2*

         from the Mathematical Tlieory of Probabilities.         513
Logicians naturally have taken exception to this result; and
Boole has deduced from his alternative hypothesis the very
different result that the probability is \, which, as the expres
sion of mere indifferent ignorance, brings us back to our
original position. I have arrived at the same conclusion by
a process of reasoning which is longer, but by which I ob
tain an answer to the more general question, i. e. if an event
has occurred n — r times out of n times, what is the probability
(1) that it has occurred or will occur 0, 1, 2 ... r times of the
remaining r times, the order of these occasions relatively to the
n — r times being quite indeterminate? and (2) that it will occur
0, 1, 2 . . . r of the remaining r times, these being after the n —r
times ? It is the second question that has special interest for
the problem of inductive logic, as bearing directly on the
inquiry—How does our knowledge of the past enable us to
have a knowledge of the future? But the first question is its
necessary complement in the inductive inquiry.
   Let 1 denote the Universe in Time ;
        x denote a time of an event, i. e. its occurrence ;
        x denote a time of its non-occurrence ;
        n denote total number of times in the Universe.
Then the Universe may be considered as developed into a
series of x and x with n terms, as, for instance,
                        x + x + x + x+x + ... ;
or, for brevity, we may prefer the form
                             x xx xx ... ;
it being possible that any place in the series may be occupied
either by x or x. Now the hypothesis is, that any series of x
 and x is as probable as any other. All series in which x
 occurs the same number of times are of the same type.
    To determine the number ofpossible constitutions, the number
 of types, and the number of each type.
   (1) Every constituent may be an x;
                           No. of ways = 1.
   (2) n— 1 constituents may be x, and 1 constituents;
                           No. of ways = n.
   (3) n— 2 const, may be x, and 2 constituents x;

    (r) n—r const, may be x, and r constituents x ;
                    No. of ways = —==— ,
    (n) 0 const, may be x, and n constituents x ;
                          No. of ways = 1.
Thus, the number of possible constitutions
                            K — 1)' + ... + n + l, = 2-;
               = ,l + n+ n.(n                        .
the number of types = the number of terms in this expansion
                             = n + l;
the numbers of each type = the respective terms
        = coefficient of x*~T 7if in the expansion of {x + x)'.
All this may be expressed as follows:—
       Sum of possible universes =S(1) = (jt + 5)
            =xn + nx'-,x+7l^^x'-»x* + ... + xn.
    Or thus, reading columns vertically and adding, with        the
 understanding that 1 denotes presence of x, 0 its absence,     and
 tiftff &c. successive times in the Time- Universe:—
              1010101010101010...                                0
              1 1 00 1 1 00 1 1 00 1 1 00...                     0

              111111111111                           00000000
    Now, if all constitutions of the Universe are equally pro
 bable, the probability of the occurrence of any one type is the
 frequency of its occurrence in the above divided by 2"; and
 the various probabilities thus obtained are those which mathe
 maticians have assumed to be equal. We may denote each
 type as of the form a?* xn~m, the relative frequency of the
 event x in such a universe being —, and the relative frequency
of that type being                   .  We have, then,

    Popularly stated, the conclusion is that, so far as considera
tions of mere probability go, an event being known to have
happened n—r times, it is more probable than not that it has
not happened in any of the remaining r times, and less pro
bable that it has happened a greater number of times than a
less. Also, since the p's decrease with the increase of r, it
follows, if n be taken as constant, that the more the event is
known to have happened the less likely is its occurrence in the

The ratio is that of the terms in the expansion of (1 + l)r.
   Hence it is clear that, by the Theory of Probability, the
occurrence of an event in the past tells us absolutely nothing
as to its occurrence in the future. Also the larger the number
of times we include in our expectation, the less should be
our expectancy.
   Our ignorance of the future is left therefore just what it was
so far as any mere counting of cases in the past is concerned.
The determination to be taught by facts, and facts only, to
bring no preconceptions for the interpretation of those facte,
cuts us off from all means of making advance to the new facts
which are our quest. Presuppositions of knowledge, not of
ignorance, are what we want. The latter is perfectly expressed
in the statement that all constitutions of the Universe are
equally possible. The principles of Inductive Science are the
former. These assert that, so far from all constitutions of
the Universe being equally possible, one only is possible and
also necessary. Hence our business in observing Nature is
 not the calculation of chances but the investigation of signs
 of order, the knowledge of which shall enable us to infer
 from them that one possible and necessary order of events.
     LIX. On the Theory of the Transmission of Power by
   Dynamo-electrical Machines. By Prof. R. Clausius*.
       § 1. Equations which hold for individual Machines.
IN a paper recently publishedf I deduced two equations
      which serve to determine the work of the ponderomotive
and of the electromotive force for a dynamo-electrical machine
in operation, and which are as follows:—
   In this T is the work of the ponderomotive force in unit of

time, and E the electromotive force ; i and v represent the
current -strength and the number of turns, while a, b,p, q, I,
p, <r, and X are constants, of which those denoted by Greek
letters, and especially the two last, are small as compared with
the rest. If the two members in the first round bracket be
reduced to a common denominator, and the sign e be then
introduced with the signification
                             ««* + |>                          (1)
the equations assume the following still simpler form :—
   These equations may be used in dealing with the trans
mission of force ; that is, in treating the case in which two
dynamo machines are in conducting communication, and one
of them is driven by any mechanical motor, while the other is
Bet in motion by the electrical current in the common con
ductor, and can thus do mechanical work. In order to make
the application of the equations to this case as convenient as
possible, it is advisable to introduce a little simplification in
reference to the sign.
   The second machine, which is set in motion by the current,
rotates in the opposite direction to that which produces the
current ; and hence, if we wish to express this also in the
equation, we must assign a negative value v for the second
machine. Further, the ponderomotive force is overcome in
the motion of the first machine, while the second is set in
motion by the ponderomotive force ; hence if this also is to
be expressed, we must represent the work T in the first
machine by a negative magnitude, as has been done in the
above equations ; and in the second machine by a positive
magnitude. Finally, the induced electromotive forces in the
two machines are in opposite directions, and for a complete
determination they also must be represented by positive and
negative magnitudes.
   But it would be inconvenient in practice to speak always
of negative velocities of rotation in regard to one machine ;
and instead of this it is usual to express the velocities of rota
tion in both machines simply by the number of turns, and
therefore by absolute magnitudes, and to regard it as a matter
of course that the rotations are in opposite directions. It is

 520         Prof. E. Ckusius on the Transmission of
 also looked on as a matter of course that work is expended in
 one machine and is gained in the other, and that the electro
 motive forces induced in them are in opposite directions ; and
 accordingly, in determining the values of the work and the
 electromotive forces, we are content with giving their absolute
 values. We shall follow this custom, and in accordance there
 with shall represent by vx and i>3 the two numbers of turns
 without reference to the directions of rotations, by Tj and T,
 the absolute values of the work, and by Et and E2 the absolute
values of the electromotive forces.
    The equations referring to the first machine are then as
follows :—
     i-k^RJ^+G^Vra^^ • <IIL>
     ^h^^^-^-i'+^M*-                                 ¦   -<IV->
    In order to form the corresponding equations for the second
machine, a remark must be made as to the sign of the mem
bers which have v2 as factor, and of the member pv. Dis
regarding for the present the member pv, the following holds
for the other members. If the signs of T and E are to be
 determined, then, in order to pass from the equations refer
 ring to the first machine to those which hold for the second
machine, we must replace t\ by — 1>3. The members of the
first order would thereby change their sign, while those of
the second order would retain theirs unaltered. If, on the
contrary, the absolute values only of T and E are to be
determined, then in those cases in which the previous method
would have given negative values of T and E, we must change
all signs on the right hand. The consequence of this would be
that, in the equations which refer to the second machine, the
members of the first order acquire the same sign as in the
equations referring to the first machine, while those of the
second degree acquire the opposite sign. As to the member
pv, which we have hitherto disregarded, the electromotive
force represented by the product pvi acts always in that direc
tion which is opposed to the direction of the current t : hence
in the first machine, in which the whole induced electromotive
force has the direction of the current i, it must diminish its
absolute value, which agrees with the minus sign prefixed to
pv (IV.) ; in the second machine, on the contrary, in which
the whole electromotive force is opposed to the current t, the
electromotive force represented by that product must increase
the absolute value, and hence the member pv must have the

              Power by Dynamo-electrical Machines.           521
plus sign. Accordingly the equations assume the following
form for the second machine:—
    E2=[(^W)^+^+(ff+^)1^-                              • • (VL)
   In forming these equations it is presupposed that the second
machine is similar to the first. If the second machine is dif
ferent from the first, the constants occurring in the equations,
and which depend on the nature of the machine, would have
different values from those which hold for the first machine ;
and this would have somehow to be indicated, for instance by
prefixing indices to letters.
   The four equations (III.), (IV.), (V.), (VI.) can now be
used to make the calculations for the joint action of the two
machines.
           § 2. Determination of the Current-strength.
   If the two machines are connected, as in the transmission
of force, by conductors which contain no further electromotive
force, the effective electromotive force in the whole circuit is
represented by the difference Ei— E2. Hence, if II is the
resistance of the whole circuit, we may write
                             Ri=E!-E2                        (2)
If we replace E1 and E2 in this, by their values from (IV.)
and (VL), we get
        Ui= [(a+iX6 + i)^-^-P^ + ^
                                                +          • (3)
which equation is to be used for determining i.
   As the first directly obvious solution we get
                                t=0                          (4)
After this has been determined we may divide the equation
by i, and after removing the members which have no denomi
nator to the left hand, we get the following equation:—
      ~R + p(vi + v2) + <7(v] + vl)
   This equation we imagine divided by the magnitude on

  522        Prof. R. Clausins on the Transmission of
  the left hand, and introduce then the following abbreviated
  signs :—
                               «i— vt
               u=
                    R + p{?i + vt) + <r{v\ + vl) '
                                                                   (6)
              TT„                 +
  The equation then becomes
  If this equation be further multiplied by (a + i)(b + i), and
 then the members arranged according to powers of i, we
 arrive at the quadratic equation
          ^-{pu—\U— a— b)i— epu + \aV + ab=0 ; . (8)
 by solving which we obtain
         i'=i(p«—XU— a— b)
           ±^\/(j}u-X\J-a-by + Aepu-A\al]—4ab. . (9)
    Of the two signs before the root we must choose the upper
 one, in accordance with my previous remark in reference to
 the corresponding equation ; and by using this sign we must
 make the limitation that the expression only holds for such
 values of w as are great enough to make it positive. For
 small values of u, below a certain limit, which make this ex
 pression negative, the value null for i, given in (4), must be
 taken to hold. If this is to be treated in all strictness we
 should have, in this interval, not the exact value null, but a very
 small value of i, depending on the remanent magnetism in the
 fixed electromagnet of the first machine. But as this interval
 only comprises those velocities of the first machine which
 occur during the starting, and before the second machine is in
 motion, the very small values of t within it are of small import
 ance, and we need only direct our attention to the values which
hold for greater velocities, and are defined by equation (9).
    This equation may be put in a somewhat simpler form. If
for the sake of shortness we put

   These equations show in a comprehensive manner how the
magnitudes Tj and T2 depend on the velocities of rotation,
and on the current-strength also affected by these velocities,
and in what relations they stand to each other. The equations
can therefore be used to draw conclusions how the working of
the machine is to be arranged, so as to obtain the most favour
able action under given conditions.
    In this latter respect a conclusion is sometimes adduced,
which in the year 1840 M. H. Jacobi drew as to the action
of an older form of electromagnetic machine worked by a vol
taic current, and which he thus formulated*:—•"" The consump
tion of zinc which takes place when the machine is at rest and
does no work is double that which takes place when it does
the maximum work." This conclusion has been applied in
a modified form to the transmission of power by dj-namo
machines, in which the velocities of rotation of the two
machines could be used as the variables for determining the
current-strength and the work, and from which the principle
has been deduced that the greatest useful effect is obtained
when the ratio of the two velocities is as 2 : 1.
    It must be observed in this connexion that Jacobi drew his
conclusion from somewhat inaccurate assumptions, the first
of which is—" The strength of the magnetism excited in soft
iron by voltaic currents is proportional to the strength of
these currents;" and that therefore no great accuracy can be
assigned to his conclusions. It must, on the other hand, be
observed that this conclusion refers to a strictly defined
process, where a voltaic battery, the work of which is governed
by fixed laws, served as the source of power ; while, in
the transmission of power, other sources may be used the

 work of which is at our disposal in various ways. Hence, if
 we are to make investigations as to the maximum of the work
 transferred, we must first of all accurately define the conditions
 to which this maximum refers.
     § 4. Determination of the Work Tj when the Velocity Vi is
                       supposed to be given.
     In reference to the circumstance last mentioned, that the
 source of power, which we have to use for driving the first
 machine, is in various ways at our disposal, we will first make
 the assumption that the source of power is of such a kind as
to do work of any magnitude, so that the work which can be
expended in the first machine is unlimited. This would be the
case, for instance, if a great water-power were at our disposal,
which would far exceed the demand even with the greatest
possible consumption of work. The question is, How can
the greatest work T5 be obtained from the second machine
under these circumstances ?
    If T2 is to be large, then from (15) v3 and t must be large,
and a great value of i presupposes again (12) a great value of
the difference Vi — v2. The two conditions that v2 and vt —vt
must be great can only be fulfilled when vl is great ; and the
 first condition for a great value of Ts is therefore that vu the
velocity of rotation of the first machine, must be as great as
f>ossible. In this respect we are confined within certain
  imits, arising from the mechanical difficulties which oppose
the production of very great velocities ; and we will ac
cordingly consider the greatest attainable velocity as a given
magnitude, and assume that vx is this velocity.
    Of the two velocities of rotation, v3 only remains undefined;
and we may accordingly regard the work T3 as a function of
this magnitude. To determine this function we will use the
equation already deduced, that is,
in which we may replace t by its value given in (12). The
magnitudes u and u', which occur in this latter, are functions
of i>! and vs in accordance with (6) and (10); and hence also the
entire expression for Ts obtained in this way is a function of
»i and vs. As, further, we must consider vx as given and only
v3 variable, we may also say that in this way Ts is represented
as a function of the single variable v2.
    In order now to find that value of v8 for which Ts is a
maximum, we must apply the well-known method of differen
tiating T2 in respect of v3, putting the differential coefficient

equal to null, and solving the resultant equations in respect
of v3.
   But from the frequent and multifarious occurrence of Vj
this calculation is tedious, even when the members contain
ing the small values a and \ are simplified by introducing
approximate values, as is undoubtedly allowable. We shall
therefore content ourselves with making the calculation for a
special case and with certain omissions, in order to get at any
rate an approximate idea of the magnitude of the value r2
in question. The constant c, which is equal to (e—a)p, may,
according to the values of e and a, be either positive or nega
tive, and thus may also be null in a particular case ; we will
assume that this constant has the last-named specinl value null.
The expression for i acquires then the following simple form :—
                            i=pu' — b.
We will further disregard, in the calculation, all members
containing the factors p, a, and X ; we have then to put u'
equal to         u3)/R, and make y and 8 equal to null. The
equation which holds for Ta passes then into
                   w^^P-")'-                     ¦   ¦   ¦  <22>
   By differentiating this equation in respect of v3 we get
E'= (^^(^T?                                                     (23)
If now this differential equation is equal to null, one of the
three factors of which the expression on the right hand con
sists is thus null. The first factor cannot of course be null.
The second factor          „ _,,
                        p-^-b
represents the current-strength t, and for our purpose cannot
be made equal to null. We must hence make the third factor
null, and thus obtain for the determination of vt the equation
                   2pc\-Zpvlvi+pv\-'Blv1 = Q. . . . (24)
From this follows
The upper sign before the root gives a value for vs which is
greater than v1} and which therefore is inadmissible in our
case; hence wTe must use the lower sign, and then by a slight
transformation we get the equation
                 W^-i^l-fojl).                 •   •   •    (25)

    This equation shows that the value of v3 which corresponds
 to the maximum of T3 is not equal to Vi/2, as the above law
 states, but approaches this value with increase of V\.
   § 5. Determination of the work Ta when the work Ti is given.
    The second assumption which we can make in regard to the
 source of power which drives the first machine, may be that
 it can only perform a work Tj of definite magnitude. The
 question then arises, Does the work Ta to be gained from the
 second machine depend on the working of the machines ?
    It is here to be observed that, if T, is given, only one
 of the velocities of rotation and vt is to be considered as
 independent. As three equations, (III.), (V.V and (3), are
 given between the five magnitudes vu v%, T„ T3, and », from
two of these magnitudes the other three can be determined.
We will consider Vi as that magnitude which, along with Ti,
serves to define the other three values.
    In order to define i as a function of Ti and v, we use the
equation (III.), that is,
 which we may bring into the following form :—
         (a + i){b + i) pvx \a + i) \ ^ b + i)p'
    The solution of this equation in respect of i is rendered
 more difficult by the second member on the right hand, which
 contains t in the denominator in a higher power than the
 member on the left hand. It is to be observed, however, that
 the member on the right hand is affected by the factors a and
 \, which are so small that we may disregard magnitudes in
reference to them which are of higher than the first order.
This fact may be utilized in treating the equation. We first
of all determine that value of i which results from the equation
when we disregard the member containing the factors a and \.
If we denote this value for distinction by i', the equation for
its determination is
                      (a+i'Xb + V'pvt                       V"*
The value of i' resulting from this can only differ from i by a
magnitude of the order of the factors a and X ; and if we
return to (26), and in the member affected by these factors
replace i by the value i', the expression on the right hand only
changes by a magnitude which in reference to a and \ is of
the second order, and therefore may be neglected. Hence

                {s-(z-ey-(a + b)zi-al>z=0, . . . (31)
and apply to this the well-known method of solving cubical
equations. Only one of the three roots thereby obtained can
be used on account of the sign, and this is determined as
follows:—Let <f> be the angle between 0 and w which satisfies
the equation
                   (*-'?+ K« + »)(«-«>+¥«to. . (32)
                        y/[(z'-ey + 3(a + b)zf
i will be represented by the following expression:—
        i=$(e-e) + $\/(z-e)1 + d(a + b)z.cost. . ¦ (33)
                                                    o
   In reference to the cosine which occurs as a factor of the
last member, it follows from equation (32) that while z in
creases from 0 to oo , the angle ^ decreases from ir to 0, from
which it follows that <f>/3 decreases from 7r/3 to 0, and accord
ingly cos (</>/3) increases from £ to 1. Here it is to be observed
that the first increase is pretty rapid, so that in the values of
z which occur in practice, cos (0/3) cannot be very different
from 1.
   Equations (32) and (33) may also be used in a twofold
manner. If z is replaced in them by ipvu they form a solu
tion of equation (27), and give that approximate value of t
which has been designated above by i'. By replacing it in
(29) we obtain the value z, and, knowing this, we can by
another application of equations (32) and (33) calculate the
stricter value of i.
   After determining in this way the strength t, the first of
the above-named three magnitudes, there is no difficulty with
the two others.
   To determine »3 equation (5) can be used. This is an

                Power by Dynamo-electrical Machines.                 52b
   equation of the second order, and could be solved as such ;
   yet here also the fact that the square of t>, only occurs with
   the small factors a and X may be used for simplifying the
  calculation. For this the equation may be written in the
   following form:—
    *= V                    e+{                                 . (34)
                        (a + i)(b + i)P + P
   In this we may omit the last term of the numerator, and from
  the equation thus abbreviated calculate an approximate value
  of t'j. This value can then be introduced into that last
  member, and thus the more accurate value of v3 determined
  by a second calculation.
      When this magnitude v3 is known, the determination of the
  last magnitude, with which we are specially concerned (that
  is, the work done by the second machine T2), follows directly,
  as equation (20) can be used, which, after replacing 7 and 8
  by their values, may be written as follows :—
T,=TX- [n + P(v1 + vi)+(l +^^+b^^+^y (35)
     We see from this equation, in which the negative member
  on the right hand has the factor i2, that T2 is greater (that is,
  is nearer the given value Tj) the smaller i is. But as, from
  (33), t decreases simultaneously with z, and as, further, the
  chief member of the expression for z in (29) is the fraction
  I]/pt)ii and therefore decreases when i\ increases, i also de
  creases when Vi increases ; and hence we get the result for T2,
  that its value is greater as t>j is greater ; and it is in fact
 known from practice that, in order to make T3 as great as
 possible in reference to T1( the velocity of rotation of the first
  machine must be increased to the utmost possible limit.
     According to (32), the velocity v3 of the second machine is
 greater the greater vi and the smaller i becomes. But as, from
 the preceding, with a given value of T1( a decrease of t is con
 nected with an increase of Oi, it follows from (34) that v2 in
 creases with an increase of r, in a still greater ratio than Vi itself.
     It will be clear from what has been said that in this case,
 in which Tj is considered as given, there can be no question
 of a definite ratio between vs and vx for which T2 would be a
 maximum.
    In this paragraph, from the magnitudes Tx and Vx the three
 other magnitudes i, v2, and T2 were determined ; and in the
 previous paragraph the magnitudes % and T2 from the magni
 tudes Vi and v3. In like manner a series of other calculations

530     Transmission of Power by Dynamo-electrical Machines.
may be made with our equations, by selecting any two of the
five magnitudes and determining the other three from them.
But we will content ourselves with the above instances of
calculations, which refer to two of the most important cases
which occur in practice.
   The results obtained by calculation are perhaps rather more
complicated than is desirable for practical use ; it may, how
ever, be observed that the aim was to deduce the results from
the principal equations in such a manner that only higher
powers of the small magnitudes a and A are neglected. If
we are content with a less degree of accuracy, the calculations
and the form of their results may be simplified. Moreover,
when the results derived from the principal equations are once
known, it will not be difficult to form approximate formulae,
which give the results with sufficient accuracy for certain
practical purposes, and are more convenient for use. But I
will not here enter on such external transformations, as they
are outside the object of the present paper.

                  LX. On Electromagnets.—No. I.
      By R. H. M. Bosanquet, St. John's College, Oxford.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       Gentlemen,
THIS paper contains the results of the complete examina
        tion of two cylindrical electromagnets, with so much
comment as is needed to show the nature of the generaliza
tion which is being worked out.
   In the following tables of results, each normal place re
presents a number of experiments. The number of normal
places has been reduced as far as possible consistently with
exhibiting the course of the values.
   The quantities are as follows:—
   13, magnetic induction (number of linos of force through
       unit area, field intensity) through equatorial section of
       magnet ;
   p, magnetic resistance = magnetic potential
                            38 TP
       where n is the total number of coils, and G the current
       in C.G.S.J
   Earth's force, H, V; H='1723 in the mean,
                            V = -433;
  ampere-turns = 10 nC ;
                                                47rM
  /, focal distance in terms of length= ,xlines offorceJ
   M, moment ;
  m, —s                   ,. ,.
       moment = magnetization.
     ; volumo
   The bars are wound uniformly from end to end. If the
magnetizing coil be concentrated towards the middle the
magnetic resistance is diminished.
   The induction-coils are concentrated as close as possible to
the equatorial section. If they are distributed more towards
the ends, the apparent magnetic resistance is increased. Their
number was varied between 200 and 1.

   The first entry is a mean between determinations made
with the horizontal and vertical components of the Earth's
force. The magnetic resistance of this bar under H (the less)
was in every case less than that under V (the greater). This
is opposed to the general run of the values. The mean elimi
nates this inconsistency, which is probably due in some way
to residual magnetism.

places are given as seem necessary in each case.

         Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on Electromagnets.            533
   33. This was determined by the method given by Rowland
(Phil. Mag. xlvi. p. 140). The mean radius of the earth
induction-coil is 25-65 centim. It has 21 turns, 3 layers of 7.
The values of H and V employed were determined nearly
every day. Latterly H alone was employed.
   Earth's force.—The magnetic potential was taken as H x
length or V x length, as the case might be. The absolute
values of H and V disappear from p.
   Ampere-turns.—The currents were measured by two Helm-
holtz galvanometers, one having 18 coils and the other 2 coils ;
circumference 1 metre. The galvanometer-constant was kept
in the form CH, so that the values of H obtained daily were
conveniently employed.
   Magnetic resistance.—The magnetic potential was thrown
into the form PH tan 8. The induction also involved H.
The quotient of these quantities was therefore independent
of H. To secure identity of H in numerator and denomi
nator, the tangent-galvanometer and earth induction-coil
were always adjusted on the same standard place ; being used
alternately, the one could be removed to make way for the
other.
   Moment.—The moment was obtained by observing the
deflection of a needle by the electromagnet placed at a known
 distance E or W. The scale and mode of computation em
 ployed in the absolute determinations were used. The value
 of H was always determined separately in the position of the
 deflected needle, by observing the deflection produced by the
 standard magnets, with which a complete determination had
 been made in the standard position the same day. The moment
 being known from the standard determination, H can be
 obtained from the deflection only.
    These are all the observational data. With respect to /, I
 define the foci of a bar as being such that, if F be their dis
 tance, F x lines of force = 4ttM. This would be true if
 these points were true poles, and the points of application of
the resultants of the lines of force. Then, to get a more
general datum, I put F//=/, so that the numbers from differ
 ent bars may be directly comparable.
    To study the values I take 33 for abscissa, conveniently so
 that 1000 is represented by 1 centim. Then any of the other
 columns may be represented by ordinates. p and / are the
 most important. In drawing the curves for p, I adopt a scale
 of 10 centim. for 1 centim. of p*. It is easy to see how far
 the curves for / would assume the same general character.
       * The woodcut is drawn to about half these dimensions.

         As I propose shortly to undertake further experiments, I will
         only indicate the nature of the general conclusions.

           The magnetic resistance for each bar can be expressed as
        the sum of a resistance c'ue to its form, and a quantity formed
        by dividing the length by fi, the permeability of the metal*.
        The form-resistance for different bars may be approximately
        represented by
                                    ¦37rl0-'00("7.
        These constants are determined from the minimum resistances
        of the above bars, assuming that a further metal resistance,
        due to ft = 3000, is to be subtracted from the values found.
           The formula agrees with the values obtained from the bar
        and the 18 pieces (Phil. Mag. May 1883), when corrected for
        the erroneously assumed value of F (/ in that paper). The
        error due to the value of H is not worth considering, as most
        of it appears in numerator and denominator. These errors all
        fall on the value of A in the formula
                                         ArlO~*r.
        A would come to about "36 after correction. But k is un
        affected by the errors, depending only on the ratio of the
        observed quantities. And taking as the result there that the
        ratio of the form-resistances of the bar and of one of the 18
        pieces is 2 : 3, we find at once £= '006139. The agreement
        of both constants is quite as close as can be expected.
           As to /, it obviously follows a general course similar to p,
        except irregularities in the lower inductions, which I take to
        be connected with residual magnetism. But it can never
          • The initial value of p for I. would be about 240 (very near Rowland's
        value 232 for his magnetic ring), that for II. about 270. Both bars had
        been repeatedly magnetized to saturation.

          Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on Electromagnets.               535
approach very closely to 1. The values throughout the middle
range, for both bars, are well represented by the formula
                           /=-650 + -440p-
It is only for small inductions, and again for over 19,000, that
this fails. It holds throughout the range of ordinary practice.
In the following comparisons the last entry in each table is
beyond the range for which it holds.

    Generally, wo may chiefly note that the course of the values
does not at all indicate any definite limit to iJf. The only
 limit that stopped me from forcing it up higher in both cases
was that the coils became hot. In one case the coil of I. was
actually charred.
    It appears then, so far as the iron I am working with is con
 cerned, that the existing idea of saturation is as complete a
mistake as that of the existence of unalterable permanent
magnets. And the idea of constructing measuring-instru
ments of an accurate character based on either principle is
fallacious.
   * There is evidently a discontinuity in this value,
   t It is commonly assumed that 3B cannot exceed about 17,600 or
 18,000 (Rowland, c.j Enc. Brit. art. Magnetism).

536       Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on Electromagnets.
   The most accurate law to be drawn from these results is
that, say, between 8 = 2000 and 38 = 15,000 the magnetic
resistance does not vary more than about 2 or 3 per cent, for
such bars as I have been using.
   It must be remembered that i$ here refers to the equatorial
section of the magnet. Its average value throughout the
magnet would be less.
   My object has been to avoid refinements and deal with such
conditions as obtain in practical work. Thus I have not
touched the question of residual magnetism. I may note,
however, with reference to a recent remark by Prof. Ewing*,
that Rowland gave an account of the enormous values of resi
dual magnetism in soft-iron rings in the paper before referred
to ; and the conditions of a wire or long bar approximate to
those of a ring as far as the magnetic resistance is concerned.
It is only when this is small that the residual magnetism is
largely developed. I have a bar 1 metre long and 1 centim.
in diameter, which retains a large charge just as Mr. Ewing
describes.
   Mr. Ewing remarks with surprise on the small magnetizing
forces needed to produce large effects with his wires. I must
point out that, if the bar be taken long enough, any difference
of potential, however great, can be represented as a small
magnetizing-force, since the force is potential / length.
Further, this conception of magnetizing-force tacitly assumes
that a long bar takes more potential to magnetize it than a
short one. The reverse is actually true within practical limits.
So that, by taking the bar long enough, the effect of a given
difference of potential may be continually increased, and the
corresponding magnetizing-force, as usually expressed, conti
nually diminished up to a point beyond practical limits.

LXI. Saturation of Salt-Solutions. By W. W. J. Nicol,
   M.A., B.Sc, F.R.S.E., fyc, Lecturer on Chemistry, Mason
   College, Birmingham1*.
ACCORDING to the theory of solution brought forward
         in my paper on the Nature of Solutionf, saturation of a
solution of a salt results when the sum of the attractions of
the salt-molecules present in the solution for any individual
salt-molecule is equal to the sum of the attractions of the
water-molecules for that particular salt-molecule—the attrac
tion of the water-molecules for one another being disregarded,
as a probably constant quantity. At that time I endeavoured
to prove that the attraction of the dissimilar molecules of water
and salt is one cause of the contraction attending the solution
of a salt, while the attraction of the similar molecules of the
salt has an opposite effect, and tends to produce an increase in
the volume.
   I wished at the time of publication of the above to show a
connexion between the molecular volume of a salt in the solid
state and its solubility. That such a connexion does exist, my
early experiments soon convinced me. But as yet I am in a
position only to indicate the nature of this relation; sufficient
evidence is still wanting to give my conclusions a quantitative
value.
   The results J obtained by comparisons of the molecular
volumes of dilute solutions of various salts, show that in such
solutions the intermolecular spaces are practically coextensive
whatever may be the salt, while this is clearly not the case in
the solid state, except with isotomous salts. In solution the
molecules of salt are so far apart that they are out of the sphere
of one another's attraction ; in the solid state, on the other
hand, they are packed more or less closely together, according
to the temperature § of crystallization and the attraction they
have for one another. If, now, the above theory of saturation
be the correct one, it is evident that, since loose packing of
the molecules—that is, large molecular volume in the solid
state—is due to weak attraction between the molecules of the
salt, such a salt should be more easily dissolved than one which
differs from it only in the attraction between its molecules
being so great as to cause a smaller molecular volume. I hope
to be able to show that this is the case.

of the specific gravity of a salt-solution is less than the rate at
which it increases in concentration; consequently the mole
 cular volume of each successive molecule of a salt added to a
solution is a constantly increasing quantity. Tables I. and II.
 contain the results of experiments with NaCl.
   Table I. gives the density (S) and the molecular volume
 (M. V.) of solutions containing n molecules of NaCl in 100
molecules of water, at t°=20°. The column headed A gives
the difference in molecular volume produced by each succes
sive molecule of salt added.

   The molecular volume therefore increases from 17"08 up to
23-61 for the last -99 molecule added. In Table II. the data
are treated differently. The molecular volume of the water
is assumed constant = 1800, and is subtracted from the mole
cular volume of the solution; the remainder (M. V. — 1800) = r
is what Thomsen has called the " Rest'''—it is the volume of
the salt in the solution ; and — is the mean molecular volume
                                  n
of a molecule of the salt in a solution of strength n : this in
the case of NaCl increases from 17"08 to 21*16 in the satu
rated solution. The molecular volume of the salt in the solid
state       ^ ^ is given by Schroder =27*1.

  We have therefore:—

   (2) Mean M. V., NaCl saturated solution =21*2.
   (3) M. V., NaCl -5 molecule solution          =17-1.
  Now, (l-3) = 10-0, and (l-2) = 5'9; and

   But (2) is the mean volume of each molecule in a saturatea
solution, when the attraction of similar molecules is equal to
that of dissimilar molecules; (3), on the other hand, is when
only dissimilar molecules act, and (1) only similar ones. Satu
ration has taken place therefore when the difference between
the volume of a molecule of NaCl in the dissolved state and
the volume in the solid state has reached '59 of that between
the volume in the solid state and that when the molecules are
entirely free from one another's attraction.
   Again, in the case of potassium chloride:—
     (1) M. V., KC1 solid                            =37-4.
     (2) M. V., KC1 in saturated solution            = 30-9.

 be kept in mind that the more nearly the fraction
 approaches to a whole number the greater the attraction of
 the salt-molecules for one another, and conversely.

   We find that the less the solubility the larger the fraction,
holds good in all four cases; and I have added to the table,
without intending to lay much stress on the result, the product
of the fraction by the solubility by the molecular weight. In
the three first cases the result is nearly a constant number ;
the mean difference is 2 per cent, only, which is little when
the number of determinations involved is considered ; but
NaNOj is entirely exceptional. I have failed to find any
error anywhere, .and must leave it at present unexplained. It
will be found that this is not the only instance in which NaNOj
behaves differently from the majorit}* of salts. My reason for
introducing the molecular weight as a factor in the above cal
culation is that, other things being equal, the cohesion of the
salt is evidently a function of its molecular weight.

                     Saturation of Salt-Solutions.                   541
    I believe that further investigation will show the general
truth of the following conclusions:—
    That the more soluble a salt is in any liquid, the more nearly
 will its mean molecular volume in the saturated solution
 approach that in the solid state, and that in most cases the
 product of F by the solubility by the molecular weight will
be found a constant, subject, however, to variations, due most
likely|to the influence of the at present unknown factor attrac
tion of salt for water.
    That the solubility of a salt is intimately connected with its
molecular volume is also shown by the following:—
    (1) Diminished molecular volume without change of com
position is attended by diminished solubility: thus, in the case
 of sodium sulphate, the salt crystallized at different tempera
 tures has a different molecular volume *.
       f            =40°                110°                 Melted.
       M.V.         =5335               53-31                53-96
       Solubilityf =48-8                42-5              J" 230°
                                                          1 46-4
The solubility here is parts per 100 of water.
    Under this head also come the instances given by me (loc.
cit.), and also the determinations of the rate at which CaCO^
dissolves in dilute acids in the different forms of calcspar and
arragonite, where the former, with a lower specific gravity
(i. e. larger molecular volume), was found to dissolve fastest.
    (2) Diminished molecular volume with change of composi
tion is attended by diminished solubility.
    Sodium sulphate has its maximum of solubility at 32°-8,
the temperature at which the decahydrated molecule is broken
up. So with sodium carbonate at 32°-5 (Mulder).
    Manganese sulphate has a maximum of solubility at 54° C,
and the solid salt decomposes into a lower hvdrate at 54
(Tilden).
    Ferrous sulphate has its maximum at 630,5, temperature of
decomposition (Tilden). Other cases are given by Mulder J.
But enough has been said to show that here the solubility is
connected with the hydration of the salt; but as increased or
diminished hydration means increased or diminished molecular
volume, the molecular volume is connected with the solubility.
I do not intend by the above to imply that in solution the
salt is combined with the water of crystallization. I formerly
held this, the general view; but experiments, nearly completed,

have raised grave doubts, and incline me to the opinion that
water of crystallization is indistinguishable, when the salt is
dissolved, from water of solution. This, however, does not
affect the above : it is immaterial for the above argument
whether the hydrate is ready formed in the solution, or the
salt is forced by conditions of temperature &c. to carry with it
that number of water-molecules—the effect on the molecular
volume would be the same *.
     I come now to the second part of the subject.
                 Saturation in Solutions of two Salts.
     Hitherto we have considered saturation in the solution of
a single salt. What laws govern the saturation of a solution
 with two or more salts ? I shall confine my remarks for the
 present to solutions of only two salts; and this implies that
 they are salts containing the same metal or the same salt
 radical.
     This is a subject which presents considerable experimental
 difficulties, and it has been attacked by but a few experi
 menters, the chief of whom are :—

      Before considering the results obtained by former observers,
  I shall describe my own experiments and state their results.
      Four salts were taken for examination—the chlorides of
  sodium and potassium, and the corresponding nitrates; and
  their solubility and density at 20° C. were carefully deter
  mined in the following way. A large bath, fitted up as
     • It is curious that the temperatures 32°-33° and 04°-66° should be
  marked out so definitely as those at which decomposition of hydrated salts
  takes place. Thus, 32°-33°, as above, is the V at which sodium carbonate
  and sulphate decompose ; CaCl,6HaO melts at 33°. The solubility of
  Sr(N03)a increases much less rapidly after 32° is reached, while the same
  is the case at 60° with SrCL,. The solubilitiy of MnSO„ which drops
 suddenly at 64°, remains constant from 64° for more than 20° ; FeSO^
  maximum at 630-5. The melting-point determinations of Wiedemann
 give critical points at 32°, at 63°, and 92° (Wied. Annul, xvii. p. 561).

                       Saturation of Salt-Solutions.            543
  described in a previous paper*, was provided with a cover
  pierced with holes to hold test-tubes 180 millim. by 30 millim.
  Round the top of the bath ran a tube with stopcocks at in
  tervals, corresponding to the holes in the cover; this tube was
  connected with the air-blower. The course of experiment
  was as follows :—Two test-tubes with 50 cubic centim. of water
  in each were taken, and an excess of the same salt placed in
  each. The contents of one of the tubes were heated till solu
 tion was complete, and after partial cooling both tubes were
 placed in the bath at, say, 12 noon. By means of wide tubes
 attached to the stopcocks at the side of the bath, a slow
 stream of air saturated with water vapour was allowed to
 bubble up through the solutions in the test-tubes, which were
  loosely covered. The whole was left till 10 a.m. the next day,
  when the air-current was turned off", and the solutions were
  left at rest till 12 o'clock. In this way saturation had gone
  on in one of the tubes, and crystallization in the other for 24
  hours. By means of a cork fitted with two tubes, one wide
  and sufficiently long to reach nearly to the bottom of the test-
  tube, and covered at the lower end with two-ply of cambric,
 a portion of the liquid was forced by air-pressure into a
  Sprengel tube placed in the bath, and another portion collected
 in a weighed dish. In this way the specific gravity and per
 centage composition of the solution saturated at 20° C. were
 found.
    The results were as follows :—

                   Mr. W. W. J. Nicol on the
Here the more soluble salt has its solubility increased more
than that of the less soluble, with the exception of NaN03,
since R together < R separate.
   The more important part of Table Y. is in the last four
columns, where I have compared the actual molecular volume
of the salt-solution with the volume calculated on the suppo
sition that each salt-molecule is present in the solution with
the volume it possesses in its own saturated solution. In
the three first cases the agreement is satisfactory ; but
KNOj + NaNOs is exceptional, the actual volume of the
salts being about 10 per cent, higher than the calculated. I
may venture to suggest that a possible explanation of this is
to be found in the fact that KN03 is dimorphous, and in one
of its forms (that of rhombohedra) is isomorphous with
NaNOj. It may be that the presence of this last salt may
influence the form in which the KN03 would crystallize out;
and inasmuch as the isomorphous form is the unstable one
under usual conditions, it is probable that its molecular
volume in the solid state would be greater, and hence its
Bolubility and molecular volume in a saturated solution would
also be greater than that of the usual form.
   I have examined this point in another way: by preparing
a solution of one of the above salts, and then adding to it,
after determination of the molecular volume, a number of
molecules of another salt : for example, a 7 NaCl 100 H30
solution had 2 KCl, 3 KCl, and 4 KCl added.
   The results are given in Table VI., and compared with the
molecular volume calculated on the supposition that the more

                   Saturation of Salt-Solutions.
soluble salt possesses a molecular volume the same as it
would if all the salt-molecules present were the same, and that
the less soluble salt possesses the molecular volume it has in a
saturated solution. There is here very complete agreement
between the two sets of figures.
   Enough has been said to show that in the majority of the
cases examined the molecular volume of the saturated solu
tion is equal to the sum of the molecular volumes of the
salts present, calculated on the hypothesis that each salt has
the volume it would possess in its own saturated solution.
   The results of previous experimenters on this subject are
given in Table VII. I shall at present content myself with
pointing out the general conclusions to be derived from it,
reserving for future discussion the special points of diffi
culty. I do so with the less hesitation, since the data here
given are liable to the same charges of inaccuracy that are
made with so much truth against ordinary solubility deter
minations.
   Out of forty-two determinations (including duplicates) there
are thirty instances in which the more soluble salt has its solu
bility increased by the presence of another salt to a greater
extent than that of the less soluble one.
   In no instance is the solubility of the more soluble salt less
than if it were alone in the solution, while in several instances
it is doubled. In twelve cases the less soluble salt suffers a
diminution of solubility; in all the others the reverse is the case.
   The general rule appears to be that the solubility of two
salts together is greater than that when separate. The pro
bable explanation of this appears to me to be as follows:—
   Each salt dissolves independently of the other. This is
shown by the molecular volume of the solution. Each salt,
however, increases in most cases the solubility of the other by
what may be called mechanical means: thus, molecules of dif
ferent salts do not, as a rule, attract one another; there is
therefore no tendency to form a system containing two salts.
At the same time, however, the formation of groups of similar
salt-molecules is prevented to a certain extent by the inter
position or collision with a molecule of the other salt: thus
the number of similar salt-molecules must be increased before,
in unit time, the number of encounters of similar molecules
becomes as great as in a saturated solution of that salt alone.
   The increased solubility of the more soluble salt at the
expense, so to speak, of the less soluble salt is in all probabi
lity due to the greater attraction for water possessed by that
particular salt. This is specially noticeable in the case of

       In conclusion, I am fully aware that it is only by numerous
    and careful experiments that it is possible to decide whether
    the above results are merely fortuitous, or are part of a wider
    generalization ; and I hope, at no distant date, to be able to
    bring forward further evidence in this direction.

TTHE subject of this masterly work may be regarded as a history
       of Erosion on a grand scale, as shown by the physical features
of the Grand-Canon district. Erosion depends upon climatal con
ditions, the local characters of the land, and the progressive eleva
tion of the region affected. In working out this history the author
has endeavoured to correlate all the conditions, processes, and
events, and has clearly indicated the progressive evolution of the
physical features of this wonderful region, with their origin and
changes, and the existing results of the order of events. The
district treated of, chiefly in North-western Arizona, but extending
northward into Utah, is about 180 miles from N.W. to S.E., and
125 miles N.E. to S.W., and has between 13,000 and 16,000 square
miles. The " Colorado Eiver of the West " traverses it in an
average W.S.W. tortuous course, along the Glen Canon, Marble
Cation, and Grand Canon. The last name, however, has been
misapplied to the gorges of other rivers. The deep-cut channel is
bordered by high, extensive, and successive plateaus, conterminous
with strong escarpments of great geological formations. Those
on the north comprise the Eocene, Cretaceous, Jurassic, Triassic,
Permian, and Carboniferous rocks ; and the last is continued as
the surface-ground on the south side of the river for at least
130 miles, with an extent of many thousand square miles. These
plateaus, channelled and scored with drainage-lines, are modified
according to the nature of the strata, and at places by the occurrence
of igneous rocks.
   The Eocene strata form the Markagunt and Paunsagunt Plateaus
(nearly 11,000 feet above the sea), overlooking the Grand Canon
from the north, at a distance of some 80 miles. Their escarpment,
800 feet deep, is marvellously sculptured and coloured : obelisks
and pilasters form a gigantic ruined colonnade of pale and rich red
tints, " beautiful beyond description." These are but the Lower-
Eocene lake-marls, of the same age as those of the Uinta Moun
tains (Green Eiver, Bitter Creek, White and Uinta Eivers). Still
further north Middle and Upper Eocenes occur, making a whole
thickness of 5000 feet, but the Lower Eocene only seems to have
been at any time present at the plateaus above mentioned, with
their intrusive trachytes and basalts. Probably the great Tertiary
lake began here to be dried up, though persisting further north
ward in later Eocene times.

552                   Notices respecting New Books.
   Below the " Pink Cliffs " of the Eocene beds, Cretaceous sand
stones and shales (nearly 5000 feet thick) form rolling ridges,
yellowish in tint, with long hill-sides and rocky pine-clad promon
tories, over a platform varying from 4 to 10 miles in width. More
eastward they widen out with numerous ledges, tier above tier,
sharply defined, symmetrically sculptured, and peculiarly coloured
with light yellow and brown, set off with the dark grey belts of
shale.
   The Jurassic formation, consisting of red fossiliferous shales
(from 300 to 500 feet thick) and an underlying white sandstone,
nearly 1000 feet thick, forms a platform stretching along beneath
the Cretaceous escarpment, with a varying width of about 10
miles and less. The great unfossiliferous white sandstone is very
peculiar,—massive, homogeneous, cross-bedded throughout. Some
times it presents simple straight cliffs, sometimes the white wall
is cut into bastions and bays, buttes, temples, and dome-shaped
masses, with outlying forts nearly 1000 feet high. At one locality
(the Colob) grotesque anomalous rock-forms, curved, hummocky,
and wobbly, have been weathered out of the sandstone*.
   Strata belonging to the Trias form a still lower plateau or plat
form, at some places more than 15 miles broad, elsewhere very
narrow, within the scarped terraces already described as curving
irregularly round, on the north and east within the district which
is drained into the Marble and Grand Canons. " The splendour of
the terraces culminates in the Trias." These cliffs, in some places
 2000 feet high, are composed of relatively thin-bedded sandstones,
often gypseous, with 6haley beds in the lower portion. The
 sharply defined and fretted edges of the horizontal strata, form
 ing delicately moulded, vertical, cliff-like ledges and plinths, and
their successive " water-tables " or talus-banks, with graceful
feebly concave slopes, constitute a complex profile, made up of
simple elements, and keeping a definite type throughout, though
locally modified. Wonderfully red with varied tints, banded at
intervals with white, and traversed by the hollow lines of dissolved
gypsum, they are carved vertically, as by a bold architectural
sculptor of immeasurable power, into pinnacles, gables, buttresses,
towers, and dome-like forms, often in stages and tiers to vast
heights, all " of great beauty and grandeur, with strongly emphasized
vertical lines and decorations, suggestive of cathedral architecture
on a colossal scale." These are the leading features of the incom
parable " Vermilion Cliffs," especially in their greatest perfection
among " the temples and towers of the Virgen," where that valley
comes down in more than picturesque gorges and canons from the
Eocene heights through the successive plateaus already mentioned.
   * The filagree plexus of curved lines in the face of the cliffo of this
bedless mass suggests to us an Aeolian origin ; and the Colob looks as if it
owed its bizarre forms to concretionary conditions of this curious Jurassic
sandstone. It is doubtful if it belongs to the Jurassic or to the Triassic
series ; it might be the blown-sands of the Triassic sea.

                     Notices respecting New Books.                    553
   Here "the slopes, the winding ledges, the posses of projecting rock, the
naked scanty soil, display colours which are truly amazing. Chocolate,
maroon, purple, lavender, magenta, with hroad hands of toned white, are
laid in horizontal belts, strongly contrasting with each other ; and the
ever-varying slope of the surface cuts across them capriciously, so that
the sharply-defined belts wind about like the contours of a map     Across
the canon, and rather more than a mile and a half beyond it stands the
central and commanding object of the picture, the ' western temple,'
rising 4000 feet above the river. Its glorious summit was the object we
had seen an hour before, and now the matchless beauty and majesty of its
vast mass is all before us. Yet it is only the central object of a mighty
throng of structures, wrought up to the same exalted style, and filling up
the entire panorama." (Pp. 57, 58.)
   The lowest (first) stratum of the Triassic formation is the Shina'-
rump conglomerate ; and this, unlike the basal beds of the other
formations, which end with their cliffs, protrudes from below,
extending far over the next lower (Permian) platform towards its
edge. This brownish, coarse, and conglomeratic sandstone is
usually from 40 to 75 feet, sometimes even 100 feet thick ; but
occasionally it is absent. It lies horizontally on an eroded surface
of the Permian shales, and with the underlying strata was included
by Powell in his " Shindrump Group," in some lower beds of which
Permian fossils have been found. As a strong feature in the region
and on account of its apparent unconformity, Walcott and Dutton
keep it now with the Trias *.
   The Permian consists of thin beds of sandy shales and impure
limestone, traceable, like those of the Trias, for miles and miles
along the richly coloured cliffs (about 1000 feet high) ending the
terrace. Horizontal streaks of chocolate, purple, and red-brown
are interstratified with violet, lavender, and white, in these grand
sections. Many outliers and " buttes " of Permian strata, and
isolated sheets of basalt, are scattered over the great plain or plat
form of Carboniferous rocks, which stretches hence to the Grand
Canon (about 30 miles), and far away on the other side of the
great river. About 60 miles S. of the river the volcanic San-
Francisco Mountains are piled on the horizontal Carboniferous
strata, which continue as a level platform for 30 miles beyond, to
end abruptly in the Aubrey Cliffs overlooking the sierra country of
Central Arizona. The Grand Canon, where crossed by the N. and
S. line above indicated, namely between the Kanab and Kaibab
districts, consists of an inner and an outer (wider) chasm ; the
former about 1600 yards wide and 1000 yards deep ; the latter
from 4 to 5 miles wide, including its two lateral esplanades, and
more than 600 yards deep, making a total depth of at least 4800,
if not 5000, feet. Of this, some 400 feet are sunk into Devonian
and Silurian strata. These are highly inclined and contorted, richly
coloured, certainly 6000 and probably 10,000 feet thick. On the
   * Some analogy may be noticed between these great North-American
Permio-Triassic strata and the relations of the European Zechstein and
Bunter-Schiefer, as argued by Sir R. I. Murchison and disputed by others.

 554                   Notices respecting New Books.
 flat, straight-planed edges of these strata, Carboniferous quartzites
 (underlying massive limestones) rest unconformably *. Elsewhere,
 higher up (near the junction of the Marble Canon, the Little
 Colorado, and the Grand Cauon), the Carboniferous strata, about
 4000 feet thick, are seen to lie unconformably on Archrean (schistose
 and granitic) rocks.
    The north side, then, of the valley of the Colorado of the west
 consists of a series of enormous steps,—rising at first suddenly from
 the bed of the river in its deep channel, 3000 feet,—then from the
bordering esplanade (two miles wide), with a rise of 1500 feet ; and
from a great platform of Carboniferous strata about 30 miles wide,
by a succession of broad platforms and their scarped edges, to the
high Tertiary flats about 50 miles from the Carboniferous plateau.
    The strata whose denuded edges constitute this tremendous stair
case of successive terraces have probably an entire thickness of
about 10,000 feet ; the surface of the Eocene platform, however,
is only about 6000 feet above the Carboniferous plateau, owing to a
slight dip to the north throughout, with local increments at the
base of each set of cliffs. The slight northward dip is recognized
also in the Carboniferous strata south of the Colorado.
    That the enormous ma9s of material once occupying, as stratified
rocks, the wide area bordered by the terraces and escarpments, of
which our section above-described is a typical example, has been
removed by denudation, Capt. Dutton and his colleagues have ably
proved. Also that it was denuded during Tertiary times, and by
successive instalments, is well argued out.
    Studying the Canons of the great river from west to east, the
Surveyors divide its course geographically into several parts. 1st.
From the great step at the Grand-Wash fault to the Hurricane
 fault and ledge is the Sheavwits plateau, with its basaltic fields.
2nd. The Uinkaret plateau, bearing Mount Trumbull and other
volcanic cones and coulees t, reaches to the Toroweap fault, which
is well marked at the Grand Canon. 3rd. The wide monotonous

ments (a fault and a monocline) higher up than the others, reaching

The Kaiparowits, high and broad, composed of Cretaceous strata,
further to the N.E., abutting upon the Glen Canon, and traversed
by a plexus of canons formed in Miocene or Pliocene times. These
plateaus are north of the great river. The expanse of plateau-land
south of the river is called the Colorado Plateau.
   The " Plateau Province " comprises, besides the foregoing, the
Uinta Mountains, the Henry Mountains, and the High Plateaus of
Utah. Much of this great region has already been described and
illustrated in the Reports of the U.S. Geographical and Geological
Surveys. The region of the Great Basin of Nevada and Western
Utah was an old mainland in Mesozoic times, and the Trias,
Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Eocene strata have been traced in its
proximity as littoral belts ; indeed the Cretaceous deposits, covering
a much greater area than the Tertiary, reached perhaps from the
Atlantic to the Pacific.
   Other geological points are carefully discussed, such as the vol
canic rocks, and the great faults* and bendings of strata, giving
decided features to the country. The drainage-system of the whole
region, and the subordinate drainages of terraces and escarpments
are specially looked to. The mechanical laws, forces, and methods
of action by which the enormous valley has been eroded and the
 canon " corraded," are carefully discussed, explaining " how those
 abnormal architectural forms so abundantly displayed in the chasm
and in the region round about have been generated." The wonder
ful features of the chasm itself are studied from four points espe
cially. One is " Vulcan's throne," a basaltic cinder-cone, 600 feet
high, on the brink of the inner gorge where the axis of the older
Toroweap valley strikes that of the cation, probably of Post-tertiary
date ; not a very rare instance of a tributary showing evidence of
being older than the canon in its present condition. Another is
 "Point Sublime" in the Kaibab division, a promontory projecting
far out in the chasm, and opening on an indescribably sublime pano
rama, one of many here. Tapeat's Amphitheatret, Surprise Valley,
Shinums and Hindoo Amphitheatres, Shiva's Temple, The Transept,
the Bright-angel and Ottoman Amphitheatres, the Cloister Buttes,
and Vishnu's Temple are some of the remarkable places of scenic
effect in this most gorgeous of wonderlands. Points Boyal and
Final, at the east end of the Kaibab, also give panoramas of great
beauty and powerful effect.
   * There are seven or eight great N.-S. parallel faults in the country
north of the Colorado ; they lead some drainage-lines, but are crossed by
others, especially by the great river.
   t The " amphitheatres are great, dry, lateral, branching valleys, the
interiors of which present wonderful aspects of geological landscape, when
viewed from the Grand Canon itself.

  556               Notices respecting New Books.
    The broadly read history of the region shows that after the in
 calculably old Archaean rocks were covered by Silurian and Devonian
 strata, these also were disturbed, elevated, worn down, and then
 covered by the Carboniferous beds in a moderately deep sea ; and,
 after an uplift and denudation, sinking down, they were covered
 with Permian and Mesozoic strata, in shallow seas, with continually
 sinking sea-bed, and with exceedingly regular horizontality, until
 in that long succession of ages from 12,000 to 16,000 feet of strata
 were accumulated over the entire Plateau Province. Near the end
 of the Cretaceous period there was a change : the ocean-waters were
 restricted, the sea became brackish, and parts of the land were
raised and denuded. Again submerged, they were coated uncon-
formably with the Eocene deposits of a great lake nearly correspond
ing in extent with the Southern Plateau Province. In the Middle
Eocene Period the western portion of the continent began to rise ;
and, in alternating periods of activity and repose, continued to be
raised until a recent epoch. An outlet of the great Eocene lake
was a river which originated the Colorado, perhaps in late Miocene
times ; and this slowly won its way over and through the Eocene and
all the older strata, cutting through them, as the rising of the land
slowly brought them within its influence, probably with intervals
of rest, as marked by the terraces. Lateral streams and the com
bined influence of climatic agencies have eroded the wide stretch
ing plateaus, the channels being deepened and deepened by the
corrasive action of the water carrying sand and stones as mechani
cally erosive agents, whilst rain was too rare to destroy the sharp
angles of the banks. The narrow but great Canon is of relatively
recent manufacture ; and how far the drainage-system can yet be
extended and deepened (to the possible " base-level of erosion ") is
an interesting subject of inquiry.

 -*¦ 1. " A Delta in Miniature.—Twenty-seven years' work." By
T. Mellard Eeade, Esq., F.G.S.
    The author described a delta deposit, which, during a period of
twenty-seven years, had formed in the Eake reservoir (Bivington
Waterworks) from materials brought down by a stream of that
name. The reservoir at this part was divided by a road, water
communication being maintained by a culvert, once 8 feet high,
now almost silted \ip. The author described the stratification of
these deltas ; that near the influx of the Eake consisted of peaty
matter, gritty sand, gravel, shingle, and boulders of Millstone-grit
up to about one foot diameter ; the other chiefly of fine sand with
some peaty matter. The former covered an area of 2508 yards,
with an average thickness of 2 yards ; the latter, an area of 430
yards, with an average thickness of 3 yards. These materials had
come from the drainage-area of the Eake. This is estimated at
1*176 square mile, and the delta being estimated at 6306 cubic
yards, and the time being 27 years, gives, as the annual rate of
denudation over the whole area,         inch per annum, or 1 foot in
5184 years. The mean rainfall of the Eake Brook watershed for
the last 10 years was 49*57 inches per annum. In this calculation
no account is taken of the finer materials which have doubtless been
distributed over the rest of the bed of the reservoir. The author
pointed out that this rate of denudation was rather more rapid than
that of the Mississippi (1 foot in 6000 years), and that the arrange
ment of the materials under the varying condition of the stream
illustrated the phenomena of larger deltas.

an Introductory Note on a Deep Boring at Eichmond, Surrey, by
Collett Homersham, Esq., A.M. Inst. C.E., F.G.8.
    The wants of the growing town of Eichmond, in Surrey, have
necessitated the deepening of a well some years ago put down
into the Chalk, the water derived from which proves inadequate to
 the present demand. The well has now been carried from a depth
 of 434 feet to one of 1310 feet. The work of boring has been
performed by Mather and Piatt's flat-rope machine, under the
superintendence of Mr. S. C. Homersham, C.E. Only insignificant
quantities of water have as yet been obtained ; but that this water
is derived from a deep-seated source is proved by the following

facta :—it is capable of rising 130 feet above the surface of the
ground, and, it has a temperature considerably higher than that of
the surrounding air.
    This well, the bottom of which, reckoning from the Ordnance
datum-line, is now 150 feet lower than that of any other well within
the London Basin, has revealed a number of facts which are of the
 greatest interest to geologists.
    The Tertiary strata passed through present their usual characters.
 The London Clay ha9 a thickness of 160 feet, the Woolwich and
 Beading Series of 60 feet, and the Thanet Sand of 23 feet. The
 usual band of gren-coated flints separates the Tertiaries from the
 Chalk.
     The Chalk was proved to be 671 feet thick under Bichmond. Two
 important horizons, the Chalk Bock and the zoneof Beltmnites plenus ,
 were recognized in it, and it was thus proved that the Upper Chalk,
 or Senonian, is 300 feet thick, the Middle Chalk, or Turonian,
 150 feet, and the Lower Chalk, or Cenomanian (including the Upper
 Greensand, which is normal in character and about 16 feet thick),
 less than 250 feet.
     The Gault presents its usual characters, subdivisions, and fossils ;
 it is 201£ feet in thickness. At its base is the usual band of phos-
phatic nodules.
     Beneath the Gault was found 10 feet of impure sandy limestone,
 with but few and imperfect fossils, and a second junction-bed at its
 base. These beds are probably referable to the Neocomian.
     At this point the boring entered thick beds of oolitic limestone
 with some subordinate bands of clay. The careful examination of
 these has revealed the presence of many fossils—Brachiopoda,
 Bryo/.oa, and Echinodermata being especially abundant, some of
 them in a very perfect state of preservation. These fossils prove the
 strata in which they occur, 87£ feet in thickness, to be of the age
of the Great Oolite.
    A careful reexamination of the evidence in the case of the boring
made in 1878 at Meux's Brewery, proves that the 64 feet of oolitic
 limestone, which was there found overlying the Devonian rocks,
is also of Great-Oolite age, though deposited under somewhat dif
 ferent conditions from those at Bichmond.
    The Great-Oolite strata at Bichmond rest on beds of red and
variegated sandstones and " marls," the former exhibiting much
false-bedding. These strata have not yielded any fossils ; but their
Iithological characters seem to indicate that they belong to the
New Bed Sandstone formation. These discoveries have an im
portant bearing on several very interesting geological problems.
    (1) The great Palaeozoic ridge beneath the London Basin is shown
to have been overlapped, in part or altogether, by strata of the
Lower Oolites, the Lias being absent I That representatives of the
Middle Oolites were also present is shown by the derived fossils in
the Neocomian strata along the base of the North Downs.
    (2) Pervious beds of the Lower Greensand, which probably
underlie part of the Southern Metropolitan area, are proved not to

 reach so far north as Richmond. The presence of pervions beds of
 the New Red may possibly be found to compensate in some degree
for the absence of the Neocomian as a source of water-supply.
   (3) The discussion of these facts throws some new light on the
problem of the existence of Coal-bearing strata at workable depths
under London. Small particles of anthracite were found in several
of the deeper beds at Richmond, these being probably derived
from Coal-seams in the great Palaeozoic axis ; but tho presence of
Jurassic and Triassic strata shows that a greater thickness of strata
will probably have to be pierced in order to reach the coal than
was formerly supposed.
   The paper concludes with some notes on the very interesting and
beautifully preserved fossils from the Great Oolite beds under
London.

OBSERVATIONS ON EARTH CURRENTS IN LINES A KILOMETRE IN
   LENGTH, AND THEIR COMPARISONS WITH MAGNETIC VARIA
   TIONS. BT H. WILD.
THE International Congress of Electricians which met in Paris
      from the 16th to the 26th October, 1882, formulated the
following resolutions among others :—
   " It hopes that certain lines, even of small length, independent
of the general telegraph system of each country, will be ex
clusively devoted to the investigation of earth currents."
   Thanks to the kindness of the Directorate of Russian Telegraphy,
the Meteorological and Magnetic Observatory of Paulowsk has
already, since the month of August 1882, been in possession of two
submarine lines, each a kilometre in length, one being perpendi
cular and the other parallel to the magnetic meridian. Each of these
lines is connected with an aperiodic galvanometer set up in the
underground pavilion for observing magnetic variations; so that
the readings of the scale may be made at the same time as those of
the variation instruments. The Observatory of Paulowsk was thus
in a position to realize the hope of the Congress ; and earth cur
rents have been regularly observed in these two lines during the
period of the Polar Expedition (that is. from the 1st of September
1882 to the 1st of September 1 883) three times a day, and on the
special days of observation every five minutes for twenty-four
hours.
   In a paper (Merrwires de VAcad. imp. des Sc. de St. Petersbourg,
vol. xxxv. No. 12) I described in detail the method of observation
which I used in these researches. I particularly dwelt on the dif
ficulty which arises in these short lines from the different electro
motive force of the electrodes ; so that we must distinguish clearly
between the earth current properly so called, which bifurcates
in the lines by the electrodes (or earth plates), and the currents
which are only due to the electrical difference of these plates. By

560           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
combining, in various ways, the four electrodes of our two lines, I
 succeeded in separating the two classes of currents, and in drawing
from my observations the following conclusions :—
    (1) The difference in the electrical potential of the earth for
two points at a distance of 1 kilometre, and in the most favour
able direction, is in any case less than O001 volt for a time of
magnetic calm—that is to say, free from magnetic disturbances ;
while the difference of the electromotive force of the electrodes
may reach 0-05 volt. During magnetic storms the earth currents
become stronger ; but even then their potential rarely exceeds this
latter limit, 0-05, in lines a kilometre in length.
    (2) The electromotive difference of the electrodes placed at a
depth of 2 metres below the surface, and connected by well-insu
lated wires, is for some time so constant that we may look upon
any appreciable change iu the ordinary current due to the elec
trodes as the manifestation of an earth current properly so
called.
    (3) The ratio between the force of the branch earth current
and of the current due to the electrodes is independent of the re
sistance of the lines and of the dimensions of the electrodes, and
only increases with the distance of these latter. In order to be
certain about an observation of an earth current properly so called
during a time of magnetic calm, if indeed an earth current does
exist at such periods, the lines should be 50 kilometres in*h?ngth.
Only by using earth plates more uniform than they are usually, is
it possible to observe this current in shorter lines, that is V kilo
metre in length.
    (4) The resistance of the earth for electrodes a metre square
and at a distance of 1 kilometre, is equal to from 30 to 60 ohms.
Assuming that the total resistance of the circuit, including the
galvanometer, does not exceed 100 ohms, we could observe earth
currents in such lines by means of a mirror-galvanometer, in
which the value of a division of the scale is equal to 0'000002
ampere. The deflections by earth currents will rarely exceed
 +250 parts of the scale even during magnetic storms.
   Since the publication of the paper mentioned, the calculation of the
observations made regularly during the period- from September 1882
to September 1S83 has been so far advanced as to enable me to
communicate to the Academy some interesting results which I have
deduced from them :—
   1. The earth-current at Faulowsk in our lines of one kilometre
in length is usually manifested not as a current which flows for
some time in a certain direction, and the force of which varies
slowly, but as more or less strong alternating currents, which change
rather rapidly their direction in space.
   2. The component of the earth current which appears in the
E.-W. line is generally stronger than that observed in the N.-S.
line ; the direction approaches therefore the parallels rather than
the meridians.
   3. The observations of the term-days, token separately each day,

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            561
do not show a daily course of the earth current either in respect of
magnitude or number of oscillations. But taking the mean of 24
term-days, a sufficiently distinct, though small, daily course is seen.
The current in the S.-N. line indicates a maximum between 4 and
5 o'clock in the morning, and a minimum at 8 o'clock in the evening ;
and the current in the W.-E. line a maximum at 8 a.m., and a
minimum at 1 p.m. The amplitude of this oscillation is very small,
only corresponding for the two components to about 0-0008 volt.
This variation does not coincide with the normal variation of the
magnetic elements ; and it follows that the daily variation of the
earth currents cannot be regarded as the origin of the daily varia
tion of the magnetic elements.
   4. As soon as the earth current shows itself in the two lines
with greater force, the magnetic instruments begin to diverge from
their regular course ; and these disturbances increase in general
with the strength of the earth currents without there being any
strict proportionality between the two classes of phenomena. On
the loth of November, 1882, for instance, the earth currents
showed themselves in greater strength in the two lines than on the
1st of March, 1883 ; and nevertheless the course of the magnetic
instrument on the first of these days was far more irregular than on
 his latter day.
   5. If, as Sir Q. Airy has already done for similar observations
at the' Greenwich Observatory, we compare the current in the
S.-N. line with the changes in the declination, and the current in
the W.-E. line with the changes in horizontal intensity, we often
find, especially for somewhat slow changes, perfect equality between
these two kinds of disturbances ; but the variation of the current
always precedes that of the earth's magnetism by at least five
minutes, so that the current appears as the primary cause of this
latter. Thus the motion of the magnetic apparatus is always that
which would be required by the fundamental law of electromag-
netism, if the earth current had a direct influence on the magnets.
If, for instance, a positive current from north to south shows
itself in the N.-S. line, the easterly declination of the needle in
creases at the same time ; and if in the E.- W. line a positive cur
rent goes from east to west, the horizontal intensity of terrestrial
magnetism becomes greater—that is to say, the north pole of the
bifilur moves towards the north.
   The retardation which the indications of the magnetic instru
ments experience relatively to those of the galvanometer could be
explained by the hypothesis that the earth current, which directly
influences the magnets of the galvanometers, only acts on the varia
tion instruments by the magnetization on the more or less thick
layers of earth, and this requires a certain time.
   6. This retardation in the effects of the earth current explains,
partially at any rate, the want of strict proportionality between
the variations of the current and the magnetic elements. It is
observed that the proportionality fails particularly when the changes
in the current are very frequent and alternating ; and it is more

5G2           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
complete ou those days on which the disturbances are not sudden.
Now it will be readily understood that in the former case the tran
sitory currents in opposite directions which rapidly succeed each
other, will be partially destroyed by the magnetization of the earth,
so that the variations of the magnetic instruments will be relatively
smaller. The observations of the 15th November, 1882, and of
1st March, 1883, as well as the curves registered by the magneto-
graph, support this explanation. The curves registered on the
1st of March show by the clearness of the lines a relatively tranquil
course of the magnets, although the slow disturbances have been
somewhat large ; and, in consequence, the curves drawn from the
readings of the galvanometers are not very marked, and those of
the S.-N. current are very similar to the curves of the unitilar,
while those of the E.-W. current are in close agreement with the
registrations of the bitilar. On the other hand, the two kinds of
curves of November 15 show little agreement with each other ;
and although the variations of the two currents are very great and
very rapid, the registers of the niagnetograph, as well as the direct
observations of the magnetic instruments, do not show great pertur
bations ; but if we examine more closely the curves registered, we
easily observe the traces of a permanent oscillation of magnets
within small limits.
   We may then conclude that earth currents are always the primary
cause of magnetic storms, but not of tlie periodical variations of the
magnetic elements.
   Observations on earth currents in the telegraph lines of Austria,
which Director Muller of Pola has kindly communicated to me,
show that in long lines also the earth current is seen in the same
way as in our very short b!nes—that is to say, a a rapid series of
alternating currents. It follows from this, that earth currents at
the time of magnetic storms are usually currents of induction and
discharge ; this is entirely in harmony with the connexion between
these storms and aurora boreales, which the experiments of M.
Lemstrdm entitle us to consider as discharges of atmospheric and
terrestrial electricity.
   Unfortunately the observations of earth currents in some of the
longer Russian telegraph lines, which were projected for the epoch
of the Pclar expeditions, have not been made. It was therefore
not possible for me to compare the observations of our short lines
with those of the longer ones starting from the same point, so as
to learn how far the currents of the two kinds of lines are in
agreement. But as in any case the telegraph lines could only have
been at our disposal for a short time, and as there are as yet no
underground lines in Russia, I think for the present it would be
more useful for such comparisons to have at our disposal lines in
all respects similar to those a kilometre long which we already have,
but five to ten times as long.—Bulletin de TAcademic des Sciences

  ON THE ABSOLUTE STANDARD OF LIGHT.            BY PROF. J. VIOLLE.
   The investigation of the radiation emitted by melted silver had
essentially for its object the verification of the principle of that
method which consists in taking a metal at its fusing-point as
standard of light, a suggestion which I made at the International
Congress of Electricians in Paris in 1881.
   Preliminary investigations having established the constancy of
the radiation during the solidification, I was able to attempt with
certainty the realization of the absolute standard.
   I take as absolute unit of light the radiation from the surface of
1 square centim. of platinum at its solidifyiug-point.
   In order to get a definite multiple of the unit it is sufficient to
increase the surface.
   The Carcel lamp of Dumas and Begnault's pattern having been
adopted as the usual secondary standard, I endeavoured in the first
place to settle its value compared with my principal standard. By
various methods, which closely agreed, I found for the value of the
standard Carcel lamp C,
                              C- 1 ¦
from which, taking the surface into account, it is concluded that
the intrinsic intensity of our standard is almost eleven times that of
the Carcel lamp.
   I also worked with electrical foci. The comparison with our stan
 dard was found to be satisfactory in practice. I shall merely adduce
experiments with incandescent lamps, the constancy and colour of
 which render the comparison with platinum easy and certain.
   A Swan lamp was fed by a battery of thirty Kabath accumu
lators. By means of a resistance-box in the circuit, the conditions
could be varied. An observer noted each minute the strength of the
 current i, and the fall of the potential between the terminals of
the lamp. It was only necessary therefore to take the photometric
 measurement, and note the corresponding condition of the lamp, to
 get its illuminating-power E, special experiments made at the
 beginning and end of each series having established this illumina
 ting-power for different values of ie. The relative values of E given
 below are independent of possible variations of Carcel's lamp.
   In order to compare the electric lamp with the standard, a
 Bunsen's photometer was used which could be moved about between
 the two sources, which were at a distance from each other of 4 metres.
 The rays emitted by the platinum being directed horizontally by
 means of a mirror of 45°, the total effective distance was about
 4-54 metres. It was each time determined exactly ; we shall
 denote it by A, and shall call D the distance of the platinum from
 the photometer.
    In the first set of experiments three different observers made
 each six measurements. Of the eighteen determinations thus

564          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
obtained we may deduce as many values of the expression ———    ED5 ,
representing the intensity in Carcels of the light reflected by the
mirror above the platinum. In respect of the observers, these
values divide into three groups, the respective means of which are
                 G                                 7-018

In respect of the lamp they still divide into three groups :—

   The photometric measurements agree well with the electrical ones.
They give for the standard Carcel J^og' a v&lue near that which we
found directly.
    In conclusion, platinum at its melting-point fulfils the con
 ditions which we can require for an absolute standard of light ; it
 depends on a perfectly definite and constant physical phenomenon,
 and being of a suitable magnitude it forms a practical term of
 comparison with the usual standards.— Comptts Bendus, April 28,
