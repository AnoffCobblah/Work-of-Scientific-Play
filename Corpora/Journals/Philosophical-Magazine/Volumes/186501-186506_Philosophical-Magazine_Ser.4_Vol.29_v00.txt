                             metal occurs
       in combination with    oxygen, sulphur,  and tellurium, in a
small vein in the lower Silurian      clay-slates  of the mountain
Illamput in Bolivia. The mine of San Baldomero opened upon
this vein is situated but little under the line of perpetual snow,
and has an elevation of between 14,000 and 15,000 feet above
the level of the sea. The vein cuts through the lower Silurian
strata, here tilted up at a very high angle (nearly vertical), and
has to some extent altered these strata: in immediate contact
with the vein, a sahlband of from a few lines to some inches in
width is seen in the rock on each side of the vein, the thickness
of the sahlband being dependent on the relative strength of the
vein itself; this is much darker in colour than the less altered
rock, and has evidently been altered in chemical composition by
the action of the mineral matter of the vein, most probably by
the sulphur and arsenic present; at a greater distance the slates
are only hardened or, as it were, baked by heat, and not more
altered than that the abundant fossils in them are well preserved

2                Mr. D. Forbes's   Researches on the
Ctenodonta, &c.; in fact hand specimens were obtained consist
ing of ore and veinstone containing, in the latter, fossils in a
perfectly recognizable condition.
   The geological examination of the environs appeared to prove
that this and other veins in the neighbourhood had been pro
duced by the eruption of the large mass of granite (auriferous)
further to the west, with which the veins are most probably con
temporaneous.
   The age of the granite itself was considered to be    of the middle
Silurian period.
    The minerals found present in this vein were-Danaite or
cobaltiferous mispickel, mispickel, bismuth, bismuth-glance, bis
muth-ochre, carbonate of bismuth, telluric bismuth, gold, apa
tite, iron pyrites, zincblende, tourmaline, epidote, calcspar, and
quartz. The main mass of the lode was Danaite, which also
formed the base for the mining exploration.
    The native bismuth was found more abundantly on the sur
face of the vein, and became very rare as the workings in the
mine increased in depth; it occurred in irregular lumps or
masses, and frequently as if wedged in between the walls of the
lode.    The largest mass found in one piece weighed about 400
pounds, and had one side entirely overlaid with a thin plate
of gold of a rather light colour, not more than 0.05 inch in thick
ness, adherent and as if soldered to the bismuth.
    No crystals of bismuth were observed; but on fracture the
basal cleavage was perfect, and the fresh surfaces showed the
peculiar reddish-white colour so characteristic of this metal.
    The specific gravities of two separate specimens quite free from
extraneous matter were found respectively to be 998 and 977
at 60°Fahr.       The analysis was conducted as follows:—
    The arsenic was determined by fusing 25-08 grs. in fine
powder, with a mixture of 80 grs. pure nitrate of potash along
with 100 grs. pure carbonate of soda in a silver crucible; the
mass was extracted with water, acidified by hydrochloric acid,
and the arsenic precipitated as arseniate of magnesia and ammonia
by the addition of a mixture of ammonia, chloride of ammonium,
and sulphate of magnesia.        0.270 gr. arseniate of ammonia and
magnesia were obtained, equivalent to 0-097 arsenic, or to 0-38
per cent. arsenic in the bismuth.
    The sulphur was determined by suspending 50.01 grs. bis
muth in finest powder in a solution of potash, and passing a
stream of chlorine gas through until    all the bismuth was oxidized
 (this required very long time); the solution was then rendered
                 a
more acid   by   additionof  hydrochloric acid to  prevent any tellu
rate of  barytes  being   simultaneously  precipitated,  and the sul
phuric acid precipitated   by   the addition  of  chlorideof   barium.

The precipitated sulphate of baryta weighed 0-26 gr., equivalent
to 0.07 per cent. sulphur in the bismuth.
   The tellurium present was determined by dissolving a fresh
portion of bismuth, weighing 45-55 grs., in nitric acid, neutrali
zing with ammonia, then adding sulphide of ammonium in excess,
with which it was allowed to stand, being shaken occasionally, for
some five days. The insoluble sulphide of bismuth was filtered
off and washed with water containing sulphide of ammonium.
The filtrate was now treated with an excess of hydrochloric acid,
throwing down the sulphide of tellurium along with free sulphur
and a little sulphide of arsenic; these were digested with nitric
acid until the sulphur was quite pure, filtered, and the solution,
previously strongly acidified and heated with hydrochloric acid
to reduce        all
                telluric acid present, was treated with     stream                           a               of
                                                                     an all
sulphurous acid passed through         until   tellurium
                                                       it present   had
been thrown down, allowed          stand       atmosphere
                                               to              sulphu

rous acid, and then the precipitate was washed with sulphurous
acid and dried with proper precautions.          The tellurium thus
obtained weighed 2:425 grs., equivalent             5:09 per cent.            to                             in
the metallic bismuth.
   In order       to
                 see    any silver was present
                            if                      the mineral, three         in
several  portions,   respectively   weighing  40-50,   50-0, and 92.0
grs., were cupelled;             in    of no
                                 case was any visible trace       silver                          of

4.                   Mr. D. Forbes’s    Researches on the
    Bismuthine.—As before mentioned, this mineral is found at
the San Baldomero mine, where it occurs both in the form of
scales incrusting the masses of native metallic bismuth, and b
itself in small compact masses having a very highly developed
foliated structure.        It occasionally occurs in long and fine aci
cular   crystals,    which sometimes have an iridescent lustre, and
frequently are so intermingled with slender needles of black tour
maline as to present a very peculiar and at first glance puzzling
appearance.
    Frequently perfect single crystals of mispickel are found im
bedded in the more compact variety. The largest specimens
found never exceeded half a pound in weight; in no case were
defined crystals obtained, and in only one case were the needles
or plates observed to have terminal faces.
    Two perfect cleavages, with occasionally a less distinct third
cleavage-plane, were present, and the faces of cleavage invariably
possessed a      brilliant metallic lustre.
     Hardness was never found above 2, and sometimes appeared
rather less.
     Specific gravity of a pure very compact specimen was found
to be 7.16 at 60° Fahr.
    The chemical examination was conducted as follows:—The de
termination of the sulphur was made by heating 20:02 grs. of
the pure mineral in finest powder, with a mixture of 60 grs. pure
nitrate of potash along with 70 grs. pure carbonate of soda in a
silver crucible; it glowed gently and became semifused, but did
not flow. The mass, on cooling, was digested with water and
thrown on to a filter to separate the oxide of bismuth, which was
well washed. . The filtrate was then acidified with hydrochloric
acid and precipitated by the addition of a solution of chloride of
barium.        The sulphate of barytes thus thrown down was col
lected as     usual,  and weighed 28°46 grs., equal to 3.926 grs. sul
phur, or 1961 per cent. sulphur in the mineral. The bismuth
 was now estimated by dissolving the oxide left upon the filter, as
 above mentioned, in nitric acid, and precipitating the solution
 with carbonate of ammonia in excess. The precipitate, well
washed and ignited, afforded 18:03 grs. oxide of bismuth, cor
responding to 16:202 grs. metallic bismuth, or 80.93 per cent.
in the mineral.
    An equal amount of the original mineral was examined for
 arsenic, using the process employed in the case of examining
native bismuth for this substance; no trace however was found+.
    * I may mention that in analyzing another specimen of this mineral  I
found 190 per cent. arsenic present; but I satisfied myself that this was

Silver, iron, nickel, and cobalt were also specially examined for,
but not found present in the mineral.
   42-01 grs. of the mineral in fine powder were now examined
for tellurium by the same process as is described in the case of
native bismuth. No tellurium, however, was found present. The
analysis will therefore stand as follows:–

   Considering the atomic equivalent of bismuth as 106, and that
of sulphur as 16, the formula Biº Sº would require the following
percentage composition:—
      Bismuth, 2 atoms .       .  .    212 or percentage 81-53
      Sulphur, 3 atoms .     .  .  .    48       22       18°47

   Mispickel—This mineral only occurs crystallized in the San
Baldomero mine when in small drusic cavities or close to the
walls of the vein, where the crystals are frequently found protru
ding from the surface of the massive mineral and imbedded in
carbonate of lime, or, as before stated, in the bismuthine.      All
              I
the crystals have observed belong to the trimetric system, and
are rhombic octahedrons more or less modified, most generally
as twin crystals.     Perfect octahedrons are occasionally found,
but only when imbedded in the soft bismuthine.          No cleavage
planes could be observed.       Colour: silver-white to grey-white;
but fresh surfaces tarnish quickly, becoming of a brassy colour
on exposure.
   The specific gravity was found to be 6'255 at 60°Fahr. When
heated alone, the mineral first evolves sulphide of arsenic and
then metallic arsenic, and leaves sulphide of iron containing a
trace of cobalt and nickel.
   The chemical analysis was conducted as follows:–
   23:42 grs. in finest powder were intimately mixed with 60
grs. pure nitrate of potash previously mixed with 60 grs. pure
anhydrous carbonate of soda, and fused in a silver crucible ; the
mass deflagrated very gently, but a strong smell of arsenic was
observed; it did not flow; the whole on cooling was digested
with water, and, after filtration and washing, the filtrate was
acidified by hydrochloric acid, and the sulphuric acid precipitated
by addition of a solution of chloride of barium. The sulphate of
barytes collected amounted to 33'16 grs., equal to 4.575 grs.
sulphur, or 19,534 per cent. in the mineral.
   The insoluble oxides were now dissolved in hydrochloric acid,
neutralized by ammonia, and the iron separated from the cobalt,

6                  Mr. D. Forbes's     Researches on the
nickel, and manganese present by the use of succinate of am
monia with the usual precautions. The succinate of iron, redis
solved in hydrochloric acid and reprecipitated by ammonia,
afforded 11.78 grs. sesquioxide of iron, equal to 8-173 grs. iron,
or 34.47 per cent. in the mineral.
   The solution, or rather filtrate, separated from the oxide of iron
was now precipitated by sulphide of ammonium; this precipitate,
collected, incinerated, dissolved in nitric hydrochloric acid, and
precipitated by potash, gave 0.19 gr. oxide of cobalt, nickel, and
manganese, which were arsenized and separated according to
Plattner's method by the blowpipe, giving 0.171 quadribasic
arsenide of cobalt, equal to 0-104 metallic cobalt, or 0.44 per
cent. in the mineral, and 0.09 quadribasic arsenide of nickel,
equal to 0.0056 metallic nickel, or 0.03 per cent., whilst the
manganese was estimated by the difference.            The determination
of arsenic was attempted in precisely the same manner as that
of the sulphur, as described above; but notwithstanding every
precaution, I could not have any confidence in the result, as
after three attempts I noticed in each case the smell of garlic
indicative of some evolution of arsenic.         I therefore modified the
process as  follows:—20.05 grs. mineral in fine powder was placed
in a porcelain crucible and drenched with pure nitric acid until
no further oxidation took place.           Carbonate of soda was added
to take   up  the   superfluous  nitric   acid,  and more carbonate of
soda along with nitrate of potash added to make up the same
quantities as those used in determining the sulphur.             The whole
was heated to dryness, removed to a silver crucible and fused;
the residue was digested with water as usual, and the arsenic
determined in the filtrate, after acidifying it by hydrochloric
acid, as arseniate of ammonia and magnesia, which, when ignited
with the usual precautions, gave 1884 grs.2MgO AsO", equal to
9-116 grs. arsenic, or 45-46 per cent. arsenic in the mineral+.
   The results of this examination, when tabulated, will now stand
as  follows:—
                     Arsenic    .    .   .   .   45-46

  * had the curiosity to make a determination of the arsenic by simply
fusing with nitrate of potash and carbonate of soda as before mentioned,
and only obtained 38.59 per cent. of arsenic, a loss of 6.87 percent., which
shows how unsafe this method is.

   Danaite.—In the analysis of the mispickel above given, I had
fully expected to find considerably more cobalt than actually
was found; for it must be remembered that this mispickel had
crystallized out of the Danaite, to which it bears a proportion
quite insignificant, as the Danaite forms the entire mass of the
vein, which occasionally has presented a solid mass of the mineral
having a breadth of more than ten feet between the walls.
   The Danaite was never found crystallized, but formed a com
pact mass, possessing a granular, fibrous, or foliated structure,
and more or less crystalline appearance. The specific gravity of
the fibrous variety, which probably is the most pure, was found
to be 6'94 at 60°Fahr., of the granular variety 5-86; but this
was invariably intermixed with more or less quartz or gangue in
a very fine state of dissemination.          Several analyses were made
by the methods described under mispickel, and the following
percentages show the average composition derived from their
results:—

a portion of the iron to have been replaced by the cobalt, nickel,
and manganese here present.
   Nickeliferous Mispickel—From Mr. Philip Kroeber              I received
a specimen                              I
             of this mineral which have not before seen described
in any of the published works upon mineralogy. The mineral
occurs as a vein in the lower Silurian slates in the Cordilleras
 between La Paz and Yungas in Bolivia, about 5 leagues from
 Unduavi, at a place called by the Indians Chacaltaya. The
geological relations of this vein are very similar to those described
in the case of the vein of San Baldomero, and it has doubtless
originated from the same cause, the outburst of the same granite.
    More or less distinct crystals occur, and pertain to the trimetric

8                 Mr. D. Forbes's Researches on the
system.     The prisms are found striated parallel to their longer
axis, and twins are most common.             Lustre metallic; colour
tin-white to steel-grey, tarnishing quickly to a greenish-grey
tinge. The crystals, when situated in quartz, are frequently
coloured a fine green on their surfaces, evidently from the
nickel present.      The ore also, when exposed to the air and
weather, assumes a fine apple-green colour from the same cause.
 Streak black to dark grey. Fracture uneven, brittle.         Specific
gravity  47   at 60°   Fahr.    A  chemical examination was made by
 Mr. Philip Kroeber which       gave the following results:—

   Mispickel.—Another        variety of mispickel, occurring likewise
in veins in the lower Silurian formation, is found at Inquisivi in
Bolivia, where   it is associated with Danaite, native bismuth, and
an undetermined and probably new mineral in hexagonal crystals
with perfect basal cleavage and having a great resemblance to
dark brown zincblende, in a large quartz vein.
   The crystals obtained were too imperfect for measurement,
but evidently belonged to the trimetric system; no defined
cleavage-plane was observed.          Colour dark steel-grey; lustre
dull metallic; streak dark greyish black. Non-magnetic. Hard
ness 5'5, scratching apatite, but not orthoclase.
   The specific gravity at 60°Fahr. was found to be 6'170.
 . Before   the blowpipe in a closed tube it gave off, first some
trace of sulphur, then sulphide of arsenic, and lastly metallic
arsenic.                                                              -
   In  the oxidizing flame it gave off sulphur and arsenic; and
with borax glass, slagged off entirely with reaction for iron, but
showed no appreciable quantity of copper, nickel, or cobalt
present.
   An assay by cupellation afforded a trace of silver containing
gold, which latter appeared present in larger quantity than
the silver.
   The analysis was performed exactly as in the case of the mis
pickel from San Baldomero mine, with the exception that the
arsenic was determined as loss.       The results were as follows:—

which conforms to the usual formula for mispickel, FeS2+ FeAs.
   I  may mention that       I   examined the Danaite which is asso
ciated with this   mineral,     and found in various specimens a per
centage of cobalt (with trace of nickel) which varied from I-81
to 3.9 per cent. metallic cobalt.
   Antimonial Galena.-Considerable veins of antimonial galena
are worked between La Paz and Yungas on the eastern slope of
the Andes, chiefly for the amount of silver contained in them.
The mines are situated in veins which cut at very high angles
through the lower Silurian slates, containing abundant fossils of
the genus Crusiana and Boliviana, as well as others not yet
determined.      Their geological relations are otherwise similar to
the veins hitherto treated of in this paper.                A specimen from
the Mina Pilar was examined              by  Mr.  Philip    Kroeber, who has
communicated the results to me.              The mineral which was ana
lyzed was quite free from gangue, but contained some minute
specks of iron pyrites and chalcopyrite; compact but foliated in
structure, and in colour of a light steel-grey tint and very lus
trous.    Its analysis afforded him—

   The associated minerals are quartz, calcspar, carbonate of iron,
iron pyrites, chalcopyrite, zincblende, cubic galena, Fahlerz, and
a new mineral, in strongly magnetic, copper-coloured crystals,
which   I have called Kroeberite, and which, though not yet ana
lyzed, appears to be principally a subsulphide of iron.              In some
specimens also there occurs some mineral containing cobalt,
most probably “Selenkobaltblei,” as the ore was found to con
tain on analysis more than 2 per cent. of cobalt.
   If  we look upon the iron and copper as combined with a
portion of the sulphur, forming iron or copper pyrites, we may
suppose the mineral here analyzed to pertain to the mineral
species Geokronite.       I add a tabulated statement of the various

   Weins of these antimonial galenas are met with almost every
where, cutting through the Silurian strata of South America.
They are generally crystallized, or rather more or less crystal
line; and although they can be procured free from apparent
mechanical admixture of other minerals, yet it is extremely diffi
cult to determine the mineral species to which they belong
merely by an examination of their external and physical charac
ters, and it is most probable that a closer examination will show
the presence of at least more than one new mineral species per
                                                                     -
taining to this class.
    The specific gravities of these varieties differ considerably, yet
not sufficiently to be a decisive criterion as to the species; eight
varieties of what appeared to be antimonial galena from different
mines in the department of La Paz, Bolivia, gave respectively
the following specific gravities taken at 60°Fahr. :—
          5:25, 5.302, 5:49, 5:49, 6:515, 7:07, 7:20, 7:41;
and    I have       no doubt that on further trial many intermediate
numbers would be found ; indeed it would seem as if the sul
phides of antimony and lead would combine in any proportion.
II.    On the relative          Heating, by Solar Radiation, of              the    Soil
   and      of    the  Air,   on a Mountain and in a Plain.                    By M.

Th;           sun's rays falling on the top of a mountain ought,
         theoretically, to be warmer than those which, after traver
sing the lower and denser strata of our atmosphere, reach the
adjacent plain, since these strata necessarily absorb a consider
able quantity of the heat of such rays.                 Observation fully con
firms the prediction of theory in this case.                   All travellers who
have ascended          high   mountains have been         surprised      at the great

heat of the sun’s rays and of the ground, when compared with
the temperature of the air in the shade, or with that of the soil
at night. As early as 1842, MM. Peltier and Bravais made,
from the 10th to the 18th of August, a series of bi-hourly
observations on the temperatures of the air and of the soil
on the summit of the Faulhorn, a Swiss mountain which rises
to a height of 2680 metres above the level of the sea. Experi
ments of a similar kind were made by Bravais and myself, two
years afterwards, on the same mountain, between the 21st of
 September and the 2nd of October. The 125 observations
comprised in these two series, and which were continued from
 six in the morning to six at night, both in fair weather and in
foul, under cloudy as well as cloudless skies, gave, notwithstand
 ing, a mean temperature of 11°75 for the soil during the day,
 that of the air being only 5°40. It thus became evident that
 during the day the soil was heated by the sun twice as much as
 was the air. We did not know, however, what, during the same
 period, had been the relative heating of the soil and the air in
 the Swiss plaims.    For a long time I was anxious to remove this
 incompleteness, by determining the relative heating of the same
 kind of soil, at the same moment, on a lofty mountain and on an
  open plain, when the sky was pure and the air calm. Bagnères
  de-Bigorre and the Pic du Midi appeared to me to possess                                              all

I  was able to select twenty corresponding and perfectly com
parable observations, made alike under a pure sky, in full sun
light and in calm air: these coincidences occurred between 7 in
the morning and 2 in the afternoon.
    With reference, first, to the heating of the superficial soil, the
mean of the twenty observations on the temperature of the air in
the shade was 22°3 at Bagnères, and only 10° 1 at the Pic du
Midi. The mean temperature of the surface of the soil was 36°l
at Bagnères, and 33°8 at the Pic. The mean excess of the
temperature of the soil above that of the air at Bagnères had
 consequently to the like excess at the Pic the ratio of 10 to 17;
in other words, it was nearly double on the mountain. Further,
 although the mean temperature of the soil in the plain was 2°3
 above that of the soil on the mountain; still, on the 10th of
September, between 11 and 11.30 A.M. (after which latter time
the Pic became enveloped in clouds), the temperature of the soil
at    its

and without comparison of estimated with calculated results,
which it would be very hard to conduct satisfactorily, think                                     I        I
may give this phenomenon as a confirmation of Sir David Brew
ster's view, subject to the qualification above stated, which he
applies himself in a particular class of cases at pages 209, 210,
and 217.
   That such a surface is given by the theory is evident. The
visual rays approach without limit to parallelism, as you run
your eyes away along the wall: they are parallel also when the
four quantities following are proportional, the distances of the
eyes and of the points to be combined from the intersection of
the wall by the line through the eyes. When these are propor
tional to one another, they are proportional to their differences.
So the direction of the second asymptote is that of the base of a
triangle whose sides are in direction and magnitude the distances
between the eyes and between the points to be combined. The
latter distance is in these patterns constant in magnitude, and
must be positive if the stereoscopic combination is direct, and
negative if converse, provided that the directions containing the
acute angle are taken to be of the same sign. The surface is
cylindrical, because the points to be combined in any part of the
pattern, and therefore the lines through them from fixed points,
and the intersection of these,                               all
                                     have for orthogonal projections
points and lines answering the same description         the horizontal                in
plane.

the wall, and is convex to the observer; the other branch

of which one is concealed from the corresponding eye, is invi

consists of three compartments, of which the median takes in
the visible rays, and the two others, respectively, the rays of
greater refrangibility and of less refrangibility than corresponds
to visible or light-rays. In order to avoid circumlocution, and
the ambiguity which attaches to the terms actually in use, it is
proposed to adopt in the sequel the following momenclature for
the above-mentioned three classes of rays.     The visible rays will
be called Newtonic, those of greater refrangibility Ritteric, and
finally those of smaller refrangibility Herschellic—the       name
being formed in each case from that of the discoverer of the
particular class of rays.   By means of this nomenclature it is
easy to give a complete list of the transmutations of rays a priori
possible, and which accordingly is here appended:—
                                Transmutations.
   (1)      Of Ritteric rays into Ritteric rays of less refrangibility.
                                                                        -
   (2)      Of Ritteric rays into Newtonic rays.
   (3)      Of Ritteric rays into Herschellic rays.
   (4)      Of Newtonic rays into Newtonic rays of less refrangibility.
   (5)      Of Newtonic rays into Herschellic rays.
     (6)    Of Herschellic rays into Herschellic rays of less refran
               gibility.
     (7)    Of Herschellic     rays into        Herschellic rays of greater                   re
               frangibility.
  (8)       Of Herschellic rays into Newtonic rays.
  (9)       Of Herschellic rays into Ritteric rays.
 (10)       Of Newtonic rays into Newtonic rays of                        greater     refran
               gibility.
 (11)       Of Newtonic rays into Ritteric rays.
 (12)       Of Ritteric rays into Ritteric rays of                        greater     refran
               gibility.
   4. Degradation and Elevation.—Of the      enumerated     twelve
species of transmutations, the phenomena     of fluorescence and                                     s
phosphorescence afford only instances under (2) and (4); for, as
previously stated, these phenomena consist in an emission of
light, or Newtonic rays, consequent upon the incidence of either
Newtonic or Ritteric rays, subject to the law that in every case
the refrangibility of the emitted rays is less than that of the
incident.  This law, which has particular reference to those
cases where the incident rays are Newtonic ones, has been found

true whenever the incident rays are Ritteric ones, the presump
tion has arisen that only such transmutations may actually occur
in nature as involve a decrease of refrangibility in the emitted
ray as compared with the incident.           If such were the case, it is
evident that the      species  of transmutations instanced above from
under (1) to (6) would alone be possible, whilst the remainder
would be impossible by the nature of things.                  Among the
transmutations the        possibility  of which is thus more or less
directly negatived, the species (8) and (10), forming in some
sense the counterpart of those properly comprised under fluores
cence and phosphorescence (namely of (2) and of (4)), it would
 undoubtedly be of the greatest importance to effect. A simple
 consideration of well-known facts will show that the transmu
 tations (8) and (10) may probably be effected.
     5. Calcescence.—The metals, by Professor Stokes, are classed
 among non-fluorescent substances”, and by M. E. Becquerel, to
 whom, as is well known, the most delicate observations on phos
 phorescence are due, among non-phosphorescent substancest—
 Professor Stokes having been unable to elicit Newtonic rays from
 metals by the means found efficient with fluorescent substances,
 and M. Becquerel having been unable to detect any persistency
 of luminosity in metals exposed to the treatment of the phospho
 roscope.      On the other hand, it is well known that metals may
 be rendered self-luminous or incandescent by contact with flames
 of high temperature, by electrical and other means; and, though
  no experiment appears to be on record affording clear evidence
  of the fact, it is impossible to doubt that the same effect might
  also be produced by solar radiation of sufficient intensity.            If
  this latter assertion be founded on truth, it must be evident that
 all   metals, in  the wide sense        the word, are fluorescent, and

    schellic rays, to which, for some reason or other, a greater heat

    possible also to produce by any given luminous or Newtonic
    radiation incandescence of such intensity that some of the New

    ences, the author, conjointly with Mr. G. Griffith, Deputy-Pro
    fessor of Experimental Philosophy in the University of Oxford,
    has instituted the following experiments.        At the focus of
    an   ordinary concave  glass mirror,  measuring   some 2' across”,
    and irradiated  by the  sun, a piece of platinum-foil was exposed,
    attached to the bottom of an opake tube, so that the back side
    of the foil might be observed free from the interference of any
    extraneous light, such light only being seen as the foil itself
    might emit on becoming incandescent.      On days of powerful
    sunshine the platinum became vividly incandescent, and, viewed
    by means of a pocket-spectroscope            (which was inserted in the
    above-mentioned         tube), a spectrum exhibiting          the visible          all                    or
    Newtonic rays might                   be

   One interesting observation, made in the course of preparing
for the preceding experiments, may be worthy of mention. The
platinum being rendered incandescent in the focus of the mirror
by insolation, a film of water of some 2" thickness, contained
between thin sheets of glass, was interposed, and no other dia
phragm, when the luminosity of the platinum quite disappeared,
just as upon the interposition of the red-glass diaphragm. By
the experiments of Masson and Jaminº, the absorption exerted
by glass and water of the thickness described upon the visible or
 Newtonic rays is extremely small, and according to Professor
W. A. Millert the same may be pronounced also with regard to
 the absorption of the Ritteric rays; but, on the other hand, it
is well known that glass, and even more so water, very power
fully absorb the invisible Herschellic rays. It is evident,therefore,
that the sudden disappearance of the incandescence of the plati
num-foil upon the interposition of the above water-and-glass
diaphragm is owing mainly to the abstraction of a great amount
of Herschellic rays from the incident beam. Hence it is proved
that in the first-described experiment, where     the three species                     all
  rays impinge upon the platinum, the Herschellic rays contribute
to of
   the production     incandescence—thatof      say,   luminous                  is   to        of                  or
Newtonic    rays—though     this does not actually prove  that Her
schellic rays              by
                  themselves are capable   causing incandescencef.         of

transmutation of Herschellic rays in the very act of emission.
By means of a couple of conjugate mirrors, having in one of the
foci an oxyhydrogen-flame, and in the other a piece of lime, the
phenomenon of the transmutation of Herschellic into higher
rays, thus spontaneously occurring in the production of the
common lime-light, might be made to assume the ordinary form
of fluorescent phenomena.
   8. Conclusion.—In the original communication a third class
of experiments promising to effect a conversion of Herschellic
rays into Newtonic was adduced, which, from            being almost                    its
entirely conjectural, shall                       be

also several distinctions   mentioned,    which most   probably  will
divide ordinary fluorescent phenomena from those         which atten                       to
tion has been directed      this paper. inTo distinguish these latter
phenomena from the former, the term Calcescence was suggested
to  the author, from calcium, the name        the characteristic che
mical constituent     lime, whose action

ever, and   of   the qualities required, were not           procured; and        to
it was thus necessary         employ much smaller ones, which were
                                     to

                     this manner some      the rays incident had

                                              incidence, and next after
reflexion. To obviate the objection arising from the incidence
of  side-light upon the platinum,           was proposed    it     employ                            to                 a
truncated tin cone, the base        which was formed  of       the dia                                   by
phragm itself, whilst the apex gave admittance                the tube                                  to
supporting the platinum+.             this manner,     In   rays could                             no

the  diaphragm;   but,                   on
                            the other hand, the cone itself would
have cast   ashadow                 on
                          the mirror,     the latter was placed

most favourable position.

ocular diaphragm when the red glass was used as an objective
diaphragm, was deep-green glass. Pieces of such glass were used
for insertion within the angular tube near the end where the eye
was placed, and were made moveable from without; so that the
incandescence of the platinum, when produced, could be viewed
either freely or through the ocular diaphragm.
    It will be seen that our arrangements were pretty well consi
dered. Unfortunately, when our preparations were nearly ma
tured, my collaborator, Prof. Griffith, as it appeared, was not
able to give to the subject so much of his time and attention as
it required, and towards August this year the experiments were
consequently allowed to drop unfinished.
      I
   (ii) have stated in a former Number of the Philosophical Maga
 zine my probable inability to pursue the subject-matter of this
paper any further, at least experimentally”.        Meanwhile      will            I
 take this occasion to make some remarks concerning experiments
 on artificial sources of rays.
    Our first trials at Oxford were made with a couple of brass
 reflectors and the flame of the oxyhydrogen jet, in the manner
 before described; but, no doubt in a great measure from the
 imperfect condition of the reflectors, the trials were not successful.
 It is evident that, instead of a couple of reflectors, a single re
 flector might be made to render practically the same service, the
 flame and the object to be rendered incandescent being respect
 ively placed at any two conjugate foci of the reflector. The oxyhy
  drogen jet has the advantage in these experiments of being
  comparatively deficient in Newtonic and Ritteric rays, which
  might hence be easily eliminated altogether without much detri
  ment to the Herschellic rays.       On the other hand, gases are
known to be but indifferent radiators as compared with solid
bodies, as was shown long ago by Mellonit.         Hence it might
be preferable perhaps to use lime-light for the purposes here in
question, instead of the pure oxyhydrogen-flame, as possibly the
Herschellic radiation of lime-light remaining after the Newtonic
and Ritteric rays have been eliminated by proper absorbents might
surpass in intensity the similar radiation emanating from the
pure oxyhydrogen-flame.

 regard to the other sources of rays just mentioned, the follow

 the Ritteric rays than the solar spectrum f. Now, according to
 Prof. Draper’s observations, the higher the maximum refrangi

instances where the transmuting agent is a vapour*. The increase
of radiation exhibited in these experiments, at first sight, appears
equivalent to a creation of energy; but, upon consideration, it is
easy to see that such need by no means be the case.     Some direct
experiments might perhaps be made on this point.
   (2) The experiments before described, in which the platinum
was to be heated by electricity previously to the incidence of solar
rays, together with a remark mentioned below, led me to pro
pose to myself an investigation of the absorptive powers of solids
for rays as dependent on temperaturet.
   (3) In my original paper, since published in the Reports of the
British Association for 1863, I suggested an explanation of the
phenomena of ray-renovation, according to which the rays emitted
in the act of renovation are to be considered as resulting from a
species of interference between the incident or absorbed rays and
the rays spontaneously emitted by the renovating substance. In
order to test this view practically, I intended to try the following
experiment. Let a fluorescent substance be placed in front of a
thermo-multiplier, and between the multiplier and that substance
 let   an
        absorbing medium           placed, capable be   eliminating New               of
       rays          very  description                            question

gives out     the act      fluorescence. The caloric equilibrium being
                                     of
established whilst the substance does not fluoresce,                evident                      it   is
that,   as                         begins    fluoresce,  the caloric equi
                         be as

                         By John TYNDALL, F.R.S. &c.”
A COMMUNICATION                     from the pen of Dr. Akin, pub
        lished in the last Number of the Philosophical Magazine,
will, I trust, be my excuse for giving the following brief sketch
of my relation to the question of “negative fluorescence”—a
term which may be provisionally taken to express the changing
of the refrangibility of the invisible ultra-red rays of the spec
trum so as to render them visiblet.
   In the month of June 1852, a scientific gentleman, eminent
though young, showed me, in his lodgings in Duke Street, Pic
cadilly, the fluorescence of an infusion of horsechestnut bark,
and explained to me the nature of the discovery of Prof. Stokes.
   In the month of September of the same year, I heard Prof.
Stokes lecture on this subject before the Belfast Meeting of the
British Association. At that Meeting, moreover, a term was
employed by the gentleman who had first enlightened me on the
subject of fluorescence, which I have never since forgotten. He
said that the light was always degraded (meaning thereby that                                                        its
refrangibility was always lowered)when fluorescence was exhibited.
   This lowering          the refrangibility was one
                           of                             the most promi              of

Stokes, and         inevitably provoked the opposite question.
                    it                                                                                               In
common,      I believe, with many         those who had heard the ex
                                                      of
periments described,          soon afterwards inquired whether
                                I                                       was                                it
not possible        elevate refrangibility, and thus
                    to                                    render the ultra           to
red rays       the spectrum visible,

involuntarily, that phenomena analogous to those of fluorescence
may be discovered, the explanation of which would have to be
referred, not to a lowering, but a raising of the refrangibility.
Such would be the case if the ultra-red rays of the spectrum
could be rendered visible, as the ultra-violet ones have been **.
    During the last six years, or since the commencement of my
researches upon radiant heat, this subject has been frequently
in my thoughts; and                      I
                              helped myself, whenever opportunity
offered, to form conceptions of the physical processes involved
in negative fluorescence, by observations upon waves of water.
But other questions, of a more pressing character, compelled me
to postpone the definite experimental examination of this one.
    Early in the autumn of 1863             imagined that I    had suc                    I
ceeded in      proving  one of our commonest experiments to be an
illustration of a change of refrangibility, in an upward direction.
Having, as I conceived, shown the oscillating periods of the mo
lecules in a hydrogen-flame to be ultra-red,          inferred, at once,     I
that the    light emitted  by a  platinum  wire  plunged  into the flame
could only be produced by a change of period. It was not, how
ever, a case of real negative fluorescence, for there was no con
version of invisible rays into visible ones.       The change of period
occurred, as I then phrased                        it,
                                        “before the heat had assumed
the radiant form.”

nology for the phenomena of radiation. The changes of refran
gibility possible to light and radiant heat were afterwards dis
cussed, and an experiment was described, by which the author
proposed to convert the ultra-red rays of the spectrum into visible
OneS.
     In that article there           was no mention     of the form of conversion
which I thought had been established by myself; and having at
that time occasion to write to the editor of the ‘Saturday Review,’
I  mentioned, in my note to him, my having already accomplished
that which Dr. Akin proposed to accomplish.           informed him  I
that   my solution was  already some months    old, and was now on
the verge of publication. I requested him, moreover, if he thought
fit, to show my note to Dr. Akin.
    These facts are distinctly in the recollection of the Editor of
the ‘Saturday Review,’ who is perfectly willing to corroborate
what    Ihave here stated.
    The supposed change of period exhibited by a platinum wire
in a hydrogen-flame, constituted a brief episode in my memoir
on “Molecular Physics,” read before the Royal Society on the
17th of March 1864. Up to that date I had not the slightest
notion that Dr. Akin had ever alluded to the subject.               During
the exposition of my paper                I
                                    referred pointedly to Prof. Stokes,
with the view of     eliciting   his opinion as to the reality of the
conversion.     That  opinion,    clearly expressed and ably sustained,
was not favourable to the conclusion at which                       I
                                                              had arrived.
Prof. Stokes reasoned thus:–“When oxygen and hydrogen
clash together to form aqueous vapour, vibrations of the respec
tive atoms, in short periods, result; but these vibrations of the
atomic constituents are soon imparted to the molecules of the
compound formed by their union. Aqueous vapour constitutes,
in fact, the ‘ashes’ of a hydrogen-flame; on these ashes the
rapid vibrations of the single atoms are expended, thus produ
cing heat of lower refrangibility.           When a platinum wire is
plunged into a hydrogen-flame, it simply takes up the vibra
                      in its
tions which, in      absence, are imparted          the ashes; hence the
                                                         a to
                                                In we
possibility that,          caseits
                                 also,     have    lowering,   instead             of   a
raising      the refrangibility.”

the tip     the hydrogen-flame, where the vibrations
            of                                                          of

                                          to
upon the vapour-molecules. Prof. Stokes, however, retained
his opinion that the experiment was altogether inconclusive                        as   to
the real point    inquestion.

to  me       criticise the scientific method        which Dr. Akin                 by

  48         Prof. Tyndall on the History of Negative Fluorescence.
    freely conceded to his insight what                           I
                                                      deemed wanting in his
    data.    But now that he talks of my reasoning being the same as
    his, save that it exhibits the defect of a missing link, let me
    inquire what is his reasoning, and what is mine? As far as I
    can see, he does not reason at all.           He founds his “opinion,”
    that the radiation from a         hydrogen-flame       is ultra-red, on the
    defect of brightness which the flame exhibits.                 Now the flame
    of hydrogen, and other gaseous flames, have been over and over
    again compared, by chemists, with flames yielding solid products
    of combustion, the defective brightness, in those cases where solid
    matter was absent, being either referred to the extremely dilute
    character of the radiation, or to the fact that intense combus
   tion generated rays of a refrangibility too high for the purposes
   of vision. What has Dr. Akin done to prove this notion in
   correct? Nothing.         He never, to my knowledge, made a single
   experiment on the radiation of a hydrogen-flame.                     Again, he
   speaks of the probable         paucity   of rays of      high     refrangibility
   in a hydrogen-flame, as one ground of his conclusions. On this
   point let us hear Professor Stokes: —“It appears that the feeble
  flame of alcohol is extremely brilliant with regard to invisible rays
  of very high refrangibility.           The flame of hydrogen appears to
  aboundininvisible      raysofstill higher  refrangibility” (Phil. Mag. S.4.
  vol. iv.   p.
              392). And        again—“The        effect                    of
                                                             various flames and

culty; and we shall presently see whether the mode of surmount
ing it proposed by Dr. Akin entitles him to compare his per
formance with that of the mathematicians “who first conjectured
the existence of Neptune,” and so on.     He described before the
British Association, assembled at Newcastle in 1863, three experi
ments. In the first of them he proposed to employ two conjugate
mirrors; at the focus of one of which he places a piece of
chalk or lime, and at the focus of the other an oxyhydrogen
 flame.   He proposed to cut            “by absorbents” such visible

 52        Prof. Tyndall on the History of Negative Fluorescence.
      As already stated, the obscure radiation from the electric light
 has occupied my attention, more or less, during the last ten years.
 In 1854 I sought by “proper absorbents” to separate the lumi
 nous from the non-luminous radiation of this source.                In 1858
 I again tried to do so; and it was only a few days ago that the
 last remnant of the black glass, prepared for me for this express
 purpose by the late Mr. Darker, went to pieces in the condensed
 beam of my electric lamp.          It is not my habit, nor do think it                                 I

                                 accomplished.          My work would have
 been far more     completely   done,    by  this time,   had he never existed.
 His value to me has been purely negative, and that to an extent
 little dreamt of by the readers of the Philosophical Magazine.
 The real fact, moreover,                          is,
                                  that ten months ago              performed the            I

 but        objected that rock-salt plates sufficiently large could not
                he
  be  obtained. “Bring your cell near the focus,”                  replied, “and             I
 you will not require large plates.”             He   rejoined    that the plates
                     be            heat;      by            this,            finally

the Principia, appear to him to alter the meaning and applica

that restriction [“in ordinary mechanics”] under which I made
the assertion about Newton.         In fact the three English words
form a   perfectly   complete,  though   not literal, translation of the
four Latin ones.       Any rigid body, subject to such forces as pres
sures, gravitation, &c., is really a machine—whether it be em
ployed for mechanical purposes or not. I took care to indicate
the omission of this qualifying clause, though it had, in fact, been

              “Note previous                 on the Constitution of the Sun’t                             I

    a
                 the                         results of some experiments on the
thermal radiating powers of sodium, lithium, potassium, &c.
These experiments were made so as to compare the radiation of
a platinum plate, heated in a Bunsen’s burner, with that of an
exactly equal and similar plate covered with fused carbonate of
soda, of lithia, &c. The great radiating power of these substances
appeared to be due not improbably to the circumstance that, at
the high temperature to which they are exposed, small particles
continually detach themselves, which particles produce the                                               in
tense and peculiarly coloured light of the flame.             At the moment
of detachment these       particles may  be  regarded    as so many points;
so that it appeared      possible  that the radiation might be deter
mined by them or by the roughness of the surfaces of the glow
ing substances.       It is well known, in fact, that rough metallic
surfaces do radiate more heat than smooth ones—either in con
sequence of the points which they present,                                  or,

   Mellonistrives also to refer the greater radiation of powdered
bodies, wherever it occurs, to a difference in density.   He holds
that the separated surfaces of the small particles are less dense
than is the smooth continuous surface of the same metal.        This
view is scarcely tenable.  It will scarcely be asserted that filings
are less dense than the rough surface of the metal from which
they are obtained; nor will it be conceded that platinum-black
is less dense than spongy platinum, but merely that it is in a
state of greater distribution.    We shall consequently be com
pelled to assume that in metals the degree of distribution as well
as the density exerts an influence on the radiating power.
Whatever may be the condition of the metal, however, which
gives the greatest radiation, whether it be one of less density or
greater distribution of the substance, we are always compelled to
admit that the vibrating particles of the body, and the aether
which immediately surrounds them, are less able to communicate
their motion to the external aether when the surface of the metal
is smooth than when this surface is rough, or less dense, or when
the substance on the surface is in a condition of greater distri
bution.
   An hypothesis might certainly be found to account for the
fact that change of density and distribution alter so greatly the
communication of the above motion; and from such an hypo
thesis a simple connexion could be easily deduced between the
radiation, absorption, diathermancy, and thermal conductibility
of bodies.

THE“Further
    following          communication was        read:—
                  Inquiries concerning the Laws and Operation of
Electrical Force.” By Sir W. Snow Harris, F.R.S., &c.
   1. The author first endeavours to definitely express what is meant
by quantity of electricity, electrical charge, and intensity.
  By quantity of electricity he understands the actual amount of
the unknown agency constituting electrical force, as represented by
some arbitrary quantitative ‘electrical” measure.  By electrical charge
he understands the quantity which can be sustained upon a given
surface under a given electrometer indication.     Electrical intensity,
on the  contrary, is ‘the electrometer indication’ answering to a given
quantity upon a given surface.
   2. The experiments of Le Monnier in 1746, of Cavendish in 1770,
and the papers of Volta in 1779, are quoted as showing that bodies
do not take up electricity in proportion to their surfaces.  According
to Volta, any plane surface extended in length sustains a greater
charge—a result which this distinguished philosopher attributes to the
circumstance that the electrical particles are further apart upon the
elongated surface, and consequently further without each other's
influence.
  3.   The author here endeavours to show that, in extending a sur
face in length, we expose it to a larger amount of inductive action
from surrounding matter, by which, on the principles of the conden
ser, the intensity of the accumulation is diminished, and the charge
 consequently increased; so that not only are we to take into account
 the influence of the particles on each other, but likewise their opera
 tion upon surrounding matter.
    4. No very satisfactory experiments seem to have been instituted
 showing the relation of quantity to surface. The quantity upon a
given surface has been often vaguely estimated without any regard
 to a constant electrometer indication or intensity.        The author
thinks we can scarcely infer from the beautiful experiment of Cou
lomb, in consequence of this omission, that the capacity of a circular
plate of twice the diameter of a given sphere is twice the capacity of
the sphere, and endeavours to show, in a future part of the paper
(Experiment 16), that the charge of the sphere and plate are to each
other not really as 1-2, but as 1: V2, that              is,
                                                       the square roots
                                                               as
of   the exposed surfaces;        so
                                 that we cannot accumulate twice the
quantity    ofelectricity upon the plate under the same electrometer
indication.

                                                                           F

wide, is about 80 inches; whilst the linear boundary of the same 100
square inches of surface under a plate 10 inches square is only 40
inches.    Hence the charge of the rectangle is much greater than
that of the square, although the surfaces are equal, or nearly so.
   6. The author finds, by a rigid experimental examination of this
question, that electrical charge depends upon surface and linear exten
sion conjointly.   He endeavours to show that there exists in every
plane surface what may be termed an electrical boundary, having an
important relation to the grouping or disposition of the electrical
particles in regard to each other and to surrounding matter. This
boundary, in circles or globes, is represented by their circumferences.
In plane rectangular surfaces, it is their linear extension or perimeter.
       If
      this boundary be constant, their electrical charge (1) varies with
the square root of the surface. If the surface be constant, the charge
varies with the square root of the boundary.         If the surface and
boundary both vary, the charge varies with the square root of the
surface multiplied into the square root of the boundary. Thus, calling
C the charge, S the surface, B the boundary, and a some arbitrary
constant depending on the electrical unit of charge, we have
C=p VS.B., which will       be found, with some exceptions, a general
law of electrical charge.  It follows from this formula, that if when we
double the surface we also double the boundary, the charge will be
also double.     In this case the charge may be said to vary with the
surface, since it varies with the square root of the surface, multiplied
into the square root of the boundary.       If therefore the surface and
boundary both increase together, the charge will vary with the square
of either quantity. The quantity of electricity therefore which sur
faces can sustain under these conditions will be as the surface.         l    If
and b   represent   respectively   the length  and breadth of a     plane
rectangular surface, then the charge of such a surface is expressed
 by p V215 (I-FM), which is found to agree perfectly with experiment.
 We have, however, in all these cases to bear in mind the difference
between electrical charge and electrical intensity (1).
    7. The electrical intensity of plane rectangular surfaces is found
 to vary in an inverse ratio of the boundary multiplied into the sur
face. .      If
              the surface be constant, the intensity is inversely as the
boundary.       If the boundary be constant, the intensity is inversely
as the surface.       If both vary alike and together, the intensity is as
the  square    of either quantity; so that if when the surface be doubled
the   boundary    be also doubled, the intensity will be inversely as the
square of the surface.       The intensity of a plane rectangular surface
being given, we may always deduce therefrom             its  electrical charge
under      given
            a      greater intensity,   sincewe   only  requireto    determine
the increased quantity requisite      to   bring the electrometer indication
 up      the given required intensity.
        to                                     Thisis   readily deduced, the

intensity being,   a       well-established law   of  electrical force,  asthe

   8.  These laws relating    to    charge, surface, intensity, &c., apply
more especially                                               whole, and not
                                                        as
                  to    continuous surfaces taken       a
    surfaces divided into separated parts.        The author illustrates this
bytoexamining the result    of   an   electrical accumulation upon   a   plane

Sir W. Harris      on the Laws and Operation    of Electrical Force.      67
rectangular surface taken       as a whole, and the results of the same
accumulation      upon   the same surface divided into two equal and
similar    portions  distant from each other, and endeavours to show,
that if as we increase the quantity we also increase the surface and
boundary, the intensity does not change.        If   three or more separated
equal spheres, for example, be charged with three or more equal
quantities, and be each placed in separate connexion with the electro
meter, the intensity of the whole is not greater than the intensity of
one of the parts. A similar result ensues in charging any united
number of equal and similar electrical jars. A battery of five equal
and similar jars, for example, charged with a given quantity = 1, has
the same intensity as a battery of ten equal and similar jars charged
with quantity =2; so that the intensity of the ten jars taken together
is no greater than the intensity of one of the jars taken singly.         In
accumulating a double quantity upon a given surface divided into
two equal and separate parts, the boundaries of each being the same,
the intensity varies inversely as the square of the surface. Hence two
separate equal parts can receive, taken together under the same elec
trometer indication, twice the quantity which either can receive
alone, in which case the charge varies with the surface. Thus if a
given quantity be disposed upon two equal and similar jars instead
of upon one of the jars only, the intensity upon the two jars will
be only one-fourth the intensity of one of them, since the intensity
in this case varies with the square of the surface inversely, whilst the
 quantity upon the two jars under the same electrometer indication
 will be double the quantity upon one of them only; in which case
 the charge varies with the surface, the intensity being constant.         If
 therefore as we increase the number of equal and similar jars we
 also increase the quantity, the intensity remains the same, and the
 charge will increase with the number of jars. Taking a given sur
 face therefore in equal and divided parts, as for example four equal
 and similar electrical jars, the intensity is found to vary with the
 square of the quantity directly (the number of jars remaining the
 same), and with the square of the surface inversely (the number of
 jars being increased or diminished); hence the charge will vary as
 the square of the quantity divided by the square of the surface; and
  we have, calling C the charge, Q the quantity, and S the
                                                                    surface,

 c=};        which formula fully represents the phenomenon of         a con
 stant intensity, attendant upon the charging of equal separated sur
 faces with quantities increasing as the surfaces; as in the case of
 charging an increasing number of equal electrical jars. Cases, how
 ever, may possibly arise in which the intensity varies inversely with
  the surface, and not inversely with the square of the surface.          In
  such cases, of which the author gives some examples, the above for
  mula does not apply.                             -
     9. From these inquiries it is evident, as observed by the early elec
  tricians, that conducting bodies do not take up electricity in propor:
  tion to their surfaces, except under certain relations of surface and
  boundary. If the breadth of a given surface be indefinitely diminished,

and the length indefinitely increased, the surface remaining constant,
then, as observed by Volta, the least quantity which can be accumu
lated under a given electrometer indication is when the given surface
is a circular plate, that is to say, when the boundary is a minimum,
and the greatest when extended into a right line of small width,

 be, as in the preceding experiments, inversely as the surfaces.

 inches, under the same intensity of 9°.            Here the charges are as
  1 :  2, whilst the surfaces are as 1:4. The charges, therefore, are
 as the square roots      of the surfaces, or as I : V4.

 be inversely as the surfaces, or very nearly, being as 2°5 and            9°

 with a sphere of the same diameter. Here the actual surfaces are
 63-6 square inches for the plate, and 254 square inches for the

 face of the    sphere   is closed or shut up; consequently the exposed
 surfaces,   electrically considered, neglecting one-half the surface of the
 sphere as being closed, are as I : 2, and the exposed surface of the
 plate is exactly one-half the exposed surface of the sphere.
     Charge of plate 8 circular inches, under an intensity of 12°. Charge
 of sphere l l circular inches, under the same intensity of 12°. The
 charges, therefore, are as 8: 11, or as 1 : 1:4, the exposed surfaces
being as 1:2. The charges, therefore, are as the square roots of the
 exposed surfaces.
     On examining the intensities of the plate and sphere, they were
 found to be in an inverse ratio of the exposed surfaces, as in the
 former experiments.
     Ea'periment 16. Comparison of a sphere of 7 inches diameter with
 a circular plate of 14 inches, or double that diameter.              In this

are actually the same as the two surfaces of the plate.            The inner
surface of the       sphere   being closed,  however,  as in the last experi
ment, the surfaces of the sphere and plate, electrically considered, are
therefore not equal, and the surface of the plate is twice the surface
of the sphere. The surfaces, therefore, open to external induction
are as 2: 1.
    On examining the charges of the plate and sphere, they were
found to be as 10: 14, or as 1 : 14, charge of sphere being 10
circular inches, under an intensity of 20°, and charge of plate
being 14 circular inches, under the same intensity of 20°. The
charge of the sphere, therefore, as compared with the charge of the
plate, is as 1 : V2, that.is, as the square roots of the exposed
surfaces.
    On examining the intensities of the sphere and plate, they were
found to be, as in the preceding experiments, in an inverse ratio of

observed (4), that the capacity of the plate is twice that of the
sphere.

of the preceding:—

the same plate rolled up into an open hollow cylinder, 10 inches
long by 3-2 inches diameter.     Here, as in the last experiments,
although the surfaces are actually the same, yet, electrically consi
dered, the plate has twice the surface of the cylinder, one surface of
the cylinder being shut up.
   On examining the charges of the cylinder and plate, they were
found to be, as in the preceding experiments, as 1 : V2; that                                                in is,   an as

into two unconformable groups, which have been called the Upper
and Lower Laurentian respectively.         In both divisions zones of
limestone are known to occur, and of them at least three have
been ascertained to belong to the Lower Laurentian. From one of
these limestone-bands, occurring at the Grand Calumet on the River
Ottawa, Mr. J. McCulloch obtained, in 1858, specimens apparently
of organic origin, which were exhibited as such by the author in
 1859; and other specimens have also been obtained from Grenville
and Burgess.     These specimens consist of alternating layers of cal
careous spar, and a magnesian silicate (either serpentine, white py
roxene, pyrallolite, or Loganite)—the latter minerals, instead of
replacing the skeleton of the organic form, really filling up the
interspaces of the calcareous fossil, as was discovered by Dr. Dawson,
to whose paper, and to that by Mr. Sterry Hunt, Sir William refers
for further details.
   2. “On the Structure of certain Organic Remains found in the
Laurentian Rocks of Canada.”      By J. W. Dawson, LL.D., F.R.S.,
F.G.S. With a Note by W. B. Carpenter, M.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   At the request of Sir Wm. Logan, Dr. Dawson carefully ex
amined the laminated material thought by Sir William to have an
organic origin, and he found it to consist of the remains of an
organism which grew in large sessile patches, increasing at the
surface by the addition of successive layers of chambers separated
by calcareous laminae.     Slices examined microscopically   showed
large irregular chambers with numerous rounded extensions, and
bounded by walls of variable thickness, which are studded with
septal orifices irregularly disposed; the thicker parts of the walls
revealed the existence of bundles of fine branching tubuli.      Dr.
Dawson therefore concludes that this ancient organism, to which he
gave the name of Eozoön Canadense, was a Foraminifer allied to
 Carpenteria by          by
                    habits    growth, but   more complex structure,

                           the aggregation                         of
                                               individuals, assumed the
aspect     of coral reef.

     In  note, Dr. Carpenter corroborated Dr. Dawson's observations
          a
on the structure and affinities      Eozoön, but stated also that, as he
                                                    of

                               did not hesitate      express his belief   to                        in a
its affinities to Nummulina.

    instances are composed of nearly pure carbonate of lime.
        The author then gave the results of a chemical analysis of spe
    cimens from the different localities, and deduced therefrom the com
    position and affinities of Loganite; this mineral he considered to be
    allied to chlorite and to pyrosclerite in composition, but to be
    distinguished from them by        structure.        its

confine myself to those precise particulars to which his expressions
 regarding myself are directed.
   And first, as regards the conversation between Dr. Wollaston and
the President.      In a paper in my own hand-writing, which I can,
satisfactorily to myself, identify as having been written either on the
 24th or 25th November, 1826, certainly not later, I find it written:
   “The President was distinctly asked by Dr. Wollaston whether he
intended to use the privilege, by courtesy accorded to him, of naming
the Secretary, to which no one would object, or fairly to throw it
open to the Council.       His answer to the former part of the alterna
tive was susceptible of any sense that one might choose to put upon
it; to the latter, it was both in Dr. Wollaston's opinion and my
                                         -
own a negative.”
   Secondly, as to the question whether the President did or did not
promise me that Mr. Babbage should be my colleague. He assuredly
never did make to me that specific promise, nor, so far as I know, to
anyone else. What he did promise me (not me only, but others)
with regard to Mr. Babbage's pretensions, was that the question of
the succession to the Secretaryship, as between him and his com
petitor, should be referred to the Council; by which I             along                   all
understood (as       suppose
                     I        anyone  would) that the relative claims                                  of
the candidates            on
                      every ground should     fairly taken into conside

on as     matter of free election.
          a                           Under such circumstances       felt                       I
quite confident        Mr. Babbage's success and
                          of                        justified   assuring              in
him that      did so.

ON    THE DISCRIMINATION            OF COMPOUNDS OF SESQUIOXIDE OF

phosphate of sesquioxide of manganese, ascribed the purple colour
of the liquid obtained in Crum's method of testing for manganese,
by boiling any manganese compound with nitric acid and binoxide
of lead, to the formation of sesquinitrate of manganese, and not, as
Crum had done, to the formation of permanganic acid.
   The author has shown in the most decisive manner that Crum’s
view is correct.
   When a solution, not too dilute, of permanganic acid or its potash
salt placed in a glass with parallel sides is brought into the solar
spectrum, it produces a very powerful absorption of greenish and
yellowish-green light. Solutions of sesquiphosphate of manganese
exhibit the same deportment.      But if the latter is more and more
diluted, the obscurity in the middle of the spectrum gradually dis
appears without showing any absorption bands; while dilute solutions
of permanganic acid exhibit five distinct absorption bands, of which
the first feeble one (starting from red) lies more towards the Fraun
hofer's line D, the second dark one is in the middle between C and
b, the third, equally obscure, lies upon E reaching to b, the fourth is
between b and F, and the fifth and feeblest is in F. These bands are
especially distinct when the spectrum is taken on a paper screen.
   Sesquichloride and sesquisulphate of manganese show quite a
similar deportment to the phosphate, excepting that there are new
absorptions in blue and violet.
   The liquid, prepared according to Crum's method, shows the five
absorption bands in the most distinct manner.—Zeitschrift          für

     ON  THE CONSTRUCTION       OF DOUBLE-SCALE    BAROMETERS.
      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
   In a short paper which you did me the favour to insert in your De
cember Number, it was remarked that there was reason to fear that
double-scale barometers were not always properly graduated in this
country.     I was then unaware of the extent to which barometers
with incorrect metrical scales have recently been manufactured by the
most eminent firms in London.         I have in my own possession a
standard barometer, two mountain barometers, and a mountain
aneroid by four of our first makers, and in each of these the metrical
scale is erroneous, while a mountain aneroid by Secretan of Paris is
affected by a similar error in the English scale.      My friend Mr.
Tuckett of Bristol, who has been investigating this subject simulta
neously with myself, informs me that all his instruments are like
wise inaccurate.
   The nature of the error may be explained as follows:—
   Suppose a standard brass yard, divided to inches, at the normal
temperature     of 62°F., to be laid beside a standard brass metre  di
vided to millimetres at the normal temperature of 32°F., with their
zero-points coincident.      Then by Guyot's Tables for converting
inches into millimetres, at their respective normal temperatures, each
inch of the English standard will correspond with 25-39954 millims.
and 30 inches with 761.986 millims., or 762 millims. very nearly.

80                        Intelligence and Miscellaneous                      Articles.
   Next, suppose the temperature of the standard                                  metre to be increased
30°F., and            so to be made equal to the temperature                               of the English
standard.

                                                                                         0-0000104344

   Each length of the standard metre which corresponded with the
inch of the English scale will have expanded through a space equal
to 00795 millim., and the length which corresponded with 30 inches
through 238 millim.
   It is manifest that whatever lengths correspond at the temperature
of 62°F. will correspond also at all temperatures common to the two
scales.
      We have therefore the following relations:–
        At   the normal temperatures                   of
                 the standards.                                        At   all   common temperatures.

IN diversity of phenomena, can we detect            a dynamical condition
 common to all—a       single  essential   principle  upon which the ces
 sation of the excitement depends?            Light is a common pheno

82             Mr.    J. J. Waterston       on some Electrical
may be presented quite unalloyed with matter                 in any degree
open to question or difference of opinion.
             Eaperiments       on certain   forms of discharge.
   1. A disk of sealing-wax, 4 inches in diameter and ºth of an
inch thick, held close to the negative excited end of a shell
lac cylinder, then removed and applied to the electroscope,
showed no charge; but if before removing it we touch every
part of the outer surface of the disk, we find on applying it
to the electroscope, that it has acquired a strong positive
charge.    If we touch only one point, the charge is confined to
that point.    If we touch with the blunt end of a needle there is
no  charge;   if with the sharp end it is sensible; if with a brass
wire it is sensible; with a lead point it is still more sensible,
even when that point is held an inch or two from the outer sur
face of the disk; also with gold-leaf.     These phenomena vary
with the   strength  of the excitement of the shell lac, also of the
material of which the conductor is composed.       This last fact is
distinctly impressed on the mind after frequent repetition of the
experiments.
    2. To examine this further, I worked with a jar having about
two square feet of coated surface.     Its uncoated part was covered
with shell lac applied when the glass was hot, and the edges of
the tinfoil were covered with sealing-wax, as also the lower part
of the jar outside, where the curve was sharp. On the top of the
jar was a cake of lac, with a sealing-wax handle to take it off and
on ; and through its centre passed the charging-rod, which was
coated with soft wax, as was also the knob, which was abrass ball
2 inches in diameter.     The jar rested on a cake of sulphur which
rested on an insulating stool, and was charged by means of an
 other rod and ball uncoated, which was removed after the charge.
 The soft wax that covered the ball was composed of a mixture of
beeswax, resin, and red lead.     It was heated and rendered semi
liquid before placing on the jar; then, before it hardened, the
point of an uninsulated needle was presented about an inch from
the knob (first having touched the outside of the jar).      Instantly
the coated   semiliquid   surface of the knob    opposite  the needle
was pitted with innumerable small holes, occupying an exactly
 circular space of three-quarters of an inch diameter.      By taking
 away the needle, touching the outside of the jar, then bringing
 the needle to      its
                    former position, the action could             be
                                                             sustained
 (until the coating became hard), having the appearance                 of   a
 shower of  particles    from watering-pan.
                          as      a
                                                   by
    The pitted space being then examined         lens, the appearance
                                                   a
 was exactly   as
                if    shower
                      a          minute projectiles had been forcibly
                                  of
 driven through the wax coating             to
                                         the metallic surface      the of

                         Eaperiments and Inductions.                        83
ball. The pitted space was bounded by a perfectly circular
ridge, as if there had been a current of air or augmented atmo
spheric pressure on the part.
   In the dark the usual appearance of brush was visible issuing
from the needle when it was positive; when negative the star
appeared, but the wax coating of the knob was pitted ea'actly the
same as when positive.
   3. Other experiments     of the same kind were made by present
ing  the point of a penknife to the outer surface of a disk of shell
lac upon which there was a thin coating of soft wax in a semi
liquid state. The inner surface of the disk touched the wax
coated knob of the charged jar.        The effect was very peculiar.
When the point was within one-eighth of an inch from the coat
ing of the disk, a sharply-defined perfectly straight line of inden
tation suddenly appeared, forming a small fosse about one-fourth
of an inch long and one-fiftieth of an inch broad. This was quickly
followed by another of the same kind, radiating from the extre
mity of the first at an angle of about 60°, and sometimes at right
angles; others followed, and sometimes two together, forming
the letter T.
    The general effect, after the discharging point had been held
opposite different parts of the semiliquid wax surface, resembled
the marks left by crows’ feet on a soft clay surface.
    When the rounded extremity of a brass wire was substituted
in place of the penknife, a similar effect took place, but with
much greater ease, lines being thrown off in rapid succession
forming stars.     A small brass ball throws off stars.
    4. It is only after such lines appear that the disk acquires a
charge. When the wax surface has cooled and become solid, no
indentation or mark is observed when the wire or knife is pre
 sented under otherwise the same circumstances; but charge being
 still given as before, it seems fair to infer that the particles or
molecules of metals are still projected upon the wax surface in
lines.
    The indented line is not simultaneously impressed.—The end
nearest the point of the conductor appears first.     This was most
 distinctly observed when the conductor presented to the molten
surface was a needle bent at the point ; also a small brass ball
 half an inch in diameter.
     5. With highly-charged jar and knob the following experiments
 were made with an insulated circular plate of tinned iron 4 inches
in    diameter.

of    quarter
      a            of         inch; after few seconds, removed
                                         a                            it,

found       no
          charge.
      b.   The same process repeated after    a   very small hole had been

viously touched); the plate, held as before, obtained a charge of
the same electricity as the knob.
   c. The plate held with     edge              its

is stuck on to the coated conductor, and a spark taken from a brass
ball held as shown in fig. 2. The spark traversed the surface of
the shell lac and passed through the crack, as shown by the dotted
line. The distance is much greater than if the spark had to pass
through the air alone without the shell of lac to assist                                            it.

 noted between two balls coated with the soft wax.                      On dis

circle      ºth
             of an inch in diameter, and in the exact centre was an
excavated  cup  rºoth of an inch in diameter, as if a hole had been
drilled to a very minute depth (fig. 5). Examined with a watch
maker’s lens and reflected light in several directions, it was a
simple concavity with bright surface, as if metallic particles had
been torn off.    Examined with a microscope magnifying 40 dia
meters, the cavity was obviously irregular; there was a slightly
marked ridge round the excavated part, and a few minute speckles
of brass outside the rim as if thrown off in a molten state.
   b. Some experiments were made with the view of discovering
what became of the small portion of metal torn off at each dis
charging surface.     When the discharging surfaces consisted of
brass balls coated with wax, the appearance was the same in
both, even when one ball was much larger than the other. The
electric force in the axis of discharge effectually tore apparently
the same number of molecules from each surface; but in only
one instance was there any appearance of those particles after
the explosion.     In this case one of the discharging surfaces was
pointed lead, the other a wax-coated brass ball. A hole was
made in the wax coating as before, and about half an inch from
it a small patch of brass, about <U+017F>ºuth of an inch in diameter, was
found, and in an opposite direction a similar patch of lead.     On
the other side, at about the same distance from the hole, a small
irregular fragment of wax was found adhering, with that pecu
liarity of surface which showed that only the superficial particles
had been in a molten state.
    c. When the discharge was repeated by bringing the leaden
terminus opposite the hole of the previous explosion, the bright
point of the brass ball was found coated with lead; and a grey
powder appeared round the hole in the wax coating, spreading
round it to a radius of about half an inch.     In this case a brush
preceded the spark.
   11. The mechanical effects of the electric explosion between
a pointed wire covered with a thick coating of sealing-wax and
a naked brass ball were as follows. The coating gave way about
three-quarters of an inch from point, with sound of a smart crack
of a whip, and the electric fire passed along surface of wax from
the fissure to the ball. The fissure extended completely round
the coating, but there was no projectile force given to it (fig. 6).
The front part of the glove of wax had completely separated from
the hinder, but the distance it had moved in consequence of the
explosion was imperceptible.
                           Description of Electroscope.
      12.   The electroscope employed                       the following experiments
is   shown    in   fig.   7,   which   is   drawn   to in
                                                        a     scaleof one quarter.

                                Eageriments and Inductions.                               87
    The cage consists of a brass cylinder, on the top of which is
stuck a disk of lac with oval hole in centre, in which was fitted,
when soft, an oval plug of shell lac that had been melted upon
the wire when heated.      The lower end of wire was filed to a
knife-edge about ºth of an inch long. This edge, when heated,
was brought down on a surface of soft sealing-wax (resin and
beeswax), the sides then cleaned, and the knife-edge rubbed on
paper so as to leave only the slightest coating of wax.     It was
then brought down transversely upon the centre of a strip of gold
leaf 1, inch long and Toth of an inch broad (being less in breadth
than knife-edge of wire), lying loosely on gold-beaters’ paper.
After being trimmed at edges, the angle of divergence is very
clearly brought out. It is most convenient to use thick gold
leaf which can be handled.                     I
                                 used the thinnest (what is sold in
books and used by gilders) in most of the experiments; but
latterly I mounted the electroscope with a leaf ten times as thick,
obtained from the gold-beater, and found that there was no
sensible difference in the divergence for the same intensity of
charge.
    Two square openings were cut on the opposite sides of the
brass cylinder and covered with thin plates of talc, and on the
off side an angular scale was applied, which enabled the diver
gence of the leaves to be measured roughly, the maximum being
about 110°.     The insulation was almost perfect; even in rainy
 weather the leaves would stand at their extreme angle for 10
minutes without sensible diminution.
    To obtain some idea of the relation between the intensity of
the charge and the angle of divergence, twin brass disks (termed
B. D.) were provided (fig. 8), and an insulating handle provided
to each, composed of a slender stick of fine hard sealing-wax.                            If
we charge one B.D. inductively from a constant source, such as
centre of an excited cake of sulphur (see 35.), then touch it
 with the second B.D., we divide the charge into two equal
 parts; then discharge B. D. 2, and touch B. D. 1 again with
it, we divide the charge into four parts, and     on; three touch          so

ving it observe the divergence of the leaves to be 65°. This is
termed angle of first contact. We then repeat the process, and
again touching the cap, find the angle rises to 75°, a third time
to 80°, and so on, converging to a maximum of say 85°, which is
termed angle of last contact, and is the angle that truly represents
the intensity of the electricity of the induced charge, and there
fore of the inducing power existing at the centre of the sulphur
excited             But from the angle of first contact we may
              surface.
infer the angle  of last contact.
   Now suppose the limiting angle of last contact due to three
contacts of the twin B. D.s, or ºth of the constant charge, is 100°;
and of four contacts of the twins, or ºth of the same constant
charge, is 85°; and of five contacts, or and of the same, is 60°.
We can thus determine the relation between the angle of diver
gence and the quantity of electricity on the electroscope.
   The maximum divergence depends on the proximity of the
leaves to the sides of the cage, so it varies with the diameter of
the cage and length of the leaves.      With cage 6 inches in dia
meter and upwards the maximum is 70°; and 3 inches in dia
meter, 105°, the leaves being ºths of an inch long; but if gths,
the angle extends to about 115°; and if 1 inch, to 130°: the
weight of the gold-leaves seems too small to influence the angle,
which seems to be fixed by the repulsion between the leaves
themselves and the vertical wire that supports them, and by the
attraction of the extremity of the leaves to the sides of the cage.
This suggests an arrangement with the wire placed horizontal, as
perhaps affording a more equable scale.
   Having thus determined the scale of the particular electro
scope,    it is easy to find                 its   capacity with reference        to    the      B.   D.

   34. As these phenomena of the magic pane are fundamentally
characteristic of the electric force, and make their appearance in
uncoated non-conducting matter after excitement, it is well to
have a clear idea of their sequence.       To assist in this I submit
the following method by diagram.
   Let n (fig. 11) be an element of a non-conducting surface ne
gatively excited, and p an element of another non-conducting sur
face positively excited.   These surfaces may be in contact with
out discharge or depolarization taking place.          The polarized
condition is   represented  by  the V   lines, their  aspect  from p
towards n being male or entrant, and their aspect from n towards
p being female or recipient. When the surfaces are in contact,
the electricities are masked ; their intensity is inappreciably
 small.   On separating these surfaces, mechanical force has to
 be  expended,   and electric intensity is generated, or polarized
lines are spun   having one root or extremity on the positive sur
face and another on the negative surface.    When the surfaces
are entirely separated, the electric excitement appears on both
sidesof each excited surface, as at A and B of n (fig. 12), and
D and C of p. It is proper, therefore, to view an excited surface
as having two sides.
  In the following diagrams, surfaces that are excited are repre
sented by thicker lines than those that are unexcited.
  Fig. 13 represents an element of the coated wax plate resting
upon the negative excited surface s of sulphur plate.       The W
lines show the female aspect issuing on both sides of s.
   Fig. 14 represents the wax plate still resting on the sulphur,
but after having          its
                     top coating touched. This removes          the                    all
V   lines above      a,

show that the top surface      now excited

   d.  If  the silk is undried and there is dust flying about, the
same  experiment     may be made without any apparent charge to
the  ball, because the convective charge may neutralize the induc
tive; but the escape of the negative up the silk line to the elec
troscope reveals the fact that convection and induction are both
at work.
   49. Cylinders   and plates of sulphur, shell lac, and heated
glass coated with melted shell lac were suspended by dried silk
lines, and subjected to the inductive influence of an excited rod
of shell lac 18 inches long and 13 inch in diameter.                                                           They
turned and were attracted like insulated conducting bodies of
the same shape, but with less force.
   The non-conducting quality of these substances was tested
previously to experiment by placing them on the top plate of the
electroscope while charged to                             its

&c. upon dense matter, the law of the elastic force of vapours in
contact with the liquids from which they arise, at different tem
peratures, is a subject of great importance.
   Many formulae have been proposed for the elastic force of
steam, which corresponded sufficiently nearly with the observed
results through moderate ranges of temperature, but failed com
pletely for great ranges.    It is not intended in the present paper
                                         -
to recapitulate these attempts.
   M. Regnault has given formulae for interpolation which en
abled him, from his observation through many series of experi
ments, to construct most valuable tables of the elastic force of
the vapours of the liquids in regularly ascending temperatures.
These are found in his treatise “Relation des expériences . . . .

derable differences from even the more recent experiments                                          in

clusive.
   When we consider the formula, we can see that the nature of
the experiments must be such that extreme accuracy is unattain
able with even the most improved apparatus.       When p is the
elastic force of the vapour expressed in the pressure of a column
of inches of mercury, t the temperature expressed in Fahrenhei';

degrees, then                 Mr. Alexander's formula                                  (i. * Tö95).
The binomial being to the sixth power, a small error in the value
of t, either in the graduation of the thermometers or in the ob
servations, produces a considerable change in the value of p ;
and if both errors existed at the same time and in the same di
rection, the error in the value of p might become large. We
have no need to be surprised that even the results of M. Reg
nault require this consideration to be kept in mind, and it is the
general accordance through long ranges of temperature that we
must look for, rather than great accuracy at           points, which                   all

    6. they are so situate as not to be intersected by any one
ellipse whatever—the distinction being similar to that which
exists between four points, which may be either such as to have
passing through them as well ellipses as hyperbolas, or else to
have passing through them hyperbolas only.
   I   remark that the limitation of the theorem to the case of a
quartic curve without nodes or cusps is necessary, at any rate as
regards the nodes.    We may in fact find a quartic curve having
a  single  node which is met by every line in at least two real
points, and which is therefore not the projection of any finite
curve; for if we imagine two hyperbolas so situate that each
branch of the one cuts each branch of the other, then it may be
seen that there exists a quartic curve approaching everywhere
very nearly to the system of two hyperbolas, but having, instead
of the four nodes of the system, only a single node, which is
such that every line meets it in at least two points.

        XVII. On the condition of the Molecules of Solids.
       By A. G. GIRDLESTONE, Magdalen College, Oaford+.
                    gases         particles are moving in straight
THAT          are bodies whose
   lines is now no hypothesis,     but a fact resting on physical
demonstration, derived from the phenomena of diffusion, heat,
&c., In like manner the motion of the particles of liquids may
be demonstrated.    The object of the present paper is to give the
same   certainty to the hypothesis of the molecular motion of
solids.
   Now there are certain prima facie difficulties in the way of
such an hypothesis, e.g. the cohesion of solids, the fact that
they exert no chemical action, that they do not transmit pres
 sure equally in            all
                     directions, their inertia, &c., which, however,
 on further consideration are the most convincing confirmatory
evidence that these molecules, equally with those         liquids and       of
 gases, are    motion.

division to be pushed to one side, involving, as this would, a
change of their planes of rotation.   (b) Chemical action could
not take place, for there is no jostling of the tops one against
another; and therefore if two such masses were placed in con

      an uncombined state.     The mean of the vapour-densities of
      ammonia and    hydrochloric acid being 0.93, whilst the vapour
      density of the vapours given off by chloride of ammonium when
      heated to the boiling-point of mercury has been found to be
      1:01    (seeDeville and Troost’s paper in the Comptes Rendus,
      May 11th, 1863, page 895), it is obvious that these vapours
      should, strictly in conformity with theory, contain some unde
      composed chloride of ammonium.         A simple calculation will
      show  that, according  to the theory, these vapours should con

         On bringing together hydrochloric acid and ammonia at
      350° C.; we should look for the development of about one-sixth
      of the heat which would result from complete combination.
         Nothing in M. Deville's recent paper indicates in any way
      that there was more than this. As will be apparent on referring
      to the paper, he agrees with M. Pebal in considering that there
      was not the evolution of the total amount of heat which com
      plete combination would produce, but gives no data from which
      we are able to form a judgment whether or not more than one
      sixth of that amount was evolved.

      account of his last experiment, is that the condition that the
      ammonia and hydrochloric acid should havé attained the tempe
      rature of boiling mercury before they enter the flask in which
      they come into contact has not been satisfactorily fulfilled.
      They were sent through the spiral at far too great a rate. 20

      each gas per second. The paper informs us that the length of
      each tube (which was bent into a spiral) was more than 2 metres,
      the diameter not being given at all. Unless we suppose a very

 strength of the magnet due to previous magnetism”, and the
 relations between torsion and magnetism f.
    An experiment of the simplest kind, and which may be regarded
 as an experimentum crucis against the theory of the two fluids, is
 to be found in my observation of the anomalous magnetizing of
 iron, which forms the subject of this communication.
     In examining the residual magnetism which is displayed by
 electromagnetic masses of iron after the stoppage of the magne
 tizing current, I have observed that it is nowise indifferent
 whether the circuit be broken suddenly or whether the intensity
 of the current be previously diminished by interposing resist
 ance, and gradually, when it has become nearly zero, altogether
 stopped.
     In the former case the residual magnetism is always much less
 than in the latter.
     I  have particularly noticed this difference in thick cores of iron.
            I
 In such have not seldom observed that, on the sudden breaking
 of the current, there was residual magnetism of an opposite cha
 racter to the temporary magnetism which had disappeared, a
 phenomenon which may be designated “anomalous magneti
 zing.” These phenomena cannot be looked upon as secondary
 actions of induced currents, inasmuch as the opening currents
 are in the same direction with the primary currents, and so, on
 the contrary, can only go to increase the residual magnetism.
                                  I
 As in support of this view refer particularly to the explana
 tions with which Magnusi and Helmholtz S have discussed the
 behaviour of electromagnetized masses of iron on breaking the
 circuit, it does not seem to me to be necessary to dwell upon this
 part of the question.
    I  think, moreover, that these phenomena find an explanation
 equally simple and satisfactory if we abide strictly by the sup
position that in the movements of the magnetic particles, besides
the tendency to return to the original position of equilibrium,
there is also a certain resistance due to friction.
    Thus, if we suppose the magnetic particles to be displaced by
a magnetizing agency, it is clear, in accordance with the above,
that on the gradual diminution and removal of this force they
must assume other positions of rest than when it is suddenly
removed.
    In   the former case, in which the molecules are allowed to move
slowly, the resistance due to friction prevents a complete return

to the original position of equilibrium; in the second case, on
the other hand, the rapidity of the retrograde movement—in
proportion to the greater vis viva which the molecules acquire on
the sudden removal of the state of tension—carries them still
further back towards the original position of equilibrium, and in
many instances even overstepping of this original position of
equilibrium may occur. When the latter takes place, then the
further possibility arises that a number of magnetic particles
may remain permanently beyond the original position of equili
brium, and then a magnetic condition of an opposite kind to
that set up by the electric current may be produced.      A needle
the oscillation of which is retarded by considerable friction, will,
on the sudden or    gradual  withdrawal of the  magnetic    tension,
behave so as to render the above description experimentally
intelligible.
   After these remarks, I will give the numerical data belonging
to some of the experiments.    In giving numbers for magnetic
intensities, a moment of a million absolute units is always taken
for the unit.
     An absolutely unmagnetic cylinder of the      softest iron, 103
millims.  long, and 28  millims, in  diameter,  was magnetized                         (–)
with an increasing intensity of current, so far that       temporary    its
moment reached finally about 60. On suddenly stopping the
stream, showed residual magnetism —0:20, and
         it             a                                  repeatedly   on
making sudden break

                              the   circuit,    showed   it  decidedly   a
negative residue.     On the other hand, when the magnetizing
current was   gradually stopped,    regular residue
                                        a                          of
                                                            least 0:30  at
always appeared.      When the current was again passed            the             in
same direction and suddenly stopped, then the residual magne
tism, instead     being 0:30

to  about     0,
               but could not        brought    below zero, even                          on
repeating the experiment.      But      altering the direction
                                               on                  the             of

           in                             when first used. If, on

116                 Mr.  J. Hunter on the Absorption
rents, the anomalous magnetizing was not to be produced to the
same extent as when the unmagnetic state had come of itself in
the manner just described.
    It follows from this that the apparently unmagnetic state
which is brought about by contrary magnetizing, and which
Marianini+ has named “latent" or “ dissimulated ” magnetism,
is also in these experiments nowise equivalent to the originally
unmagnetic condition.
    The same irregularities were displayed by an iron bar of 103
millims. in length and 20 millims. diameter, and which was
magnetized in the same spiral up to about 45.              The numerical
values of the residual     magnetism     for this bar were not very con
siderably different from those which the thicker bar had showed
at the same intensity of current.
    For the rest, both bars were of the softest iron which was       I
able to get.      In conclusion, I have still to remark that in these
experiments the magnetizing was effected, as a rule, by means
of a gradually increasing stream, and that, every time, the iron
core was exposed to the magnetizing influence for several
seconds.     I have thus taken into account the circumstance first
shown by Faradayt, that for the complete development of elec
tromagnetism a measurable time is requiredf.
    The striking numerical difference in the residual magnetism
after sudden and after gradual stoppage of the current is in every
instance easy to show; on the other hand, the observation of
anomalous       magnetism     requires undoubtedly delicate experi
ments; it is also obvious that the appearance of the latter must
depend upon the nature of the kind of iron, and so far must be
more or less accidental.

   This theorem has long been known and usefully employed
 with regard to one particular pair of correlated functions, viz. p
 and pay-y, which give w-ar; and this instance has the pecu
liarity, that if the substitution be effected twice, we are remitted
to the original equation.      This will always be the case when u,
v, and w, expressed in terms of a, y, and p, are similar in form
to the expression of a, y, and p in terms of u, v, and w.
   The theorem may be stated more generally in this form:—If
the equation

   The minerals associated with the native gold are oxide of tin
in considerable quantity, black tourmaline, garnet, rounded and
highly polished nodules of haematite, pseudomorphous crystals
of oxide of iron after iron pyrites, a rose-coloured mineral, appa
rently one of the topaz-group, and some small red fragments,
apparently of ruby ; metallic tin also occurs, as will be noticed
further on. The rock of the bed is generally, if not always, clay
slate, and the loose soil above it is composed of boulders of the
granite before described, often of immense size, along with Silu
rian slates, greywacke, and metamorphic schists of the immediate
neighbourhood.
   The gold is generally found perfectly free from any rock
matrix whatever; and I only succeeded in finding a single and
minute specimen which contained any gangue, and in that case
it was colourless quartz.
   The gold is very regular in size, being best compared in size
and shape to melon-seed, and of a very fine colour; occasionally
larger nuggets have been found, but more as an exception, the
size of a melon-seed being the rule; but comparatively          little
gold dust is associated with      and   it,

day, independent of the lucky chance of hitting upon some larger
auriferous deposit. The gold in such washings, as might be

 that the proprietors and managers of the speculation quite ridi
 culed the idea of such being the case. Are we to suppose that

 yet observed was associated with a veritable rock matrix. True
it is that it was always extremely impure, and contained stony

Th;       last Number of the Philosophical Magazine contains an
     article “On the History of Negative Fluorescence,” by Prof.
                                  I
Tyndall, to which intend herewith to reply. As this is a per
sonal discussion, of course I shall have to allude to personal
matters; but, in doing so,                       I
                               shall endeavour not to imitate the
language adopted by Prof. Tyndall towards myself, more or less,
throughout his paper.     In stating this, however, I do not wish
to complain of Prof. Tyndall; for, besides that language of this
kind always recoils upon the person who uses          has adopted                            it,   he
the same tone     his discussions with Professors Tait and Thom
                            in
son, and      such excellent company
                   in                    can very well bear Prof.       I
Tyndall’s contumely.

                       the History    of Calcescence.                    137
transmutation of rays occurred to me”. I immediately commu
nicated on the subject with Prof. Stokes, hoping that he would
enable me to bring my speculations to the test of experiment.
Prof. Stokes expressed himself in very high terms on the im
portance of the subject—terms which I have since often repeated
to others, and which have frequently encouraged me to persevere
when my patience was nearly exhausted; and when, towards
midsummer 1862,         I  left Cambridge, he was good enough to ex
press his regret that it had not been in his power to give me an
opportunity of making the experiments             I had proposed.    In No
vember of the same year, i.e. 1862,            I went to reside at Oxford,
and so much was my mind engrossed by the matter in hand,
that the very first time I met Mr. Griffith, then, as now, Deputy
Professor of Experimental Philosophy in the University,                     I
broached the subject to him, when I was greatly pleased
to find that the matter interested him, and that he was ready
to make experiments on it with me.                  Consequently, in the
month in question, or early in the December following, we
made some trials with the oxyhydrogen jet; and as these gave
no satisfactory result, we began to make experiments on the sun
a short time after.       These latter experiments were continued till
June     1863, when    I  drew up a paper on the subject, which I for
warded to the Royal Society.             Being called by urgent private
matters to town at that time, it was arranged that, during the
week or ten days intervening, the experiments, which appeared
then to be in a very forward state, should be completed, so that
an account of the result might be presented by me to the Royal
Society at the last Meeting of the then session.            The expectation
founded on this arrangement, however, was not fulfilled, and I
was consequently advised to withdraw also the introductory
papers already forwarded for communication to the Royal
Society. Although, in consequence of private circumstances
      I
   * may as well state now that the article on fluorescence in Cornelius
and Marbach’s Physikal. Lewicon (the work being one intended for popular
circulation and for reference, not for perusal) became first known to me
from M. Emsmann's paper on “Negative Fluorescence,” published in Pog
gendorff’s Annalen in 1861. It so happened that, at the time when this
last-mentioned paper appeared,    I                            I
                                    was staying at Paris, where had no access
to Poggendorff’s Annalen; and when in the following spring I had an op
portunity of seeing the Annalen at the University Library at Cambridge,
the volume in which M. Emsmann's paper was published was with the
binder; so that the paper became actually known to me only in the winter
of 1862–63 at Oxford. In my paper in the Reports of the British Asso
                  I
ciation, in which have duly adverted to M. Emsmann's publications,      I did
not think it necessary to mention these facts, as they were of no scientific,
 but only of personal interest.   For an appreciation of the contents of M.
 Emsmann’s paper    I must refer for the present to the historical Appendix
 in the Reports of the British Association for 1863, p. 99.

138            Dr. Akin's further               Statements concerning
which then arose,           I
                      could continue to give my time and attention
to scientific researches only at a great sacrifice,   yet returned           I
towards the end of June to Oxford, in order to complete the ex
periments, if possible, in time for the Meeting of the British As
sociation, which was to assemble towards the end of the August
ensuing at Newcastle; yet, although my return originated in
previous arrangements, for reasons which have never been ex
plained to me, no opportunity was given me after my return to
proceed with the experiments.    The suspense which I then un
derwent, my mind being full yet of other pressing anxieties, has
left an indelible mark of pain on my memory.    This, however,
is not now the question;                    I
                                  will therefore merely state that,
 although greatly depressed and discouraged in mind,          attended            I
 in August the Meeting of the British Association; that read                           I
 the papers which       I
                     had prepared before the Mathematical and
 Physical Section; and that the Committee of the Section, in con
 sequence, resolved to recommend the principal paper I had read
for publication in eatenso among the Reports of the Association.
The Association further resolved to appoint Mr. Griffith and my
self a committee to carry out the experiments proposed by me, for
which purpose a special grant was placed at our disposal.            In
consequence of this latter resolution,                   I
                                          again took up my residence
at Oxford in the spring of 1864, although at some sacrifice to my
feelings; but the proceedings which                          I
                                             had experienced in the
summer of   1863,   am  I
                        sorry  to say,  were soon recommenced, and
my plans were again defeated.        Instead of a report, I was thus
obliged to forward to the President of the Mathematical and
Physical Section of the British Association, for the Meeting
at Bath in September 1864, a letter of which the following is the
substance:–“I am sorry to have to state that, owing to the
scarcity of clear sunshine at Oxford last summer, and to Mr.
Griffith being mostly unable to give his time to our work when
the weather happened to be favourable to          the experiments it,                      in
tended    to
           have been made were left           August         in

had the greater reason      feel disappointed
                                      to            such   conclusion,
                                                                    at       a

the ‘Reader’ of April 2, 1864:—“I profit by this opportunity
to call your attention to your report of Prof. Tyndall’s late lec
ture at the Royal Institution. I suppose it was only by inad
vertence that you said, “such a change of period [or of invisible,
less refrangible, into visible rays], Prof. Tyndall believes, occurs
when a platinum wire is heated to whiteness by a hydrogen
flame,’ &c.; for in your own columns of September 26, 1863,
that explanation, communicated by me for the first time to the
British Association last year at Newcastle, was published in my
name, a fact which                      I
                           cannot but believe Prof. Tyndall has
referred to.” As an    afterthought, and as an act of courtesy to
                          I
Prof. Tyndall, wrote to him, a day or two after, a private note,
enclosing a set of proof-sheets of my paper on Ray-transmuta
tion, then printing in the Reports of the British Association.
In  answer to that note,                    I
                               received a letter from Prof. Tyndall,
dated from the Isle of Wight, in which he observed on the “sin
gular coincidence of thought” that had arisen between us, and
stated that “the piece of work which he had set before him for
attack on his return” to town was a series of experiments on “that
very subject” that engaged my own attention.             was somewhat    I
astonished at this latter statement; for, Prof. Tyndall having read,
as he himself informed me, the article on “Calcescence” in the
“Saturday Review,’ was aware that the British Association had
confided to Mr. Griffith and myself the task of executing the
experiments, for which                      I
                               had submitted the plans.       As to the
“coincidence,” real or supposititious, between Prof. Tyndall’s
“thoughts” and mine, it could extend only to the explanation of
the origin of lime-light; and Prof. Tyndall neither then nor has
he since ever stated that, before reading of my own method in
the “Saturday Review,’ he had planned any experiments on cal
cescence similar to those                   I
                               had submitted to the British Associa
tion.  Others,   before both  myself and Prof. Tyndall, had thought
that  they  had  recognized  phenomena evincing “negative fluores
cence,” and yet were unable to devise, for the purpose of proving
 itsexistence, methods analogous         those adopted   to the produc       in
                                       Tyndall                 for him
       or of
tion     fluorescence.    That Prof.            had  guessed
self,     perhaps but remembered, the explanation            lime-light,      of
could form           no
                  right     his part on interfere with the experiments

With this proposal, for which Professor Tyndall's letter had

had elapsed without my having heard from Prof. Tyndall.

    Prof. Tyndall that       was not likely that

                                      to
us. Prof. Tyndall,          reply, remarked that

that     he

showed me the proof of the paper since published in the Philo
sophical Magazine for November 1864, and he invited me to read
the paper in his presence, while he was perusing his letters. On
reading the very first sentences of the proof,             was somewhat   I
displeased by the marked manner in which Prof. Tyndall alluded
in them to the “ difference” between his reasonings and my own
on the subject of lime-light.                I
                                       was still more startled to learn
that, whilst a fortnight ago                 I
                                       had been informed by Prof.
Tyndall that he was occupied with different matters, he should in
the meanwhile have attacked a research intimately related to that
which had formed the subject of our agreement.                 might have      I
expected that, in the experiments on the spectrum of the oxy
hydrogen-flame, concerning which                      I
                                             was the first to enunciate
the views which those      experiments    were intended to test, Prof.
Tyndall might have invited me to join him, or, at least, to be pre
 sent while they were making—the more so as was then in town,        I
and daily in the Library of the Royal Institution. However, my
                                         I
astonishment increased when came to the passage in which
Prof. Tyndall expressed his resolution not “to publish anything
relating to the subject” of “the production of incandescence” by
 invisible Herschellic rays till the “arrangements devised by me
 had had a sufficient trial.” Considering the agreement that
 had subsisted    all  along between us, this statement              Prof.              of
 Tyndall was rather puzzling              me.to  Moreover, abstracting
 altogether from that agreement,       saw objections

 term “to    publish.”   An   unwary  reader   might   assume that Prof.
Tyndall, when writing the sentence above mentioned, had already
 accomplished what was searching after, but from generosity
                       I
 towards myself would not publish his results.                  who knew      I,
better, and other readers,          the other hand, were obliged
                                    on                                                            to
assume that Prof. Tyndall intended               work out the subject
                                                           to

                                              this kind    considered    I                        an
 unusual one    among    men   ofscience,   and one fair neither      my                 to

                                         it      is  possible,    perhaps      at

 fit,to  keep scientific results secret which are arrived           public     a
 place like the Royal Institution.       An observer        physiognomy  of
 would have noticed that the impression which the reading
of    the passages adverted         to

                                                      me was far from
 favourable.     However,  I   was not  prepared        make any imme

  diate  remarks,  and
                    I     consequently   merely   stated    Prof. Tyndall to
  that, regarding the “arrangements’ referred                  him       to
                                                                       his    by         in

 had again adverted to “definite arrangements,” he stated that
 he had no present intention of prosecuting the matter which had
 been discussed between us. Upon this left.         had then reason      I              I
 to expect that I should soon see Prof. Tyndall in a more private
 manner; and had that expectation been fulfilled,         the com                                 all

far from conclusive; or else should not have written privately
on the subject, as it would have been too late to carry out our
agreement.     Several more letters passed between us, the result
of which was that Prof. Tyndall volunteered to bind himself not
to make known publicly or privately any experiments on ray
transmutation till November 1865%. When wrotein reply that,I
being anxious to see the matter upon which I had been working
proved, and not having any hope of being able to pursue the
subject myself any further, in the interest of science would not    I
hold him to the engagement to which he had volunteered to bind
himself, Prof. Tyndall answered that, to his regret, he could not
accept the release     I
                       had offered him, his simple duty appearing
to him to be strictly to adhere to the engagement to which he had
voluntarily pledged himself. Notwithstanding this, Prof. Tyndall
has seized the very first opportunity that offered itself to him to
publish, some eleven months in advance, those very experiments
which, he had asserted, he could not with any degree of satis
faction to himself publish before November 1865, as there were
things more important in his estimation than the mere claims of
science.
    3.   I now turn to reply to Prof. Tyndall’s paper more in de
 tail.   In doing so, however,       I
                                   shall not take any more notice of
 his   personal animadversions than will be absolutely necessary for
 the vindication of my person from the insinuations levelled
 against me.      .
    My “Note on Ray-Transmutation,” published in the Supple
mentary Number of the Philosophical Magazine for December
 1864, though not exclusively, was principally intended to point out
a capital defect in Prof. Tyndall’s published reasoning regarding
the origin of lime-light, &c. Prof. Tyndall does not deny that there
is a “missing link” in his argument; but, adopting a well-known
forensic device, he turns round upon me, and charges me with
having committed an even greater error. I had spoken, he says,
of the “paucity of rays of high refrangibility in a hydrogen
flame.” Now, Prof. Tyndall quotes passages from the writings
of Prof. Stokes, which appear to prove the fact to be the reverse
of my assumption. In doing           so,
                                    however, Prof. Tyndall evidently
forgets that, the richer    a hydrogen-flame        invisible Ritteric
                                                       is
                                                       in
rays, the more egregious the oversight
                             is                       he
                                               committed      leaving,

in   his own reasonings concerning the phenomena           lime-light,

                                             consideration.        the    In

                                         the British Association for

                                                                         at

space of 20 seconds was found to be very faint.         The expres
sions of “poor” and “rich,” however, are well known to be of
comparative value only; and Prof. Tyndall is well aware that
I  grounded my conclusions regarding the origin of lime-light,
not upon the poverty or richness of the oxyhydrogen-flame in
Ritteric rays in             its
                     natural state, but upon the comparative abun
dance    Newtonic and Ritteric rays emitted
          of                                      the oxyhydrogen               by

need refer only          to
                    the note which Prof.  Tyndall  certainly had be
               writing his late paper.           there expressly state that

 which was later corroborated                        by

146                  Dr. Akin's further Statements concerning
indicated in language which                     I am    altogether at a loss to construe.
Why “a proposed experimental demonstration of a point which
can only be decided by experiment,” should be necessarily                                            “hope
less" and “absurd,” because it is a “proposition,” i.e. a “pro
posal,” it is really beyond ordinary reasoning powers to compre
hend.    I proposed                                I hoped, with more
                                   three experiments by which
or less certainty, to produce calcescence;     to say that I advanced
the mere “proposition ” as equivalent to a demonstration of fact,
which is the only intelligible meaning can assign to Prof. Tyn  I
dall’s words, is one of those vagaries of language peculiar to Prof.
Tyndall, and to other examples of which I shall yet have to advert.
    Prof. Tyndall further criticises that of my proposed experi
ments which he allows to be “rational *—the “only rational’’
one among the three which I had suggested.               had hoped to                I
produce incandescence by means of a concentrated solar beam
sifted by a diaphragm of monochromatic red glass.             is need                      “It
less to remark,”  Prof. Tyndall  says,  “that,  even had this experi
ment   succeeded, the  question would have still remained unsolved;
for a sheet of glass, which permits the most powerful rays of the
visible spectrum to pass through       could not       it,
                                                      called  ‘proper           be              a

of red  rays+.   This latter    experiment,  although   less striking                                      to

Prof. Tyndall asks whether it will be believed that he needed my
“ideas” to inform him what he was “to do with the obscure
radiation from the electric light?”     Why should it not be be
lieved     Every one knew that the invisible part of the radiation
of the sun is calorifically powerful—at least to the same extent
as Prof. Tyndall had shown that of the electric light to be by
the experiments to which he refers in his last paper.    Every one
who had read Melloni’s papers knew also that, by means of black
glass, the Herschellic rays may be separated from the Newtonic;
and yet nobody knew what he was “to do” with the obscure radia
tion of the sun. In the article published in the ‘Saturday Review’
the solution proposed by me for the problem which         had indi                               I
cated was compared with the solution proposed in the case of
“Columbus's egg; ” and as in that case, so also in mine, it is
easy to say, ea post facto, that anyone might have found the
solution, had he but bethought himself of                                     it.

Tyndall which concern more my person than my writings.

148                 Dr. Akin's further Statements concerning
   Prof. Tyndall regrets that he was not more “suspicious.”
and I more “open”; and he employs in this connexion several
other expressions in keeping with his usual urbanity.       No
doubt Prof. Tyndall’s and my own views on this latter sub
ject differ considerably.                           I
                             have stated already that in Octo
 ber 1864 he  gave  me a  duplicate proof of the paper he was
then publishing.    Having read it in his presence,   proposed                                          I
to “talk it over” with him, when he replied that “there was
nothing to talk over.”           Had                              I
                                           shared Prof. Tyndall’s views
regarding conduct, no doubt                                  I
                                        should have been more “out
spoken,” and should have pressed upon him the remarks I
wished to make, notwithstanding.             As to the “rule of courtesy
in this country,” as in others, regarding the publication of pri
vate correspondence,                  I
                             am very well aware of          and have acted                   it,

   The author commences by showing the importance of bringing
analysis by the prism to bear upon the remarkable class of bodies
known as nebulae, especially since the results obtained by the largest
telescopes hitherto constructed appear to show that increase of optical
power alone would probably fail to determine the question whether
all  the nebulae are clusters                   of
                                  stars too remote          separately                to      be

   The kind of motion attributed to the medium when transmitting
light is that called transverse vibration.
     An elastic medium capable of such motions must be also capable
of a vast variety of other motions, and    elasticity may                     its                               be   called

  conditions therefore are those of a system of bodies connected with
 two driving-points A and B, in which we may determine the rela
  tion between the motions of A and B, and the forces acting on them,
 by purely dynamical principles.      It is shown that in this case we may
 find two quantities, namely, the “reduced momentum” of the system
 referred to A and to B, each of which is a linear function of the
 velocities of A and B. The effect of the force on A is to increase
 the momentum of the system referred to A, and the effect of the force
 on B is to increase the momentum referred to B. The simplest
 mechanical example is that of a rod acted on by two forces perpen

 - The relation which subsists between the electromagnetic and the
electrostatic system of units is then investigated, and shown to depend
upon what we have called the Electric Elasticity of the medium in
which the experiments are made (i.e. common air). Other media,
as glass, shellac, and sulphur have different powers as dielectrics;
and some of them exhibit the phenomena of electric absorption and
residual discharge.
   It is then shown how a compound condenser of different materials
may be constructed which shall exhibit these phenomena, and it is
proved that the result will be the same though the different substances
were so intimately intermingled that the want of uniformity could not
be detected.
   The general equations are then applied to the foundation of the
Electromagnetic Theory of Light.
   Faraday, in his “Thoughts on Ray Vibrations”*, has described the
effect of the sudden movement of a magnetic or electric body, and
the propagation of the disturbance through the field, and has stated
his opinion that such a disturbance must be entirely transverse to the
direction of propagation.       In 1846 there were no data to calculate
the mathematical laws of such propagation, or to determine the
velocity.
   The equations of this paper, however, show that transverse disturb
ances, and transverse disturbances only, will be propagated through
the field, and that the number which expresses the velocity of pro
pagation must be the same as that which expresses the number of
electrostatic units of electricity in one electromagnetic unit, the stan
dards of space and time being the same.
   The first of these results agrees, as is well known, with the undu
latory, theory of light as deduced from optical experiments.         The
second may be judged of by a comparison of the electromagnetical
experiments of Weber and Kohlrausch with the velocity of light as
determined by astronomers in the heavenly spaces, and by M. Fou.

 sected by deeply cut valleys which are occupied by arms of the sea
 on the west, and by the great lakes on the east. These crystalline
rocks comprise an ancient contorted gneiss, and a newer (probably
not very old) series of hornblende-slate, gneiss, quartzite, &c. East

porphyritic conglomerates, with greenstone-slates, &c., in patches,

can be easily worked into any required form.
   Pyrolusite, combined with platinum, also gives a pile whose electro
motive force can be easily raised to one-tenth of that of a Daniell’s
 element, without fear of the heat thereby required decomposing the
mineral. The upper and lower ends of a small cylinder, 6 millims. in
 diameter and 50 millims. long, easily cut from a complicated fibrous
variety of pyrolusite, were enveloped with platinum wire; and the
upper junction, in a cover of mica, was heated directly in a non-lumi
nous flame, whilst the lower one was immersed in water.            An expe
riment    therewith,  in  which, as  already  remarked,  d was  equal to 0-25

       SIR,                                         Utrecht, January 6, 1865.
    Allow   me to trouble you for your duly and highly esteemed opinion
 on a  subject   to which I have given considerable time and care, as
you may know from my Changements periodiques de température dé
pendants du Soleil et de la Lune, and from the Annalen of Poggendorff.
 I remember your having written in the Philosophical Magazine”,
first, that you could not, as Melloni did, find a heating effect from
the full moon's rays by means of your thermoscope, but that, at
the same time, you were of opinion that the smoke of London was
 an obstacle ; and secondly, that you supposed that the moon's rays
 cleared the sky, and that from that cause the earth lost more heat
 than it gained by the direct action of the moon.            I want to know
 whether this was a lapsus calami, or your real opinion.
    It is very improbable to me that a source of heat should be in any
way a source of cold, even if I could admit Sir John Herschel's
opinion to be a true one—that the moon does clear the sky. I
could not find, from many years’ observations, that the sky is more
serene when the moon is above than when she is beneath the hori
 zon—in other words, that it is clearer about the time of full moon
than it is about the time of new moon.
    As for the influence on the temperature, I have added together all
the observations taken on the first day of the moon, from 1729 till
now, as well as all the observations taken on the second, third, fourth,
and so on.
    The result is not the same from 1729 to 1789 as it is from 1789
to now.      In the first period I found a greater sum of temperatures
for the days between the 12th and 26th than for the 27th, 28th,
29th, 30th, and the eleven first days.                                  I
                                                In the second period find

just the same as Mr. Park Harrison, viz. a more elevated tempera
 ture about new moon; this is also the opinion of the observers who
accompanied the late polar expeditions.
    The whole series gives, however, a sum in favour of the full
 moon, just as it ought to be.
    You will agree with me that       if the new moon really gives a more
elevated temperature at the surface of the earth than the full moon,
the question is still more interesting, because the opposite ought to be
the case, since the whole earth necessarily contains more heat about
the time of full moon than about the time of new moon.               I have
thought, at the same time, whether the moon, when it has north
declination, imparts      a more elevated temperature to our ther
mometer than when        it has south declination; and I found it to be
so; but the difference is equally variable and small.
    Now we all admit that other perturbations, a thousand times
as great, may totally eclipse for a considerable time the small influ
ence of the moon; but nevertheless it seems to me, when we have
 135 years of continued observation, that those perturbations ought
to have annihilated themselves.
    Why is the    mean   result so small and uncertain, while we are so
certain of the    heating   action of the moon? The explanation that
 has occurred to me is this:—
    The moon acts partly directly, and by that part the thermometers
are most elevated the second or third day after full moon (the day
 of the greatest north declination for our latitude); but it also acts
in some measure indirectly, by elevating the temperature of the
 aqueous vapour in the atmosphere.          By the latter action the clouds
 and the air have a more elevated temperature, and contain more
 heat, about and after full moon; but some days must elapse before
 those particles of air and cloud reach the surface of the earth. When
 fourteen days elapse before they reach the surface, they have an
 action wholly opposed to the direct action, and thus the two parts
 of the action of the moon are necessarily neutralizing each other,
 more or less.
    Hence it is that experiments at great elevations, such as those of
 Prof. Piazzi Smyth at the Peak of Teneriffe, are of the greatest
 value.   It is one instance among many where they are indispensable.
    My letter is already too long to give you my numbers. I will
 publish them, but would like very much to know your opinion before
 doing so. Probably you have not time and leisure just now to give
 your attention to this question.        Perhaps you may think fit, how
 ever, to publish this letter of mine, with verbal correction, in the
 Philosophical Magazine, together with a few remarks of your own.
    Excuse me for thus applying to you; it is in order to fix your
 attention on the subject and to be instructed by your opinion.

instrument is eminently fitted to examine “the mixed action of our
 atmosphere and stellar space,” as regards radiation.               My observa

 of mine on the     questions    raised by my distinguished correspondent
 M.   Buys   Ballot,  would be of little value; but       I  am glad to see the
 subject in such excellent hands.          It also  gives   me pleasure to find
 that M. Poey has recently turned the thermo-electric pile to account
 in examining the atmosphere of Havana. This zealous observer                     .
 thinks that his observations regarding the action of aqueous vapour
 are diametrically opposed to mine: I, however, entertain a strong
 hope that M. Poey himself will eventually clear up the apparent dif
 ference. The experiments demonstrative of the action of aqueous
 vapour on radiant heat of low refrangibility are, in my opinion, per
 fectly conclusive.—John TYNDALL.]

    While the changing of the ultra-red rays of the spectrum of the
electric light into a complete luminous spectrum agrees so far with
the phenomena of fluorescence, that in both cases the change of
period is wrought by the intermediation of ponderable substances
which alter the rate of oscillation, still the fact that the one class of
effects is produced in bodies at ordinary temperatures, while the
other class requires the temperature of incandescence for their pro
duction, introduces a marked distinction between them.                   Instead,
therefore, of the two words “negative fluorescence” provisionally
adopted by me in an article in the January Number of the Philoso
phical Magazine,      I  would propose the word Calorescence to express
the   rendering   of bodies luminous by the heat of the ultra-red rays.

nomination as a right of the President, to which Sir Humphry Davy
replied, that he did; and then nominated Mr. Children.”
   It is likewise stated by Sir John Herschel (Phil. Mag. Jan. 1865,
p. 78), that “the President was distinctly asked by Dr. Wollaston
[at the Council of the Royal Society, Nov. 23, 1826] whether he
intended to use the privilege, by courtesy accorded to him, of
naming the Secretary, to which no one would object, or fairly to throw
it open to the Council. His answer to the former part of the alter
native was susceptible of any sense that one might choose to put
upon it; to the latter, it was both in Dr. Wollaston's opinion and
my own a negative.”
   You and I were present at that Council from the commencement
to its end.
   May I be permitted to ask you whether you remember having
heard any conversation such as that which has been stated by Sir
John Herschel and Mr. Babbage 2
     I
     assert, that no such conversation took place.
   May I also be permitted to ask you, as a then member of the
Council, whether you ever heard it even surmised, that Sir Humphry
Davy had promised to appoint Mr. Babbage to the office of Secre
tary of the Royal Society, and had then violated that promise 2

    There are, however,   some additional facts which     my opinion              in
establish that your  late  brother, Sir Humphry  Davy, did not, either
directly             by
               implication, promise that

XXVI. On     the Elastic Force of Steam of Marimum Density; with
   a new  Formula for the eagression of such force in terms of the
    Temperature.    By Thomas Row E EDMonds, B.A. Cantab.*
          laws of steam and other    vapours,   in relation to elastic
THEforce,      density, quantity of heat, and temperature, possess
claims  on the attention of mankind which are not surpassed in
interest or importance by the claims of any other branch of phy
sical science.   The foundation for the knowledge of these laws
must be sought in observations and experiments of great variety,
extent,  and accuracy.    The best of such observations (as is gene
rally acknowledged) are those of M. Regnault, made by order
and at the expense of the Government of France.         The report of
M. Regnault to the Government of his nation was made in the
year   1847.    His Report fills the twenty-first volume of the
Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences de     l’Institut de France.    It
is divided into ten memoirs on steam and allied subjects.         The
eighth memoir, entitled “Elastic Forces of Steam,” contains the
materials now presented for consideration.
    Among the laws of steam desired to be known, the most im
portant has generally been acknowledged to be the law which
indicates the relation between temperature and elastic force of
 steam confined with water in a closed vessel—such as the boiler
of a steam-engine.     On the application of heat to such a vessel,
the enclosed water will continually diminish by conversion into
steam, and the enclosed steam will continually increase in density
and elastic force until the point of condensation or saturation is
attained, or, which is the same thing, until the maximum den

170                     Mr. T. R. Edmonds                      on the   Elastic Force          of
sity appropriate to the given temperature is attained.         The
elastic force of such steam is measured by the height of a column
of mercury contained in a tube of which the open end is inserted
in the boiler containing both water and steam. At a given tem
perature, when the elastic force ceases to increase, the contained
steam must be of maximum density. It is to be noted that when,
by increasing the temperature, the whole of the contained water
has been converted   into steam, any further addition to the tem
perature cannot further increase the density of the steam, which
then becomes “dry” or “superheated ” steam, a kind of steam
which is not here taken into consideration.
   The problem offered for solution is this:—Given the tempe
rature of the water and steam contained in the boiler, it is
required to find, either by experiment or calculation, the corre
sponding elastic force when such force is constant and at                                                      its
maximum. This problem has been completely solved                   M.                                  by

quantity representing elastic force, and the latter temperature
measured             on      the thermometric scale),                   is   the following:

                            Steam      of Maximum                 Density.                              171

   The earliest of the empirical formulae referred to is that of our
own countryman Dalton, who suggested, as the foundation of
useful formulae of interpolation, the principle, that the elastic
forces increase in geometrical progression, whilst the tempera
tures increase in arithmetical progression. Thus Dalton's for
mula of interpolation would be
                                        log       Pi—At,
a formula consisting of one term only, and that term being the
first of the series (above given) constituting the Roche formula.
    M. Regnault (at page 587 of the volume” cited) makes a
valuable remark which is applicable to the two empirical formulae
just mentioned, as well as to other empirical formulae relating to
steam.     The remark            is,
                           that such formulae express correctly only
the first,    only the first and second terms
              or                                   the series consti         of

the numbers in the fifth column and the reciprocals of the abso

of one degree Centigrade, or one degree Fahrenheit, nothing is
required beyond, 1st, a Table of reciprocals of numbers repre

any one specific interval of temperature; and 3rdly, the value

                      XXVII.          On the Unit-volume of Gases.
    By Professor A. W. WILLIAMson, P.C.S., F.R.S., &c.”
            many years the term volume has been employed by che
Fol.mists          in a specific sense in relation to the weight of gases
and vapours. When a chemist speaks of a volume of hydrogen
or nitrogen, &c., he is understood to refer to that particular
quantity of the gas which is equal in volume to sixteen parts by
weight of oxygen. When we say that alcohol, according to the
formula C*H*O, is a two-volume vapour, we thereby say that
the weight represented by this formula, namely forty-six parts
                            * Communicated           by the Author.

                      Prof. Williamson             on the Unit-volume          of Gases.                 189
of alcohol, occupies twice the bulk of sixteen parts of oxygen, or
the same bulk as thirty-two parts of oxygen.
   Before the rectification of the atomic weight of oxygen, the
unit-volume was defined as being the volume of eight parts by
weight of oxygen.     But retaining the principle of that original
definition, viz. that the unit-volume is the volume of one atom of
oxygen, we now use volumes double as great as the old volumes,
while referring to an atomic weight of oxygen double of what
was formerly in use.
   A more convenient way of describing the unit-volume now in
use is to call it the volume of one part by weight or one atom
of hydrogen, and this definition is now generally coming into
use.    One important advantage of the rapidly prevailing system
of applying the term “two volumes * to the volume of two parts
by weight of hydrogen (or one molecule of free hydrogen), is
that we thus obtain an exceedingly easy means of calculating the
density of gases and vapours on the hydrogen scale.
  Thus when we say that the molecule of steam occupies two
volumes, we thereby assert that Hº O, or eighteen parts by
weight of steam, occupy twice as great a volume as one part by
weight of hydrogen, and our statement contains the data for cal
culating the density of steam compared to that of hydrogen;
for it amounts to saying that two volumes of steam weigh
eighteen, while one volume of hydrogen weighs one ; so that
one volume of steam weighs nine times as much as one volume
of hydrogen.
   Again, the molecule of chlorosulphuric acid, SO*Cl”, is stated
to occupy two volumes in the state of vapour, so that this weight
(S=32, O*=32, Cl*=71), 135, is as bulky as two parts by
weight of hydrogen, and our vapour has accordingly a density

75-8 cubic metres as the volume of our air reduced to 0°C.; and
this multiplied by ºn gives us 15918 as the volume of the
oxygen, whence 15918:           wall
                                 2: 16 gives us 22:740 grammes
as the  weight required.

at 100° C.
    The formula C*H*O- 2 vols., gives us 37 grammes as the
weight of 11.2 litres at 0°C., whence 3:305 grammes for one
litre at 0°C.   2-42 grammes is therefore the weight at 100°C.

the surface is greater, the ratio being the inverse square of the
radii.
    Suppose 100 radial lines like a b to be drawn equidistant, and
let c represent an extremely thin disk of metal perpendicular to
one of the radii. We know that on the inner side of c negative
electricity appears, and on the outer positive.       These are shown
by the arrow-heads, or rather what are more correctly to be taken
as V marks.      Thus c towards b presents a positive entrant or
male aspect, and c towards a presents a negative recipient or
female aspect.     Upon each of the 100 radial lines we may ima
gine an infinite number of such disks without any disturbance of
the electricity between the concentric spherical surfaces; and if
each is marked like c with the symbol of the electricity that is
developed on each side, we shall have each of the 100 lines re
presented thus >>PPPP, which exhibits the nature of the static
polarizing power that exists in the space between a and b. The
intensity of this force depends on the distance between the lines,
diminishing as the distance increases.        To obtain a clear idea of
 this, we may suppose another disk d similar to c and close to                                                      it.

   61. In the magic pane the free part of the charge compresses
the engaged part by the contractile tension of the free lines.
These by their lateral repulsion tend to fill up unoccupied space,
and thus bend round the engaged lines and acquire the lateral
packing power by their longitudinal tensile force when thus bent.
   Fig. 40 is intended to give an idea of the charging of a magic
pane.   The line B pressed forward by A (intended to represent
the lines engendered by the machine) arrives at the balls k, l.
The ball l cuts the line, and so do the opposite surfaces of the
magic pane.     The part of it between k and l remains, and so
does the  part  between the coatings of the magic pane.       The
part c between l and the near surface of the magic pane con
tracts and discharges itself along the conducting wire w; the
exterior part D escapes to the ground by the free conductor a
after the centre part N has been pressed into the magic pane.
The lines between k and l accumulate until discharge takes
place, which may be looked upon as a signal that a certain
number 2 of lines have crossed over and left segments packed
into the magic pane.    The spark appears after the unit quantity
has entered the  jar.   The propelling force (from the machine)
required to bring up a of course increases as the charge M
increases; but when brought up, it is probable that discharge
between k, l destroys the same constant number of lines, and

   (8b, &c.) Are due to a similar quality of shell lac, and probably
other non-conducting surfaces.              If the electric fire consists of
strongly excited molecules, we may remark that when in such
condition of excitement, and moving probably with inconceivable
velocity, they appear not to obey any ordinary law of projectile
force. They seem for the time to form part of the polarized
aether, and to be in the grasp of an agent of transcendant attri
butes. As it is in the spark, so must it be in the lightning,
the amazing mechanical effects of which must be due to the
matter issuing from the surfaces of discharge.

   (24, 25, 26.) Here there is evidence, especially in 25., that
the flame or match acts in discharging the B. D. partially, as if
unconnected with the electroscope.    In this it differs from the
action of points, which could not discharge the B. D. without
charging the electroscope, although the discharge would of
course be more limited than if the plate of the electroscope were
a free conductor.
    (27, 28.) Why should not the brass disk be discharged under
the same conditions that discharge the excited sulphur 7
    (30.) This is proof of induction acting in curved lines,
which Faraday was the first to direct attention to (Experimental
Researches, 1218, 1231).          Not entertaining the possibility of
such curved action      taking   place in a vacuum, he holds that the
inductive force is enabled to bend round in consequence of the
molecules of air being polarized, and one leading the action
to the others in straight lines. In § 63 of paper in Phil.
Trans. for 1834, Harris states that the operation of electricity
on distant bodies by induction is quite independent of atmo
spheric pressure, and is precisely the same in vacuo as in air.
    (31.) The free part of the charge which issues from the exterior
surface of the inside coating gradually diminishes, and the
engaged or masked portion between the coatings consequently
expands, and the free part comes to issue from the exterior sur
face of both coatings.         So the electroscope shows latterly the
action of that nearest to        it,
                                  which again        removed  is   touching       by
the outer coating. See 34.

Tait “that, so far as experimental facts were known in Newton’s
time, he had the Conservation of Energy complete.” In the case
of any other man it might appear ungenerous to look too closely
into claims to a scientific discovery put forward on his behalf by
well-meaning advocates, especially when there is not any better
entitled competitor in the field; but in the case of Newton, whose
head is already so thickly covered with laurels, this remark could
not apply.         I
                cannot help thinking that the principle of the Con

    I am a strong partisan of the notion of the transport of
erratic blocks by ice, at the period of the great extension of the
glaciers, and as a Swiss I am attached to this theory, which is
worthy of the term national.      But, at the same time that                                                 I
acknowledge it to be accompanied by certain difficulties,    can                                   I
not  comprehend   the two other theories, although  they have the
advantage of being advocated by able men of science.     Amongst
these is to be counted Professor Ramsay, a highly distinguished
geologist, to whom long practice on the Geological Survey of Eng
land has given great powers of observation and a sure eye (cow
d’ail), Mons. de Mortillet, who is well acquainted with the
Alps, and Professor Tyndall, whose works on physics hold the
first place.  Not that I do not sincerely respect the opinions of
the learned authors who have developed these views, and who
have done             so,
                      acknowledge, with considerable ability.
                       I
                                                                                                            is on
  It    is evident, indeed, that existing glaciers abrade the rocks
which they move, inasmuch               they polish them. But this action
                                                     as
so   feeble, that       cannot see how
                          I                    has been inferred therefrom
                                                               it

I  understand still less how this same action could have excavated
valleys many thousands               feet deep  of      great rock-mass like
                                                                     in   a

208                        Prof. Favre on the Origin of
the name of the Glacier of the Rhone has been given. This glacier
evidently discharged itself into the Swiss plain by the valley
which extends from Martigny to Willeneuve, and had a mini
mum thickness of 2300 to 2600 feet *.
     This great glacier extended itself over the plain. It covered
all the bottom of the basin of Lake Leman with moraines,
boulders, clay, and scratched pebbles. The distribution of these
materials has often been studied; they are spread over the two
                                  I
banks of the lake; but do not think that any conclusion can be
 drawn from their examination, either for or against the hypo
 thesis which I am desirous of examining.
     In the course of its slow but continuous movement, the enor
 mous glacier abutted eventually against the Jura. As M. Char
 pentier has stated, it is remarkable that the maximum height of
 the traces which it has left should be near Chasseron, a moun
 tain situated to the north-west of Yverdun, just opposite the
 valley of the Rhone. The blocks there attain an elevation of
 3000 feet above the Lake of Neuchâtelt.
     Thence the upper limit of the boulders falls successively to
 wards the north and south, in such a manner that we may apply
 the term median to the line which connects the mouth of the
 Rhone near Willeneuve with Chasseron. North of the median line
 the higher line of the blocks rejoins the plain in the environs of
  Soleure. The glacier terminates there, and has left at                ex                 its
  treme limit the remarkable blocks              Steinhof, near Soleure.

  South of    the median line the glacier has left incontestable traces
       all  the southern extremity       the Swiss plain.         has gone

   These pebbles must consequently have passed over the de
pressions of the lake. But how could they do so, since their
transport appears to be anterior to the development of the
glacier?   That is the difficulty, and it is this which has given
rise to the notion of the theory of excavation, in which it is
supposed that the pebbles  of the older drift have been heaped
up by pre-glacial currents in the depths of the lake, and that
when the glacier reached them it excavated that portion of the
lake which had been filled up. It is supposed, then, that it has
produced a great excavation, and that it then spread before it
all   this enormous mass                 ofpebbles which     drew from this great

neighbourhood run nearly north-east, follow for a great dis
tance the curve of the lake, and towards the frontier of the
Walais take an easterly direction, as does the lake itself between
Rolle and Villeneuve.”         This form may be recognized in my
geological map of Savoy.
    These great features, so characteristic of the region of the
Alps which border upon us, establish an evident relation be
tween the form and position of the lake-basin, the orography
of the ground, and the cause which has elevated the mass of
 the Alps above the mean level of the continent.
    The position of most of the Alpine lakes reveals to us, again,
the relation which subsists between the mountains and the
 lake-basins: nearly            either      all   lie

214         On  the  Origin  of the Alpine  Lakes and Valleys.
Playaux near Wevey, and on the southern at Woirons, east of
Geneva.      These two mountains are both situated on the borders
of the    Alpine    chain.   In order properly to grasp the relation
which subsists between the overthrow of the strata along this
line and the great depths of the lake, it is necessary to mark on
the map the soundings of the lake by De la Beche, the positions
of the crests of the Woirons, the Allinges south of Thomon, and
of Playaux near Vevey *.
    The principal soundings of the lake placed opposite Meillerie
and Evian may likewise (and perhaps it is the most easily
effected) be marked on the geological map of Savoy.                    Then
Voirons and      Playaux    should be   joined   by   a line (but not by a
straight line, because the chains on the borders of the lake are
curved) drawn through Calvaire (Voirons), Allinges, the point
where the Alpine Macigno (M) (Affleure) descends to a level
with the bed of the Dranse, at a distance of four kilometres
 from Thonon and the city of Evian.            Such a line as this would
 terminate towards      Playaux,   passing   over the northern bank of
 the lake between Corsier and St. Saphorin.
    This course shows pretty nearly the line of the reversal of the
 strata situated on the flanks of the Alps; and, presenting a certain
 parallelism to the denudations of the different rocks traced on
 my geological map of Savoy, it passes through the midst of the
 soundings which indicate the greatest depth of the lake. Con
 sequently this depth bears a relation to the reversal of the beds.
                             I
 It is in such fractures, am confident, that the true cause of the
 origin of these lake-basins is to be found.
     From a summary of these facts it may be concluded—
     1st. That the Lake of Geneva deviates much from the median
  (central) line of the great glacier or glaciers which extended from
 the Rhone to the Jura.
    2ndly. That these ancient glaciers not having had the power to
 remove the older drift below Geneva, have not been able to pro
 duce in the lake-basins what is called their excavation (l’affouille
 ment).     If they could not scoop out these basins, still less have
 they excavated the adjacent valleys which terminate in them.
    3rdly. The valleys and the basins of mountain-regions are
 related to the cause which has given to the mountains their
 orographical characters, and to the strata their greater or less
 inclination.
    * This   mountain, called   Pleyaux or Playaux, is indicated on the
 Federal  map  by the name of Pléiades.   To facilitate the indication of it on
 my geological map of Savoy, on which it is not marked,      I should say that
it lies 6 kilometres from the mouth of the stream which discharges
itself into the lake between Vevey and Corsier, and 63 kilometres from
the point of Montreux.

                             did not know that you had brought the
subject forward there. Professor Stokes, however, informed me that
you were engaged on the question, and I had similar information
from the “Saturday Review.’
   “There is certainly a most singular coincidence in the thoughts
which have passed through both our minds on some of the points in
question.     As to the possibility of converting the Herschellic into
the Newtonic rays I do not entertain a doubt; and indeed the piece
of work which I had set before me for attack on my return from this
place was a series of experiments on this very subject.
   “I   have devised a very perfect means of sifting the Herschellic
from the Newtonic rays, and with the latter alone I have strong
hopes of being able to produce incandescence.     But you have entered
this field before me, and although the question lies directly in the way
of my own inquiries,             I
                         should like to do in the matter what would be
most   pleasing to you.   I shall be in town on Saturday next, at the
Royal Institution at noon; could you not look in upon me there :

    In the    December Number of the Philosophical Magazine,

doubt whether Sir        Humphry    Davy, for example, or any other
predecessor of Professor     Tyndall    at the Royal Institution, hav
ing read in a public print that two persons were engaged in
making researches on a certain subject with the aid and sanction
of the British Association, would have chosen ‘ that very subject’
be for

Davy would never have given Dr. Akin the chance                    garbling                 of

    The fundamental error        Dr. Akin consists his interpreting

     It was  in answer to the express desire of Dr. Akin to see me
 that I informed him at the end of my note from Chale that I
 should be in town on the following Saturday. He came. I have
 since ransacked my memory for the details of our interview; and
 though    I cannot recall the whole of them, the essential ones are
 perfectly clear to me, while the result is as vivid to my mind as
 the occurrence of yesterday.        Without waiting to obtain the
 knowledge of Dr. Akin's character that ten minutes' conversa
.tion might have given,     I  remarked that although he and had   I
 reached the same point by independent routes, he was the first
 to publish definitely his ideas, and that, therefore,    I would not
 interfere with him.     I  stated that although my plans were pre
 pared,   I  was perfectly willing to suspend them.        Dr. Akin's
 reply was that he was delighted to find the subject taken up,
 and was only anxious to see it prosecuted to a successful issue.
                    I
 Of these words have the most distinct recollection.          I  did not
 know at the time that the note written to him on the          previous
 Wednesday had excited his “astonishment”; nor did               I know
 that he had come, as he has since informed me, expecting that         I
 would make him an offer that we should work together; but
 pleased by his apparent frankness, on the spur of the moment I
 used these words:– “We might perhaps attack it together.”
 I  use the phrase “spur of the moment” because it strictly
represents the fact, but they who know me best will be the last
to believe me capable of retreating from a position assumed even
 on the spur of the moment.          And had Dr. Akin agreed to my
 proposal, no matter what consequent penalties it might have
 involved—and they,      I   doubt not, would have been great—I
 should have carried it out to the letter.       But he did not agree
 to my proposition.     He said that he had associated himself with
 Mr. Griffith at    Oxford,   and that he was compelled to fulfil his
  engagement with that gentleman.
     Let me here remark that neither Dr. Akin nor myself pro
  fesses to remember the whole of what occurred during this inter
  view; and when he spoke of his being bound to Mr. Griffith,
  some conversation followed, the precise terms of which       I  do not
  recollect; but it drew from Dr. Akin a proposition, which            I
  do remember perfectly well.       I will allow him to supply what    I
  have here forgotten.     In a letter written to me more than three
  months ago, he affirms that when he declared himself bound to
  Mr.Griffith at Oxford, I rejoined:—“Can we not make it a triple
  alliance?” His reply was, “No, leave us the sun at Oxford, but
  as regards experiments on artificial rays, I shall be happy to co
  operate with you separately.”       Of the words “triple alliance.”  I
  have no recollection, but they are so like what I should use under
  the circumstances, that      I do not doubt the correctness of Dr.

Akin's memory regarding them. But do remember his proposal                  I
to work with me in London and with Mr. Griffith at Oxford,
and it caused me to pause.        Neither in       tone nor          terms       its                       in      its

                                           to                          ever                                         I
show the slightest symptom          assent.
     Inhis last published account          this conversation Dr. Akin of
omits       all
            reference      my proposal and his refusal
                                      to                           “triple                                 of   a
alliance,” and represents me         accepting his counterproposition
                                                            as
without reservation       qualification.
                                      or   “To this conclusion Profes
sor Tyndall cheerfully agreed, observing that          had from the first                  he
intended      make experiments
                  to                   the electric light; that  on    was                                               he
consequently quite satisfied with the arrangement proposed.”
Though there seems now                     doubt upon Dr. Akin’s mind
                                                of no

subject entirely in his hands throughout the summer. During
the months of April, May, and June my assistant was employed,
under my direction, on an investigation which he afterwards
published in the August Number of the Philosophical Maga
zine, while           I
                occupied my leisure with other matters.         The

riments to be undertaken on my return to town. On the very
day of my arrival the execution of these experiments is post
poned, and not a word is heard of them until the end of
October.
   Meanwhile Dr. Akin had pursued his experiments at Oxford,
and had sent in the following Report of his performances to the
President of the Physical Section of the British Association.
The document is dated from the Cavendish Club, London, 15th
September, 1864.

sciousness at the time that such an engagement existed, and that
anger now supplies him with a power of memory which in his
calmer moments he did not enjoy.
     I went to Switzerland early in July, and from Pontresina
wrote to my assistant, describing the apparatus I had intended
 to employ, and desiring him to have it prepared for me. . One
portion of it consisted simply of the substitution of a rock-salt
lens for the glass one of the electric lamp, and a rock-salt cell
 for the glass one that I had used in 1862. With this arrange
ment          I
           executed the experiments “on luminous and obscure
radiation ” described in the November Number of the Philoso
phical Magazine.         Nay, abandoning the rock-salt altogether,
and employing a glass lens of somewhat shorter focus than that
made use of in 1862, with a battery of sixty cells, I obtained
all  the results with the electric lamp there described.                   not                         In
the slightest particular does this arrangement differ from that
which    I had employed two years and three-quarters previously.
We have the same source                rays, the same mode
                                                         of           conver                     of

          the radiation.     And yet           from this, my own ground,
                                                                   is
which    I  had taken          practically up before       had perused the        he
“little German treatise which first taught him what had been
done”             on
             the subject                    of
                               fluorescence, that Dr. Akin would fence
me out.
    Experiments                  on
                        combustion could not decide the question                                                of
ray-transmutation.         “Intimately connected             they assuredly       ”

  Late in the day of the 29th of October, I obtained the incan
descence of platinum foil by the dark rays of the electric light.
The layer of iodine, however, was too thin to wholly intercept
the light, while the battery had been enfeebled by long-continued
previous action. On the following morning it was freshly charged,
the number of cells being increased from fifty to sixty. Removing
from the back of the camera the little reflector which   had made I
use of in 1862,              I
                     mounted it on a retort-stand, and with it
converged the rays from the lamp. The mirror was silvered
behind, and the reflected rays had therefore to pass to and
fro across a plate of glass of considerable       thickness. Not
withstanding this, however, and the employment of a much
thicker layer of dissolved iodine, the platinum, when placed in
the dark focus of the mirror, became vividly incandescent.
Almost immediately after the performance of this experiment
I  found Dr. Akin in the library of the Royal Institution. With
                                      I
out a moment's hesitation invited him to accompany me to the
laboratory, and there almost simultaneously with myself he saw
the result which             I
                     had obtained”.
    Not one word of remonstrance or complaint escaped him on this
occasion; not a syllable to indicate that he believed me in any
way pledged to him.      He made some critical remarks as to the
experiment being made in daylight.           He was moreover struck
with the thickness of the layer of iodine employed, observing
that the layer used by him at Oxford was a thin one, which
did not cut off the light. He finally expressed himself delighted
 to see the experiment, and we quitted the laboratory together.
I  walked with him upstairs, and there at the eleventh hour ex
 pressed my desire not to interfere with him, and to leave, if he
 wished      it,
            the subject still    his hands. His reply was,

the experiment        I had showed him, his mind had become greatly
agitated.       He referred to our interview in         April, and to what
he asserted had occurred between us since.              Like his last article
in this Journal, that letter consisted of a single broken fibre of
truth in a tissue of error. I then went through the assertions
of Dr. Akin one by one, pointed out where they were exag
gerated, where he had unduly intensified language, and where
his statements were, as I believed, at direct variance with facts.
His last paper furnishes some illustration of the intensification
of language which I then sought to correct. In my reply to
his intimation that         I had appropriated his ideas,      I stated that
“my work would have been far more completely done by this
time had he never existed.”               Dr. Akin’s version of this state
ment of a fact is this:—“Professor Tyndall, who is charitable
enough to express an implied wish for my non-existence, will no
doubt be gratified to learn that the experience I have met with
at his hands has acted upon me in the manner he would seem
to desire.”
    It was sufficiently evident from Dr. Akin's correspondence that
he was very much disappointed. He had been “greatly depressed
 and discouraged in mind” at Newcastle.                 “An indelible mark
 of  pain”      had been left     upon    his memory    by the treatment he
 received at     Oxford;    and now his misfortunes culminated on find
 ing, in London, the goal at which he aimed attained by another.
  Still that other, though sorely irritated, was less anxious to avail
 himself of his success than to show Dr. Akin “how lightly he
 valued the whole matter when a question of good faith came into
 play.” The letter which contained my corrections of Dr. Akin's
 misapprehensions concluded thus:—
    “And now for        a few concluding words:—I cannot help express
 ing my    deep    regret that you did not write to me in a different
 manner.       I should have gone almost any length to gratify you, had
 you adopted another tone; and          I shall prove my sincerity in writing
 thus, by doing that which still remains in my power to do.             I have
to say, then, that from this 3rd of November 1864 to the 3rd of
 November 1865 I shall not make known, publicly or privately, any
 experiments on ‘ray-transmutation.”          Nearly seven months ago I was,
 as  you  know,     ready  to take this subject up. Out of deference to you
 I did not do     so;  so that at the termination of the period referred to I
 shall have held back for nearly nineteen months.            That you will be
 able to release me long before, by the actual performance of this
 experiment, is almost beyond a doubt; and in this event I hope
 to muster sufficient greatness of heart not to envy you.”

                 Prof. Tyndall on the History            of Calorescence.        229
     Dr. Akin has the assurance to upbraid me with having, in the
face of this  promise, seized the first opportunity to publish my
results.     My  promise was given in order to enable him to
perform honest work, and not to indulge in aggression.
     I
     halted that he might move on. The arrangement left open
to him another summer, during which he might renew the                            in
vestigation that had broken down at Oxford, with the assurance,
moreover, that the object at which he aimed was no longer a
doubtful one. Not satisfied with this arrangement, he continued
to complain, and I was at length obliged to end a profitless and
apparently interminable correspondence with these words:—“I
have now only to add, that when you have so far overcome the
agitation of mind to which you so frequently refer, as to be able
to look at this question with the eyes and mind of a philosopher,
I  shall be happy to communicate with you. But no possible good
 can arise from a continuance of this correspondence.    Hence, as
far as         I am   concerned,      it is for the present at an end.”
           then wrote to me his fifth letter, and ended it by the
      Dr. Akin
statement that, although he could scarcely allow himself to
hope much for the future, he wished, nevertheless, to say that
whenever          I
          should be pleased again to communicate with him he
would be happy to hear from me. This letter was dated from
Harley Street, November 9, 1864.
                                         I
    For nearly three weeks heard nothing from or of Dr. Akin,
but he meanwhile was not idle. Silently, and without a word
of warning to me, he concocted his “Note on Ray-transmutation”
for the December Number of the Philosophical Magazine. After
the completion of that article, and twenty-four hours previous to
    its
     publication,                 me commencing his letter with “Dear
                             it he
                         wrote         to

myself from time           time to   the wisest advice within my reach;

    2. Dr. Akin affirms that he closed with alacrity with a pro
 position of mine to work out, in conjunction with him, a certain
 subject.
    But Dr. Akin admits that he did not “close?” with my first
proposition, on account of his                           tie

        “On       a Method          of   Meteorological            Registration          of the Chemical
Action of Total Daylight.”                         By Henry E. Roscoe, B.A., F.R.S.
  The aim of the present communication is to describe a simple mode
of measuring the chemical action of total daylight, adapted to the
purpose of regular meteorological registration.    This method is
founded upon that described by Prof. Bunsen and the author in their
last Memoir” on Photochemical Measurements, depending upon the
law that equal products of the intensity of the acting light into the
times of insolation correspond within very wide limits to equal shades
of tints produced upon chloride-of-silver paper of uniform sensitive
ness—light of the intensity 50, acting for the time 1, thus produ
cing the same blackening effect as light of the intensity 1 acting for
the time 50.      For the purpose of exposing this paper to light for a
known but very short length of time, a pendulum photometer was
constructed; and by means of this instrument a strip of paper is so
exposed that the different times of insolation for             points along the    all
length       of
             the strip can       calculated be    within small fractions

of measurement. Two strips of this paper are exposed as usual in
the pendulum photometer: one of these strips is fixed in hyposul
 phite-of-sodium solution, washed, dried, and pasted upon a board
 furnished with a millimetre-scale.               This fixed strip is now graduated
 in terms of the unfixed pendulum strip by reading off, by the light
  of a soda-flame, the position of those points on each strip which
  possess equal degrees of tint, the position of the standard tint upon
 the unfixed strip being ascertained for the purpose of the gradu
  ation.    Upon this comparison with the unfixed pendulum strip
  depends the subsequent use of the fixed strip. A detailed descrip

mental error may be estimated. Curves exhibiting the graduation
of several strips are also given; and from these the author concludes
that the determinations agree as well as can be expected from such
photometric experiments, the mean error between the positions 40
and 80 min. on the strip in one series of graduations not exceeding
 1 per cent. of the measured intensity.           To each fixed strip a Table
is attached, giving the intensity of the light which must act for 1
second upon the standard paper, in order to produce the tints at
each millimetre of the length of the strip.
   The methods of exposure and reading are next described. The
exposure of the paper is effected very simply by pasting pieces of
standard sensitive paper upon an insolation band, and inserting the
band into a thin metal slide having a small opening at the top and
furnished with a cover, which can be made instantly to open or close
the hole under which the sensitive paper is placed. When one ob
servation has thus been made, and the time and duration of the inso
lation noted, the remaining papers can be similarly exposed at any
required time; and thus the determinations can be very easily car
ried on at short intervals throughout the day.
   The reading-instrument consists of a small metallic drum, fur
nished with a millimetre scale, and upon which the graduated strip
is fastened. The drum turns upon a horizontal axis, and the inso
lation band, with the exposed papers upon                     it,

the interesting results to which a wide series of such measurements
must lead. They extend from August 1863 to September 1864; and

   As a rule, one observation was made every half-hour; frequently,
however, when the object was either to control the accuracy of the
measurement or to record the great changes which suddenly occur
when the sun is obscured or appears from behind a cloud, the deter
minations were made at intervals of a few minutes or even seconds.
   Consecutive observations were carried on for each day for nearly a
month, from June 16th to July 9th, 1864; the labour of carrying
out these was not found to be very great, and the results obtained are
of great interest. By reference to the Tables, it is seen that the
amount of chemical action generally corresponds to the amount of
cloud or sunshine as noted in the observation; sometimes, however, a
considerable and sudden alteration in the chemical intensity occurred
when no apparent change in the amount of light could be noticed
by the eye. The remarkable absorptive action exerted upon the
chemically active rays by small quantities of suspended particles of
water in the shape of mist, or haze, is also clearly shown. For the
purpose of expressing the relation of the sums of      all the various

hourly intensities,         giving the daily      mean      chemical intensities of the
place, a rough method   of integration is resorted to : this consists in
determining the weights of the areas of paper inscribed between the
base-line and the curve of daily intensity, that chemical action being
taken as 1000 which the unit of intensity would produce if acting
continuously      for twenty-four
                             hours.  The remarkable differences
observed in the chemical intensity on two neighbouring days is
noticed on the curves for the 20th and 22nd of June 1864: the
integrals for these days are 50.9 and 119, or the chemical actions on
these days are in the ratio of 1 to 2:34.
   The chemical action of light at Manchester was determined at the
winter and summer solstices, and the vermal and autumnal equinoxes:
the results of these measurements are seen by reference to the accom
panying curves. The integral for the winter solstice is 47, that of
the vernal equinox 36:8; that of the summer solstice 119, and that
of the autumnal equinox 29' 1. Hence, if the chemical action on the
shortest day be taken as the unit, that upon the equinox will be
represented by 7, and that upon the longest day by 25.
   The results of simultaneous measurements made at Heidelberg
and Manchester, and Dingwall and Manchester, are next detailed.
   From the integrals of daily intensity the mean monthly and
annual chemical intensity can be ascertained, and thus we may
obtain a knowledge of the distribution of the chemically acting
rays upon the earth's surface, such as we possess for the heating rays.

  The authors then attempted to answer the following questions:--
   (1) Is the umbra of a spot nearer the sun's centre than the penum
bra, or, in other words, is it at a lower level ?
   (2) Is the photosphere of our luminary to be viewed as composed
of heavy solid, or liquid matter, or is it of the nature either of a gas
or cloud 7
   (3) Is a spot (including both umbra and penumbra) a pheno
menon which takes place beneath thelevel of the sun's photosphere
or above it !
     In answering the first of these, it was shown that if the umbra
is appreciably at    a lower level than the penumbra, we are entitled
to look for an apparent encroachment of the umbra upon the penum
bra on that side which is nearest the visual centre of the disk.
This, in fact, was the phenomenon which Wilson observed, and which
led him to the belief that the umbra was nearer the sun's centre than
the penumbra.
   Two Tables are then given, showing the relative disposition of the
umbra and penumbra for each spot of the Kew pictures available for
                                          -
this purpose.
   In the first of these, this disposition was estimated from left to
right, this being the direction in which spots advance across the
visible disk by rotation; while in the second Table this disposition
was estimated in a direction parallel to circles of solar longitude, and
in this Table only spots having a high solar latitude were considered.
   From the first of these Tables it was shown that, taking             those                             all
cases where          an

stated to be about eleven in number; and the author remarked that
towards   the two lowest seams Pachydomus, Bellerophon, &c.
were found; Spirifer abounds near the lowest seam, as well as
Fenestella and Orthoceras; but the Vertebraria and Glossopteris,
occur throughout, while Lepidodendron has been found in coarse -
grits below the Coal-measures.
   Mr. Keene then described a lower fossiliferous limestone uncon
formable to, and much older than, the Coal-measures;       and gave
a sketch of the geology of the Peak Downs Range, in Queens
land. He concluded by referring to his large collection, sent to
England some time ago, and now in the Bath Philosophical Institu
tion, for further evidence of the age of the Coal-beds of New South
Wales, which he believes to be as old as those of Europe.

S. W.  Wood,   jun., Esq.,  F.G.S.
   In this paper the author divides the Drift of the country extend
ing from Flamborough Head to the Thames, and from the Sea on
the East to Bedford and Watford on the West, as follows:—a, the
Upper Drift, having a thickness of at least 160 feet still remaining
in places. b and c, the Lower Drift, consisting of an Upper series
(b), having a thickness from 40 to 70 feet, and a Lower series (c),
with a thickness, on the coast near Cromer, of from 200 to 250 feet,
but rapidly attenuating inland.      c comprises the Boulder-till, and
overlying contorted Drift of the Cromer coast, which along that
line crop out from below b a few miles inland. c also, in an at
tenuated form, ranges inland as far south as Thetford, and probably
to the centre of Suffolk, cropping out from below b by Dalling, Wal
singham, and Weasenham, and appearing at the bottom of the
valleys of central Norfolk. b consists of sands, which on the east coast
overlie the Fluvio-marine and Red Crag, but change west and south
into gravels, which pass under a and crop out again on the north,
south, and centre of Norfolk, and west of Suffolk and Essex, ex
tending (but capped in many places by a) over most of Herts.       The
Upper Drift (a) consists of the widespread Boulder-clay, which
overlaps b, for a small space, on the south-east in Essex, and again at
Horseheath, near Saffron Walden, but overlaps it altogether on the
north-west, resting on the secondary rocks in Huntingdonshire and
Lincolnshire. The distribution of bindicates it as the deposit of an
irregular bay, afterwards submerged by the sea of a, which over
spread a very wide area.     a now remains only in detached tracts,

 visible rays as that exhibited by the electric light, which is practically
 uninfluenced by atmospheric absorption.
     Having thus demonstrated that a powerful flux of dark rays
 accompanies the bright ones of the electric light, the question arises,
 Can we separate the one class of rays from the other
     In the lecturer's first experiments on the invisible radiation of
 the electric light, black glass was the substance made use of. The
 specimens, however, which he was able to obtain, destroyed, along
 with the visible, a considerable portion of the invisible radiation.
 But the discovery of the deportment of elementary gases directed
 his attention to other simple substances.                    He examined sulphur
 dissolved in     bisulphide    of carbon,  and found it almost perfectly trans
 parent to the invisible rays.          He also examined the element bromine,
 and found that, notwithstanding                          its

244             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
their discoverer, and to the phenomena brought forward on Thursday
week at the Royal Society, and on the evening of the following day
at the Royal Institution, the lecturer proposes to apply the term
calorescence.
   It was the discovery, more than three years ago, of a substance
opake to light, and almost perfectly transparent to radiant heat—
a substance which cut the visible spectrum of the electric light sharply
off at the extremity of the red, and left the ultra-red radiation almost
untouched—that led the lecturer to the foregoing results. They lay
directly in the path of his investigation, and it was only the diversion
of his attention to subjects of more immediate interest, that prevented
him from reaching, much earlier, the point which he has now at
tained.    On this, however, the lecturer could found no claim, and
the idea of rendering ultra-red rays visible, though arrived at inde
pendently, does not by right belong to him.      The right to a scientific
idea or discovery is secured by the act of publication; and, in virtue
of such an act, priority of conception as regards the conversion of
heat-rays into light-rays, belongs indisputably to Dr. Akin. At the
Meeting of the British Association, assembled at Newcastle in 1863,
he proposed three experiments, by which he intended to solve this
question.     He afterwards became associated with an accomplished
man of    science,  Mr. Griffith, of Oxford, and jointly with him pur
sued the    inquiry.    Two out of the three experiments proposed at
Newcastle     are, the lecturer believed, impracticable; but the third,
though not yet executed, may nevertheless be capable of execu
tion. In that third Dr. Akin proposed to converge the rays of the
sun by a concave mirror, to cut off the light by “proper absorbents,”
and to bring platinum-foil into the focus of invisible rays.         It is
quite possible that, had he possessed the instrumental means at the
lecturer's disposal, or had he been sustained as the lecturer had been,
both by the Royal Society and the Royal Institution, Dr. Akin might
have been the first to effect the conversion of the dark heat-rays
into luminous ones. For many years the idea of forming an intense
focus of invisible rays had been perfectly clear before the lecturer's
mind, and in 1862 he published experiments upon the subject.           He
had then discovered the properties of iodine, and had made use of
this substance as an absorbent, in the manner subsequently proposed
by Dr. Akin. The effects observed by him in 1862 at the focus of
invisible rays, were such as no previous experimenter had witnessed,
and no experimenter could have observed them without being driven
to the results which formed the subject of the evening's discourse.
Still publication is the sole test of scientific priority, and it cannot
be denied that Dr. Akin was the first to propose definitely to change
the refrangibility of the ultra-red rays of the spectrum, by causing
them to raise platinum-foil to incandescence.

              be heated by the charge and discharge, I arranged an ap

paratus by which even small heating-effects could be recognized with
certainty.      The result of the experiments made there with quite an
swered my expectations.          The construction of the apparatus is as fol
lows:—I covered with silk a fine iron and equally fine German-silver
wire.     These wires were cut into pieces about a decimetre in length,
and each German-silver wire soldered to an iron wire. These wires
were so laid upon a glass plate covered with a cement of resin and
shell-lac, that the solderings of 180 wires, without touching, occupied
a space of about a square decimetre.            By pressing with a warm iron
the wires were fused into the cement and thus fastened upon the plate.
After the adjacent free ends of the wires were soldered together so
as to form a battery of 180 elements, a second glass plate, also covered
with cement, was laid with the cemented surface upon the first. By
careful heating, the cement between the glass plates was softened,
and a portion of          it,
                          with the individual air-bubbles which             enclosed,      it
pressed out.       The thermo-pile stood thus                                               5 of

inside solderings was provided on both sides with tinfoil armatures
about  a    decimetre square, which were furnished with insulated wires.
The free ends         of the thermo-pile were also furnished with copper
wires,     by which  they   were connected with delicate reflecting galva

 carefully protected from any change            temperature.

A    LETTER FROM SIR J. F. W. HERSCHEL, BART., To THE EDITORs
     OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE AND JOURNAL, IN REFER
     ENCE TO A RECENT COMMUNICATION TO THAT WORK OF DR. J.

          To the Editors               of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
          GENTLEMEN,                       Collingwood, February 12, 1865.
   In reference to the communication from Dr. Davy in your Journal
for this month, I have only a few words to say. If the conver
sation between Dr. Wollaston and Sir Humphry Davy, the pur
port of which I stated in my letter to you of December 20, 1864,
did not take place, I must have been dreaming when I wrote down,
within forty-eight hours from the time of its occurrence, the state
ment in question.      If so, the dream has been a singularly persistent
one, as I still retain a clear recollection of that conversation having
taken place, and of its general purport, though not of the particular
words used ; and                   I
                       have, moreover, before me the copy of a letter
which I wrote to Mr. Davies Gilbert on the 27th of June, 1827,
enclosing my formal resignation of the Secretaryship, in which the
opinion expressed by Dr. Wollaston on that occasion respecting the
President's right or courtesy of nomination is alluded to. This letter
I subjoin; observing merely that, as Mr. Gilbert was present at the
Meeting of the 23rd of the previous November, the allusion to a
matter of which he was personally cognizant requires no further
explanation.                      (Copy.)

deration.    But it is consistent with my theory to attribute it also to
the fact that the existence of cloud and vapour is due to the sun and
the winds, and consequently the action of the moon, though con
sistent, cannot be regular or constant.
    For example, if no clouds are formed at the period of new moon and
first quarter, the earth's radiant heat passes away into space, and the
result is cold at a time when curves of mean temperature for a
series of lunations, show heat; and so in like manner, if more heat
than the moon is able to disperse occurs in the second half of the
lunation, where the curves indicate cold, the result, pro hac vice,
would be a higher temperature than the average.
    Lastly, as the moon's hemisphere turned towards the earth does
not, as it would appear, attain its maximum heat until the last
quarter (and it is probable also that it does not part with all                                            its
radiant heat till several days after new moon),       any further expe     if
riments are made with the thermo-electric     pile, would    not     well              it         be

XXXVI.       On the Application    of the Principle of the Screw to  the
   Floats of Paddle-wheels.       By W. G. ADAMs, M.A., F.G.S.,
   Fellow of St. John's     College, Cambridge, Lecturer on Natural
   Philosophy at King’s College, London*.
          following calculation is an attempt to apply the mathe
THEmatical        laws of fluid-motion, as far as they may be de
pended on, to an important practical question with regard to
paddle-wheel steamers, viz. the comparison of the pressure of a
fluid on a float in the form of the surface of a screw, with the
pressure on the ordinary flat float, so as to discover whether any
advantage would be gained by having the floats of paddle-wheels
made in the form of a screw-surface.       This application of the prin
ciple of the screw has been conceived by Dr. Croft of St. John's
Wood, who has tested it by means of small working models
with very satisfactory results, both as to the speed when the boat
is either lightly or heavily laden, and also as to the steadiness of the
pulling power.       In all cases on the small boat, the new is
superior to the old paddle-wheel when they are of the same dia
meter, and even when the new wheel is narrower than the old
one. It has also been tried on larger boats, and the two kinds
of floats have been compared; and the results have been in
favour of the new principle, there being no large waves or
strong backward current in the case of the new wheel, and the
velocity and steadiness of motion being greater than in the
paddle-wheel with flat floats.         This principle is now being
applied, under Dr. Croft’s directions, to one of Her Majesty's
steamers.

and B H two parallel radii on opposite rims of one wheel, CEFD
the axis of two screw surfaces C E K G and D F L H of opposite
kinds, the outer edges G K and H L being at the circumference
of the wheel, and the angles which they make with H G at G and
H being each half a right angle; CE, EF, and FD are equal to
one another, so that between the floats a vacant space is left
equal in breadth to either of them. K L is a rod connecting the
free corners of the floats, and the planes KEM and LFN are per
pendicular to the axis.      These two floats take the place of one

of the ordinary flat floats; and propose to compare the pressure
on them, and the power necessary to sustain it for a given speed
of revolution with the pressure, and the corresponding power, in
the case of the ordinary paddle-wheel. Before entering into the
calculation, it will be well to notice some of the peculiar features

    On comparing these results, we     see that when the two wheels
are revolving with the same angular velocity, the resistance and
moment on the new float are less than on the old, but the ratio
between the work done and the power required to perform it is
greater in the case of the new wheel than in that of the old, in
the ratio of 7 to 6; so that the advantage is on the side of Dr.
Croft’s invention.    If the difference of the powers of the two be
spent   in increasing the angular velocity of the new wheel, then
the resistance will be greater in the new wheel than in the old,
in the ratio of 7 to 6; and the angular velocities in this case
would be in the ratio of 6 to 5.
    The mathematical theory takes no account of the motion of
the water; so that the results of the above calculations are quite
separate from the other evident advantages stated in the early
part of this paper.    Also, since the floats enter the water gradu
ally, and since the water is less disturbed, it is plain that the
angular velocity of the new wheel may be increased in the above
ratio without causing the floats to slip through the water and
 do no work.
    Another case, where the results may be more easily obtained
 from the expressions after the first integration, is that in which
 the axis of the wheel is the axis of the screw-surface, and where
 the inner portion of the surface up to a distance of one-third of
 the radius from the axis is cut out, so that    a-0, and    the limits
 of integration for p are r and 3.     Hence

  Hence     if these   wheels be of the same breadth as in the first
case, the resistance and moment are not so great as in the other
case, but are nearly in the same proportion.       the breadth of                 If
 <U+017F>º
the wheel be three-fourths of the radius, then the same resistance
will be produced by the same power as in the first case considered.
  It will now not be difficult to arrive at the expressions for the
resistances and moments, taking into account the velocity of the
steamer.        If
              v be this velocity, the expression for the resistance
when the float is in a vertical position is

 the engine required to do it is about 3 per cent. less. The
  angular velocity of the new wheel will be greater than that of
 the old in the ratio of 1.175 to 1, or nearly in the ratio of 6 to 5.
  We may conclude, then, that for a velocity of ten miles an hour
 in a steamer with paddle-wheels of 15 feet radius, the number
 of revolutions a minute should not be less than 18: and with
 this number the relations between the resistances and moments
 are those given     above, which show an advantage in favour of
 the new wheel.      With a less number of revolutions the part of
 a float nearest to the axis will tend to stop rather than to propel
 the boat.    For a velocity of 18 miles an hour, the number of
 revolutions a minute in the new wheel should not be less than
 30, for the same reason; and then the same hold is obtained on
 the water as in the ordinary wheel making 25 revolutions a
 minute, and that with less power of engine.          By still further
 increasing the angular velocity in the new wheel as compared
 with the old, so that the number of revolutions a minute are as
 3 to 2, the ratio of the resistance to the power producing it is
 10 per cent. greater in the new wheel than in the old.          Since
it appears that the angular velocity of the new wheel may be
made much greater than that of the old (provided marine
 engines will admit of such an increase in the rate of revolution)
without causing the floats to slip through the water, it follows
that this increase will give the new wheel a great advantage over
the old with regard to speed.

must be    provided,  to serve as a medium for the ordinary every
day transactions of the science; and in the second place, there
must be what may be called the legal language of the science,
—a language whose terms are, as far as possible, strictly defined,
and have an exact and generally recognized value.          It is this
second stricter language which constitutes the more technical
part of scientific momenclature, and it is this alone which it is
either desirable or possible to alter or reform in accordance with
any particular state of scientific opinion. The general language
of a science will always, in the main, take care of itself; and at
any given period it usually contains a large admixture of terms—

acid, S0° sulphuric acid, &c. Among the arguments urged by
Professor Williamson in support of this proposal, one of the
most forcible is founded upon what he says was the original
meaning of the word. “There are perhaps no words in use
among chemists of which the original meaning was so clear as
the word acid, and the correlative word base. They were intro

alkaline salts, and their recognition as a distinct class, resulted
chiefly from Lavoisier's discovery of the presence of oxygen in
several of the best-known acids, and his consequent conclusion
 that they were in reality a particular class of oxides%. This view
 was of course applicable with strictness only to the anhydrous
acids, but it did not for a good while occasion any difficulty in
the application of the word acid: the essential nature of the dif
ference between the bodies since known as anhydrides, and the
bodies formed by their union with water, although insisted upon
 by Davy, was not generally recognized until experiment had

the name anhydride to acids, and leaving bases, however anhy
drous they might be, entirely unprovided with a corresponding
name’” (page 424); but      I am not aware from what part of his
writings such a limitation can be inferred.        It is quite true,
however, that Laurent and Gerhardt pointed out that, as a matter
of fact, the bases which took part in a great many reactions were
not anhydrous oxides (as they had hitherto been commonly re
presented) but hydrates, and that they laid great stress upon the
importance of recognizing this fact in the chemical equations by
which those reactions were expressed.
                      I
   But not only can not admit that original usage is in favour
of that application of the terms “acid” and “base” which Dr.
Williamson recommends; it appears to me that one at least of
the arguments by which he tries to show that the salts of hy
drogen ought not to be called acids, can be used with equal force
against the employment of that name in the sense which he de
fends.    In page 426 he says,
   “But it is not only true that the bodies misnamed anhydrides
are acids; it is equally true and certain that the hydrogen-salts
cannot with any consistency be called acids: for when two hy
drogen-salts—say hydric nitrate and potassic hydrate—react on
one another, we cannot call the process a combination of nitric
acid with potash, without putting in the background, and to
some extent concealing, the fact that water is formed, quite as
much as potassic nitrate.     Learners of chemistry who have been
told that an acid is a thing which combines with a base, natu
rally and consistently wish to omit any mention of the water in
their description of the process, and they have to be told that
this supposed acid really is a salt of hydrogen possessing acid
properties, and the so-called base is a hydrogen-salt with strongly
basic properties, the two on coming together undergoing double
decomposition, just as truly as potassic chloride when mixed
with argentic nitrate.”
   Without dwelling upon the facts that chemists who call
hydrogen-salts acids, do not want to call the process above de
scribed “a combination of nitric acid with potash,” and that
they would not tell learners of chemistry that “ an acid is a
thing which combines with a base,” we may remark that a pre
cisely similar difficulty would in some cases arise for learners
from the adoption of Dr. Williamson's definition of acids. When
                                                         2 TI3

or thiacetic “acid,” (Cº H*O)° S, reacts with a base, say water,
 H*O (which is the first base in the list of examples on page 429),
we cannot call the process a combination of the acid with the
base, without putting in the background, and to some extent

concealing, the fact that it is in reality a double decomposition,
just as truly as the change which occurs on mixing potassic
chloride with argentic nitrate.
    Possibly Professor Williamson might reply to this, that he
 never asserted that double decompositions could not occur
 between acids and bases; but that is not now the precise ques
 tion.   If the impossibility of correctly describing the reaction
 which takes place between the two bodies NH0° and HKO as
 the combination of an acid with a base is a reason for not calling
  NHO' nitric acid, the like impossibility in the case of the
  bodies (C*H*O)*O and H2O is an equally good reason for not
  calling (C*H*O)*O acetic acid.
     Nevertheless, although it appears to me that the only consis
 tent and logical sense in which the word acid can be used, is
  the sense defined by Laurent and Gerhardt, it seems to me
  unnecessary to retain it at all as a strictly scientific term.     I
  most fully agree with what Professor Williamson says in a pas
  sage which follows immediately the one last quoted:—
   “I    hold that it is inconsistent and highly inconvenient to
 apply to the double decompositions which take place between
  hydrogen-salts of acid properties and hydrogen-salts of basic
 properties, any terms which conceal the fact of their close ana
 logy with other double decompositions; and that the hydrogen
 salts ought to be designated by terms similar in form and gene
 ral arrangement to the terms applied to the salts of other metals.”
   If   we regard the salts of hydrogen as constituted like the salts
 of  any  other metal, the application to them of the name acid
 becomes incorrect if it implies any peculiarity of constitution,
  and superfluous if it does not. When we want to speak of acids
 as a class, they are accurately and conveniently indicated as
 hydrogen-salts; while individual acids may equally well be de
 noted by such names as hydric sulphate, hydric nitrate, hydric
 chloride, &c., the systematic adoption of which is urged by Dr.
 Williamson.
    The word acid will certainly long remain as a part of popular,
 and even of ordinary chemical language, and hence the im
                                       its
                                                                   a its
 portance of trying to ascertain         correct application; but
 strictly scientific significance has passed away.           It
                                                           indicates
 distinction   to  which we now know that no real difference cor
 responds.
    Lastly,   it  necessary
                   is       to  saya  few words    as   to
                                                       the nomencla

 bestow the name acid. The term      “anhydride,”       by
                                                       which Laurent
 and Gerhardt designated these bodies, has been very justly ob

heat when decomposed; they break up when heated, and are not
reproduced on cooling.
     The following additional examples may be quoted from
Deville's paper referred to above—namely, chloride, iodide, and
 sulphide of nitrogen, which are suddenly decomposed with evo
 lution of heat by elevation of temperature, but are not reproduced
 by subsequent cooling. The law above stated holds good also
 for the transformations of dimorphous or polymorphous sub
 stances from one condition to another.
    1. When Arragonite is heated, it changes into calc-spar and
 evolves heat; Arragonite therefore contains more energy than
 calc-spar, and hence the opposite change does not take place on
cooling.
    2. Crystals of sulphur obtained by fusion (and belonging to
 the Fifth System) change at a low temperature, with evolution
 of heat, into crystals of the same form as those of native sulphur
 (which belong to the Fourth System). Again, therefore, more
 energy is contained in the substance in              first condition than    its
in   the second, and accordingly the inverse process does not
 occur     low temperatures.
          at                                         .
     3. Plastic sulphur (soufre mou) likewise evolves heat while
 passing into ordinary sulphur, and hence contains more energy
 than this.    Ordinary sulphur therefore cannot               itself change                of
 into the  plastic  modification,   but the  opposite   change    can occur.
     4. Deville” speaks                        of
                                  third modification        sulphur, which             of
is  insoluble      sulphide

 converted into common        sulphur;    and     follows from the expe  it
 riments       of
              Fordos and     Gelist,  that    takes up heat during the
                                                                   it
 change, thus exhibiting the opposite behaviour              that      plastic           to      of
 sulphur.     This insoluble modification       accordingly     contains less
 energy than ordinary sulphur, and apparently              does not change             it
 spontaneously into the latter.        Devillet kept some fragments                                   at
 the  ordinary   temperature,   which were unchanged after six years.

this kind takes place in freezing-mixtures, where the cooling is
a secondary consequence of the powerful molecular forces; but
similar phenomena do not seem to have been observed in the
case of simple combination accompanied by absorption of heat.
   The converse theorem to the above is as follows:—
     If heat is absorbed in the
                             case of a decomposition caused by ele
     vation of temperature, an action of the opposite kind will
     occur on subsequent cooling.
   This theorem cannot be referred to a theoretical basis, and
therefore cannot be looked upon as proved; it receives, however,
frequent confirmation, as the following examples show.
   Carbonate of lime absorbs heat, according to Favre and Sil
bermann, when decomposed by heat, and therefore does not con
tain as much energy as                    its
                              components taken together. Accord
ingly, lime and carbonic acid combine again            cooling.                on
  It   isworthy         of
                     remark that    Arragonite,   which contains more
energy, absorbs scarcely any heat when decomposed.
  It   isthe same with the slaking         lime.     great deal
                                                          of        heat  A                        of

                                               lime contains much less
energy than          its
                  components.       By heating,       decomposed, and     it   is
it re-forms spontaneously         cooling.      on

constituents. Their elements, however, unite only                  high                       at

 strength of chemical affinity increases with the temperature.
  In other compounds (nitric acid, for example) the components
possess less energy than the body formed.     In such a case the
spark must not only cause a possible increase of affinity, but it
must in addition furnish the needful energy; each spark, how
ever, yields only a limited quantity of work, so that the entire
 mass of such a mixture can never be made to combine by a
single spark.
    According to Favre and Silbermann+, 1 gramme of hydrogen
evolved 7576 units of heat by                       its
                                               conversion into ammonia;
ammonia therefore contains less energy than                               its
                                                                 components.

surprise us.

   4. Kirchhoff discusses the heat of combination in his memoir
on the effective function, and demonstrates that in general it must
alter with the temperature”.     This follows also as a direct con
sequence of the following considerations.     Let explosive gas be
converted into water at different temperatures, e.g. at 50° and
100° C., in a closed space, and therefore without development
of external work; the heat of combination can be the same in
both cases only if the difference between the quantities of energy
contained in the water and in the explosive gas at the two tem
peratures is the same. This again implies that aqueous vapour
and explosive gas take up equal quantities of heat when they
undergo equal elevations of temperature—in other words, that
under constant volume the specific heat of water-vapour is the
same as that of explosive gas.        This cannot in general be
assumed.
     Kirchhoff finds for this difference between the specific heats
of water-vapour and explosive gas, upon two distinct hypotheses,
0-0417 and 0.212 unit of heat per 1* C. We find similarly,
in the case of the formation of carbonic acid from carbonic oxide
and oxygen, 0.0049 unit per degree and per gramme.
   Since the alteration of the specific heat with the temperature
has been determined for only a few substances, this difference
cannot yet, in most cases, be exactly stated.
   5. The heat of combination is in general regarded as a mea
sure of chemical affinity; but although experiment shows on
the whole a greater heat of combination in the case of stronger
combinations, many striking exceptions nevertheless present
themselves which make it impossible to accept this as a fully
proved principle.    Thus phosphoric acid has a greater heat of
combination than    sulphuric  acid, although the latter displaces
it from       its
              compounds.    Potash       stronger base than lime,
                                                is   a

           GENTLEMEN,
 1.                ALEXANDER,
      MR. Philosophical     quoted by Professor Potter in the
                        Magazine for February, was surely
mistaken when he claimed as new, in 1848, the formula
                                        p= (a+bT)"
for the pressures of saturated vapours.   The general formula of
which it is a particular case, p=  (a+bT)n, was first proposed by
Dr. Thomas Young nearly sixty years ago. The same formula,
with the index n=5, was used by Arago and Dulong in 1829%,
and with the index n=6, by Tredgold about 1828+.
   2. The history of that and many other formulae is given by
M. Regnault in his Relation des Eapériences &c., vol. i. pp. 582
et seqq.   He gives the preference, for purposes of interpolation,
to the formula proposed by Biot in 1844,
                               log p-a+ba"+cº",

   3. Young's formula, it is true, contains three constants only,
a, b, and n; but, as M. Regnault has shown, it is deficient in

 pear, and become negative below that temperature, which is
 exceedingly improbable; and that it makes the pressure of every
 vapour increase without limit as the temperature rises—a result
 contradicted by the experiments of M. Regnault, which (as he
 states in vol.           p.
                      647) point

this fact stated as a piece of common knowledge in a manual so
popular as Sir Charles Lyell’s is sure to be. Some physical
geologists may doubtless marvel that Sir Charles, writing of
lakes that “run in great rents and faults,” is still of opinion
that the existence of such rents and faults in connexion with
valleys “is no more than may be said of most of the longi
tudinal and transverse valleys in every mountain-chain;”       but

the principle I endeavoured to establish, that mountain-lakes

very few words.      Every physicist knows that when such a body

that  “everywhere    we behold proofs that the glacier,       the aid                              by
of  sand and pebbles, can grind down, polish, and plane the
bottom.”     Neither the mountains that bound nor the valleys
under the   glaciers  can possibly preserve the same relative de

Sandstone, as distinct from Devonian rocks, is a lacustrine de

ence is made in the ‘Elements’ to their formation in deltas
or lagoons; but no mention is made of great deep inland lakes.
Indeed the word lake is only once used in the description of this
formation, and it is immediately qualified by the word lagoon.
Has any one yet described Permian lakes            though I believe
they will be found. And even in his account of rock-salt, Sir
Charles does not assert that the salt of the Trias was formed
in far inland continental lakes supersaturated with salt, though
he refers to those of Asia; and he again insists rather on la
goons, as in the Runn of Cutch or the Bahr Assal, near the
Abyssinian frontier, or the possibility of salt now forming in the
Red Sea. Are there any Liassic, Oolitic, or Cretaceous lakes de

converted in some parts      of their course into lakes of considerable
magnitude,” because otherwise we should have to assume “that
the greatest elevatory movement always conforms to the central
axis of every chain,” or to that “ of every watershed.”               “But
sometimes upheaval will be in excess in the lower part of the
valley, and at other times (which would equally produce lake
basins) there would be an excess of subsidence in the higher
regions, the alluvial plains below sinking at a less rapid rate, or
being, perhaps, stationary.”          And here I must be allowed to
remark that these considerations did not escape me when I
wrote my memoir “On the Glacial Origin of certain Lakes"; but
I  rejected them (I now see, unwisely) as random surmises, not
comparable in value to the various hypotheses                          I
                                                          discussed, and
as I believe disproved, viz., that the great Alpine lakes “lie in
simple synclinal troughs,” or in “areas of mere watery erosion,”
or in mere “lines of dislocation,” or “in areas of special sub
sidence.”       I
                shall now show why I rejected and still reject both
of the above    suppositions   proposed in the ‘Elements.’
    Referring to ‘The Antiquity of Man,” Sir Charles very pro
perly assumes that the large valleys of the Alps were of pre
glacial origin,_a good and a sound assumption, founded on de
finite proofs as old as the days of Charpentier, if not older, and
one   I  had occasion in this Magazine to show may have ori
ginated in subaérial actions that have been going on ever since
the close of Miocene times *. No one, therefore, ever dreamed
that “the rivers had been idle for a million of years or more,
leaving to glaciers the task of doing, in comparatively modern
times, the whole work of excavation.” But the question he
proposes to solve         is,
                        how, controverting my proposition           glacier      of
erosion, parts       of
                      these   valleys   may  have been converted into

    If   inthis case upheaval was “in excess           the lower part                      of
the  valley,”  what would the result be?

as to bring it at the least to a level a little lower than what is
now the deepest part of the lake.       Without this the onward
southern flow of the water could not have been established.
But in that case the plain of the Po outside the present efflux
of the lake must also have been at the least 2650 feet lower than
at present, that is to say, before the tilting began; in which
case the plain must have been about 2000 feet below the level of
the present sea, and liable to be covered with deposits of that
post-pliocene epoch.     But no trace of these deposits exists,
and they have never even been imagined; for the post-pliocene
deposits of the valley of the Po are older than the ancient
glaciers. The only escape from this is to suppose that when these
movements took place the whole region lay so high (from 2000
to 3000 feet higher than at present) that elevations and de
pressions had no immediate relation to existing sea-levels.
   But though Sir Charles alludes to upheaval “in excess in                                          .
the lower part of the valleys,” he rejects it in the case of the
Alpine valleys, and prefers another hypothesis to account for
the actual existence of the lakes as they now stand; and this                                   I
shall now examine.
     “The Alps,”          he observes, “are from 80 to 100 miles
across.    Let       us suppose a central depression in this chain at the
rate of 5 feet in a century, while the intensity of the move
ment gradually diminishes as it approaches the outskirts of the
chain, till at length it dies out in the surrounding lower region.”
Thus in time the valley-slopes that originally        declined out         is
wards and downwards from the central elevations         the moun                    all
tains, would        the lower regions,
                     in                                by
                                               depression                  to of
                                                                 the central
ridges,    by degrees acquire      reverse slope, that
                                             a                  say, towards     of
their ends they would slope inwards                the mountains, and
                                                            to                                  by
this process the drainage would become dammed                      rock, and   up     by
lake-basins would        formed. Now,
                              be              test this idea, we must take

 before depression began, must have been 28,000 or 30,000 feet
 high during the greatest extension of the glaciers. If we make
 an allowance for denudation, of course the Alps were still higher.
 Depress the central ridge h till it attains the height of a, the
 axis of movement or hinge being at d, and the triangle ged,
previously filled with ice, would assume the position of the triangle
 b c d, and when the glacier melted, the hollow became filled with
 water*. This is asking a good deal; and if it were necessary to ac
count for the greater snowfall of the old glacier-epoch in the Alps
by increased height of the mountains, which it is not, though we
 might be inclined to grant Charpentier his 3000 feet, the diffi
culty increases when we are asked to grant an elevation five
times as much; nor indeed is the question likely to be raised
by any one who measures his angles and calculates his numbers.
 lf we remove the point where the angular movement ceased out
into the alluvial plain of the Po, the difficulty simply increases
for every yard we carry it in that direction; and a little reflec
tion will show that at no great distance the angular movement
necessary to drain the lake would raise the Central Alps to a
height of 60,000 instead of 30,000 feetit.
    Neither have we any special reason to suppose that any of those
oscillatory movements have frequently taken place in the Alps,
such as are common accompaniments of earthquakes in volcanic
areas; and the trifling instances Sir Charles gives of these in
Cook’s Strait, and of another gradual movement in Finmark of
135 feet, though they have some relation to the subject, yet
cease to have any probable significance when we consider the
magnitude of the movement needed in our case, and also that
it is not only necessary to apply it for the formation of the rock
bound lake-basins of the Alps, but also to numerous other cases
on the flanks of many mountain-chains, and not there alone,
but to the widely glaciated undulations of North America. Has
Dr. Julius Haast also been mistaken when, adopting generally
my views, he accounts for the excavation of the rock-bound lake
basins of New Zealand by glaciers ? or was there a central depres

 would approach the lowest of these numbers; while if we
 shorten the line still more, and place it at the Borromean Islands,
 we then get merely a special sinking of the bottom of the lake,
 —that for Maggiore, making no allowance for sediment, being
 2625 feet. Considering, however, that the depression of the
 chain, according to Sir Charles Lyell’s hypothesis, ought to have
 been the means of forming the rock-basins on both sides of the
 Alps, it is difficult to get rid of the idea that a great central
 depression was the cause, if there be any ground for the idea
 at all.   In that case Charpentier's 3000 feet come very far
 below the mark. Indeed, if we must allow 14,000 feet of depres
 sion to form the lake-basins (still full of ice), one cannot see
why there are not a great many more lakes than we find; for they
ought also to occur in other valleys that run north and south of
the central chain and open on the plains, but which are merely
river-courses.
    Again, how do the existing lakes conform to the regulation ?
Certainly those of Geneva and Neuchâtel do not in their trend
agree with a supposed depression of the Central Alps; for their
lengths and outflows are, roughly, at right angles to those of the
other great lakes of Como, Lugano, Maggiore, Orta, Warese,
Garda, Thun, Lucerne, Zug, Sempach, Zurich, and Constance;
and to dam up the lakes of Geneva and Neuchâtel, we should
require a central depression running north-west between them
at right angles to the chain of the Alps, and quite across the
Miocene rocks.        For this we need a special proof, which has
never even been    attempted;   and  I do not see but that to produce
the whole of the lakes by depression, the supposed great move
ment must merely resolve itself into a number of minor ones.
A better supposition than this seems to me to be a special dis
location, or a special depression for each lake, which I have
elsewhere attempted to disprove.
    And now, to sum up the matter, let us see what I am ex
pected to allow if    I am forced to accept as proved the adverse
points that have been raised against my theory. The Alps
“may have been at the time of intense cold 3000 feet higher
than they are now.        They may also have been lower again.”
“The repetition of such unequal movements may, in a time
geologically brief, turn parts of a valley into a lake.”          “If
there be no ice during the movement, &c.,” and “should the
movement be very slow,” “the river may afterwards fill up the
cavity,” and “it may afterwards cut through the new stony
barrier.”    “If   the change takes place in a glacial period, the
thickness of the ice will augment from century to century, not
in consequence of erosion, but simply because the contour of
the valley is becoming gradually more basin-shaped. The mere

occupancy, therefore, of cavities by ice, by preventing fluviatile
and lacustrine deposition, is one cause of the abundance of lakes
which will come into existence whenever the climate changes
and the ice melts.”     After so many ifs, and shoulds, and may
be's,     I
        submit that may be one cause, instead of is one cause,
would have been a more appropriate mode of expression. These
suppositions are backed by the additional statement, that if
“we observe a capricious distribution of lake-basins, we have no
reason to feel surprise, so long as we conceive the origin of such
basins to be due to subterranean movements in the earth’s
crust; for these may be partial in their extent, or may vary in
their direction in a manner which has no relation to the course
of the valleys.”                   I
                     prefer to so many surmises the simplicity of
my hypothesis, that as glacier-ice does erode the rocky floor over
which it passes, and as it can, under certain circumstances, move
up slopes, the nature of that erosion will be, and was dependent,
   1. On the angles of the slopes over which it passed, when
these slopes were seriously appreciable.
   2. On the fact that the glaciers sometimes passed from these
slopes into low grounds, into which the great old glacier-valleys
opened.
     3.       That at the mouths of these great old valleys, and some
 times near their mouths, where two or more great glaciers met,
the downward pressure of           the accumulated ice      allthe                                     of   all

XLI.  On an Eatension of the Dynamical Principle of Least
  Action. By JAMEs H. CoTTERILL, St. John's College, Cam
  bridge +.
W HEN   material body, or
   the action of
                  a                system of bodies, is exposed to
                         force, the points of application of that
force move to a greater or less degree, and the motion of these
points of application, by reason of the physical connexion of the
points of the system, causes a general relative displacement of
every one      of them, thereby calling into play forces which in
crease     with the extent of that displacement, and at length be
come  sufficiently great to balance the applied forces; the dis
placement then ceases, and a state of equilibrium is attained.
   Thus in every case of the balance of forces by the resistance
of matter, a certain amount of energy is expended by the ap
plied forces, and a certain amount of work done in partially
overcoming the resisting forces; and it is a well-known case of
the general law of the conservation of energy, that the energy so
expended is equal to the work so done.
   But further, if any portion of the system be considered apart
from the rest, the forces generated at the points of junction
must form a system of forces in equilibrium, and the energy
expended by them considered as applied to the detached portion
must be equal to the work done in that detached portion; and
these are general conditions to which the forces generated at
every point of the system are subject.  Now Mr. Moseley has
shown that if any number of pressures are in equilibrium, some
of which are resistances, then each of these resistances is a
minimum, subject to the conditions imposed by the equilibrium
of the whole—a principle which he has called the principle of
                           let
                                                                              as let

             of                                    above described;as
then each      those resisting forces
                of                          minimum, subject
                                                     is   a         the                        to
general conditions stated above: and further, the relative dis
placements which are the cause                   of
                                          those forces must also                                    be
the least possible, and the work done the least possible.        Thus
in  the  assumption    mentioned,      which    to
                                                 shall return I     the                        in

300                  Mr. J. H. Cotterill              on an Eatension                   of the
conservation of energy being implicitly satisfied, we have simply
to make the work done a minimum, subject to the statical con
ditions of equilibrium.
    The principle in question is (theoretically) sufficient to deter
mine the law of distribution of the stress within an elastic body
exposed to given forces; but if we attempt to apply it by ex
pressing the work done in an element of the body in terms of
the elastic forces by the known formula given by Clapeyron,
and then make the integral of the result a minimum by La
grange's method, subject to the well-known differential equations
expressing the equilibrium of that element, we shall simply fall
upon the general equations given by Lamé; the method, there
fore, being of no practical value, I shall not dwell upon                                              it.
    There are, however,        number       questions        practical im

 Since, then, the change in U, consequent on any possible
 change in the resisting forces, is zero, U must be a minimum
  (the other two possible hypotheses being easily seen to be        in
 admissible), and the principle is proved for a perfectly elastic
 body    or system of bodies.
     In   default of a more general demonstration, it may perhaps,
 by many persons, be considered self-evident that, cateris pa
 ribus, energy must be expended in that way in which there is
 least opposition to such expenditure, and that, on the other
 hand, work will be done, cateris paribus, in that way in which
 most energy can be expended.            And is it not a general law of
 energy, that the energy expended is a maximum, and the work
 done a minimum, subject to the laws of transformation of energy,
whether general or peculiar to the particular case under con
sideration ?

                         has found that when acetylene and iodine are
                  together   at 100° for fifteen to twenty hours, they
combine and form a crystallized iodide which has the formula
C2H2 I?.
     A  saturated solution of hydriodic acid absorbs acetylene slowly,
and forms a liquid dihydriodate which is about twice as heavy as
water, and is volatile at 182° without special decomposition.       Its
formation is thus expressed:—
                          C2 H2 + 2 HI-C2H4 I?.
     It is thus isomeric with iodide of ethylene, than which it is
much more stable.
     Both the iodide and the dihydriodate of ethylene yield acety
lene when treated with alcoholic potash.
     Berardt has found that acetylene, when allowed to bubble
through an ethereal solution of iodine, is slowly absorbed, and a
combination of iodine and acetylene is formed. This compound,
however, is more easily obtained when silver-acetylene             sus
pended in water is shaken with ethereal solution of iodine until
the iodine is no longer decolorized. After distilling off the ether,
the residue solidifies, forming a mass of yellowish crystals which

lene. Treated with reducing agents it furnishes a very volatile
oil, which is probably iodated acetylene, C*H*I, corresponding
to the brominated acetylene of Sawitzsch and of Reboul.

and of other substances.
   Semenoff” recommends for the preparation of ethylene gas a
mixture of 1 part by weight of absolute alcohol and 5 parts by
weight of sulphuric acid. With such proportions the addition
of sand is unnecessary; for with careful heating in the sand
bath there is no
                  fºothing up, and the disengagement of gas,
which commences at 100°, is quite regular.
   For the preparation of monobrominated ethylene, Gº Hº Br,
the same author recommends the following method. In a retort
connected with a Liebig’s condenser is placed a mixture of bro
mide of ethylene, C*H*Br”, with an equivalent quantity of
aqueous potash; alcohol is then dropped in from a burette until
two layers are no longer perceptible. At the temperature of
40° to 50°, the monobrominated ethylene is then distilled                                                          off
mixed with alcohol.         obtained     almost the theoretical

          M. Claus        on the Synthesis     of Crotonic Acid,        309
  By treating cyanide of ethyle with potash, Frankland and
Kolbe obtained propionic acid; and this reaction has been since
then very frequently used for passing from one alcohol to the acid
corresponding to the next higher homologous alcohol. Clausk
has succeeded in applying this reaction to the preparation of
crotonic acid, G*H* 9°, starting from cyanide of allyle, C*H* GN.
The preparation of this latter substance was readily effected by
the action of cyanide of potassium on iodide of allyle.        The
cyanide of allyle was then boiled in a retort connected with an
inverted condenser, until no more ammonia was disengaged, and
the odour of cyanide of allyle was no longer perceptible. The
contents of the retort were then neutralized with carbonic acid,
boiled, and filtered to remove carbonate of potash. The filtrate
was evaporated to dryness, and repeatedly crystallized to get rid
of the last portions of carbonate.   The potash-salt thus purified
was decon  posed  by  means of dilute sulphuric acid and distilled,
by which means an aqueous acid distillate was obtained that
was used for the preparation of the other salts.    The decompo
sition of cyanide of allyle by potash is as follows:—
        C3H6 CN +        KHO + H2O=G4            H5 KO2 + NH3.

          allyle.                               potash.
The aqueous distillate thus obtained is a colourless pungent acid
liquid, with an odour resembling that of butyric acid, from which
the acid separates at 0° in small white crystals.
   The salts show in general great resemblance to the corre
sponding compounds of acrylic acid.
   Michaelson has investigated propylic and butylic aldehydest.
He heated a mixture of butyrate and formiate of calcium in the
expectation of forming butylic aldehyde, in accordance with the

   About 80 grammes of the mixed salts were used in one ope
ration.    The product of the reaction was treated with oxide of
lead, and then rectified over chloride of calcium.     It began to
boil at 62°, and at 90° two-thirds remained in the retort. The
distillate, on rectification, gave a product which boiled between
54° and 63°. The results of the analysis and vapour-density
determination of this substance agreed with those required for

that it reduced silver with formation of propionic acid. The

312                     M. Wurtz         on Diallyle.
formula should be doubled, (C8H8)*= Gº H”; and he accord
ingly names it diallyle. It is best prepared by treating iodide
of allyle with an alloy of 1 part of sodium and 2 of tin.
   When diallyle is treated with strong hydriodic acid in closed
vessels at a high temperature,     combination ensues, but the
body formed, dihydriodate of diallyle, Gº H!", 2 HI, cannot be
distilled without decomposition. It is a transparent heavy liquid,
usually coloured by the presence of a little free iodine.
   When this substance is treated with potash, an immediate
reaction takes place with deposition of iodide of potassium.   The
liquid products of the action are monohydrate of diallyle, the for
mation of which takes place thus—
          C6H10, 2 HI+ KHO= H20+ KI+C6H10, HI,
and diallyle.
   Sodium decomposes the dihydriodate with the formation of
hydrocarbons, of which hexylene is the principal.    Dihydrochlo
rate of diallyle, C*H", 2 HCl, is prepared by heating diallyle
with concentrated hydrochloric acid.
   When the dihydriodate is treated with acetate of silver mixed
with ether, a reaction sets in accompanied by the formation of
iodide of silver, which is complete at the expiration of twenty
four hours. The ethereal solution filtered from the iodide of
silver was distilled; after the ether had passed over mixed with
a little diallyle, the residue was found to consist of free acetic
acid and of two acetates of diallyle, one of which boils at 154°,
and the other at over 200°. The latter is a diacetate,

   Besides these biatomic compounds of diallyle, there is a mono
atomic series, the starting-point of which is the monohydriodate
of diallyle, Gº Hº HI, obtained from the dihydriodate by the loss
of one molecule of HI.
   For the reduction of nitro-compounds, Zinin first introduced
the use of sulphuretted hydrogen; and Béchamp subsequently
showed that a mixture of iron filings and acetic acid is an ex
tremely energetic reducing agent.     Sulphuretted hydrogen acts
in such a manner that a single atom of hyponitric acid, NO”, is
replaced by NH*; while acetic acid and iron filings act so that
all the Ne” present    replaced                     by
                                    NH*. Beilstein's has recently

314             Mr.   J. A. Wanklyn on the Constitution
proposed to look upon ferric chloride as a compound of the
second order of complexity, and showed that on this supposi
tion the atomic weight of iron might be 28 or 56.
   Among other possible views of the constitution of iron-com
pounds (and he extended them to the other metals
                                             -   - of the iron
                                                            -
family), Erlenmeyer proposed this:
                               Feiv-56.
                 1     .   .   Fe Cl* Hypothetical.

                 3     .   .   Fe?   C16   Ferric chloride.
      course, on the same principle, chromium-compounds would
     Of
be represented thus:—
                               Criv-52'5.
                 1    .    .   Gr. Cl* Hypothetical.

                 3     .   .   Crº Clº Chromic chloride.
   In atomicity these metals would be like carbon, compounds
2 and 3 being chlorine representatives of the iron and chromium
ethylene, Fe? Hº, and ethyl-hydride, Crº H%.
   When either these hypothetical chlorides shall have been
discovered, or representatives of them shall have been found,
this theory will have acquired claims on the attention of chemists.
   There is a chromium representative of the hypothetical chlo
ride. It is chlorochromic acid.
   The analysis and vapour-density of chlorochromic acid agree
with the formula Cr 0° Cl*. That chlorochromic acid and the
proto- and sesqui-chlorides of chromium are of different orders
of complexity is proved by the difference in their boiling-points.
If anyone maintains the formula of sesquichloride of chromium
to be Cr Cl*, he is at once involved in this absurdity, that there
are two chromium-compounds differing only in this, that in the
one there is a certain atom of chlorine, and in the other this
certain atom of chlorine is replaced by 0°, but that whilst the
former boils at a red heat, the latter (with the oxygen in          it)
                                                                boils
a little above the boiling-point       of
                                      water.
 It   istherefore quite certain that, whilst chlorochromic acid con
tains  only€r in  the standard volume, sesquichloride         of
                                                           chromium
must contain at least Crº.
   From the close analogy subsisting between sesquichloride
                                                                          of of of
chromium and sesquichloride            iron (the vapour-density
                                       of
which    requires  Fe"  Cl");   also follows that the molecule

chromic chloride (sesquichloride           of

extremely well-defined artificial compounds, possessing a high degree

    To   evade this difficulty,     chemists have proposed to accord
                                             some
to the molecule of aluminic chloride the formula Al" Cl", whereby an
indivisible proportion of metal would be habitually represented by a
divisible symbol; for it is agreed on all hands that the proportion of
aluminium contained in the molecule of aluminic chloride is the
smallest proportion of aluminium found in any aluminic compound
whatsoever; that it is incapable of experimental division by any pro
cess whatsoever; and consequently that, so far as our present know
ledge goes, it is an indivisible or atomic proportion.
   Now there are undoubtedly certain bodies, elementary and com
pound, of which the ascertained vapour-densities, and consequent
volumes, no matter how accounted for, are, as a mere matter of ex
periment, discordant with the chemical analogies of the respective
bodies; but in most instances these anomalous results are rendered
unimportant by other determinations of vapour-density, either of the
same bodies raised to higher temperatures, or of associated bodies
having a more decided volatility.    Hence arises the question whether
the ascertained volume of aluminic chloride, which is discordant with
the specific heat of aluminium, may not be anomalous in a similar
manner, and whether the anomaly may not be corrected by an ex
amination of other more volatile aluminic compounds.
   The methide and ethide of aluminium recently obtained by Mr.
Buckton and the speaker are, so to speak, varieties of aluminic
chloride in which the chlorine has been replaced by methyle and
ethyle, and are at the same time far more volatile and manageable
than the typical chloride.     Now it has been found that two gaseous
volumes of the methide and ethide of aluminium contain only 27.5
parts of aluminium, united with three atomic proportions of methyle
and ethyle; and accordingly their molecules have to be expressed
by the formulae AlMe” and AlFt” respectively.         In other words, the
normal results obtained with the methide and ethide correct the
anomalous result obtained with the chloride, and confirm the atomic
weight and molecular formulae deducible from the specific heat of
                                                 -
aluminium.
    That the ascertained vapour-density of aluminic chloride is really
anomalous receives a further corroboration from the behaviour of
aluminic methide itself. At 220° and                       all

     Aluminium-ethide and methide occur as colourless liquids. The
  ethide boils at 194°, and does not freeze at –18°. The methide boils
  at 130°, and solidifies at a little above 0° into a beautiful crystalline
  mass.      Both liquids take fire on exposure to the air, and explode
  violently by contact with water. They are produced from mercuric
  ethide and methide respectively by heating these compounds for some
 hours in a water-bath, with excess of aluminium clippings. This
 process was obviously suggested by Frankland and Duppa's new
 reaction for making zinc-ethide, methide, amylide, &c.

    In a paper recently presented to the Royal Society”, gave the     I
 results of the application of prismatic analysis to some of the objects
 in the heavens known as nebulae.             Eight of the nebulae examined
gave a spectrum indicating gaseity, and, of these, six belong to the
class of small and comparatively bright objects which it is convenient
to distinguish still by the name of planetary. These nebulae pre
sent little indication of probable resolvability into discrete points,
even with the greatest optical power which has yet been brought
to bear upon them.
     The other two      nebulae which gave a spectrum indicative of matter
in the    gaseous  form,   are 57 M, the annular nebulain Lyra, and 27 M,
the Dumbbell nebula. The results of the examination of these nebulae
with telescopes of great power must probably be regarded as in favour
of their consisting of clustering stars. It was therefore of import
ance to determine, by the observation of other objects, whether any
nebulae which have been certainly resolved into stars give a spec
trum which shows the source of light to be glowing gas. With this
                      I
purpose in view submitted the light of the following easily resolved
clusters to spectrum analysis.
     “4670. 2120 h.        15 M. Very bright cluster; well resolved ”t.
     “4678, 2125 h. 2 M. Bright cluster, well resolved.”
     Both these clusters gave a continuous spectrum.
     I  then examined the Great Nebula in the Sword-handle of Orion.

November and 13th December (both inclusive), the dates being
marked on each, for comparison with others made in 1862, partly
by Mr. Lockyer, partly by myself; from which it will immediately
appear that no appreciable change has occurred in the main outlines
of land and sea, in the longitudes observed. A certain fogginess has
been noticed, especially on the 18th and 20th November, such
as does not commonly occur with Jupiter or Saturn ; but it seemed
to be due to no essential circumstance of the planet, for it grew less
and less as the observation approached the meridian.
   The colour of the larger masses of land is the same as formerly ob
served, but fainter from distance; and the sea is grey and shadowy,
but without the very distinct greenish hue which was noticed in
1862.     Finally, the snows round the south pole appeared much
less extensive than in 1862, and were not really observable with
distinctness except on a few evenings.       Snowy surfaces, scarcely
more defined, but much more extensive, were observed in parts
of the northern regions, not immediately encircling the pole (which
was invisible), but in two principal and separate tracts estimated
to reach 40° or 45° from the pole. On one occasion (30th November)
two practised observers (Mr. Luff and Mr. Bloxidge) noticed with
me one of these gleaming masses of snow, very distinct—so much                                               so,
that,    ashappened with the south polar snow        1862,   seemed          in          it                  to
project beyond the circular outline—an optical effect,          doubt,                        no
              the bright irradiation.       This white mass reached
                  or to                                                                                      of to

in long. 225°, and extending          lat. 50°.      to                In

   2. “On   the History of the last Geological Changes    in Scotland.”
By T. F. Jamieson, Esq., F.G.S.
   The history of the last geological changes in Scotland, as given
in this paper, was divided into three periods, namely, the Preglacial,
the Glacial, and the Postglacial.
   The absence of the later Tertiary strata from Scotland leaves the
history of the Preglacial period very obscure; but the author con
sidered it in some degree represented by some thick masses of sand
and gravel (apparently equivalent to the Red Crag of England) on
the coast of Aberdeenshire; and he stated that there were indica
tions of the Mammoth having inhabited Scotland during this
period.
   The Glacial period was divided into three successive portions,
namely, (1) the Period of Land-ice, during which the rocky surface
was worn, scratched, and striated, and the boulder-earth, or glacier
mud, was formed; (2) the Period of Depression, in which the
glacier-marine beds were formed; and (3) the Period of the Emer
gence of the land to which belong the valley-gravels and moraines,
and during which the final retreat of the glaciers took place.
    To the Postglacial period Mr. Jamieson referred that of the
formation of the submarine forest-beds, which he considered was
succeeded by a second period of depression, and this again by the
elevation of the land to its present position.        It is in the old
estuary beds and beaches formed during the Second Period of De
pression that the author finds the first traces of Man in Scotland,
while the Shell-mounds with chipped flints he referred to the same
epoch as the blown sand and beds of peat, namely to the most
recent period, during which the land was raised to its present level.
   Mr. Jamieson described in great detail the deposits representing
each of these periods, and concluded his paper with lists of shells
from the different beds, showing the percentage of the species that
 are now found in the British, Southern, Arctic, N.E. American, and
North Pacific regions.

assumed.     For this purpose two equal threads stretched vertically
by weights might be used, and a plane mirror without edge be so
adjusted that the reflected piece of the one thread falls in a straight
line with the directly seen parts of the other in each position of
the eye.
   After the position of the image produced by a plane mirror has
thus been fixed, the discovery of the position of other subjective
pictures will be possible by means of a transparent and at the same
time reflecting plane-parallel plate on which a luminous point is
reflected.  The plate is to be so arranged that the reflected picture
of the luminous point covers a point of the image in question. An
 assistant must move the luminous point until the reflected and re
fracted image no longer move towards each other in any motion of
the eye. The directly measured distance of the reflected point from
 the plane-parallel plate is equal to the required distance of the sub
jective image produced by the optical apparatus from the same plate.

ON A SIMPLIFIED        METHOD OF EXTRACTING INDIUM FROM THE
                FREIBERG ZINCBLENDES.  BY M. WESELSKY.
    The roasted and levigated blendes are treated with a mixture of ten
 parts of hydrochloric and one of nitric acids; the solution, separated
 from silica and the liberated sulphur, is greatly diluted with water,
 and carbonate of soda added until a precipitate first begins to form.
The solution is boiled, hyposulphite, of soda being added until no
more sulphurous acid escapes, and the precipitate, which at first is
yellowish and flocculent, has become black, when it readily settles
down.      The solution contains, besides all the iron and zinc, small
quantities of arsenic and copper, and also part of the indium. The
black precipitate consists of the sulphur-compounds of arsenic, lead,
copper, &c., and contains the rest of the indium. Without removing
it,  freshly-precipitated carbonate        barytaof    excess   in
                                                                 added     the  is         to

hours.      The precipitate, which, besides the above sulphides, contains
all the indium and the excess               of

XLVI.       Supplementary             Considerations         relating to   the   Undulatory
 Theory     of Light.            By Professor CHALLIs, F.R.S., F.R.A.S.*
    a review of the arguments by which I have now for a
ON long  time maintained that the phenomena of light are
 referable to the vibrations and pressures, as mathematically de
termined, of a continuous elastic fluid the pressure of which
varies proportionally to               its
                                 density,   have found that there are

certain  points      ofthe   reasoning  which require rectification                           or

          Prof. Challis on the Undulatory Theory of Light.           337
of yellow and blue colours made by chalk pencils,            I constantly
found that even when the eye was near enough to distinguish
the spaces easily, the whole appeared to be suffused by a tinge
of green. Now, although this diffusion in            both kinds of ex
periment may be referable to the manner in          which the organ of
sight is acted upon by the rays, it proves          not the less that a
combination of yellow and blue has the same          effect in producing
green, whether the light come directly from         the sun, or is what
I   called terrestrial light. For this reason      I  withdraw the dis
tinction   I  endeavoured to establish between      solar light and ter
restrial light.
    With    reference to the same subject,    I  take this opportunity
                 I
to state that have made           experiments  for showing the effects
of combining colours by means of revolving disks, the disks
being divided into spaces covered alternately with the two
colours to be compounded.            The apparatus I used was pro
fessedly made according to directions contained in Professor
 Maxwell's paper on this subject, and among the different sets
 of colours was one which was intended to show that yellow and
 blue combined do not produce green.            The result in this    in
stance was      certainly  a dirty white;  but according to my sight
the blue and the       yellow   had scarcely any resemblance to pris
matic blue and yellow. On substituting for them the very same
                        I
 chalk colours that used in the above-mentioned experiment of
 parallel spaces,    I  found that the result was decidedly green.
                                     I
 It may be that the colours used were not pure colours;
but the fact that one appeared blue and the other yellow was
 owing to the predominance of blue or yellow solar rays, and
 the predominant tint of the compound was determined ac
 cordingly.
     For these reasons, drawn, it will be seen, in part from per
 sonal observations,     I  hold that sunlight and terrestrial light are
 not essentially different, and that, in accordance with the ma
 thematical theory of the composition of colours given in the
 above-cited article, combinations of yellow and blue, with either
 kind of light, have the effect of producing green.            .        -
     (4) It  having    been   suggested  to me to   employ    Angström’s
 values of A, given in Poggendorff’s Annalen for November
  1864, for testing my Theory of the Dispersion of Light con
  tained in the Supplementary Number of the Philosophical
  Magazine for December 1864, I have calculated as follows for
  this purpose. It was considered sufficiently accurate to obtain
  the values of A for the rays C, D, F, and G from those for the
  rays B, E, and H, and the given values of a by mere interpola
  tion, and to regard the differences of the results deduced from
  the old and the new values of X as the same that would have

to apply these differences to the values of A previously calcu

be given by Ångström's data.   These calculations having been
gone through, the comparison, to the third place of decimals,

      consists simply in directing the spectroscope upon a frag
      It
ment of sodium burning in oxygen gas. The incandescent metal
gives, of course, a continuous spectrum; but the rays, in passing
through the cooler atmosphere of sodium-vapour which surrounds
the metallic nucleus, are selectively absorbed, and the dark
double line D, or Naz, appears with great distinctness on the
bright spectrum.     As, however, the fragment of sodium is soon
consumed,            I
               have used an apparatus resembling that employed
for  making   phosphoric  anhydride, by which pellets of sodium
may be added as often as required.
   A moderate-sized deflagrating-jar is placed in a dish of sand.
In it is suspended a shallow iron cup, and through the same cap
which carries the latter is passed a short wide glass tube, so as to
be directly over the centre of the cup. Through the sand and
under the lower edge of the jar passes a bent glass tube, con
nected with a caoutchouc bag of oxygen, and serving to intro
duce a continuous slow stream of the gas to replace that con
sumed by the sodium. The spectroscope should first be adjusted
as to position and focus by bringing it to bear on a candle placed
on the opposite side of the jar, so that    flame may just     seen its                               be
over the edge                 of
                    the iron cup.      Then, while the jar       filling                         is
with gas, the cup may         withdrawn,      pellet
                                             be         sodium placed

                                                                    Spain
Thisthemineral         was some time back forwarded from
               purpose of being submitted to chemical examination;
                                                                            for
it   was stated to occur     in the district of Estramadura in South
ern    Spain  in large  quantity.
     The specimens received, though in large blocks, consisted of
the pure phosphorite, apparently uncontaminated and unaccom
panied by any other minerals; the mineral itself was massive,
and, on breaking, the fracture was uneven and earthy, disclosing
at the same time a slightly radiating dendritic structure, but no
trace whatever of crystallization.           The colour of fresh fracture
was chalk-white, but weathered surfaces frequently showed a
dirty or rusty white colour externally.              Lustre earthy; opake;
streak and     powder    dead white.
     Hardness about 4.5 on the scale, or immediately below apa
tite, by which it was scratched. The specific gravity was taken
on two distinct specimens,         and found to be 3:00 and 2.92             re
spectively    at 60°F.
     When the powdered         mineral was heated over a lamp in the
 dark or thrown on to a nearly red-hot plate of iron, it quickly
glowed, emitting an extremely beautiful and slightly greenish
 yellow light, which passed off before the mineral attained a
 visibly red heat.      As Mr. Phipson, in his treatise on Phospho
 rescence, states that minerals which, after having been heated, no
 longer emit the characteristic phosphorescent light upon reheat
 ing, again recover their fluorescent property upon being exposed
 to the sunlight, the experiment was tried several times and with
 various modifications, but failed even after many days’ exposure
 to the sun’s rays: this was also the case when the mineral, after
 heating once, was cooled in the dark and again reheated. In order
 also to see if the loss of moisture in the first heating had any
 relation to the phosphorescent property, another portion, after
 heating, was thrown into water and kept in the sun under water
  for many days; on being air-dried and reheated no signs of phos
 phorescence      could be detectedt.
      In  order to examine whether, as is the case with the mineral
  Gadolinitef, the phenomenon of fluorescence, on heating, might

     t  Mr. Phipson states that the fluor-apatites only    are phosphorescent,
  and that this is not the case with the chlor-apatites.       On examination,
  however, the fine crystallized true chlor-apatites from Krageroe in Norway
 emitted, on heating in the dark, a most distinct slightly greenish-yellow
  light, though not quite so bright as the above phosphorite,
     f  Gadolinite, when heated, glows suddenly and increases in density,
 being, after ignition, about 5 per cent. specifically heavier than before.

somewhat higher result was obtained after ignition than before,
the exact numbers being        follows:—before ignition the specific

    colourless glass, which, however, if supersaturated, becomes a
    white enamel.
        A portion of the mineral in the state of powder was placed in
     a small leaden capsule and drenched with strong sulphuric acid.
     Hydrofluoric acid was evolved upon gently heating the capsule,
     and etched deeply letters written through a film of wax varnish
    coating a glass plate with which the leaden capsule was covered.
        The analysis of the mineral was conducted as follows:—
     31:05 grains in powder were heated for some time to redness in
     a platinum crucible; upon cooling, the diminution in weight
     amounted to 0.45 gr., equivalent to 1:44 per cent., which
    loss was considered as water; the powdered mineral had become
                                                º
    much darker in colour during ignition, and on cooling had as
     sumed a reddish-brown tint.
        In order to determine the amount of carbonic acid present,
    this gas was displaced by the action of hydrochloric acid upon
     100 grs. of the powdered mineral                 in a previously tared
     thin  glass  apparatus,     from which the   gases   were evolved after
    passing through a tube containing chloride of calcium.                The
    loss of carbonic acid was found to be 0.45 gr., or equivalent to
    0.98 per cent. carbonate of lime in the mineral.
        Sulphuric acid was also distinctly observed, but in quantity
    too small for estimation unless an unusually large amount of
    the mineral had been operated upon.
        For determining the fluorine a thin glass bulb was employed,
    closed by a cork through which two tubes passed, the one for
    evolving the gaseous products, and the other, reaching to the
    bottom of the bulb, for passing a stream of             airthrough  it
                                                                        in

    remained behind          inthe apparatus     atthe termination    of   the

                     a          quantity    pure

                       in                        10grains pure silicic acid
     (precipitated from hydrofluosilicic acid), and the whole boiled       to
    expel any moisture present, and weighed.           50:00 grs. phospho
    rite  in powder were then introduced, and the whole heated and
    weighed several times during two days; the ultimate loss was
                                                                           to as,

pure sulphur was removed from this solution, and then ammonia
added to precipitate the alumina and sesquioxide of iron.   These
were not  separated, but after washing were ignited, and afforded
a weight of 0.42 gr., equivalent to 2-94 per cent.; and sub
tracting from this the 175 per cent. alumina previously deter
mined, we have 1.19 per cent. as the amount of sesquioxide of
iron present in the mineral.

3.2, -6, to 3 being caused by the existence of an inflexion.
Comparing with the former case, we see that the effect of the
contact of the conic with the absolute is to give rise to an                                                  in

     return now to the general case of a curve
                             U=(*}[x, y, z)"=0.
Using, for greater simplicity, the equation a "+y^+ 2*=0 for
the absolute, the equation of the normal is
                        Q=   |    X , Y                , Z          |   =0;

we may at once find the class of the evolute; in fact, treating
(X, Y, Z) as the coordinates of a given point, the two equations
U=0, Q=0 determine the values (w, y, z) of the coordinates of
a point such that the normal thereof passes through the point
(X, Y, Z); the number of       such points is the number of normals
which can be drawn      through    a given point (X, Y, Z), viz. it is
equal to the class of the evolute.       The points in question are
given as the intersections of the two curves U–0, Q=0, which
are respectively curves of the order m, hence the number of                                                   in
tersections is -mº. It is to be observed, however, that if the
curve U =0 has nodes or cusps, then the curve Q=0 passes
through each node of the curve U =0, and through each cusp,
the two curves having at the cusp a common tangent; that                                                       is,

                          m, the order,
                          n,    ,    class,
                          8,    , number of                  modes,

                          *,    *,            33             inflexions.
Then Plücker’s equations give
                    w–K =3(n—m),                    T-8–4(n-m)(n+m–9);
and we thence have
                    t—k+T-8=}(n-1)(n–2)—#(m—1)(m—2),
or, what is the same thing,
                    !(m-1)(m—2)–8–K = }(n-1)(n–2)—t—t.
   Now M. Clebsch in his recent paper “Ueber die Singulari
täten algebraischer Curven,” Crelle, vol. lxiv. (1864) pp.98–100,
has remarked (as a consequence of the investigations of Riemann
in the Integral Calculus) that whenever from a given curve
another curve is derived in such manner that to each point                                                (or
tangent)    the given curve there corresponds
                   of                                single tangent              a
(or point)          of
              the derived curve, then the expression
             {(m—1)(m—2)—8—k,                                =   }(n-1)(n–2)—t—t,
has the same value   the two curves respectively,
                                    in                                           or       that, writing

L.    On the Application of Screw-Blades as Floats for Paddle
     wheels.  By W. G. ADAMs, M.A., F.G.S., Fellow of St. John's
     College, Cambridge, Professor of Natural Philosophy in King's
     College,   London*.
                my former paper on this subject was communicated
SINº.
   to the        Philosophical Magazine, experiments (an account of
which appeared in the ‘Times’ of the 5th of April) have been
made at Portsmouth with Dr. Croft’s new wheel, on Her Ma
jesty’s private yacht ‘Elfin,’ with very satisfactory results, show
ing in the very first trial that the new wheel is superior to the
wheel with ordinary flat floats, and very nearly comes up to the
wheel with feathering floats, even with a much smaller surface
exposed to the pressure of the water.
   One of the points especially worthy of notice is the fact that
“no vibration whatever was experienced on board”; so that it is
no longer a mere matter of theory, but also true in practice, that
with the new wheel the sudden jerking and quivering motion
have no existence.    In my former paper it is stated that if the
                                                                       then
number of revolutions be such that v is greater than              #,
the part of the float nearest to the axis will tend to stop rather
than to propel the boat. This must certainly be the case where
the radius of the paddle-wheel is small, as in the case of the
‘Elfin,” and may also be the case in a larger vessel. This diffi
culty may be obviated by cutting away the part of the float near
est to the axis; and       I
                         propose to consider the effect of such a
change on the resistance and moment about the axis, in order
to determine whether the float is rendered thereby more or less
efficient.  I also propose to investigate the expressions for the
resistance and moment on a screw-blade whose pitch is different
from 45°, and to determine the efficiency when the pitch is what
is practically considered most advantageous.        The equations
 giving the resistance and moment on one float are these           :-

Mr. Jenkin the specific resistances of the metals at 0° referred
to unit of mass and length.
   When carrying out the above determinations, we did not think
of taking the specific gravity of the wires employed, as our object
was only to see to what accuracy we could reproduce resistances
by using wires of the above metals, &c. We employed the length
weight in preference to the length section, knowing that the
weight of a wire may be much more accurately determined than
 itssection, whether deduced directly from the measurements                                          of

     The platinuin-silver alloy contains 66.6 per cent. silver, and is
that alloy which has been used for making the copies of the B. A.
 unitt.       On comparing these values with those deduced from the
 actual ones found, as given in the second Table, we find a difference
 with the silver of about 3 per cent. This is explained in our paper
 by the fact that the silver wire used was drawn in a peculiar
 manner; and on referring to another papert, like differences will
 be found in the conducting-power of silver. The differences in
 the other cases will be chiefly due to not using the correct spe
 cific gravities; thus, for instance, the specific gravity of copper
 used was 895.                 Siemens' found it to vary for wire between 8-89
 and 8.92; using the value 891, we find the conducting-power to
 be 47-64.

   Again, the specific gravity of gold used is 1927. The specific
gravity given in Gmelin’s ‘Chemistry’ for gold wire is 19:3 to
19:4. Using the value 19:4, we find the conducting-power to be
36.72. The differences between the values obtained for the
mercury (namely, about 3 per cent.) show how difficult it is to
obtain good results with this metal when only ordinary care is
taken in experimenting.     No doubt these differences are due to
the manner of calibrating and deducing the values for the diame
ters of the tubes employed in my first experiments, published in
1858*; and when determining at a later period+ the influence
of temperature on                   its
                        conducting-power (finding with the one
tube we used   nearly the same value), we did not think    neces                                      it

is based on the fact that for the calculations the wrong specific
gravity of mercury has been used, viz. 13:557 at 0° instead of
13:595 as found by Regnault, Kopp, Balfour Stewart, and

Weber) was found by him in 1861 equal to 4.025 Siemens
(London) units.
   That Thomson's coil had not altered during this time was
proved by comparing it again with a coil of wire of the gold
silver alloy which         I
                      made, and compared with the coils before
they were sent to Weber in 1860.   The new comparison agreed
identically with the first one.
Thomson's coil = 4.025 S. (London) units = 15.543 of an arbi
             trarily chosen unit, made for my own experiments,
Mile coil  .                               =53°780 ditto;
and therefore the mile coil = 13.93 Siemens (London) units,
proving that the mile coil has not altered, for Mr. Jenkin gives
the value equal 13.95%, showing a difference of rather more
than 0.15 per cent., a difference, considering the roundabout
way the value is arrived     which         at,
                                         very small;    fact  is                           in         it   is
much smaller than the differences     which    have now    speak.

agrees with the last value; and as the true value     for the resist
ance of the mercury   unit, as defined  by Messrs. Siemens,  we may
take 0.961 B.A. units, a value differing from their 1864 issue
by about 0.5 per cent, and when corrected for specific gravity, by
about 0.8 per cent.
    Now why do these differences exist? Are we not led to think
from the papers written by these gentlemen, and others working
in their laboratory, that the reproduction of the mercury unit is
the most simple thing possible? I will quote what one of them
says on the subject.     Mr. R. Sabine states”, “ Following this
method, every electrician may inexpensively and with little trouble
make himself a standard measure....The mercury unit has there
fore been reproduced in Dr. Siemens's laboratory twenty-one times,
six times in the first determination, five times in the second, and
ten times in the present.       And, allowing for the unfortunate
misrepresentation of the measure by individual errors of the
measuring-apparatus used in the comparison of the first tubes,

   In  the second   place, we are told that the unit has been re
produced twenty-one times, and that, allowing for the unfor
tunate misrepresentation       the measure of   individual errors        of by                           of
the apparatus used         the comparison

between any two single measurements with different measuring
apparatus.
  The first tubes show, Ihave elsewhere pointed out, maximum

between the other reproductions being more accurate than any
two measurements with different apparatus, the following facts
will constitute good answer.
                    a
   1.  The Messrs. Siemens's reproductions, they state, agree
within 0.05 per cent. Two coils             were compared with each
                                                           +
other some     years  ago (the one German silver, the other gold
silver), and now, with different apparatus and              different ob           by    a
server, they were again compared         the ratio    : their resistances        of
was found absolutely the same.
   2.  The Messrs. Siemens have issued             1864 mercury unit.    an
Now four different copies                  of
                                  this have been compared with four
different  copies     the B.A. unit with four different measuring
                      byof
apparatus, and       four different observerst, and the ratios         the                         of
resistances,    asdetermined                    by
                                     the four observers,        not vary                      do
between each other more than 0:02 per cent.
   In   the third place, we are told that,           direct production,    by
much greater accuracy has been attained than                  any other                  by
method    of determination       copying.  or

     Had the Messrs. Siemens followed this plan, then the use of
the wrong specific gravity would not so much influence the
value of their coils as means of comparison, as the differences
in the values of the coils themselves; for when we find a Siemens
unit used, we must first discover what value it has, because, as
already pointed out, the different issues have different values.

       GENTLEMEN,
    § 30 of the paper on Electric Experiments, I have in
INadvertently stated that the leaves of the electroscope diverged
with negative electricity, instead of positive. The experiment
was meant to direct attention to a simple mode of proving, by
means of a Leyden jar and electroscope, that the force of electric
induction is capable of acting in curved lines, a fact which appears
to deserve that distinct announcement due to a fundamental
characteristic of the electric force.
    Suppose we take a coated plate of glass properly insulated, and
charge it highly with positive electricity on the side A, and ne
gative on the opposite side B. After leaving it in this charged
state for a few seconds,                let    an
                                       electroscope       brought with      be                         its

must therefore be supplied from B, the free negative on the outer
side of which thus acts not only on the B side of the plate, but
on the A side also, to attain which it must pass round the edges
of the coating A.
   Faraday supposes this to take place by means of the action of
contiguous particles of air; and hence it is to be presumed that it
is his belief that a charged pane could not exist in an illimitable
vacuum, or at least that the electricity on B could not affect an
electroscope on the side of A, because there would be no conti
guous particles to transmit the force.
   This hypothesis has been supposed to be further supported by
the apparent augmentation in the force of induction that takes
place when a plate of lac or sulphur is interposed between the
charged body and a neighbouring conductor; and the term specific
inductive capacity, applied to denote the degree of the special fa
culty of transmitting the inductive power belonging to the parti
cles of a given non-conducting body, seems to be now established,
Harris having published experiments as supporting Faraday's
views, and teaching them in his elementary treatise.

if the B. D., when close to the top of the shade, is kept in posi
tion for a few seconds, the leaves sink a little (showing a decre
ment A of the inductive force acting on the electroscope, although
there is no decrement of the charge on B. D.); and on removing
it they shut and then open with the opposite electricity, and
the extent of the opening corresponds to the decrement A, thus
showing that the top of the glass shade has been inductively
excited by B. D. But this excitement is evanescent, the leaves
subside in a few seconds.         The explanation of such phenomena
that first presents itself                is,

 WITH  a view to finding an effectual method of separating
    from each other Mosander's three bases, yttria, erbia, and
terbia, Popp undertook an investigation of yttria.         He has pub
lished the results of his investigation separately, and has given
a summary of it in Liebig’s Annalen", from which the following
is taken.
    As distinct oxides he considers that erbia and terbia have no
separate existence, or rather they are not the oxides of hitherto
unknown metals, but are identical with the oxides of cerium and
didymium.      Mosander's oxide of yttria contains both alkali and
lime.   Hence erbium and terbium, which have heretofore been
regarded as elements, though not altogether without some doubt,
must now be struck from the list.
    Pure yttria is separated from                          its
                                             accompanying earths                            by

              of                              the cold, but not yttria.

relation  of the sulphuric acid to the yttria found, Popp deduces the
number    42 as the combining proportion of yttria, which, assum
ing that it has the composition YO, gives 34 for the combining
 proportion of yttrium.
   The metal yttrium was reduced from the chloride of ammo
nium and yttrium by means of sodium, in a manner analogous
to that by which magnesium is prepared.           While moist it is a
black glittering powder, which, while drying, becomes lighter,
owing to oxidation.      When quite dry it does not oxidize in the
air; at ordinary temperatures it only slowly oxidizes in water;
on   boiling,  the oxidation is more rapid, but even then is not
complete.     It is readily dissolved by dilute acids with disen
gagement     of hydrogen.
   Heated on platinum foil, yttrium burns with intense lustre;
in pure oxygen the combustion is most brilliant; the colour is
not of such a pure white as is that of magnesium and alumi
nium; it inclines towards reddish.

  By this deportment a way is opened for the separation and
preparation of these metals on a large scale.
   Schiel describes” the following as a lecture experiment. A
test-tube containing peroxide of silver, drawn out in the middle
and sealed, is introduced into a well-dried stoppered gas-bottle,
which is then filled with chlorine.    The flask being closed, the
tube is broken by shaking; the chlorine becomes paler, and
in a few minutes the flask is full of colourless oxygen gas. The
proportions of peroxide and chlorine must be those of their equi
valents.  The peroxide is readily prepared by passing ozonized-
oxygen over dry oxide of silver.
  Poppit designates the following as the best of two methods
which he gives for separating oxide of cerium from the oxides of
lanthanum and didymium, with which it is usually associated.
The three oxides, dissolved in acid, are approximately neutralized
without producing a permanent precipitate. An adequate quan
tity of acetate of soda is added and then an excess of hypo
chlorite of soda, and the whole boiled for some time.              The
cerium is  deposited  as a bright-yellow  precipitate, the other bodies
remain in solution.      The filtrate must not become turbid on
the addition of hypochlorite and boiling; by careful and suffi
cient addition of hypochlorite in the first case, one treatment is
sufficient, and every trace of cerium is precipitated free from lan
thanum and didymium.
   The yellow precipitate contains much water; it dries to a
brownish-yellow, transparent and easily pulverizable mass. It
has       all
          the characters         peroxide, and

chlorine, yielding a solution of a clear saffron-yellow colour, which
diminishes on dilution, and disappears completely on boiling.
Nitric and sulphuric acids dissolve the peroxide with a reddish
yellow colour, forming corresponding compounds of the oxide.
   Popp finds that the peroxides of nickel and cobalt are formed
in the same manner as that of cerium.
   Marignacº has found that when a solution of acid tungstate
of potash or soda is boiled with gelatinous silicic acid, the liquid
assumes an alkaline reaction, and is now found to contain a new
acid in which l equiv. of silica is united with 12 equivs. of tung
stic acid, SiO" 12WO°, which he calls silico-tungstic acid.                     It
is a powerful acid, which is easily separated from                 salts, forms     its
two splendidly crystallized hydrates, and salts which for the most
part are soluble and crystallize well.

                    hydrate does not crystallize; and from the very

378      M. Weltzien    on the Determination              of Nitric Acid.
   Silico-tungstic acid crystallizes at ordinary temperature in
thick quadratic pyramids, and which contain 29 equivs. water of
crystallization, according to the formula
                     SiO" 12WO34HO4·29Aq:
if itcrystallizes at somewhat higher temperature, or at ordinary
temperature in the presence of alcohol, hydrochloric acid, or sul
phuric acid, it forms a hydrate which only contains 18 equivs.
water of crystallization, and of a different crystalline form.   At
100° the acid retains, besides the basic water, 4 equivs. of water
of crystallization.   On heating at 220° it loses the latter, but
retains 2 equivs. of basic water: these appear necessary for the
constitution of the acid; they are only removed at the temperature
of red heat.
   Tungsto-silicic acid crystallizes with 20 equivs. of water of
crystallization, and has the formula
                     12W0°, SiO44HO-H20Aq.
It is acted upon by heat in the same way as silico-tungstic acid.
   Marignac has made a crystallographic investigation of the salts
of these acids; and although relations to other compounds have
not been found (since these acids appear to belong to a new type of
combination), they have furnished a number of interesting results.
These, as well as reasons against Persoz's proposal to change the
formula of tungstic acid, Marignac discusses at length.
   Weltzien” describes a method for the quantitative estimation
of nitric acid in waters.   It consists in determining it as ni
trogen gas. The water to be investigated is evaporated, and
by a careful addition of carbonate of soda, the lime and mag
nesia are precipitated as carbonates, and any nitrate of lime or
magnesia is converted into nitrate of soda.     The filtrate from
this precipitate is evaporated to dryness, and mixed with finely
divided copper reduced from the oxide by hydrogen. This mix
ture is heated in a somewhat long combustion-tube in the usual
mode of determining nitrogen,           all
                                       the atmospheric air having
been  previously   expelled   by carbonic acid. Weltzien gives              a

   According to Lamy”, phosphoric acid forms with thallium a
series of phosphates, for the most part very soluble, and varied
in their composition and properties like the corresponding com
pounds of the alkaline metals.   They are as follows:—

    All   these salts are white, and almost                             all   soluble    in   water and

hydrochloric acid, and also with nitric acid, provided their solu

pyrophosphates give       white precipitate

   In calculating these coefficients for a given form of beam, it is
convenient to observe that they consist of two parts—one due to
the arbitrary constants, and the same for every load, and the
other due to the mode of distribution of the load.       the beam                      If
be acted on by detached forces, then the portion due to the con
stants must be estimated afresh for every part of the rib lying
between those detached forces; but the portion of the coefficients
due to the distributed load may be taken throughout the rib,
without reference to any detached forces which may act upon it”.

                       on Solar Physics.—Second Series.     On the Beha
 viour of Sun-spots with regard to Increase and Diminution.”           By
 Warren De la   Rue,  Ph.D.,   F.R.S.,  Balfour  Stewart,  A.M.,  F.R.S.,
  and Benjamin Loewy, Esq.
    One of the authors of this paper having been led, from a preli
minary investigation, to suspect that the behaviour of sun-spots with
 respect to increase and diminution refers to some extraneous influ
 ence, they resolved to investigate the behaviour in this respect of the
 spots observed by Carrington, in addition to the Kew photograms up
 to the present date.
    The authors have thus examined materials embracing a period of
 ten years, and in this paper state the result.
    The nature of their examination is thus described:—
    If we imagine great circles of ecliptical longitude to be drawn from
the sun's centre, every point of the sun's surface as it moves round
 by rotation will of course pass successively through each of those
great circles, and every one of the planets will do- the same as they
move round by their own proper motions.
    And if we imagine the plane of the paper to denote the plane
of the ecliptic, and project upon this plane each body of our system,
we shall have a scheme similar to the above, in which ADB, the inner
circle, may represent the sun himself, the next circle, let us say the
orbit of Venus, the next that of our earth, while the outer may denote
the orbit of Jupiter.    To an observer looking down upon our system
from the north, all motions will be in the direction of the arrow-heads,
that is to say, in a direction contrary to that of the hands of a watch,
or left-handed, while ecliptical circles of longitude will be represented

  if one spot breaks out on the left or on the right, half the other
  spots about the same period have a tendency to break out on the

  same half.        Examples of these are referred to in the Tables,
     The authors suppose that this peculiarity of behaviour of spots
  can only be explained by reference to some influence from without,
               that such an influence, of a nature unfavourable to spot
  production, exists, then, as spots are brought round to it by rota
  tion, they will gradually wane; and, on the other hand, as the
  surface departs from                   it,
                                   spots will break out.           But while there                                            is

    It will   be seen from this Table that the behaviour of spots appears
to be connected with the position of Venus in such a manner that
spots dissolve when that part of the sun's surface in which they
exist approaches the neighbourhood of this planet; while, on the
other hand, as the sun's disk recedes from this planet, spots begin to
break out and reach their maximum on the opposite side.
    There are a few cases in which Venus and Jupiter are opposed
to one another; the authors do not, however, suppose that these
instances are sufficient to prove the fact of an action due to Jupiter,
but think it right, in alluding to them, to state at the same time the
opposed position of the two planets, since this may furnish a pos
sible explanation of the uncertain behaviour of spots by which these
series are characterized.
    The results of this paper may        be stated briefly as   follows:—

   Observed fact.—Spots appearing about the same time on the sun's
disk behave in the same manner as they pass from left to right.
   Legitimate deduction.—The behaviour of spots is influenced by
something from without, and from the nature of the spot-behaviour
the authors conclude that this influence travels faster than the earth;
and finally, they find that the behaviour of spots appears to be deter
mined by the position of Venus in such a manner that a spot wanes
as it approaches this planet by rotation, and, on the other hand,
breaks out and increases as it recedes from the neighbourhood of the

   In an older and larger pig, to which                                    the same quantity was
given, lithium after one hour was found in                                the hip and knee joints
very faintly; in the aqueous humour of the                                eye very distinctly; but
      was found in the lens, not even when                                half was taken for one
trial.

the methide and ethide might be expected to have vapour-volumes
corresponding to Alº Me" = 2 vols., Al” Et" = 2 vols. The authors
seem, however, more inclined to doubt the truth of the general prin
ciples which lead us to consider these hexatomic formulae the correct
ones, than to doubt their own interpretation of the observations
already made upon the new compounds.
    Even if the vapour-volume of aluminic chloride had been unknown
to us, there were ample grounds for assigning to aluminium methide
a molecular formula Alº Me", and a vapour-density corresponding to
Alº Me"=2 vols.; for the close analogy of aluminic and ferric salts is
  erfectly notorious, and the constitution Fe‘O’ for ferric oxide settles
Al” O’ as the formula for alumina. With regard, however, to the
chlorides of these metals, it might be supposed that the formula
Fe Cl” and Al Cl” would be the most probable molecular formulae;
and Dr. Odling, in his useful Tables of Formulae, published in 1864,
expressed an opinion in favour of these formulae by classing as ano
malous Deville's vapour-densities, which correspond to the higher
formulae Al” Cl", Fe" Cl". It is well known that Laurent and Ger
hardt, whose penetrating minds raised so many vital questions of
chemical philosophy, laid down a preliminary rule that every molecule
must contain an even sum of the atoms of chlorine, hydrogen, nitro
gen, and metals. According to this rule, the formulae Al” Cl” and
Fe Cl" would have no greater probability than the formulae Fe Cl*,
Al Cl*; and judging by that rule, Dr. Odling naturally preferred
the simpler formulae.
   ..Since Gerhardt’s time chemists have, however, extended to the
greater number of metals the arguments which proved oxygen to be
biatomic; and we now know that the alkali-metals, the nitrogen
series, silver, gold, and boron, may count with the atoms of chlorine,
hydrogen, &c. to make up an even number in each molecule, but
that the greater number of metals must not be so counted; for that
in each molecule in which they are contained the sum of the atoms
of chlorine, hydrogen, nitrogen, potassium, &c. must be even, just as
much as if the atom of the diatomic or tetratomic metal were not
in the compound. In a paper “On the Classification of the Elements
in relation to their Atomicities,” I had occasion to point out that
inasmuch as iron and aluminium belong, partly by their own pro
perties, partly by their analogies, to the class of metals which do
not join with chlorine, &c. in making up an even number of atoms,
the number of those other atoms in each molecule must be even in
itself, just as if iron or aluminium were not there; and that accord
ingly the formulae Feº Cl", Al Cl" are really quite normal.        In like
manner I showed that the      vapour-density  of calomel, HgCl  = 2 vols.,
is anomalous,     as containing  in a molecular volume a   single atom of
chlorine, although, in accordance with Gerhardt's rule, Dr. Odling
had classed it as normal.      I certainly understood that my able friend
accepted my suggestion in this case at least, for he speedily brought
forward theoretical and experimental facts in confirmation of     it.
   These examples serve    to   show thatit     to
                                              was    be expected that the
ethyle and methyle compounds      of aluminium would contain      an   even

number of atoms of ethyle and methyle in each molecule, and that
their formulae would accordingly be Alº Me", Al” Et".
   It remains for us to consider how the deviation from our theore
tical anticipations in the case of aluminium ethyle and the partial
deviation in the case of aluminium methyle ought to be treated.
   Fortunately we have the benefit of some experience to guide
us in this matter, for a considerable number of other compounds
have been found to occupy in the state of vapour nearly double
the volume which corresponds to one molecule; but, with very few
exceptions,            all   of
                    them have already been proved         have undergone                       to

    The decision of the atomic weight of aluminium has involved
greater difficulty than was encountered in the case of most other
metals, owing to the fact of our knowing only one oxide of the
metal, and salts corresponding to it; but the analogies which con
nect aluminium with other metals are so close and so numerous,
that there are probably few metals of which the position in our clas
sification is more satisfactorily settled.   We may safely trust that .
the able investigators who are examining these interesting com
pounds will bring them more fully than now within the laws which
regulate the combining proportions of their constituent elements;
for, as it now stands, the anomaly is far less than many others
which have been satisfactorily explained by further investigations.
    Meanwhile aluminium is a metal singular for only appearing in
that pseudo-triatomic character in which iron and chromium appear
in their sesquisalts.

   1. “Notes on the Climate of the Pleistocene epoch of New Zea
land.” By Julius Haast, Ph.D., F.G.S.
   The main feature in this communication was a notice of the oc
currence of bones of the Dinornis in the moraines of the extinct
glaciers of New Zealand.     In support of the author's opinion that
the extinction of that bird was due to the agency of man at a some
what recent date, it was observed that the present Alpine flora
furnished a large quantity of nutritious food quite capable of
sustaining the life even of so large a creature; and as the fruits of
these plants were at present applied to no apparent purpose in the
economy of nature, the author argued the former existence of an
adequate amount of animal life to prevent an excessive development of
vegetation.   This part, he considered, was played by the Dinornis.

    The following communications were read:—
    1. “On the Sources of the Mammalian fossils of the Red Crag,
 and on the Discovery of a new Mammal in that Deposit allied to the
 Walrus.”      By E. Ray Lankester, Esq.
    The Mammalian fossils of the Red Crag were stated to belong to
 three groups:—(1) the teeth of Coryphodon, &c., derived from
 Lower Eocene strata; (2) the other terrestrial Mammalia; and
 (3) the Cetaceans.       The Molluscan fauna of the Red Crag was
 cited in proof of its identity in age with the Upper or Yellow Crag
 of Antwerp, which contained none of the Red Crag Mammals. The
 underlying Middle and Black Sands of Antwerp contain far larger
 percentages of extinct forms and very abundant Cetacean remains.
 The deposits at Darmstadt and in the South of France, containing
 terrestrial Mammalia similar to those of the Red Crag, are also ante
 rior to the Yellow Crag of Antwerp. The Red Crag was thus shown
 to include Mammalian fossils found nowhere else excepting in strata
 of an earlier age. The probabilities therefore were, that these various
 Mammalia were not indigenous to the Red Crag, but were derived
 from the breaking up of earlier strata; and this supposition was
 supported by lithological evidence, which the author gave in detail,
 and discussed the chemical and mineralogical questions involved.
 Further evidence of the extraneous nature of the Mammalian fossils
 was also adduced, in the fact that teeth of Rhinoceros and Mastodon
 occurred at the base of the Coralline Crag ; and other less conclusive
 facts were cited. The great abundance and perfect condition of
 teeth of Carcharodon and Ziphioid Cetaceans in the Middle Crag of
 Antwerp, their absence in the Yellow Crag of that locality, and their
 presence in a much rolled, indurated and fragmentary condition in
the Red Crag, often with portions of their previous sandy matrix
adhering, was considered as conclusive evidence with regard to the
Cetacean remains.
    Mr. Lankester then described the tusks of an animal allied to the
Walrus, but probably much larger, which he proposed to call          Tri
chechodon Hurleyi.      The minute details of form and structure were
entered into, and the author stated that the teeth called Balaenodon
by Professor Owen belonged really to two genera, Zihpius and
Squalodon, as shown by the remains from the Middle Antwerp beds.
    2. “Note on the Geology of Harrogate.”           By Professor John
Phillips, M.A., F.R.S., F.G.S.
    The cuttings on the North-eastern Railway, combined with sec
tions exposed in several quarries, have enabled the author to trace
the range of the Millstone-grit, Calcareous roadstone, and Yoredale
Shales near Harrogate; and have also thrown some light on the
relation of the Permian to the more ancient rocks.         Prof. Phillips
was also enabled to refer the mineral       springs,  with greater con
fidence than heretofore, to a deep source along an axis   of movement;

             On the Lower Silurian Rocks    of Cumberland.          401
and to suggest that the Harrogate roadstone probably corresponds
to the Main, or 12 fathom, limestone at the top of the Yoredale
series.   These results, the arguments and facts in support of them,
and the inferences obtainable from their consideration were given
by the author in this paper, which was illustrated by a horizontal
section from Wharfe, on the S.E., through Harrogate, to Nid on the
N.W.

   The following communications were read:—
    1.  “On   the Lower Silurian Rocks of the South-East of Cumber
land and the North-East of Westmoreland.”             By Professor    R.
Harkness, F.R.S., F.G.S.
   The district described in this paper consists of a narrow band of
country on the western side of the Pennine Chain; it possesses
external features which indicate a geological structure different from
that of the Pennine escarpment, and from that of the adjacent
country on the west, from which it is separated by the Pennine
fault. Prof. Harkness described the Lower Silurian rocks occupy
ing this narrow tract in some detail, and showed them to consist of
Skiddaw Slates, with interstratified greenstone porphyry and ash,
and a band of fossiliferous shale. He also gave, in illustration of
the structure of the country, a section from Melmerley Scar to
Romanfell, and one from Milburn to Dunfell, together with a geolo
gical sketch-map of the narrow Lower Silurian tract in question.
In conclusion the author described a fault which brings the Skid
daw Slates against the Coniston Limestone, and another, which
cuts through the Lower Silurian rocks of the district, having a
course at right angles to the former, and nearly parallel to that of
the Great Pennine fault.
    2. “Note on the Volcanic Tufa of Latacunga, at the foot of Coto
paxi; and on the Cangáua, or Volcanic Mud, of the Quitenian
Andes.”      By R. Spruce, Esq.
    The Volcanic Tufa described in this paper is not only used for
 building-purposes,   but also by the smiths instead of charcoal, as
when heated to redness it emits considerable heat, but very little
flame. The author then described the large deposits of Volcanic
Mud, called Cangáua, which are met with throughout the central
valley of the Quitenian Andes. This mud is compact, slightly
argillaceous, and more or less saline, and occurs in rock-like masses,
yielding very slowly to atmospheric agency, or even to running
Water.

Hill, Salisbury.” By Dr. H. P. Blackmore.
    Since the discovery of Flint Implements in the Higher-level
 gravel at Fisherton on the west of Salisbury, a large number of
very excellent weapons have been obtained from the Drift-gravel of
 Milford Hill. This deposit is of the same age as the Fisherton
 beds; but it is situated on the opposite side of the Avon, imme
 diately to the east of Salisbury.

      Dr. Blackmore               described           the       materials       composing           the gravel
of Milford Hill, and discussed the nature and power of the forces
which had brought them together.           He then described the position,
thickness, and physical relations of the deposit, stating that the
gravel is from 10 to 12 feet thick on the top of the hill, becoming
thinner and gradually dying away on the sides. The hill itself is
quite isolated, being separated from the surrounding higher land by
river-valleys;              its
                     highest point      about 100 feet above the present
                                                           is

and containing the results of their examination of the Genista Cave.
Referring first to Capt. Brome's report for a description of the
general features of that cave, the authors stated that the rock of
Gibraltar abounds in both seaboard and inland caverns, the Genista
Cave being one of the latter class.     It has been traced downwards
to a depth of 200 feet; but the external aperture has not yet been
discovered; it was stated to be full of the remains of Quadrupeds
and Birds, some of the former being now wholly extinct, others ex
tinct in Europe and repelled to distant regions of the African con
tinent (as the Hyaena brunnea), while others, again, live now either on
the rock or in the adjoining Spanish peninsula.    A list of the species
to which these remains were referable was then given, and it was
inferred that there had been a connexion by land, either circuitous
or direct, between Europe and Africa at no very remote period. The
authors observed that the wild animals whose remains were dis
covered lived and died upon the rock during a long series of ages,
and they gave a detailed account of the manner in which they con
sidered the bones were introduced into the cave.      They also recom
mended the formation of a local collection of these and other spe
cimens, urged the appointment of a geologist to make a geolo
gical survey of the rock, and concluded by expressing their opinion
of the value and importance of Capt. Brome's exploration of the
Genista cavern.

scribed the salient features of St. Michael's Cave, stating that it is a
portion of a transverse cleft through the rock, and was probably
open to view at no very remote historical period; and he briefly
noticed the cave at Poco Roco, which he considers to be a portion
of the fissure which extends from Bell Lane, in the town, to the
village of Catalan Bay, the noise of blasting having been heard on
more than one occasion through the apparently solid rock. In con
clusion Lieut. Warren offered his services in the event of a geolo
gical survey of Gibraltar being undertaken.

fluviatile deposits of the Nile and the Ganges, with comparative
remarks on the Alluvial Formation of the two Valleys.”           By the
late Hugh Falconer, M.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   In this communication the author brought together the few in
stances on record of the occurrence of mammalian fossil remains in
the Valley of the Nile, and instituted a comparison between the
Alluvial deposits of the Nile and those of the upper part of the Valley
of the Ganges which had come under his own observation.              Ac
cording to certain statements, fossil human bones have been met

with in both of these subtropical valleys; and Dr. Falconer remarked
that at the present time the consideration of the general inferences
to which these cases lead may probably be of some use.
   After discussing at some length the cases in which human and
other Mammalian bones had been stated to occur in the Valley of
the Nile, Dr. Falconer described the general features of the Alluvial
deposits of the valleys of the Ganges and Jumna, stating what
organic remains had been found in them.         In a comparison of the
two regions, Dr. Falconer observed that there are striking analogies
between the Alluvial deposits occurring along the banks of the Nile
on the one hand, and the Ganges and Jumna on the other, the most
                                                                                                                               •
obvious being the great abundance, in both cases, of argillace0
calcareous concretions, forming an impure kind of travertine, and in
the lowermost beds horizontal deposits of the same material; but

beds form a very flat arch, as may be seen along the coast from
Kingsgate   to Pegwell, between which places the flinty chalk rises

         on A NEW THERMO-ELEMENT.                BY M. S. MARCUS.
Th;         author has given the following account of the properties and
        construction of his new thermo-element:—
    1. The electromotive force of one of the new elements is ºth of
that of a Bunsen's element, and its resistance is equal to 0-4 of a
metre of normal wire.
    2. Six such elements can decompose acidulated water.
    3. A battery of 125 elements disengaged in a minute 25 cubic
centims. detonating gas; the decomposition took place under unfa
vourable circumstances, for the internal resistance was far greater
than that of the interposed voltameter.
    4. A platinum wire half a millim. in thickness introduced into the
circuit of the same wire is melted.
   5. Thirty elements produce an electro-magnet of 150 pounds
lifting-force.
    6. The current is produced by heating one of the junctions of the ele
ments, and cooling the second by water of the ordinary temperature.
    To construct this battery, it is necessary, on the one hand, to pro
cure two electromotors suitable for a thermo-element, and, on the
other, to have such an arrangement of the elements, and of the means
for heating and cooling, as will ensure as favourable a result as pos
sible.    The former constituted the physical, the latter the construc
tive   part  of the problem.
    In solving the first part of the problem it was the author's endea
Wour—
    a. To use such thermo-elements as are constructed of metals as
far apart as possible in the thermo-electric series, and
    b. Such as permit great differences of temperature without using
 ice,—which is only practicable if the bars possess as high fusing-points
 as possible.
     c. The material of the bars must not be costly, and the bars
 themselves must be easily constructed.
     d. The insulation used for the elements must be able to resist
 high temperatures, and must possess sufficient solidity and elasticity.
     As neither the usual bismuth-antimony couples nor any combi
 nation of the other simple metals satisfy these conditions, M. Mar
 cus availed himself of the circumstance that alloys, in the thermo
 electric pile, do not stand between the metals of which they consist,
 and was thereby led to the following alloys, which completely satisfy
 the above requirements:–
     For the positive metal—
                                     ,
                               10 parts of copper,
                                6          zinc,
                                6    ,,    nickel.
 An addition of one part of cobalt increases the electromotive force.

  The bars are not soldered together, but bound by means of screws.
       positive metal melts at about 1200° C., the negative at about
  The
600° C.
   As in this element it is only the heating of the positive metal
which influences the development of electricity, the arrangement
has been made that only this is heated, while the negative metal
receives heat by conduction.     By this arrangement it is possible to
apply temperatures of even 600°, and consequently to attain greater
differences of temperature.
   An interesting illustration of the conversion of heat into electri
city is the fact, that the water which is used for cooling the second
point of contact of the element becomes warm very slowly as long
as the circuit is closed, but pretty rapidly if it is open.
   The thermo-pile in question was constructed with a view to being
used with a gas-flame.     The individual elements consist of bars of
unequal dimensions; the positive electrical bar is 7" long, 7" broad,
and 4" thick; the negative electrical bar is 6" long, 7" broad, and
6" thick. Thirty-two such elements were screwed together, so that
all positive bars were upon one, and          negativeall  the other side,    on
and thus had the form        of grating. The battery consists

strengthened           iron bar. As       insulator between the iron bar
and the elements, mica was used. Besides this, the elements, where
they came into contact with the cooling water, were coated with so
luble glass. An earthen vessel filled with water was used for cooling
the lower contact sides      of

        various papers on the theory of the electric telegraph,
                  W. Thomson has investigated the effect produced
on electrical signals by lateral induction, and has deduced the
laws by which, when certain constants peculiar to each circuit
are known, we can calculate the modifications that will occur in
any signal, or series of signals, in consequence of transmission
through that circuit.       The nature of these modifications, which
 are   most marked in the case of submarine cables, may be
 described as follows.
    1. The abrupt well-defined electrical changes produced at the
 sending-end of the circuit, by making or breaking contact with
 the battery, are replaced at the receiving-end by changes more
 or less gradual. Thus, when a current is sent into a cable by
 suddenly completing the circuit, no sensible effect whatever is at
 first observed at the further end (supposed in connexion with the
 earth).    After a little while a weak current arrives, and this gra
 dually increases until, after a certain time more or less long, a
 maximum is reached, when, if the insulation were perfect, the
 received current would be equal to that sent.
     2. If the signals be sent in such rapid succession that sufficient
 time does not elapse between each change of contact for the re
 ceived current to acquire this maximum and again fall to zero, then
 the total magnitude of the change at the receiving-end will be
                                                                       w

 speed no sensible change whatever in the electrical currents                                   in
 dicating a signal can be observed, however strong the currents
 produced near the sending-end of the cable may be.
    3. The changes in the received currents corresponding to sig
 mals sent are not constant even on a given cable with a given
 battery, but vary according to the electrical condition of the cir
 cuit, produced by the signals immediately preceding; so that a
 given signal at the sending-end does not produce an invariable
 and constant effect at the receiving-end, but a variable and                                   in
 constant effect, depending on preceding signals. Thus when the
 ordinary electrical signals are sent through a long submarine
 cable in quick succession, the received signals are not only re
 tarded, but, if sent too quickly, they are weaker than those that
 would have been received through an aérial line of equal length,
resistance, and insulation, they are also confused and unintelli
 gible, and at a still higher speed are wholly obliterated.       -
    The phenomena, as exhibited in long submarine cables, are so
marked, and their commercial importance so great, that they
have been the subject of considerable study, although even now
the constants required for the rigorous application of Professor
W. Thomson's theory are imperfectly known”.

                       is a reduced copy of the curve given by Pro
fessor W. Thomson in the Philosophical Magazine for December
 1855, and represents the gradual arrival of an electric current
at the further end of a long wire in connexion with the earth,
when the near or sending end of the line is connected with the
battery for a time sufficiently long to allow the current to reach
its maximum. The horizontal ordinates represent times         func                    in

412               Mr. F. Jenkin               on the Retardation          of
  One   good      example             of the kind of instrument alluded to is
afforded by Professor Wheatstone's automatic arrangement, with
which, on a single circuit, 600 letters per minute can be transmit
ted, each indicated by about three dots on an average, requiring,
when reverse currents are used, that they shall be transmitted
at the rate of 3600 per minute, or 60 per second.
   Other automatic arrangements, for instance that of the Che
valier Bonelli, differing exceedingly in most points from that
above mentioned, have this in common, that the number of dis
tinct currents required per minute is exceedingly great; and
when these arrangements are used on long aerial circuits, the
phenomena of induction place a limit to the number of messages
that can be sent in a given time, precisely as the induction in
submarine cables limits the capability of the line with ordinary
hand-signalling.    It becomes, therefore, of importance to the
inventors and introducers of these inventions to know where to
expect this limit to the rate of transmission, or to the distance
over which messages can be sent at a given rate.         This consi
deration led the writer to examine whether any existing experi
ments gave the data required; and he found that a paper by
M. Guillemin, published in 1860*, afforded, for the particular
lines of which he made trial, much of the information wanted.
M. Guillemin himself appears to have imperfectly understood
the theory of Professor W. Thomson; but it is somewhat difficult
to be certain as to his views on this point, owing to a very curious
coincidence. Ohm, in his paper “On the Mathematical Law of
the Galvanic Circuit,” published in 1827t, not only considers the
case of the permanent current which exists according to the well
known relation between electromotive force and resistance known
par eacellence as Ohm’s Law, but also considers the condition of
the current when increasing from nothing to               maximum.             its
Ohm does not    suppose   that this change  can take place  instanta
neously, and upon purely hypothetical grounds              arrived                he           at
 an expression     the law according
                      of                                to
                                           which the increase must
take  place.   This law was   wholly  unsupported      any practical       by
experiment, and appears        the time at  have attracted little
                                                             to                                or

curve of arrival is perfectly defined by using the time t and the
observed strength of current as coordinates (the time r remain

for 550 kilometres, excluding the first observations as before, is
000132 second; from Table III, it is 0.00153 second.             This
last value ought to have coincided with the previous one.        The
mean of the two is 000142 second        ; substituting this value for
a, and 550,000 for l in the above expression, we obtain as the
value of c, 0.168.
    This number should have agreed with the value 0.213 deduced
from Table I. The discrepancy shows that it would be of little
use to follow out minutely the results to be obtained from every
series observed by M. Guillemin.
    We are not informed of the resistance in the batteries or at the
receiving-end; the resistance of the lines can only be looked on
as the roughest approximation.
    The state of insulation of the lines is not known, and the de
 flections observed are not truly proportional to the currents.

 the insulators (which will probably vary considerably according
 to the weather), and possibly by the effects of polarization at the
 points of support.   (The value does not vary rapidly with the
 variation of height above the ground.)     The apparent capacity,
 measured   by   the method M. Guillemin adopts, will also be
 affected by the dynamic induction from wire to wire, the effect
 of which will be to make the capacity appear larger. Consider
able variations may therefore be expected to be observed between
different lines, even where a wire of the same diameter is used;
and the state of the weather may sensibly affect this capacity.
    The number of signals which may be sent on a land line, of
the construction used in M. Guillemin's experiments, may be
deduced from the Table calculated by Professor Thomson, pub
lished by the writer, and now given in an abridged form.

kept permanently flowing through the wire.       It is very doubtful
whether in   practice a smaller variation than this would be avail
able for practical signalling by any of the automatic plans yet
invented for acrial lines. This would give for the duration of the
shortest signal 0:01.12 second, equivalent to about 90 signals per
second, or about 5400 per minute; on the Morse alphabet this
would correspond to 360 words per minute.        On a line of 1000
kilometres this speed would be reduced to 90 words per minute.
Thus Professor Wheatstone’s automatic instruments, alluded to in
the beginning of this paper, may be expected to transmit at their
full speed over a line 500 kilometres (or say 300 miles) long;
but their speed would necessarily be reduced on a line of double
that length, unless, by augmenting the section of the conductor,
the value of k be reduced.     The value of c would at the same
time be increased by doing this; but, as will appear from the

what were then called Eye Pills, but having received no benefit

   In speculating on the process by which the crystalline lens is
supplied with the necessary quantity of fluid, it occurred to me
that it might be derived from the aqueous humour, and that
cataract might be produced when there was too little water and
too much albumen in the fluid which filled the aqueous chamber.
    Upon this hypothesis, incipient cataract might be cured in .

    1st. By discharging a portion of the aqueous humour, in the
hope that the fresh secretion, by which the loss is repaired,
may contain less albumen, and counteract the desiccation of
the lens.
    2nd. By injecting distilled water into the aqueous chamber,
to supply the quantity of humour discharged from                                      it.
    The first of   these methods      knew

from the fact that      asurgeon      the Manchester Infirmary, many
                                         in

he   attributed   to    an

                                     aqueous humour.          The frequent
repetition   of   this operation shows how rapidly the humour                                      is
 secreted, and how reasonable                itsuppose that,

428                         Sir David Brewster on the Cause
which were published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1837,
the lenses were placed in a glass trough of distilled water, and
exposed to polarized light; and the changes thus produced were
indicated by variations in the number and character of the polar
ized rings, and more palpably by the gradual enlargement of the
lens. The distilled water passed through the elastic capsule of
the lens.    The lens increased in size daily, and at the end of
several  days the capsule burst, leaving the lens in a disorganized
state, the outer laminae being reduced to an albuminous pulp by
the water admitted through the capsule.
   These experiments have an obvious importance in reference
to the cause and cure of the two kinds of cataract to which the
human eye is subject. The aqueous humour is in immediate
contact with the capsule of the crystalline lens. When, there
fore, the humour contains too little water, the lens has not a
sufficient supply of the fluid which keeps       fibres and laninae             its
in optical contact, and hence the laminae separate, and the lens
becomes opake and hard.      When,       the contrary, the aqueous   on
humour contains too much water, the capsule introduces the
excess into the lens, and produces the more dangerous affection
of soft cataract,   which   in difficult either  depress
                                                   it is     extract            to                   or

     NeitherDr. Mitchell nor Dr. Richardson seem to have been
acquainted with my experiments on the changes in the lens after
death, published in 1837, and with the theory of the cause and
cure of cataract there referred to, nor with the distinct state
ment of it published in 1836+ and, twenty years later, in 1856t.

   The two other equations may be reduced in like manner;                                         also
from the scCond set of equations,

 with two other symmetrical equations.
    Now on comparing these equations with M. Lamé's (p. 65,
 equations (1)), they are seen to be identical on supposing pla?u,
 ºbs=2v, ºbs=2w; and thus it appears that the results of the ap
 plication of the principle of Least Action are identical with those
 obtained by M. Lamé, which furnishes an independent proof of
 the principle in the case of perfect elasticity.
    Before leaving the subject,                I
                                       will make some general remarks
 in conclusion.
    Though nothing has been strictly proved, except that the va
 riation in the work done in a perfectly elastic body due to a
 change in the resisting forces is zero, yet it is sufficiently evident
 that the work is a minimum.          That             valuesis,   of   all
                                                                  the work              of
possible    on the supposition   that the resistances      terms       which  in             of
the work      isexpressed may          not merely resisting
                                              be                    (as they            or
have been called) “passive” forces, but applied                   “active”           or
forces, the least      that which corresponds
                       is                              the passive forces.
                                                                        to
I  think that, seen from this point          view, the principle
                                                        of             Least                 of
Action   is nearly  self-evident,   even without the     confirmatory    evi
dence that the variation             in
                                the case        perfectly elastic body
                                                            of
zero; for the change                of            really     is a
                                                             effect, into      an                  a is
                                force which
                                     a
force which       really
                 is        cause,
                             a     must increase    directly     indirectly          or
the total effect.
    On the other hand, the energy expended may                 said                be         byto a
maximum. That               is,   of
                                values
                                  all       the  energy ofexpended       the                    be
really active forces possible                 on
                                      the supposition that those forces
may    be active which are really passive, the greatest value physi
cally possible corresponds         the passive forces. Thus
                                         to                           weight              a

                                    of   the   Principle        of Least Action.                                               435
    placed on a beam descends as low as possible; for if any possible
    different values of the passive forces would enable that weight to
    descend, it would certainly descend and produce those values.
    But there is a restriction implied in the words “physically pos
    sible,” namely, that the energy expended cannot exceed a certain
    limit consistently with the physical constitution of the mass of
    matter; and the function representing the energy expended is
    not a maximum in the technical sense of the word. It is just
    the same in the case of the principle of least resistance: each re
    sisting force is indeed the least possible; but                limiting value                    its
     depends           on
                     the constitution                     of
                                            the whole mass, and                not,                                it     is
    properly speaking,          minimum, though the least possible.

we know the results of previous scientific inquiry, and are ac
quainted with the method of adapting them to the case before
us, we may discover the proper arrangement at once.          we are                        If
unable to make any estimate of what is required before construct
ing the apparatus, we may have to encounter numerous failures
which might have been avoided if we had known how to make a
proper use of existing data.
     All exact knowledge is founded on the comparison of one
quantity with another.      In many experimental researches con
 ducted by single individuals, the absolute values of those quan
 tities are of no importance; but whenever many persons are to
 act together, it is necessary that they should have a common
 understanding of the measures to be employed.         The object of
 the present treatise is to assist in attaining this common under
 standing as to electrical measurements.
   2. Derivation of Units from fundamental Standards.-Every
distinct kind of quantity requires a standard of          own, and                   its
these standards   might       chosen   quite
                                        be   independently       each                      it
other, and      many cases have been
                   in                        chosen; but       sopos                       is of
sible  todeduce     standardsall    quantity   of
                                             from the fundamental
standards adopted for length, time, and mass; and                                           it       is   of

                                                                                            a

we have to speak involves as factors measurements
and mass only; but these measurements enter sometimes at one
power, and sometimes at another.  In passing from one set of
fundamental units to another, and for other purposes, it is
useful to know at what power each of these fundamental mea
surements enters into the derived measure.
   Thus the value of a force is directly proportional to a length
and a mass, but inversely proportional to the square of a time.
º
This is expressed by saying that the dimensions of a force are
      ; in other words,        if   we wish to pass from the English                    to
the French system of measurements,

unit of force would, in either system, be

       PART   II.-The         Measurement            of Magnetic Phenomena.
    5. Magnets and Magnetic Poles.—Certain natural bodies, as
the iron ore called loadstone, the earth itself, and pieces of steel
after being subjected to certain treatment, are found to possess
the following properties, and are called magnets.
  If    one of these bodies be free to turn in any direction, the
presence of another will cause it to set itself in a position which
is conveniently described or defined by reference to certain ima
ginary lines occupying a fixed position in the two bodies, and
called their magnetic axes.      One object of our magnetic mea
surements will be to determine the force which one magnet
exerts upon another. It is found by experiment that the
greatest manifestation of force exerted by one long thin magnet
on another occurs very near the ends of the two bars, and that
the two ends of any one long thin magnet possess opposite qua
lities.   This peculiarity has caused the name of “poles" to be
given to the ends of long magnets; and this conception of a
magnet, as having two poles capable of exerting opposite forces
joined by a bar exerting no force, is so much the most familiar
that we shall not hesitate to employ       especially it, many    the   as        of
properties    of magnets may       correctly expressed
                                           be               this way;        in

                                                                 of

                                                                   at             of

bar, except in the case of long, infinitely thin, uniformly mag
netized rods.
   If we mark the poles of any two magnets which possess simi
lar qualities, we find that the two marked poles repel each other,
that two unmarked poles also repel each other, but that a marked
and an unmarked pole attract each other. The pole which is
repelled from the northern regions of the earth is called a posi
tive pole; the other end the negative pole. The negative pole
is generally marked N by British instrument-makers, and is
sometimes called the north pole of the magnet, whereas it is
obviously similar to the earth's south pole.
   The strength of a pole is necessarily defined as proportional
to the force it is capable of exerting on any other pole.    Hence
the force        f
             exerted between two poles of the strengths m and ml
must be proportional to the product mm.       The force, f, is also
found to be inversely proportional to the square of the distance,
D, separating the poles, and to depend on no other quantity;
hence we have, unless an absurd and useless coefficient be
introduced,
                                              f="#,                .    .        .     .      .    .        .    ()
from which equation it follows that the unit pole will be that
which at unit distance repels another similar pole with unit
force;       f
         will be an attraction or a repulsion according as the
poles are of opposite or the same kinds.  The dimensions of the

                          Field—It is clear that
in some way modifies the         surrounding    space, since any other
magnet brought into that space experiences a peculiar force.

                  of Magnetic Induction.—When certain bodies,
     9. Coefficient
such as soft  iron,  &c., are placed in the magnetic field, they
become    magnetized   by “induction”; so that the intensity of
magnetization is (except when great) nearly proportional to the
intensity of the field.
   In diamagnetic bodies, such as bismuth, the direction of
magnetization is opposite to that of the field. In paramagnetic
bodies, such as iron, nickel, &c., the direction of magnetization
is the same as that of the field.
   The coefficient of magnetic induction is the ratio of the inten
sity of magnetization to the intensity of the field, and is there
fore a numerical quantity, positive for paramagnetic bodies,
negative for diamagnetic bodies.
   10. Magnetic Potentials and Equipotential Surfaces.—If we
take a very long magnet, and, keeping one pole well out of the
way, move the other pole from one point to another of the mag
netic field, we shall find that the forces in the field do work on
the pole, or that they act as a resistance to    motion, according                its

    In speaking of a quantity of electricity, we need not conceive
 it as a separate thing, or entity distinct from ponderable matter,
 any more than in speaking of sound we conceive it as having a
 distinct existence.   Still it is convenient to speak of the inten
 sity or velocity of sound, to avoid tedious circumlocution; and
 quite similarly we may speak of electricity, without for a moment
imagining that any real electric fluid exists.
   The laws according to which the force described varies, as the
shape of the conductors, their combinations, and their distances
are varied, have been established by Coulomb, Poisson, Green,
W. Thomson, and others. These will be found accurately de

the condition of the wire in the two cases. The wire in the
latter case is therefore said to convey a permanent current of
electricity, the magnitude or strength of which is defined as pro
portional to the quantity conveyed per second.     This definition
is expressed by the equation
                       -                          C=
                                                            º.        .     .    .     .        .    .        .        (4)
where C is the current, Q the quantity, and t the time.         A per
manent current   flowing through     a wire may   be measured by the
force which it exerts on a magnet;     the actual quantity it conveys
may be obtained by comparing this force with the force exerted
under otherwise similar conditions, when a known quantity is
sent through the same wire by discharges. The strength of a
permanent current is found at any one time to be equal insall
parts of the conductor.    Conductors conveying currents exert a
peculiar force one upon another; and during their increase or
decrease they produce currents in neighbouring. conductors.
Similar effects are produced as they approach or recede from
neighbouring conductors. The laws according to which currents
act upon magnets and upon one another will be found in the
writings of Ampère and Weber.

double that done in the second in the same time, the electromotive
force in the first case is said to be double that in the second; but
if the work done in two circuits is found strictly proportional to
the two currents, the electromotive force acting on the two cur
rents is said to be the same.       Defined in this way, the electro
motive force of a voltaic battery is found to be constant so long
as the materials of which it is formed remain in a similar or con
stant condition.     The above definitions, in mathematical lan
guage, give W-ECt, or
                                         W                                                              (5 )

                                         CP
where E is the electromotive force, and W the work done. Thus
the electromotive force producing a current in a conductor is
equal to the ratio between the work done in the unit of time and
the current effecting the work.   This conception of the relations
of work, electromotive force, current, and quantity will be aided
by the following analogy:—A quantity of electricity may be
compared to a quantity or given mass of water; currents of water
in pipes in which equal quantities passed each spot in equal times
 would then correspond to equal currents of electricity; electro
motive force would correspond to the head of water producing
the current. Thus        if,
                        with two pipes conveying equal currents,
the head   forcing the water through the first was double that
forcing it  through the second, the work done        the water             by                            in
flowing through the first pipe would necessarily        twice that               be
done   by  the water    in  the second pipe; but           twice      much
                                                                      if                      as
water passed through the first pipe           passed through the second,
                                               as
the work done      by  water   inthe first pipe would again         doubled.         be
This  corresponds     exactly  with the increase       work done   of    the                       by
electrical current when the electromotive force              doubled, and is
when the quantity       isdoubled.

450         Prof. Maxwell and Mr. F. Jenkin on the Elementary
on one another.—Hitherto   we have spoken of the measurement
of currents as dependent on their action upon magnets; but this
measurement    in the same units can as simply be founded on their
mutual action upon one another. Ampère has investigated the
laws of mechanical action between conductors carrying currents.
He has shown that the action of a small closed circuit at a dis
tance is the same as that of a small magnet, provided the axis
of the magnet be placed normal to the plane of the circuit, and
the moment of the magnet be equal to the product of the current
into the area of the circuit which it traverses.
   Thus,      let
             two small circuits having areas     and        placed          A               Al     be

                                                                                                              C,is

expressed   by saying that if a conductor carrying a current is
moved in a magnetic field, the work done on the conductor by
the electromagnetic forces is equal to the product of the strength
of the current into the number of lines of force which it cuts

we can measure the current and electromotive force, or even the
ratio of these magnitudes, we should, ipso facto, have measured
the resistance of the circuit. The methods by which this ratio
has been measured, founded on the laws of electromagnetic in
duction, are fully described in Appendix D (Brit. Assoc. Re
ports, p. 163). Other methods may be founded on the measure
ment of currents and electromotive forces described in 18, 19,
20, 27, and 28. Lastly, a method founded on the gradual
loss of charge through very great resistances will be found in
Part IV. (45). The equation (25) there given for electrostatic
measure is applicable to electromagnetic measure when the
capacity and difference of potentials are expressed in electro
magnetic units.
  30. Electric Resistance in Electromagnetic Units is measured
by an Absolute Velocity.—The dimensions of R are found, by
comparing those of         E   and C, to be    #   or those of a simple      velo
city.   This velocity, as was pointed out by Weber, is an absolute
velocity in nature, quite independent of the magnitude of the
fundamental units in which it is expressed. The following illus
tration, due to Professor Thomson, will show how a velocity may
express a resistance, and also how that expression may be inde
pendent of the magnitude of the units of time and space.
   Let a wire of any material be bent into an arc of 574° with
any radius, k. Let this arc be placed in the magnetic meridian
of any magnetic field, with a magnet of any strength freely sus
pended in the centre of the arc. Let two vertical wires or rails,
separated by a distance equal to k, be attached to the ends of
the arc; and let a cross piece slide along these rails, inducing
a current in the arc.    Then it may be shown that the speed
required to produce a deflection of 45° on the magnet will mea
sure the resistance of the circuit, which is assumed to be con
stant. This speed will be the same whatever be the value of k,
or the intensity of the magnetic field, or the moment of the
magnet. In this form the experiment could not be easily car
ried out; but if a length, l, of wire be taken and rolled into a
circular coil at the radius k, and the distance between the ver

proposition can easily be established when the laws of magneto

   81. Magneto-electric Induction.—Let a conducting circuit be
placed in a magnetic field.   Let C be the intensity of any cur
rent in that  circuit; E the magnitude   of the electromotive force
acting in the circuit.    Let the circuit be so moved that the
number of lines of magnetic force (11) passing through it is
increased by N in the time t, then (23) the electromagnetic
forces will contribute towards the motion an amount of work
measured by CN.        Now Q, the quantity of electricity which
                  Ct; so that the work done on the current is
passes, is equal to
EQ   or CEt.  By the principle of conservation of energy, the
work done by the electromagnetic forces must be at the expense
of that done by the electromotive forces, or

derived by him (independently of the principle of conservation
of energy) from the motion of a conductor in a magnetic field,

means of the   point  O, we inscribe a  triangle A'B'C', and in the
triangle  A'B'C', by means of the point O', we inscribe a triangle
affy, then the triangles ABC, «Sy are in perspective, viz. the
lines Aa, B8, Cy will meet in a point.
   This is very easily proved analytically; in fact, taking wa0,
y=0, z=0 for the equations of the lines B'C', C.A., A'B' respec
tively, and (X, Y, Z) for the coordinates of the point O, then the
coordinates of (A, B, C) are found to be         Y,Z), (X, -Y,Z),             (-X,

ordinates of the point O', then the coordinates of              are                                    (a,     8,   y)

   In the course of the discussion which took place on the sub
ject,  I had occasion to point out that, inasmuch as salts in which
the base is hydrogen, such as hydric nitrate, hydric sulphate,
hydric phosphate, &c., are admitted to be analogous in their
 constitution and properties to the salts of the regular metals,
 such as silver, potassium, &c., it is desirable, when describing
their reactions, to designate them by names bearing a corre
 sponding analogy to the names of thesalts of silver, potassium, &c.;
that in describing the reactions of double salts containing as
base partly hydrogen, partly some heavier metal, such as com
mon rhombic phosphate, H Na” PO", it is not only desirable to
introduce the name of the hydrogen in a form similar to that of
the other metal, but it is really not possible to obtain systematic
and consistent names without representing in them the metallic
functions of the hydrogen; that when hydrogen is in the place of
an acid or chlorous constituent of a salt, it must be described by
a term which represents the fact of                             its
                                            having such functions.
     Infact     itnot allowable
                      is              apply     hydrogen-salts names
                                                      to              to
which conceal their analogy with other salts,         which imply the           or
absence         of
              saline constitution       hydrogen-salts.in  Thus                            it   is  a
faulty expression       say that the common process for preparing
                             to
so-called nitric acid consists       the action   in sulphuric acid on      of
potassic nitrate, forming potassic bisulphate and nitric acid; for

such       expression conveys the idea                                 a
one acid         by
               another, whereas the process          admitted              is             to   be

  It   was    first supposed
                 at               some members that      advocated                   I
the immediate introduction         systematic and accurate names
into common and popular language. The learned member felt
alarm     the danger
           at              having       of
                                       speak               to

instead     “calomel,”
               of        manganic    peroxide instead    “manga                      of
nese,” hydric sulphate instead         “sulphuric acid,” &c.; and
                                                           of
manufacturers would    certainly not have received with favour
proposal      give
                to            up
                       the term “soda” for sodic carbonate,                                         to a
                                “arsenic.”    to of

I    accordingly hastened      explain that my suggestions towards
improving our systematic nomenclature were only expected,                                           if
adopted,     react gradually upon the popular language, and that
                to

  466         Prof. Williamson on Chemical Nomenclature.
  for the present     I contemplate    ordering a couple of carboys of
  “sulphuric acid    "  or “nitric acid”   as heretofore, meaning those
  compounds which in systematic language are designated “hydric
  sulphate” and “hydric nitrate”; but that when               I  have to
  explain to learners the reactions of those hydrogen-salts,            I
  should give them the systematic names which correspond to
  their composition. The popular and trivial names by which
  they are known are abbreviations formed so as to point to the
  essential or characteristic constituent.      It is not practicable to
  send out real   sulphuric   acid, SO”;    but manufacturers and con
 sumers know that the value of oil of vitriol is not in the water
 which it contains, but in the “real acid.”          In like manner, the
 common      crystals  of  hydrated   sodic carbonate are valuable in
 proportion to the percentage of soda, Na”0, which they contain,
 and they are not unreasonably named after their characteristic
 constituent.
     There was, on the part of one or two distinguished members
 of the Society, a feeling that the retention of the words acid and
 base in their established signification of “electro-negative oxides”
 and “electro-positive oxides” might be inconvenient in presence
 of the fact that chlorine forms with hydrogen a very acid salt,
 and that some other elements also form acid hydrides. But when
 it is admitted that Hº SO" is a salt, though of very acid proper
 ties, that HNO" and Hº PO” are also very acid salts, and that in
 scientific language they must be designated as salts, it really is
 not surprising that HCl, HBr, &c. should be salts of considerable
 acidity, and it is not unnatural to call them salts of hydrogen in
 systematic nomenclature.        The fact that we cannot remove the
elements of water from hydric chloride and make Cl*—O, whilst
 we can remove water from hydric sulphate and make SO*—O, is
really no reason against classing, side by side, hydrogen-salts
with compound radicals such as NO”, SO", PO", &c., and those
with elementary radicals such as Cl, Br, &c.
    Since my suggestions have been published Mr. Foster has
published in the Philosophical Magazine a paper “On Chemical
Nomenclature, and chiefly on the use of the word Acid.”               In
this   paper  Mr. Foster    expresses  assent to the form of names of
which I had recommended the systematic adoption; and he says,
“If    we regard the salts of hydrogen as constituted like the salts
of   any  other metal, the application to them of the name acid
becomes incorrect if it implies any peculiarity of constitution,
and superfluous if it does not.” Now, as Laurent and Gerhardt
did admit and assert that the salts of hydrogen are constituted
like the salts of any other metal, and as Mr. Foster is doubtless
perfectly aware that they did so, the above sentence is a distinct
condemnation of Gerhardt's proposal of applying the word acid

   distinctive name should be given to the bodies K*O, BaO, &c.,
   formed by dehydrating the so-called bases. The absence of any
   such term is a deficiency sufficiently grave to make one pause in
  adopting the term anhydride in systematic language, until the
  idea which it represents is duly applied to the other great class

to  deprive them                 of

                       combine with bases when           brought        contact                 in

than that with which their hydrates react on basic hydrates. It
is well known that when two saline molecules such as SO“H”
and Ba0% H* react on one another with liberation of water and
formation of a salt, the force of combination, as measured by the
heat evolved, is less than that which the acid and base exert in
direct combination; for the process of double decomposition
separates the water from SO” and from BaO, and in doing so
absorbs just as much heat as was evolved when water combined
with SO” and with Ba0; so that the force with which the two
hydrates react on one another is by so much less than that with
which SO3 combines with Ba0.
    Mr. Foster expresses an objection to applying the term “com
bination ” to the reaction of such bodies as anhydrous acetic acid
 (C*H*O)*O on water, because by a process of double decompo
sition the two molecules, acid and water, give rise to the forma
tion of two new molecules; but if his objection is admitted to
have weight, it applies equally to the reaction of free chlorine on
free hydrogen, where two molecules of the elements form two
molecules of the compound by a process of double decomposition.
If  such reactions as that of chlorine on hydrogen, and of anhy
drous acetic acid on water, are not combinations, the word
might perhaps be retained for such reactions as the combina
tion of carbonic oxide and chlorine; or SO° and water, where
two molecules unite to form one; but if Mr. Foster seriously
proposes such a restriction of the word, it will be time enough to
consider       The present usage
              it.                         describe

He has also discussed Gerhardt’s misuse of the word acid.                       His
conclusion that the word had better be given up, would be quite
worthy of serious consideration if the words were only used in
those improper senses.     But the words acid and base really mean
something not only true, but of fundamental importance, which
we are constantly obliged to consider and speak of in chemistry;
and    Iam quite sure that it would be utterly beyond my power
to take from them their established meaning, even if I wished
to do so. There is at present a considerable amount of incon
sistency in the prevailing use of these, as of most other scientific
terms; and Mr. Foster’s interesting paper affords further argu
ments than those which         I
                             had given in favour of abandoning as
speedily as practicable the misuseof the terms which has crept into
partial use through popular disregard of water in hydric sul
phate, and which Gerhardt unsuccessfully endeavoured to incor
porate with scientific language.
   I  have not discussed the proposal to call both acids and bases
 oxides, because it has not as yet received sufficient development
 to enable me to form any opinion upon it beyond the obvious
 objections which present themselves at first sight to so grave a
 change. Thus MnO, Mn2O3, MnO2, MnO2, Mn”07 are at pre
 sent conveniently distinguished by names, calling the last two
 acids, and the first two oxides; and so also CO and CO2 are
 very conveniently distinguished by the words oxide and acid.
 Another circumstance which would alone have been sufficient to
 prevent my offering any opinion on this proposal is the fact above
 explained, that it is founded on Mr. Foster’s opinion that the
  word acid is not clear and is unworthy of being retained.

 thus the first to call attention to phenomena of this nature.
 The following observations, on analogous phenomena presented
 by indigo, had been already made by the author at the date of
 Professor Melde’s communication.
     It is well known that indigo gives a spectrum in which a com
 paratively narrow red band is followed by an absorption-band, of
 greater or less breadth according to the concentration of the
 solution, while after this there comes a bright band which attains
of its
      maximum        of intensity       the blue, and lastly the violet end
                                        in
     the spectrum again suffers absorption.               Now          small quan  if   a

               of          the red line    disappears    immediately,     and after
a   short time the second bright band begins                   approach the red
                                                                              to
 end     ofthe spectrum, and finally extends               this direction                              to
                                                                      of in

 The indigo solution, however, must not contain any free sulphu

ration takes place.           The red band then remains unchanged, and
after adding several drops                we

common temperatures and at the proper degree of concentration
this substance shows two luminous bands, one of which is very
intense and embraces the whole of the red and yellow, and part of
the green; the other, comparatively weak, is situated in the violet.
On applying heat, this violet band gradually diminishes in               in
tensity, and two new bands of absorption, of which previously
no trace was visible, appear in the red. They increase very
rapidly in breadth, especially the less refrangible of the two, as
the temperature rises; so that, when the boiling-point is ap
proached, they have completely obliterated the entire bright
band in which they appeared, with the exception of a very nar
row weak stripe in the extreme red.
   In order to explain these phenomena, one might be disposed
to assume that the elevation of temperature occasioned chemical
changes to take place in the liquids—that,for instance, a fewatoms
of water were fixed or given off—were it not that, so far as the
observations have yet gone, a sudden alteration of absorbing
power never occurs, but the changes take place in a perfectly
gradual manner.
    On the other hand, these phenomena are quite analogous
to those observed by Brewster* and others in relation to the ab
sorbing-powers of certain gases, in which, as the temperature
rises, the absorption-bands increase in number and width.

   On a small fragment of Killas, from Cornwall, a discovered,
several months ago, a new mineral in the form of minute but well
formed crystals. The specimen had come from Mr. Talling, of
Lostwithiel, a mineral-dealer, to whose activity and intelligence          I
am indebted for the materials that form the subject of this paper.
After a little while he found the locality of the mineral, and sent
me other and finer specimens; but these specimens proved to con
tain other new minerals besides the one already mentioned.              Two
of these minerals are described in this paper, and a third will form

   M. Pisani has published analyses of the two above-described mi
nerals.   In the former (possibly from having driven off part of the
water in the preliminary desiccation of the mineral) he has found
less water than I consider it really to contain, and he has conse
quently given to Langite the formula of Waringtonite.
   The green mineral which he has analyzed and described as Bro
chantite seems, from his analysis, to have contained a slight admix
ture of the ferruginous matrix, and also differs from mine in the esti
mate of the water.          -

     confined my preliminary desiccation to a careful treatment of the

minerals of this class yield up part of their water when long exposed
to a perfectly dry air, or to a temperature of 100°C.

 Mr. F. Jenkin           on the New Unit                  of Electrical       Resistance.    477
    April 6.—Major-General Sabine, President, in the Chair.
  The following communication was read:—
  “Report on the New Unit of Electrical Resistance proposed and
issued by the Committee on Electrical Standards appointed in 1861
by the British Association.” By Fleeming Jenkin, Esq.
     Sir Humphry Davy, in 1821*, published his researches proving
a difference in the conducting-power of metals and the decrease
of that power as their temperature rose. This quality of metals was
examined by Snow Harris, Cumming, and E. Becquerel, whose table
of conducting-powers, compiled by the aid of his differential galva
nometer, and published in 1826+, is still frequently quoted, and is
indeed remarkable as the result of experiments made before the
publication by Ohm, in 1827t, of the true mathematical theory of
the galvanic circuit.
    The idea of resistance as the property of a conductor was intro
duced by Ohm, who conceived the force of the battery overcoming
the resistance of the conductors and producing the current as a
result.    Sir Humphry Davy, on the contrary, and other writers of
his time, conceived the voltaic battery rather as continually reprodu
cing a charge, somewhat analogous to that of a Leyden jar, which
was discharged so soon as a conductor allowed the fluid to pass. The
idea of resistance is the necessary corollary of the conception of a
 force doing some kind of work S, whereas the idea of conducting
power is the result of an obvious analogy when electricity is con
 ceived as a fluid, or two fluids, allowed to pass in different quantities
 through different wires from pole to pole. When submitted to
 measurement, the qualities of conducting-power and resistance are
 naturally expressed by reciprocal numbers, and the terms are used
 in this sense in the early writings of Lenz (1833)|, who, with
  Fechnerºl, and Pouillet”, established the truth of Ohm's theory
  shortly after the year 1830.
    The conception of a unit of resistance is implicitly contained in
 the very expression of Ohm’s law; but the earlier writers seem to
 have contented themselves with reducing by calculation the resist
 ance of     all

        Mr. F. Jenkin                   on the New Unit                  of Electrical Resistance.                               479
 underground    telegraphic wires were introduced, and were shortly
followed  by  submarine cables, in the examination and manufacture
of which the practical engineer soon found the benefit of a knowledge
of electrical laws. Thus in 1847 the officers of the Electric and
International Telegraph Company used resistance-coils made by
Mr. W. F. Cooke, apparently multiples of Wheatstone's original
standard, which was nearly equal to the No. 16 wire of commerce;
and Mr. C. F. Warley* states that, even at that date, he used a
rough mode of “distance testing.” In 1850, Lieut. Werner Siemenst
published two methods for determining, by experiments made at
distant stations, the position of “a fault”—that is to say, a con
nexion between the earth and the conducting-wire of the line at
some point between the stations.    In one of these plans a resistance
equal to that of the battery is used, and the addition of resistances
is also suggested; and Sir Charles Bright, in a Patent dated 1852t,
gives an account of a plan for determining the position of a fault by
the direct use of resistance-coils.   Since that time new methods of
testing for faults and of examining the quality of materials employed,
and the condition of the line, have been continually invented, almost

 a standard by the Electric and International              Company, and about

    It was found necessary to undertake entirely fresh experiments in
order to determine the actual value of the abstract standard, and to
express the same in a material standard which might form the basis of
sets of resistance-coils to be used in the usual manner.      These expe
 riments, made during two years with two distinct sets of apparatus by
Professor        J.
               C. Maxwell and the writer, according to a plan devised
by Professor W. Thomson, are fully described in the Reports to the
British Association for 1863 and 1864.
    The results of the two series of experiments made in the two years
agree within 0.2 per cent, and they show that the new standard does
not probably differ from true absolute measure by 0:1 per centt.        It
is not far from the mean of a somewhat
                                 -        widely differing series of deter
minations by Weber.
    In order to avoid the inconvenience of a fluctuating standard, it is
proposed that the new standard shall mot be called “absolute mea
sure,” or described          as so many   metre, but that it shall receive a
                                          seconds
distinctive name, such as the B.           A. unit, or,   as   Mr. Latimer Clark
suggests, the “Ohmad,” so that,            if
                                       hereafter improved methods of
 determination in absolute measure are discovered or better experi
ments made, the standard need not be changed, but a small coefficient
of correction applied in those cases in which it is necessary to convert
the B. A. measure into absolute measure. Every unit in popular use
has a distinctive name; we say feet or grains, not units of length or
units of weight; and it is in this way only that ambiguity can be
avoided.    There are many absolute measures, according as the foot
and grain, the millimetre and milligramme, the metre and gramme,
&c. are used as the basis of the system.      Another chance of error
arises from the  possibility of a mistake in the decimal multiple used
as standard.     For all these reasons, as well as for convenience of
expression, the writer would be glad if Mr. Clark’s proposal were
adopted and the unit called an Ohmad.
   Experiments have been made for the Committee by Dr. Mat
thiessen, to determine how far the permanency of material standards
may be relied on, and under what conditions wires unaltered in di
mension, in chemical composition, or in temperature change their
resistance.   Dr. Matthiessen has established that in some metals a
partial annealing, diminishing their resistance, does take place, ap
parently due to age only.       Other metals exhibit no alteration of
this kind; and no permanent change due to the passage of voltaic
currents has been detected in any wires of any metal—a conclusion
contrary to a belief which has very generally prevailed.
 . The standard obtained has been expressed in platinum, in a gold
  * This     last number may be 30 per cent. wrong, as the writer has never been in
possession    of an authenticated Jacobi standard, and has only arrived at a rough
                      by
idea of    its value  a   seriesof published values which afford   an indirect com
parison.

   Mr. F. Jenkim     on the New   Unit of Electrical Resistance.     483
silver alloy, in a platinum-silver alloy, in a platinum-iridium     alloy,
and in    mercury.   Two   equal standards have been   prepared  in each
metal; so that should time or accident cause a change in one or
more, this change will be detected by reference to the others. The
experiments and considerations which have led to the choice of the
above materials are fully given in the Report to the British Associa
tion for 1864. The standards of solid metals are wires of from 0:5
millim. to 0.8 millim. diameter, and varying from one to two metres
in length, insulated with white silk wound round a long hollow bobbin,
and then saturated with solid paraffin.     The long hollow form chosen
allows the coils rapidly to assume the temperature of any surround
ing medium, and they can be plunged, without injury, into a bath of
water at the temperature at which they correctly express the standard.
The mercury standards consist of two glass tubes about three-quar
ters of a metre in length.       All these standards are equal to one
another at some temperature stated on each coil, and lying between
 14°5 and 16° 5 C. None of them, when correct, differ more than
 0.03 per cent. from their value at 15°5 C.
    Serious errors have occasionally been introduced into observations
 by resistance at connexions between different parts of a voltaic circuit,
 as perfect metallic contact at these points is often prevented by oxide
 or dirt of some kind. Professor Thomson's method of inserting resist
 ances   in the Wheatstone balance (differential measurer) has been
 adopted for the standards, but in the use of the copies which have
 been issued it has been thought that sufficient accuracy would be
 attained by the use of amalgamated mercury connexions.
     In the standards themselves permanence is the one paramount
 quality to be aimed at ; but in copies for practical use a material
 which changes little in resistance with change of temperature is
 very desirable, as otherwise much time is lost in waiting till coils
 have cooled after the passage of a current; moreover large corrections
 have otherwise to be employed when the coils are used at various
 temperatures; and these temperatures are frequently not known with
 perfect accuracy.     German silver, a suitable material in this respect,
 and much used hitherto, has been found to alter in resistance, in
 some cases,   without any known cause but the lapse of time, since
 the   change has been observed where the wires were carefully protected
 against mechanical or chemical injury. A platinum-silver alloy has
 been preferred by the Committee to German silver for the copies
 which have been made of the standard. These have been adjusted
 by Dr. Matthiessen so as to be correct at some temperature not dif
 fering more than 1° from 15°5 C. The resistance of platinum-silver
 changes about 0.031 per cent. for each degree Centigrade within the
 limits of 5° above and below this temperature; this change is even
 less than that of German silver. The new material seems also likely
  to be very permanent, as it is little affected by annealing. The form
  of the copies is the same as that of the standard, with the exception
  of the terminals, which are simple copper rods ending in an amalga
  mated surface. Twenty copies have been distributed gratis, and
  notices issued that others can be procured from the Committee

for £2 10s. The Committee also propose to verify, at a small charge,
any coils made by opticians, as is done for thermometers and barome
ters at Kew.
  Dr. Matthiessen reports, with reference to the question of repro
duction, that given weights and dimensions of several pure metals
might be employed for this purpose                   if
                                           absolute care were taken.
The reproduction, in this manner, of the mercury unit, as defined by
Dr. Siemens, differs from the standards issued by him in 1864 about
8.2 per thousand if the same specific gravity of mercury be used for
 both observations”.     Each observer uses for his final value the mean
 of several extremely accordant results. It is therefore to be hoped
 that the standard will never have to be reproduced by this or any
 similar method. On the other hand, four distinct observers, with four
 different apparatus, using four different pairs of standards issued re
 spectively by Dr. Siemens and the Committee, give the B. A. unit
as respectively equal to 1-0456, 1-0455, 1-0456, and 1.0457 of Sie
 mens's 1864 unit. It is certain that two resistances can be compared
 with an accuracy of one part in one hundred thousand—an accuracy
wholly unattainable in any reproduction by weights and measures
of a given body, or by fresh reference to experiments on the abso
lute resistance. The above four comparisons, two of which were
 made by practical engineers, show how far the present practice and
requirements differ from those of twenty and even ten years ago,
when, although the change of resistance due to change of tempera
ture was known, it was not thought necessary to specify the tem
perature at which the copper or silver standard used was correct.
The difficulty of reproducing a standard by simple reference to a
pure metal, further shows the unsatisfactory nature of that system
in which the conducting-power of substances is measured by compa
 rison with that of some other body, such as silver or mercury.       Dr.
 Matthiessen has frequently pointed out the discrepancies thus pro
duced, although he has himself followed the same system pending
 the final selection of a unit of resistance.  It is hoped that for the
future this quality of materials will always be expressed as a specific
resistance or specific conducting-power referred to the unit of mass
or the unit of volume, and measured in terms of the standard unit
resistance, that the words conducting-power will invariably be used
to signify the reciprocal of resistance, and that the vague terms good
and bad conductor or insulator will be replaced, in             all
                                                         writings aiming
               accuracy,   by

at  scientific              those exact measurements which can now
made with far greater ease than equally accurate measurements
length.

the only obstacle          its

and of 8 millims. for the usual sizes of the laboratory. The principle
on which I have gone has much analogy with that which guided M.
Isoar, ten or twelve years ago, in his superheated steam-engine,
which consisted in using steam at high pressures, acting on pistons
of small section working with great velocity, and not rubbing against

    The published accounts show that the Orgueil meteor was first
 seen at an altitude greater than 55 miles, that it exploded at an
 altitude of about 20 miles, and that it was descending in a line in
 clined at the least 20° or 25° to the horizon.    The velocity must
 have been not less than 15 or 20 miles   per second.  This example
 affords the strongest proof that the stone-producing meteors and the
 detonating meteors are phenomena not essentially unlike.—Silliman's

          PHENOMENON            IN THE INDUCTION-SPARK.                               BY E. FERNET.
    The disengagement of heat which the induction-spark produces in
 the air exerts upon the path of this spark an influence which seems
 to be shown by the following experiment.
   Two small straight brass rods about 2 decimetres in length, each
 upon an insulating support, are placed almost vertically and parallel
 to each other at a distance of a few centimetres; they are then
moved somewhat apart above, so that they form below a very acute
angle.     They are then both united with the ends of the induction
coil of a Ruhmkorff's apparatus. The sparks which pass at each
oscillation of the commutator appear first, as is natural, between
the two nearest points of the bars—that        the bottom.          is,
                                                              But they    at
soon leave this and appear          higher part, until they reach the
                                                 at   a
highest, when this discharge suddenly ceases.         The spark now
passes below, and the same series      phenomena       repeated.

D  lines, as measured in the third and in the fourth spectrum,
amounts to 2-226,-that between the wave-lengths corresponding

   Fraunhofer has given two different series of values for the
wave-lengths of light. The first series was obtained by mea
surements with wire gratings, and it is upon this that Cauchy

   Comparing these values with the corresponding ones in the
foregoing Table, which                 I
                         will call the series (2), the following
differences        (2–8)
                      obtained:—
                               are
    —1-3, +1-3, +3-6, + 5°2, +8°3, +7°4, + 16-2.
  The differences increase, as will be seen, towards the violet
end of the spectrum, and are there very considerable.     This
arises from the difficulty, when using gratings so coarse as those
employed by Fraunhofer, of accurately distinguishing the dark
lines at the violet end of the spectrum.
                                                                   4, by

I     conclude from this that the disagreement between the
series (a) and (8) must arise principally from errors   observa                 of
tion, which, with the wire gratings used       Fraunhofer, were       by
unavoidable.

      The values of the wave-lengths contained in the series (y)
    depend on measurements of the first interference-spectrum of
    a glass grating which was considerably finer than the one                                           I em
    ployed. According to Fraunhofer's statement, in fact,
                             e=0.0001.223 of a Par. inch.
       Since, however, the number of marks in this grating of Fraun
    hofer's amounted only to 3601, the breadth reduces itself to
                                         5:2833 Par. lines;
    and consequently it must have been considerably less luminous
    than that of Nobert.       In another respect, too, Fraunhofer's
    grating, although an excellent one, appears to me to have been
    inferior to that of Nobert; for the line B could not be mea
    sured even in the first spectrum, and the lines from C to G were
    not visible in any of the spectra beyond the second.
       Nevertheless, since almost                    all
                                        the differences (a—y) have the

    In   a lecture given on October 6, 1860, to the Royal                                          Scien
tific Society of Upsala, I explained a method of determining
the motion of the solar system by observations on the interfer
ence-bands of a glass grating.  I then showed that if we assume
the propagation of the undiffracted rays, passing through the
openings of the grating, to be uninfluenced by the motion of
the instrument, the same must be true of the formation of the
interference-bands on both sides; consequently, also, that when
a telescope is used in the observations the customary aberration
must ensue, and be proportional to the ratio between the motion
of the telescope, in a direction perpendicular to        axis, and the                 its
velocity     light
             of    along this axis.

interference-spectrum        observed, the velocity
                                        is              the telescope               of

sidered as quite decisive.  Last midsummer the weather was
unfavourable to my observations, and at the end of October the
latter were not sufficiently numerous to furnish an answer even
to the first of the above questions.
   I should not in fact have alluded to the subject had not M.
Babinet, in the Academy of Sciences, proposed a method of deter
mining the translatory motion of the solar system identical with
the one which, two years ago, I submitted to the Royal Scientific
Society of Upsala.
   A small difference exists, however, in our calculations. I had
assumed the motion of the grating to have no influence on the
angle 0, whereas Babinet introduces, on this account, the cor
rection

somewhat    more than one-third of that of the earth.       Between
this result, and what we already know of the motion of the solar
system through astronomy, there is no great divergence.
   I hope during the present year, however, to be able to con
tinue my spectrum-experiments, and to have a better opportu
nity of determining, numerically, the magnitude of the motion
of the solar system.  In the present paper my object has merely
been to show the possibility of solving, optically, this interesting
problem in physical astronomy.

               Sir David Brewster on Hemiopsy, or Half. Vision.                                                   505
that there is vision in one-half of the retina, and blindness in
the other.    But this is not the case.   The blindness, or insen
sibility to distinct impressions, exists chiefly in a small portion
of the retina to the right or left hand of the foramen centrale,
and extends itself irregularly to other parts of the retina on the
same side, in the neighbourhood of which the vision is uninjured.
In some cases the upper half of the object is invisible, the part
of the retina paralyzed being a little below the foramen centrale.
On some occasions, in absolute darkness, when a faint glow of
light was produced by some uniform pressure upon the whole
of the retina, I have observed a great number of black spots,
corresponding to parts of the retina upon which no pressure was
exerted.
     Inthe case of ordinary hemiopsy, as observed by myself, there
is neither darkness nor obscurity, the portion of the paper from
which the letters disappear being as bright as those upon which
they are seen. Now this is a remarkable condition of the
retina. While it is sensible to luminous impressions, it is                                                        in

   The two great facts of hemiopsy in both eyes, and of what is
called single vision with two eyes, do not require the hypothesis
of semidecussation to explain them.          If hemiopsy is produced
by the distended blood-vessels of the retina, these vessels must be
similarly distributed in each eye, and similarly affected by any
change in the system; and consequently must produce the same
effect upon each retina, and upon the same part of                                              it.

electricity in electromagnetic measure is exceedingly small; but
when the capacity of the conductor is great, as in the case of
long submarine cables, the charge may be considerable.                By
making use of the electromotive force produced by the friction of
unlike substances, the charge or electrification even of small
bodies may be made to produce visible effects.            The electricity
º
in a  charge  is not  essentially  in   motion,  as is the case with the
electricity in a current. In other words, a charge may be per
manently maintained without the performance of work.                Elec
tricity in this condition is therefore frequently spoken of as sta
tical electricity; and       effects,     its
                                          distinguish them from those

   43. Practical Measurement of Electromotive Force.—The rela
tions expressed by equations (17) and (23) show that in any given
circumstances the force exerted between two bodies due to the
effects of statical electricity will be proportional to the electro
motive force or difference of potential (47) between them. This
fact allows us to construct gauges of electromotive force, or                        in
struments so arranged that a given electromotive force between
two parts of the apparatus brings an index into a sighted posi
tion.    In order that the gauge may serve to measure the electro
motive force absolutely, it is necessary that two things should
 be known,     first, the distribution of the electricity over the two
 attracting or repelling masses (or, in other words, the capacity
 of each part); secondly, the absolute force exerted between them.
 For simple forms, the distribution, or capacity of each part, can
 be calculated from the fundamental principles (33); the force
 actually exerted can be weighed by a balance.        By these means
 Professor W. Thomson* determined the electromotive force of a
 Daniell’s cell to be 0-0021 in British electrostatic units, or
 0.0002951 in metrical electrostatic unitst. This proposition is
 equivalent to saying that two balls of a metre radius, at a dis
 tance d apart in a large open space, and in connexion with the
 opposite poles of a Daniell’s cell, would attract one another with
                   (0.0002951)*                      0.000,000,00888

                               4 d?                                             d?
gramme weighti.
  An apparatus by which such a measurement as the foregoing
can be carried out is called an absolute electrometer. It will be
observed that, although the definition of electromotive force is
founded on the idea of work,                    its
                                  practical measurement   effected              is

ment is of necessity such that the force exerted between two
given parts of the instrument shall be proportional to the differ
ence of potential between them. This force may be variable
and measured by the torsion of a wire, as in Thomson’s reflect
ing electrometer; or it may be constant, and the electromotive
forces producing it may be compared by measuring the distance
required in each case between the two electrified bodies to pro
duce that constant force.   The latter arrangement is adopted in
Professor Thomson's portable electrometer, first exhibited at the
present Meeting of the Association. The indications of a gauge
or electrometer not in itself absolute may be reduced to abso
lute measurement by multiplication into a constant coefficient.

The apparent  effect of absorption is to cause r, the resistance of
the material, to be a quantity variable with the time t, and the
laws of the variation are very imperfectly known.
   46. Eaperimental Determination of the Ratio, v, between Elec
tromagnetic  and Electrostatic Measures of Quantity.—In order
to obtain the value of v, it is necessary and sufficient that we
should obtain a common electrostatic and electromagnetic mea
sure of some one quantity, current, resistance, electromotive
force, or capacity. There are thus five known methods by which
the value can be obtained.
   (1) By a common measure of quantity.      Let a condenser of
known capacity, s, be prepared (40).       Let it be charged to a
given potential P (47). Then the quantity in the condenser will
be sp in electrostatic measure.   The charge can next be mea
sured by discharge through a galvanometer (25) in electromag
netic measure.     The ratio between the two numbers will give
the value of v. The only difficulty in this method consists in
the measurement of the potential Pentailing the measurement
of an absolute force between two electrified bodies.   This method
was  proposed  and  adopted  by Weber”.                 *
   (2) By a comparison of the measure of electromotive force.
The electromotive force produced by a battery, in electrostatic
measure, can be directly weighed (43).     Its electromotive force,
in electromagnetic   measure, can be obtained from the current it
produces in a given resistance (28). The ratio of the two num
bers will give the value of v. This method has been carried out
by Professor W. Thomson, who was not, however, at the time
in possession of the means of determining accurately either the
absolute resistance of his circuit or the absolute value of the
currentf
   (3) By a common measure of resistance.           We know (29 and
45) how to measure resistances in electromagnetic and electro
static measure.     The ratio between these measures is equal to                vº.

                   resistance             in

    52. Heat produced in a Conductor by a Current.—The work
done in driving a current, C, for a unit of time through a con
ductor whose resistance is R, by an electromotive force E, is
EC= RC” (§ 17). This work is lost as electrical energy, and is
transformed into heat.    As Dr. Joule has ascertained the quan
tity of mechanical work equivalent to one unit of heat, we can
calculate the quantity of heat produced in a conductor in a given
time, if we know C and R in absolute measure.      In the metrical
series of units founded on the metre, gramme, and second, if we
call the total heat 0, taking as unit the quantity required to
raise one gramme of water one degree Centigrade, we have

     In   the British     system, founded on feet, grains, and seconds,
with a unit of heat equal to the quantity required to raise one
grain of water one degree Fahrenheit, we must substitute the
number 24861 for 4157 in the above equation.
   53. Electrochemical Equivalents.--Dr. Faraday has shown”
that when an electric current passes through certain substances
and decomposes them, the quantity of each substance decom
posed is proportional to the quantity of electricity which passes.
Hence we may call that quantity of a substance which is decom
posed by unit current in unit time the electrochemical equiva
lent of that substance.
   This equivalent is a certain number of grammes of the sub
stance.   The equivalents of different substances are in the pro
portion of their combining-numbers;       and if     chemical com              all
pounds were electrolytes, we should        able    construct experi

  The energy thus lost appears during the combination as heat

522     Prof. Maxwell and                 Mr. F. Jenkin             on the       Elementary
tions is very wide.   We have to measure the intrinsic energy of
substances as dependent on volume, temperature, and state of
combination.    When this is done, the energy due to any combi
nation will be found by subtracting the energy of the compound
from that of the components before combination.
   As the tendency to increase in volume is measured as pressure,
and as the tendency to part with heat is measured by the tempe
rature, so in chemical dynamics the tendency to combine will be
properly measured by the electromotive force of combination.

   56. Note to the Table of Dimensions, by Professor Clerk Maa
well.—All the measurements of which we have hitherto treated
are supposed to be made in the same medium—ordinary air;
but Faraday has shown that other media have different proper
ties.  Paramagnetic bodies, such as oxygen and salts of iron,
when placed in media less paramagnetic than themselves, behave
as paramagnetic bodies; but when placed in media more para
magnetic than themselves, they behave as diamagnetic bodies.
   Hence magnetic phenomena are influenced by the nature of
the medium in which the bodies are placed, and the system of
units and of measurements which we adopt depends on the
nature of the medium in which our experiments are made.       If
we made our   experiments in highly  condensed oxygen, magnets
would attract each other less, and currents would attract each
other more, than they do in common air; and the reverse would
be the case if we worked in a sea of melted bismuth.
   Now if we take into account the “coefficient of magnetic
induction” of the medium in which we work, and instead of
assuming that of common air to be unity, assume it proportional
to the density of that part of the medium to which the mag
netic action is due, we shall have the repulsion of two poles
            I
=#.             where         mm'    are the two poles, u the density                     of the
magnetic medium, and r the distance.                              Now a density is a mass,
                   *
M1, divided by Lº, the unit of volume.                            Hence the dimensions of
777   are
            V                 ; or   if we     can     measure the density     of the mag
netic medium in the same unit of mass as that employed                                            for
other purposes,               the dimensions of              m   will be simply #. those
of H        will      then   be;     ora     velocity.

   The electromagnetic unit of quantity of electricity is equal to
the electrostatic unit multiplied by a certain velocity, depending
on the elasticity of the magnetic medium, and proportional or
probably equal to the velocity of propagation of vibrations in                                                  it.

 measure     of  the erosive force.          He says “the          weight       ero                                or

  does not erode; weight             motion will.

water is heated nearly to boiling, and sodium-amalgam added,
the nascent hydrogen is almost entirely consumed; and if neu
tralization and solution of the acid are prevented by the gradual
addition of hydrochloric acid, the following changes occur: the
liquid smells strongly of           bitter almonds; during the ad

     When monosulphide of ethyle and iodide of ethyle are heated
together under suitable conditions, Won Oefelek has found that
they combine and form a compound crystallizing in small laminae
which contains the elements of one atom of sulphide of ethyle
and one atom of iodide of ethyle.        Its chemical deportment leads
                                              º
to the view that it is the iodide of a radical consisting of three

 calls Triethylsulfine. The body can also be obtained by distilling
 a mixture of alcoholic solution of monosulphide of potassium with
 iodide of ethyle.
     When the aqueous solution of the iodide is treated with nitrate
 of silver, iodide of silver is at once precipitated, and the solution
 contains nitrate of triethylsulfine; or if it is treated with freshly
 precipitated oxide of silver, iodide of silver is obtained with hy

 filtered off from the iodide of silver has a strongly alkaline reac

 metals just as does potash, and, when evaporated in the exsiccator
 or in a vacuum, yields a crystalline body. It so readily attracts
 moisture that an analysis could not be made.           Its salts are ob
 tained by neutralization with the corresponding acid; they
 are difficult to crystallize, and are very deliquescent.        A plati

   Oefele has also found” that when monosulphide of ethyle is
gradually added to fuming nitric acid, an energetic action ensues,

    Linnemann+ has continued his investigations of benzophe     f
none, Gº H199, the acetone corresponding to benzoic acid. He
finds that benzoate of lime, when distilled with lime, yields this
body along with benzole in about the proportion of two of the
latter for one of the former.     Benzophenone has a great ten
dency to crystallization, and is readily obtained in large crystals.
It unites with bromine, but not without the formation of hydro
bromic acid, and the bodies formed are not of a very- definite
nature.
    Linnemann had previously found that by the action of nascent
hydrogen on benzophenone a body was formed which he called
Benzhydrole, and assigned to it the formula C*H* 9, which sub
sequent analyses show ought to be C*H* 9.            This body has
many of the properties of a monatomic alcohol, but differs in
that, when oxidized (as, for example, by chromic acid) it repro
 duces benzophenone, and not an aldehyde.       If the benzhydrole
is treated by strong nitric acid, oxidation first takes place, form
ing benzophenone, which is then converted into binitrobenzophe
none, C18H3 (N92)? 0.
    Benzophenone thus behaves exactly like acetone. That sub
 stance, when treated by nascent hydrogen, yields an alcohol
 isomeric but not identical with propylic alcohol, and called ac
 cordingly isopropylic alcohol. This isopropylic alcohol when
 oxidized yields the body acetone from which it was formed,
 instead of propylic aldehyde as is the case with ordinary pro
 pylic alcohol. Benzhydrole also differs in another important
 respect from ordinary alcohol, inasmuch as it readily forms with
 bromine bibrominated benzhydrole, C*H"Brº 9. This body con
 sists of a light glistening white mass, which is seen, under the
microscope,  to consist of small acicular crystals.
   Benzhydrole resembles the alcohols in that it                    readily forms
compound ethers; it differs in that, as yet, it has                 not been pos
sible to form a chloride or iodide of the alcohol.                  The action of
the chloride of phosphorus is simply a withdrawal                   of water with

  the zinc. Two of the bodies produced are allylic and propylic
  alcohol, which remain dissolved in the aqueous solution of chlo
  ride of zinc.; besides these, there is an insoluble substance which
  partly forms a deposit and partly is dissolved in an ethereal layer
  which floats on the liquid.    By exhausting the entire liquid with
  ether, the whole of this substance is obtained in solution.
     The solution of chloride of zinc containing the two aleohols
  was distilled, and the distillate dehydrated by carbonate of pot
  ash and again distilled, and this distillate dehydrated by anhy
  drous sulphate of copper.       In this way a volatile liquid was
  obtained, consisting of about one volume of propylic and six of
  allylic alcohol. It was impossible to separate these completely
 by fractional distillation, for their boiling-points are so near,
 though ample evidence of the identity of the two substances
 was obtained from their reactions; and to effect the complete
 separation, the mixed alcohols were treated by hydriodic acid, by
 which they were converted into iodides. Iodide of allyle, C*H*I,
 readily unites with mercury to form a compound, C*H*I Hg”,
 while iodide of propyle is unaffected by mercury: advantage
 was taken of this deportment to separate the two iodides.
     The properties of the iodide of allyle were found identical
 with those of that prepared from glycerine.         From the iodide
 of propyle, Gº H” I, propylic alcohol was obtained identical with
 that obtained from acetone, and which is therefore isopropylic
 alcohol.
     The ethereal solution contained the above-mentioned insoluble
 substance, and also some chlorine and sulphur organic com
 pounds. When, however, the ethereal solution was evaporated,
 these latter became carbonized and completely decomposed; and
 hence the first purification consisted in distilling and redistill
 ing the liquid until it passed over without decomposition.       An
 oily liquid was left, which could not be obtained of quite con
 stant boiling-point; freshly distilled it is colourless, but rapidly
 becomes brown on standing, and has a peculiar camphorous odour.
 It has the formula C* H190°, and stands to acroleine in the
 same relation that pinakone and benzpinakone do respectively
 to acetone and benzophenone, thus,

The chemical relations of this new substance, to which the name
acropinakone is provisionally assigned, have not yet been com
pletely examined, and the author is still engaged upon the sub
ject. His researches show that the action of the hydrogen from
an acid solution on acroleine gives rise to three bodies, whose
formation may be thus collated:—                                   *

   Linnemann” has also found that pinakone exists in two iso
meric modifications—a liquid one, which boils at 176° or 177°,
and dissolves in water, from which it soon separates as a crystal
line hydrate; the solid pinakone is a snow-white crystalline mass
which melts at 35° to 38°, gradually softening first, and boils at
171° to 172°. The distillate is a colourless thickish liquid,
which soon solidifies.  Both these modifications unite with water
and form one and the same hydrate, C*H*@*-F6Aq; pinakone
forms besides, as Fittig has shown, several hydrates.

   Friedeli has now found that the synthesis of acetone can also
be accomplished by another reaction, in which he makes use of
chloracetene, Gº Hº Cl, the interesting body obtained by Harnitz
Harnitzskyu, by the action of phosgene gas on aldehyde. When
this substance acts upon methylate of sodium, chloride of sodium
is formed and acetone; thus,
            C*H8 Cl-HC H8Na 0–NaCl-HC9H69.
A  quantity of sodium corresponding to the chloracetene was dis
solved in methylic alcohol and the excess evaporated.    On gra
dually adding chloracetene to the mixture, kept cool, a brisk
reaction was established, chloride of sodium was formed, and,
when the mass was distilled, a distillate was obtained consisting
of acetone mixed with a little methylic alcohol. As the boiling
points of the two liquids are very close, separation could not be
effected by fractional distillation, and the mixture was accord
ingly treated by permanganate of potash, by which methylic
alcohol is oxidized very much more readily than acetone. In this

with marsh-gas, and has thus artificially prepared acetic acid, and

obtained which passes over between 184°–188°, and is the sub

Freshly distilled it is almost inodorous; but exposed to the mois

         the Properties of Liquefied Hydrochloric                                                    Acid Gas.”
By George Gore, Esq.
    In a former communication to the Royal Society “On the Proper
ties of Liquefied Carbonic Acid,” printed in the Philosophical Trans
actions for 1861 (also in the Journal of the Chemical Society, vol.
                             I
xv., page 163)*, described a mode of manipulation whereby various
solid substances were introduced into that liquefied gas whilst under
very great pressures (varying from 500 to 1100 pounds per square
inch), and the action of the liquid upon them observed.
    The experiments described in the present paper were made in a
similar manner, but with some improvements in safety of manipu
lation, and in the mode of discharging the tubes, so as to recover the
immersed solids in a satisfactory state.
   The glass tubes in which the gas was condensed were about <U+017F>ººths
of an inch internal diameter, and fully #ths of an inch externalia.
meter.     Each tube was, before bending, 11% inches long; it was
bent, at 1% inch and 6% inches respectively from one end, to the form
already described in the paper referred               thus giving          to,

of gas will  convey the sulphuric acid into the short end of the tube,
and   endanger   the purity of the liquefied hydrochloric acid.       The
action of the acid was less violent than when generating carbonic
acid, and the process was less frequently stopped by clogging of the
tube.    The liquefied gas was condensed in contact with the various
solid bodies by application (from behind) of cotton wool, wetted
with ether, to the short end of the tube, as in the former experiments.

of sesquicarbonate of ammonia swelled and became full of fissures
in the gaseous acid, but neither evolved gas nor dissolved when the

   Potassium evolved no gas when the liquid acid came into contact

intermittent immersion the saline residue showed no signs of contain

hydrous carbonate of potash in powder evolved no gas on first coming
into contact with the liquid acid; after three days' occasional immer

potassium did not dissolve or change in appearance by four hours'

of ammonia in   powder  became  yellowish green in the gas;  it became
grass-green in colour in the liquefied acid, but did not dissolve in
four days. Sesquioxide of chromium in powder did not dissolve in
six days, but became of a dull blackish-brown colour. A fragment of
anhydrous yellow chromate of potash became red before the gas
liquefied, but did not dissolve or otherwise alter in the liquid acid.
Sesquioxide of uranium became of a paler yellow colour in the gas,
but did not dissolve in the liquid acid in six days; the residue was
entirely soluble in water.   Precipitated black oxide of manganese in
powder, and free from water, became quite white in the gas; it re
mained white in the liquid acid without evolving visible bubbles of
gas, and did not lessen in bulk in seven days.    A crystal of perman
ganate of potash softened and swelled in the liquid acid, but did not
dissolve in five days; it remained of a dark colour; the residue
placed in distilled water produced no coloration.
   A crystal of metallic arsenic remained perfectly bright and un
changed in bulk during three days’ immersion.       Arsenious acid in
powder quickly liquefied in the gas, and dissolved to a colourless
solution in the liquid acid.  A crystal of arsenic acid softened before
the gas liquefied, and dissolved quickly and freely in the liquid acid
to a colourless solution.    Bisulphide of arsenic in powder did not
dissolve in six days, but became slightly less red and more yellow;
a slight yellowish-white   sublimate occurred in the tube during the

 . Mr. Wallace then stated that Arragonite     is produced only after
the strata are traversed by joints, and that the branched Arragonite
very rarely occurs, being found only in caverns and old workings.
Two of these caverns have come under his notice, and were de
scribed in detail; one of them is in the north vein of the Silver Band
Mine, and the other near one of the principal veins of the Dufton
Fell Mine. Finally he discussed the causes and conditions neces

conclusion that the theory of a circulation, through the pores of the
spar, of fluids holding                  its

55' 60 per cent. of silicates; and taking into account the water deter
mined by Cloéz, the oxygen ratio of the silicate is that of serpentine.
If the alumina is due to anorthite, it will give 2:42 per cent. of this
felspar contained in the meteorite.       Subsequent observations by
Des Cloizeaux, Pisani, Daubrée, and Cloéz prove that this remark
able meteorite contains minute rhombohedral crystals of a double
carbonate of magnesia and iron, and Cloéz obtained a little more

operated upon.—Silliman's American Journal for March 1865.
NOTE ON THE PROPAGATION OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH METALLIC
  WAPOURS PRODUCED BY THE VOLTAIC ARC.   BY A. DE LA RIVE,
   In following out my investigations upon the propagation of elec
tricity in greatly rarefied elastic fluids, I have been led to study this
propagation in the vapours of various metals.
   The apparatus that I make use of for this purpose consists of a
large glass balloon, furnished with four tubulures and supported
on a foot.    The two tubulures at the extremities of the horizontal

 metal balls, between which passes at the same time the electric jet of

copper, aluminium, zinc, cadmium, and magnesium, and between two
points  of gas-coke, all these materials being capable               acquiring       of                       a

whitish green. With coke-points the colour of the jet is bright blue,
which becomes bluish when the arc ceases; this is due to the pro
duction of a little carburetted hydrogen gas, as I have ascertained
directly.
   It is in the upper part of the balloon, to which the metallic vapours
 produced by the voltaic arc ascend, that these effects are most dis
 tinct. The streaks or stratifications of the electric light are still
 more marked in these vapours than in rarefied gases.
    The augmentation of the intensity of the jet is most considerable
 in the vapours of silver and copper. The galvanometer passes sud
 denly from 30° to 60° at the moment when the jet indicates, by                                                          its

 APPLICATION of THE ELECTRIC LIGHT (GEIssLER’s TUBEs)                                          For
       LIGHTING UNDER WATER.    B.Y. M. PAUL GERWAIS.
    Of late years the electric light has been used for illumination
 under water.     In the Channel and in the Mediterranean attempts
 were made by means of water-tight receivers of glass, in which
works a regulator for bringing in contact carbons made incandescent
by a battery, the elements of which are on board a vessel on which
the trials are made. The part serving as lantern is sunk under water.
   In some cases these attempts have been successful, and the light
thus produced has been utilized either for submarine works or in
fishing, which this method seemed to render more productive by
attracting the fish.    Yet the use of such apparatus is costly, and the
manipulation     difficult; moreover the light is in many cases too
bright, and, besides, the entire arrangement is liable to numerous
accidents, such as, for instance, the spilling of the liquid owing to
the motions of the vessel.
   There are, moreover, circumstances in which a less brilliant light
is sufficient and even preferable.   It would, therefore, be useful to
construct an apparatus capable of working under water, and such
that its total immersion would not stop its working. I thought that
these results might be arrived at by means of Geissler's tubes, placing
them in connexion with an exhausted receiver containing the ele
ments of a battery and a coil for producing the electrical current by
which these tubes are made luminous; and M. Ruhmkorff has con
structed for me the following apparatus : —
   Our receiver is a sort of bronze box mounted on four small feet,
 and the cover of which is made to              hermetically by means
                                                       fit                                         of
