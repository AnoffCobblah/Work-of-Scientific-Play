         I.  On Waters distilled from inodorous Plants*.
 il/VERT plant whatever        has a decided smell peculiar to it
 self ; in some, however, it is so feeble that it is scarcely per
ceptible. This is certainly the reason why at one time plants
were divided into odorous and inodorous : the former were
regarded     as enjoying many more properties than the latter ;
and for this reason, much more confidence was placed in
those medicines prepared from odorous than from inodorous
 vegetables.
    It must    be admitted that the opinion formed on this sub
ject   is not absurd ; in fact, it is impossible to lay aside the
 idea, that a substance which affects the organ of smelling in
 a remarkable manner, should also produce upon the animal
 oeconomy a more remarkable influence than a substance
 which emits little or no smell      :  as a necessary  consequence
 of this reasoning,    we ought to conclude that waters distilled
 from inodorous plants have no virtue, and do not differ from
 common distilled water. Many medical men are even so
 convinced      that the above ideas are correct, that they never
 prescribe    such waters    as may be distilled from inodorous
 plants,    but   always substitute infusions       or decoctions of
  them.
    Some particular observations, however, seem to ascertain
 that the kind of proscription which has been denounced
 against waters distilled from inodorous plants is ill founded ;
 and,    if they have been often remarked to have no effect, it
 has been because the requisite precautions were not used in
 their preparation'.
    It   remains, then, to ascertain the mode of preparation

 necessary     to be adopted,      and    in this  the  chief object to be
 attended to is to collect as much as possible             of the aroma of
 the plants which are submitted to distillation.                 Several ex-
 periments were made with this view, and they were attended
 with the most happy results.
    Among all         the processes      employed, that of cohobating
 and recohobating the first distilled water            of  the plant upon
 fresh quantities of the same plant seemed to be the most
 successful.       In fact, it was thought that, an inodorous plant
 only containing a small quantity of aroma, the first water
 distilled could never be very rich in the odorous principle,
 since the plant could only furnish the small quantity be
 longing to it; but if the distillation is repeated with the first
 distilled water and a new quantity of plants, the produce of
 this second distillation ought necessarily to have more odour
 than the first ; and for the same reason, by means of a third
 distillation,    and    even   a fourth,     we may be able to saturate
 the water with aroma, which then not only acquires a sen
 sible taste and smell, but also acts differently when ysed for
 medicinal purposes from the water obtained by one distilla-
 tion only.
    For    several    years   past   I .have   prepared    distilled waters
 by the above       method, and        I  always obtained results         con
formable to the above            theory.      Latterly  I have added new
proofs to those I had already acquired, and the establish
ment of the imperial laboratory, in particular, furnished me
with these opportunities. Being under the necessity of pro
viding all the medicines for that institution, and also of at
tending to their preparation with the utmost exactitude, I
invited M. Clairon, my assistant in the laboratory, to lend
me his aid in the project          I   had conceived      of distilling, in
the most careful manner, such plants as are thought                   inodo
rous.     We     stopped the operation from time to time, in order
to introduce        such   modifications      and  improvements        as  oc
curred to us from reflections during the operation.                  Conse
quently, twenty-five         inodorous plants were first distilled in
the usual     way;     the produce     of each distillation was after
wards cohobated, and recohobated                 upon fresh      portions of
plants ; and we always stopped              the operation when we dis
                                                                    covered

Covered             produce which came from the beak of
             that the
the alembic began to differ from that first distilled.    Fre
quently  we    even  submitted    the water we had   thus  re
peatedly distilled, to a distillation in B. M., and drew off
only a small portion of it for the purpose of ascertaining if
by this means we could obtain an article richer in the odo
rous principle ; and, finally,               we had         sometimes    recourse   to
four successive cohobations with the same view.                            The fol
lowing is the conclusion we formed :
     Three cohobations were sufficient to saturate the water with
all the aroma  of the plants distilled ; after which, further di
stillations were of no service,                  as   the   produce was not in
creased in the odorous quality.
     All   our distilled waters had          a    peculiar taste, and the smell
of   the plants made use          of :   the latter was very strong.      Some
few of them were muddy, but the greatest part of them were
perfectly transparent. One thing we remarked which ap
peared very extraordinary to us ; namely, that the smell of
several    of   these waters      was so very pungent, that one would
have thought          some   of   them had been prepared from coch-
learia     or horse-radish root.             I   shall particularly notice, by
way of example, the water distilled from the flower of little
centaury. We know that this flower, even when fresh ga
thered, has scarcely any perceptible odour : upon being di
stilled, however, it furnished us with a smell so pungent
that we could hardly support it.  This water, upon the third
distillation, came off thick, and we perceived upon its- sur
face some molecules of a thickish oil of a white colour, hav
ing a very bitter pungent taste.
   Waters prepared in the manner                      I   have stated,   are not all
equally preserved in good condition : some of them soon
undergo an alteration : this is the case, in particular, with
water of borage.  M. Clairon had occasion to remark, that
fifteen days after its preparation it began                      to lose its trans
parency, and a heap of mucous threads was formed in the
middle of   which very soon fell to the bottom and ap
                it,
peared like very slender magma, which was set in motion
                 a
by   the smallest      shaking of the vessel                :   the water then ac-

quired a very disagreeable smell, a little similar to that of
an animal substance which had begun to putrefy.          I also
particularly observed that this effect was more evident when
the water was kept in transparent bottles exposed to the light,
than when kept in such as were opake and placed in the
dark ; and lastly, that by separating, by the filter and syphon,
the magma which was formed, and afterwards exposing the
water for some hours to the air, the putrid smell was en
tirely got rid of, and that of the borage was restored. I shall
not now speak of the cause which determines the putrefac
tion of some distilled waters, but there is one circumstance
,which    I
         ought not to omit ; namely, that all waters which
are subject to alteration should not only never be kept                         in
transparent vessels exposed to the light, but that such ves
sels should never be sealed hermetically.
   The duration of waters distilled from inodorous plants is
rarely more than a year. At this age the smell becomes con
siderably weaker, and soon afterwards it disappears almost
entirely.  A careful apothecary ought therefore to renew his
stock of distilled waters every year : without this precaution
their effects in medicine cannot be depended on.
  But to return to the question now before us, whether
waters distilled from inodorous plants have such decided pro
perties   as   to entitle them to be introduced into practice.
Upon this subject           I   thinkcan be no possibility of
                                         there
doubt,    if   we admit that aroma in general, whatever is the
nature    of the     substance    which supplies      it,   acts in   a    certain
manner upon the animal ceconomy      thus, as    :  proved      it    is
that we can procure the aroma of any plant, however in
odorous, in such quantity as to make
                        a               perceptible to the
                                                     it
smell,    must necessarily follow that the water thus im
          it
pregnated will produce effects proportioned to the quantity
and quality of the aroma     contains.
                                    it   In short, the above
reasoning      is   completely proved       by
                                            actual experiments.
    Of several       distilled waters, the effects of which  haveI             as
certained,    shall content myself here with describing the
               I
properties of  the water distilled from lettuce. How often
have we heard that this water enjoyed no property whatever                          !
                                                                               It

            On Waters distilled from inodorous Plants.             1
It   is nevertheless  certain that its properties are very remark
able, particularly when it is prepared by successive cohoba-
tions.      I know a lady who is extremely nervous, and who
never fails, when she has occasion for a sedative,       to take, at
bed-time, two or three ounces of well distilled lettuce water:
this has always the same effect as liquid laudanum, which
she had formerly used in great quantities.
     But if   the water distilled from lettuce possesses some    in
fluence, why may not the same result from all the other in
odorous plants ? Thus, when I hear it maintained that the
waters produced from centaury, argentine, pellitory,          purs
lane, orpine, &c. ought to be dismissed from our dispensa
tories, I conclude that those who are of this opinion have
never employed these waters when properly prepared, or
have not accurately     noticed their effects.
     Waters distilled from inodorous plants are not only useful
 in medicine,     but in the arts also they are often employed to
 advantage.
      I shall take the present opportunity of quoting an obser
 vation communicated to me by M.Despres, a distinguished
 chemist of Paris, and to whom we may pay so much the
 more credit, as that gentleman adds to an extensive know
 ledge, the most scrupulous probity and the most perfect
  correctness. I understand from him, that not only has he
 successfully employed as medicines the above kind of di
 stilled waters, but that even the manufacturers of gauze, who
  are very     numerous in Paris, could never give their gauzes
  that lustre, brilliance, and consistency, for which they are
  so eminent,     but by macerating them in the distilled water of
  argentine (pentaphylloides, argenteum alatum, seu potent ilia) .
  M.Despres added, that his servants, having substituted com
  mon distilled water in place of the above water, the manu
  facturers came to him to complain that they had been im
  posed upon. We must certainly admit that argentine is not
  a very odorous plant ; nevertheless,       if the water produced
  from it has a decided action upon the silk of which the gauze
  is made, we need not longer doubt that it acts also upon
   the animal ceconomy, and that its effects ought to differ
   from those produced by common distilled water.

8          Process     for    Dyeing the Adrianople or Turkey Red.
    From all this it results :
    1. That it is very ill* judged                       to proscribe the        medicinal
use     of waters distilled from plants                    called inodorous.
   2. That these waters have decidedly constant properties.
   3. That these properties are the more decided, the more
they contain of the aroma of the plant,
  4. That the proper method is to cohobate upon fresh
plants thrice or even four times the produce first distilled.
   5. That the waters thus procured ought always to be pre
served       in    vessels    not capable          of being       traversed by the rays
of light.
  6. That it is necessary to clear these waters from the flaky
deposits which appear soon after distillation.
     7.That, considering the short duration of these waters in
a state of perfection, it is indispensably necessary for the apo
thecary to renew his stock of them once a year.
   8. Lastly, that it is desirable that physicians, profiting
by the facts which have been now laid before them, would
turn their attention to the discovery of new ones.          Their
experiments on this subject will be extremely useful, because
they will contribute to destroy the prejudice which main
tained, that, waters distilled from inodorous plants having no
action upon the animal oeconomy, their use ought to be
proscribed.

ONE of my friends, the proprietor of a dye-house at Astra-

process for dyeing Turkey red. On Saturday, after the cot
ton yarn has undergone those preliminary preparations al
ready mentioned*,    it is immersed, for the first time, in fish
grease or fish oil, which   is made into a lather by a solution
of      soda   :   heaped up in this bath, where                    it   heats sensibly,     it

is left till Monday, when it is washed, dried, re-immersed in
this oily emulsion or saponaceous mass, and again suspended
in   the air.    The    same operation is repeated on Tuesday for
the third time.         The four following days it is washed four
times in lye made of a solution of pure soda.             After that it
receives the first tint of olive green with the leaves of su
mach (rlitis cotinus) : 1 23 lb. of these leaves (for which nut-
galls may be substituted) to about 140 gallons of water,
 boiled in a cauldron, are sufficient for 330lbs. of cotton yarn.
To this decoction, after being well boiled, strained, and the
 boiler cleaned of all extraneous        matter, are added 33 lbs. of
 alum.      The yarn is then divided into skains, and placed in
 little pots or saucers in this boiler and boiled ; after which it
 is sufficiently prepared for the red dve. To prepare this bath,
 take 33 lb. of madder roots (rubia tinctorum) , ground, to
 each 33 lbs. of yarn (less madder will do if it be of the
 best quality).       The madder is then kneaded in about seven
 quarts of blood, with which it is well boiled in the cauldron :
  the yarn is afterwards immersed in this boiled colour, and the
  boiling continued until it is well penetrated by the colouring
  particles.     The coloured stuff is then dried, and afterwards
  put into pots full of weak alkaline lev, in which it is slightly
  boiled. In this latter process the alkaline liquor is constantly
  kept of equal strength by the addition of fresh lye being regu
  larly added. The cotton yarn, when cleaned"and dried, is then
  found perfectly dyed. This series of operations generally con
  tinues   21 days.    It is said that the Turks, to give it a brighter
  or deeper colour, finish by plunging it again in an oily emul
   sion, and that they leave it to dry under a press.        They also
  use oil of olives instead of fish oil.      In general, all unctuous
   or greasy fluids, that will lather perfectly with a solution of
   soda, are equally proper for this dye. The madder which has
   small roots is considered the best.         Thirty-three pounds of
   kelp or crude soda (kalakar) are generally enough for a
   boiler containing 140 gallons of water. Todye4olbs. of
   cotton, take    15 lbs. of sumach, 4 lbs. of alum, 58 lbs. offish
   oil,  40 lbs.  of   crude soda or kelp, 40lbs. of madder, two
   cauldrons and four alkaline vats.

 III.  Account  of a   Series of Experiments, showing the Effects
    of Compression     in modifying the Action of Heat.         By Sir
    JAMES HALL, Bart. F.R.S.             Land,   and Edin.

 V. Experiments in which Water was employed to increase
    the Elasticity of the included Air. — Cases of complete
    Compression. — General Observations. — Some Experiments
   affording interesting Results; in particular, showing a
   mutual Action between Silex and the Carbonate of Lime.
P INDING      that such benefit arose from the increase        of elas
ticity given to the included air in the last-mentioned experi
ments by the diminution of its quantity, it now occurred to
me, that a suggestion formerly made by Dr. Kennedy, of
using water to assist the compressing force, might be fol
lowed with advantage ; that, while sufficient room was al
lowed for the expansion of the liquid metal, a re-acting
force, of any required amount, might thus be applied to the
carbonate. In this view I adopted the following mode,
which, though attended with considerable difficulty in ex
ecution,   I  have often practised       with success.     The weight
of  water required to be introduced into the barrel was added
to a small piece of chalk or baked clay, previously weighed.
The piece was then dropped into a tube of porcelain of about
an inch in depth, and covered with pounded chalk, which
was firmly rammed upon it.          The tube was then placed in
the cradle    along with the subject of experiment, and the
whole was plunged into the fusible metal, previously poured
into the barrel, and heated so as merely to render it liquid.
The metal being thus suddenly cooled, the tube was encased
in a solid mass before the heat had reached the included
moisture.     The difficulty was to catch the fusible metal at
the proper temperature ; for when it was so hot as not to
fix in a few seconds, by the contact of the cradle and its
contents, the water was heard to bubble through the metal
and escape.      I  overcame this difficulty,       however, by first
heating   the   breech    of  the barrel     (containing   a sufficient
quantity  of fusible metal) almost        to redness,    and then set
            1                                                      ting

                                                                         '

ting it into a vessel full of water till the temperature had
sunk to the proper pitch, which I knew to be the case
when the hissing noise, produced in the water by the heated
barrel, ceased ; the cradle, during the last stage of this ope
ration, being held close to the muzzle of the barrel, and
ready to be thrust into it.
   On the 2d of May I made my first experiment in this
way, using the same air-tube as in the la3t experiment,
which was equal in capacity to one-thirtieth of a cubic inch.
Half    grain of water was introduced in the manner just de
        a
scribed. The barrel, after an hour -of red heat, was let down
by a rope and pulley, which I took care to use in all experi
ments in which            there   was any appearance        of danger.   All
was sound.        The     metals rushed out smartly,          and a flash    of
flame       accompanied the discharge.   The upper pyrometer
gave 24°, and the lower one 14°.      The contents of the inner
tube had lost less than           1           strictly 0-84. The car
                                       per cent.,
bonate was       in   a state     of
                                   good  limestone   ; but the heat had
been too feeble       :   the lower part of the chalk in the little tube
was not agglutinated : the chalk round the fragment of pipe-
stalk (used to introduce the water), which had been more
heated than the pyrometer, and the small rod, which had
moulded itself in the boll of the stalk, were in a state of
marble.
  On the 4th of May I made an experiment like the last,
but with the addition of P05 grains water. After appli
cation of heat, the fire was allowed to burn out till the barrel
was black.       The      metal was discharged irregularly.         Towards
the end, the inflammable air produced, burnt at the muzzle,
with a lambent flame, during some time, arising doubtless
from hydrogen gas, more or less pure, produced by the de
composition of the water. The upper pyrometer indicated
36°, and the lower one 1 9°. The chalk which lay in the
outer part of the large tube was in a state of marble. The
inner tube was united to the outer one by a star of fused
matter, black at the edges, and spreading all round, sur
rounding one of the fragments of porcelain which had fallen
by accident in between the tubes. The inner tube, with the
starry matter adhering to               it,   but without the coated    frag

  ment, seemed to have           sustained    a loss  of  12 per cent, on
  the original carbonate       introduced.      But,   the substance  sur
  rounding the fragment being inappreciable, it was impossible
  to learn what loss had been really sustained.                Examining
  the little tube,     I found its edges clean, no boiling over hav
  ing taken place.         The top of the small lump of chalk had
 sunk much.          When the little tube was broken, its contents
 gave proof of fusion in some parts, and in others of the
 nearest     approach' to it. A strong action of ebullition had
 taken     place   all round, at the contact of the tube with the
 carbonate : in the heart the substance               had a transparent
 granular texture, with little or no crystallization.           The small
 piece of lump-chalk was united and blended with the ram
 med powder, so that they could scarcely be distinguished.
 In   the lower part     of the carbonate, where the heat must have
 been weaker, the rod          had    acted  more feebly on the tube,
 and was detached from it         :  here the substance was firm, and
 was     highly marked in the fracture with crystalline facettes.
 Wherever the carbonate touched the tube, the two substances
exhibited, in their mixture,          much greater proofs of fusion
than could be found in the pure carbonate. At one place, a
stream      of this compound        had penetrated   a  rent in the inner
tube, which it had filled completely, constituting a real vein,
like those of the mineral kingdom ; which is still distinctly
to be seen in the specimen.             It had then spread itself upon
the outside of the inner tube to the extent of half an inch in
diameter, and had enveloped the fragment of porcelain al
ready mentioned.            When pieces of the compound were
thrown into nitric acid, some effervesced, and some not.
    I  repeated this experiment on the same day with two grains
of water.       The furnace being previously hot,            I continued
the fire during one half-hour           with the muffle open, and an
other with      a cover   upon it.     I then let the barrel down by
means      of the pulley.    The    appearance   of a large longitudinal
rent made me at first conceive that the experiment was lost,
and the barrel destroyed : the barrel was visibly swelled, and
in swelling had burst the crust of smooth oxide with which
it was surrounded : at the same time no exudation of metal
had happened, and all was sound.              The metals were thrown
                                                                      out

out with more suddenness          and violence than in any former
experiment; hut the rod remained in its place, being secured
by a cord. The upper pyrometer gave 27°, the lower 23°.
The contents of the inner tube had lost 1-5 per cent. The
upper end of the little lump of chalk was rounded and glazed
by fusion ; and the letter which I have been in the habit of
cutting on these small pieces, in order to trace the degree of
action upon them, was thus quite obliterated. On the lower
end of the same lump, the letter is still visible.           Both the
lump    and  the rammed    chalk   were  in  a good  semi-transparent
state, shining a little in the fracture, but with no good fa-
cettes,   and no where appearing to have           acted on the tube.
This    last circumstance is of consequence, since it seems to
show, that this very remarkable action of heat, under com
pression, was performed without the assistance of the sub
stance of the tube, by which, in many other experiments,
a considerable additional fusibility has been communicated
to the carbonate.
   These experiments, and many others made about tlve same
time, with the same success, clearly prove the efficacy of
water in assisting the compression ; and results approaching
to these in quality,    obtained, in some case.s, by means of a
very small    air-tube,  show that the influence of water on this
occasion has been merely mechanical.
    During    the  following summer        and autumn 1803,     I was
occupied with a different branch of this subject, which I
shall soon have occasion to mention.
    In  the early part   of  last year (1804)    I again resumed   the
 sort of experiments lately described, having in view princi
 pally to accomplish absolute compression, in complete imi
 tation of the natural process.       In this pursuit I did not con
fine myself to water, but made use of various other volatile
 substances    in order to assist compression ; namely, carbo
nate of ammonia, nitrate of ammonia, gunpowder, and
paper impregnated with nitre.           With these I obtained some
good results, but none such as to induce me to prefer any
 of these compressors to water. Indeed, I am convinced that
 water is superior to them all.           I found, in several experi
ments, made        with a simple air-tube,      without any artificial
                                      »

compressor, in which         a   very low red heat had been ap
plied, that the carbonate       lost one or one and a half per cent.
Now, as this must have happened           in  a  temperature scarcely
capable   of inflaming     gunpowder,      it  is clear that such loss-
would    not have been prevented         by   its    presence ; whereas
water, beginning far below redness to assume a gaseous
form, will effectually resist any calcination, in low as well as
in high heats.      And as the quantity of water can very easily
be regulated     by weight, its employment             for this purpose
seems liable to no objection.
    On  the 2d   of January    1 804,  I made     an experiment     with
marble and     chalk, with     the addition   of   I-1 grain   of water.
I  aimed   at  a low heat, and the pyrometer, though a little
broken, seemed clearly to indicate 22°. Unluckily, the muz
zle of the large tube, which was closed as usual with chalk,
was placed uppermost,        and exposed to the strongest heat.
I  found it rounded by      fusion,   and in a frothy state.         The
little tube came out very clean, and was so nearly of the
same weight as when put in, that its contents had lost but
0-074 per cent. of the weight of the original carbonate. The
marble was but feebly agglutinated, but the chalk was in a
state of firm limestone, though it must have undergone a
heat under 22°, or that of melting silver.             This experiment
is certainly a most remarkable one, since a heat has been
applied in which the chalk has been changed to hard lime
stone with a loss less than the lOOOdth part of its weight
(exactly nVr)! while, under the same circumstances of pres
sure, though probably with more heat, some of the same
substance     had been brought to fusion.        What     loss of weight
this fused part sustained, cannot be known.
 - On the 4th of January a similar experiment was made
likewise with 1-1 grain of water. The discharge of the me
tal was accompanied with a flash of flame. The pyrometer
indicated 26°.      The little tube came out quite clean. Its
contents had been reduced          from 14-53 to 14-46; difference
0-07 grains ; being 0'47 per cent. on the original carbonate,
less than l-200dth part of the original weight (exactly -j-fr).
The chalk was in a state of firm saline marble, but with no
unusual qualities.
                                                                   These

            Effects  of Heat  modified  by Compression  '.       15
   These two last experiments are rendered still more in
teresting by another set which I made soon after, which
showed that one essential        precaution in a point of such
nicety had been neglected in not previously drying the car
bonate. In several trials made in the latter end of the same
month,     I found, that chalk exposed to a heat above that of
boiling   water,  but quite short of redness, lost 0-34 per cent.,
and in another similar trial 0-46 per cent. Now, this loss
of weight equals within 0-01 per cent., the loss in the last-
mentioned experiment, that being 0-47 ; and far surpasses
that of the last but one, which was but 0-074.             There is
good reason, therefore, to believe, that had the carbonate,
in these two last experiments, been previously dried, it would
have been found during compression to have undergone no
loss.
    The result of many of the experiments lately mentioned
seems    fully to explain   the perplexing discordance between
my experiments with porcelain tubes and those made in
barrels of iron.      With the porcelain tubes, I never could
succeed in a heat above 28°, or even quite up to it ; yet the
results were often excellent      :  whereas the iron barrels have
currently stood firm in heats of 41° or 51°, and have reached
even    to 70° or 80° without injury.      At the same time, the
results, even in those high heats, were often inferior, in
point of fusion, to those obtained by low heats in porcelain.
The reason of this now plainly appears.        In the iron barrels
it  has always been considered as necessary     to use an air-tube,
 in consequence of which some of the carbonic acid has been
 separated from the earthy basis by internal calcination : what
 carbonic acid remained has been more forcibly attracted,
 according to    M. Berthollet's principle, and, of course, more
 easily compressed, than when of quantity sufficient to satu
 rate the lime : but, owing to the diminished quantity of the
 acid, the compound has become less fusible than in the na
 tural state, and, of course, has undergone a higher heat with
 less effect.   The introduction of water, by furnishing       a re
 acting force, has produced a state of things similar to that
 in the porcelain tubes ; the carbonate sustaining little or no
                                                                loss

lossof weight, and the compound retaining its fusibility in
low heats *.
  In      the early part           of 1 804,    some      experiments were made
with      barrels,      which       I wished    to try,    with a view to another
series       of experiments.             The   results    were  interesting to
                                                                     too
be passed over ; for, though                   the carbonic acid in them was
far from being completely' constrained, they afforded some
of the finest examples I had obtained of the fusion of the
carbonate and of its union with silex.
     On      the    13th       of February      an experiment was                made   with
pounded oyster-shells, in a heat of 33°, without any water
being introduced to assist compression.   The loss was ap
parently of 1 2 per cent. The substance of the shell had
evidently been in viscid fusion : it was porous, semi-trans
parent, shining in surface and fracture ; in most parts with
the gloss of fusion, in many others with facettes of crystal
lization.          The little       tube   had been set        with its muzzle up
wards l over           it,
                as usual, lay                   a   fragment of porcelain, and

been evidently     very soft state; for, resting with its weight
                        in   a
on the porcelain, this last had been pressed into the sub
stance       of    the chalk        deeper     than its own breadth,              a   rim   of
chalk being visible without the surface of the porcelain just                         ;
as when the round end of      knife   pressed upon
                                           a           piece of

of the tube,          and had risen round its                 lip,    as some salts       rise
from their solution in water.                    In this manner,      small quan

                   power here ascribed to the porcelain tubes, seems not to
accord with what was formerly mentioned, of the carbonic acid having been
driven through the substance of the tube. But the loss by this means has
probably been so small, that the native properties of the carbonate have not
been sensibly changed    or, perhaps, this penetrability may not be so uni-

accompanying the union of the carbonates                 with the porce-
lain, is here very remarkable.
    On    the 26th   of February I    made an experiment, in          which
the carbonate was        not weighed, and no foreign substance
was introduced to assist the compression.              The temperature
was 46°.         The pyrometer     had been affected     by the contact
of a piece of chalk, with which           it had united ; and some          of
the carbonate must have penetrated the substance of the py
rometer, since this last had visibly yielded to pressure, as
appeared by a swelling near the contact.      I observed in
these experiments that        the carbonate had a powerful action
on the tubes        of Cornish clay, more than on   the pounded
silex.   Perhaps it has  a  peculiar affinity for argil, and this
may lead to important consequences. The chalk had visibly
first shrunk upon itself, so as to be detached from the sides,
and had then begun to run by successive portions, so as still
to leave a pillar in the middle, very irregularly worn away ;
indicating a successive liquefaction, like that of ice, not the
yielding of a mass softening all at once.
   On the 28th of February I made an experiment with
oyster-shell unweighed, finely ground, and passed through
the closest sieves. The pyrometer gave 40°. The piece of
chalk below it had been so soft, as to sink to the depth of
half         into the mouth of the iron air-tube, taking its
       an inch
impression completely.  A small part of this lump was con
taminated with iron, but the rest was in a fine state.  The
tube had a rent      in it,through which the carbonate, united
with     the    matter of the tube, had flowed in two or three
places.        The shell had shrunk upon itself, so as to stand
detached    from the sides, and bore very strong marks of
fusion.    The external surface was quite smooth, and shining
like   an enamel.      The internal     part consisted   of   a   mixture   of
large bubbles and solid parts  the inside of the bubbles had
                                    :
a lustre much superior to that of the outside, and equal to
that of glass. The general mass was semi-transparent   but            ;
small parts were visible      by
                           the lens, which were completely
transparent and colourless.          In   several   places    this smooth
Surface had crystallized,     so as to      present   brilliant     facettes*
steadily shining in certain aspects.        I   observed      one   of   these

facettes on the inside of an air-bubble, in which it inter-*
rupted the spherical form as if the little sphere had been
pressed inwards at that spot, by the contact of a plane sur
face.      In     some    chalk      near the mouth of the large tube,
which lay upon            a stratum    of silex, another very interesting
circumstance occurred.    Connected with its lower end, a
substance was visible, which had undoubtedly resulted from
the union of the carbonate with the silex. This substance
was white and semi-transparent, and bore the appearance
of chalcedony.            The        of chalk, having attached itself
                                   mass
to that above            it,     shrunk upwards, leaving an interval
                               haa
between       it   and the silex, and carrying some of the compound
up with it. From thence this last had been           the act of      in
dropping in    viscid state of fusion, as evidently appeared
                     a
when the specimen was entire, having       stalactite and staa
lagmite corresponding accurately to each other.    Unluckily
I broke off the stalactite, but the stalagmite continues en
tire, in the form         of   a   little cone.    This new      substance   effer

              a
nate.    The shell, fused in the experiment, dissolved entirely
in the acid, with violent              effervescence.
     In the     three last experiments,           and   in   several others made
at the same time, the carbonate had not been weighed   but                   ;
no water being introduced to assist the compression,                             it   is
probable there was much loss by interual calcination   and                   ;
owing doubtless  to this the carbonates have  crumbled                            al
most entirely to dust, while the compounds which they had
formed with silex remain entire.

When the effervescence was over, a series of bubbles con
tinued during the whole day in the acid, without any dis
position to burst, or rise to the surface. After standing all
next day and night, they maintained their station ; and the
solution, being stirred, was found to be entirely agglutinated
into a transparent jelly, breaking with sharp angles. This
experiment affords          a direct and positive proof of a chemical
union having        taken place between the carbonate and silex.
VI.    Experiments made in Platina, with Spar, with Shells,
       and with Carbonate of Lime of undoubted Purity.
    Since    I   had   the honour of laying before this society a
short sketch        of the foregoing experiments, on the 30th of
August      last   (1804), many chemists and mineralogists of
eminence have favoured me with some observations on the
subject, and have suggested             doubts which   I am anxious to
remove.         It  has been suggested,      that the fusibility of the
 carbonates may have been the consequence of a mixture of
other substances, either originally existing in the natural
 carbonate, or added to it by the contact of the porcelain
 tube.
    With     regard     to the first  of these surmises,  I  beg leave to
 observe, that, granting this cause of fusion to have been the
 real one, a material point, perhaps all that is strictly ne
 cessary   in order     to maintain this part   of the Huttonian The
 ory, was nevertheless gained.            For, granting that our car
 bonates were impure, and that their impurity rendered them
 fusible, still the same is true of almost every natural .car
 bonate ; so that our experiments were,           in that   respect,   con
formable to nature.           And    as to the other surmise,        it has
                                     B  2                              been

 been shown,      by comparing together a varied series of ex
 periments,    that the mutual action between the lime and the
 porcelain was occasioned entirely by the presence of the
 carbonic acid, since, when it was absent, no action of this
 kind took place.        The fusion of our carbonates cannot,
 therefore, be ascribed to the porcelain. .
    Being convinced, however, by many observations,                 that
the fusibility of the carbonate did not depend upon impurity,
 I have exerted myself to remove, by fresh experiments, every
doubt that has arisen on the subject.               In order to guard
 against natural impurities, I have applied to such of my
friends as have turned their attention to chemical analysis
 (a branch of the science to which         I  have never attended)    to
furnish me with carbonate of lime          of undoubted purity.      To
obviate the contamination        arising from the contact        of the
porcelain tubes, I      determined to confine the subject        of ex
periment in some substance which               had   no disposition to
unite with the carbonate.         I  first tried charcoal, but found
it very troublesome, owing           to its irregular    absorption   of
water and air.
    I then turned my thoughts to the construction of tube9
or cups of platina for that purpose. Being unable readily
to procure proper solid vessels of this substance, I made use
of thin laminated       plates, formed into cups.         My first me
thod was, to fold the plate exactly as we do blotting paper
to form a filter (fig. 26) ; this produced a cup capable of
holding the thinnest liquid ; and being covered with a lid,
formed   of  a similar     thin plate, bent at the edges, so as to
overlap considerably (fig. 2S), the carbonate it contained
was secured' on all sides from the contact of the porcelain
tube within which it was placed. Another convenient de
vice likewise occurred : I wrapt a piece of the plate of pla
tina round a cylinder, so as to form a tube, each end of
which was     closed by a cover like that      just  described (fig. 27
and 29). (In      fig. 26 and 27 these cups are represented       upon
a large scale, and in 28 and 29, nearly of their actual size).
This last construction had the advantage of containing eight
or nine grains of carbonate, whereas the other would only
hold about    a  grain and   a half.    On the other hand, it was
                                                                    not

             Effects  of Heat modified  by Compression.          21
not fit to retain a thin liquid ; but, in most cases, that cir
cumstance was of no consequence ; and I foresaw that the
carbonates could not thus escape without proving the main
point under consideration, namely, their fusion.
    The rest of the apparatus was arranged in all respects as
formerly described, the same precautions being taken to de
fend the platina vessel as had been used with the inner tubes
of porcelain.           i
    In this manner I       have made a number of experiments
during this spring and summer, the result of which is highly
satisfactory.     They prove, in the first place, the propriety
of the observations which led to this trial, by showing, that
the pure carbonate, thus defended       from any contamination,
is decidedly more refractory than chalk ; since, in many ex
periments, the chalk has been reduced to a state of marble,
while the pure carbonate, confined in the platina vessel, has
been   but very feebly acted upon, having only acquired the
induration of     a sandstone.
    In other experiments, however, I have been more suc
cessful, having obtained some results, worthy, I think, of
the attention of this society, and which I shall now submit
to   their inspection.      The specimens    are all inclosed, for
6afety, in glass tubes, and supported on little stands of wax
(fig. 31, 32, 33).        The specimens have, in general, been
removed     from the cup or tube   of platina in which they were
forrSisd,  these devices having the advantage     of securing both
the vessel and its contents,       by enabling us to unwrap the
folds without      violence ; whereas in a solid cup or tube it
would have been difficult, after the experiment, to avoid the
destruction cither of the vessel or its contents, or both.
    April 16, 1805. —An experiment was made with pure cal
careous   spar from St. Gothard,    remarkably transparent, and
having a strong double refraction.          A temperature of 40°
was applied ; but, owing to some accident, the weight was
not known.        The conical cup came out clean and entire,
filled not quite to the brim with a yellowish gray substance,
having a shining surface, with longitudinal streaks, as we
sometimes see on glass.         This surface was here and there
interrupted by little white tufts or protuberances disposed

 irregularly.     On the ledge of the cup, formed by the ends
 of the folded platina, were several globular drops like mi
 nute pearls, visible to the naked eye, the number of which
 amounted to sixteen.           These seem to have been formed by
 the entire fusion       of what carbonate       happened to lie on the
 ledge, or had been entangled amongst the extremities of the
 folds, drawing itself together, and uniting in drops, as we
 see when any substance melts under the blowpipe.                   This
 result is preserved entire, without deranging the tube.                I
 am sorry to find that it has begun to fall to decay, in con
 sequence, no doubt, of too great a loss of its carbonic acid.
 But the globules      do not seem as yet to have suffered       any in-
Ju17-
     April   25. — The same spar was           used with two grains   of
 water,    and a heat    of  33°.   I  have   reason   to suspect, how
 ever,   that in this,     and   several   other experiments made     at
 this time, the metal into which the cradle was plunged, on
 first introduction into the barrel, had been too hot, so as to
 drive off the water.        There was a loss of 6-4 per cent.      The
 result lay in the cup without any appearance of frothing or
 swelling.      The surface was of a clean white, but rough,
 having     in  one  corner a space shining like glass. The cup
 being unwrapt, the substance was obtained sound and en
 tire : where it had moulded itself on the platina, it had a
 small degree of lustre, with the irregular semi -transparency
 of saline marble      ;  when broken, it preserved that character
more completely than in any result hitherto obtained, the
 fracture being very irregular and angular, and shining; with
 facettes in various directions.          I much rrgret that this beau
 tiful specimen     no   longer exists, having crumbled entirely to
 pieces, notwithstanding all the care 1 took to inclose it with
 glass and wax.
    April    26. — An experiment         was made with some carbo
nate of lime, purified         by  my    friend  sir George Mackenzie.
Two grains of water were introduced, but were lost, I sus
pect, as in the last case.         The heat applied was 32°. The
loss of weight was 10'6 per cent. Yet, though made but
one day after the last-mentioned specimen, it remains as
fresh and entire as at first, and promises to continue un

 changed. The external surface, as seen on removing the
 lid of the conical cup, was found to shine all over like glass,
 except round the edges, which were fringed with a series of
 white and rough sphericles, one set of which advanced, at
one spot, near to the centre. The shining surface was com
 posed of planes, which formed obtuse angles together, and had
 their surface striated, the striae bearing every appearance of
a crystalline arrangement.         When     freed from the cup, as be
fore, the substance moulded on the platina was found to have
assumed a fine pearly surface.            Some large air-bubbles ap
peared,    which had adhered          to the cup, and were laid open
by its removal, whose internal surface had a beautiful lustre,
and was     full of striae  like the outward surface.       The     mass is
remarkable for semi-transparency, as seen particularly where
the air-bubbles diminish its thickness: a small part of the
mass being broken at one end, shows an internal                       saline
structure.
    April  29. — A cup      of platina was filled with several large
pieces   of   a periwinkle* shell, the sharp point of the spiral
being made to stand           upright in the cup (fig. 30). A heat
of 30° was applied, and no water was introduced. The car
bonate lost no less than 16 per cent. The shell, particu
larly the sharp end        of  the periwinkle,     retained    its original
shape in a great      measure,     so as to be quite discernible ; but
the whole was glazed over with a truly vitreous lustre. This
glaze covered, at one place, a fragment of the shell which
had been originally loose, and had welded the two together.
All   the angles   are rounded by this vitrification         ;    the space
between     the entire shell and      the fragment being filled, and
the angles of their meeting rounded, with this shining sub
stance.      The colour is a pale blue, contrasted, in the same
little glass, with a natural piece of periwinkle, which is of
a reddish yellow.        One of the fragments had adhered to the
lid, and had been converted into a complete drop, of the
size of a mustard-seed.           It is fixed on the wax (at b) along
with the other specimens of           the experiment (fig. 32). This
result shows as yet no sign             of decay, notwithstanding         so
great a loss    of weight.

    The last experiment was repeated on the same day, and
 prepared in the same manner, with large fragments of shell,
 and the point     of   the  periwinkle   standing up in the cup.
 A  heat  of  34° was applied ; a loss took place    of 13° per cent.
All   the original   form had disappeared, the carbonate lying
 in the cup as      a complete liquid, with a concave surface,
which did not shine, but       was studded all over with the white
 sphericles or tufts, like those seen in the former results,
without any space between them. When detached from
the cup, the surface moulded on the platina was white and
pearly, with a slight gloss.        The mass was quite solid, no
vestige whatever appearing of the original form of the frag
ments (fig. 33). A small piece, broken off near the apex of
the cone, showed the internal structure to be quite saline.
In the act of arranging the specimen on its stand, another
piece came     off in   a  new direction, which presented to view
the most perfect crystalline arrangement : the shining plane
extended across the whole specimen, and was more than the
tenth   of an inch in all directions.       This fracture, likewise,
showed the      entire internal solidity of the mass.       Unfortu
nately, this specimen has suffered much by the same decay
to which all of them are subject which have lost any con
siderable weight.        The part next the outward surface alone
remains entire.       I  have never been able to explain,    in  a sa
tisfactory manner, this difference of durability, the last-
mentioned result having lost more in proportion to its
weight than this.
   About the beginning of June          I  received  from  Mr. Hat-
chett some pure carbonate of lime, which he was so good
as to prepare, with a view to my experiments; and I have
been constantly employed with it till within these few days.
   My first experiments with this       substance    were  peculiarly
unfortunate,     and it seemed to he less easily acted upon than
any substance of the kind I had tried.           Its extreme purity,
no doubt, contributed much to this, though another cir
cumstance had        likewise   had   some   effect.   The powder,
owing    to a crystallization   which had taken place on its pre
cipitation, was very coarse, and little susceptible of close
ramming ; the particles, therefore, had less advantage than
                                                                when

when a fine powder is used in acting upon each other, and
I did not choose to run any risk of contamination by re
ducing the substance to a finer powder.    Whatever be the
cause, it is certain, that in many experiments in which the
chalk was changed to marble, this substance remained in a
loose and brittle state, though consisting generally of clear
and shining particles.   I at last, however, succeeded in ob
taining some very good results with this carbonate.
   In an experiment made with it on the 18th of June, in a
strong heat, I obtained a very firm mass with a saline frac
ture, moulded in several places on the platina, which was
now used in the cylindrical form.   On the 23d, in a similar
experiment, the barrel failed, and the subject of experiment
was found in an entire state of froth, proving its forme
fluidity.
   On the 25th, in    similar experiment, a heat of 64° was
                           a
applied without  any water   within the barrel. The platina
tube (having been contaminated in a former experiment with
some fusible metal) melted, and the carbonate, retaining its
cylindrical shape, had fallen through              it,
                                           so as to touch the
piece  of porcelain which  had been  placed next to the platina
tube.    At the point of contact the two had run together, as
a   hot iron runs when touched             by   sulphur.      The carbonate
itself   was very transparent,          resembling   a     piece of snow in
the act of melting.
   On the 26th of June            I     made  an experiment with this
carbonate, which         afforded    a   beautiful result. One grain of
water was introduced with great care yet there was ;                    a   loss
of 6-5 per cent., and the result has fallen to decay.                       The
pyrometer indicated        43°.      On   the outside     of   the platina cy
linder, and on one        of
                     the lids, were seen   set of globules a
like pearls,once before obtained, denoting perfect fusion.

When the upper lid was removed, the substance was found
to have sunk almost out             of sight, and        had assumed   a   form
not easily described.      have endeavoured to represent
                               (I                           in             it

heat, the summit of the rod (at a) had been rounded in fu
sion, and the mass being now softened bad sunk by its
weight, and spread below, so as to mould itself in the tube,
and fill its lower part completely (dfge). At the same time,
the viscid fluid adhering to the sides (at e and d), while the
middle part. was sinking, had been in part left behind, and in
part drawn out into a thin but tapering shape, united by a
curved surface      (at  I and c) to the middle rod.             When the
platina tube was unwrapt, the thin edges (at e and d) were
preserved all round, and in a state of beautiful semi-trans
parency. (I have attempted to represent the entire specimen,
as it stood on its cone of wax, in fig. 34.) The carbonate,
where moulded on the platina, had a clean pearly whiteness,
with a saline appearance externally, and in the sun shone
with facettes.       Its  surface  was    interrupted by a few scat
tered  air-bubbles,       which   had   lain against the tube.        The
intervening substance was unusually compact and hard under
the knife.       The whole surface (ebacd, fig. 31.), and the
inside of the air-bubbles, had        a vitreous lustre.      Thus,  every
thing denoted a state       of viscid fluidity, like that of honey.
   These last experiments seem to obviate every doubt that
remained with respect to the fusibility of the purest car
bonate, without the assistance of any foreign substance.

having been cured by nature alone.             I  am   about to speak
here     of the restoration of sight from a cause not hitherto
observed, and of which medical men may take advantage.
    Twenty years ago, M. Bouhole, a physician at Lieire,
wrote to me to take charge of        a   lady of that place affected
with a double cataract, and to       assist   at the operation which
,was    about to be performed upon her by M. Grandjean.
This     lady was completely blind.        I assisted at the operation
 performed upon her by this celebrated oculist.               The cry
 stalline of the right eye was completely and very easily ex
 tracted ; but the oculist having found some obstacles to
 the extraction    of the left crystalline,   he thought   of deferring
 the operation to another time ; after having, however, made
 an anterior incision upon the capsules of the crystalline, as
 well the capsule which is in common to it with the vitreous
 humour,      as that which is proper to it.
     The operation was attended with the happiest success;
 the lady recovered her sight in her right eye, the one upon
 which the operation     was performed,       and she returned home.
 Abon* two years afterwards, M.             Bouhole   wrote to us that
 the lady not only saw extremely well with the eye which
 had been operated upon, but also that she began to see with
 the other eye upon which the operation had not been finished :
 he added, that she perceived a circle of light, the edges of
 which were progressively enlarged ; and that they continued
  to  enlarge more and more, in proportion as the middle          of the
 ,fcircle,  which was black, diminished ; and that          she  conse
  quently saw better and better.
      Grandjean and I believed that this restoration of sight was
   produced from the edges of the crystalline having regained
  their pellucid property, and that the more this property was
  acquired, the sight became more distinct and more directly
  extended ; and,    in fact, we hoped that the black substance
  which     the patient always saw before her eye had entirely
  disappeared.     In order, however, to assist the operations of
   nature, we thought it right to prescribe for the patient every
   morning for three months some aperients, and among others,
  four ounces of syrup of cresses and 100 or 200 millepedes
  bruised while^ alive.    The patient did not make use of these
                                                             medicines,

 medicines, but Nature          continued    the operation      which   she
 had begun, and        the lady at last saw objects as clearly and
 distinctly  as any   one else.     I do not know      if   the black sub
 stance had completely disappeared.
    Other facts of the same or an analogous description have
been published by oculists ; but they always thought, as we
did, that it was to a restoration of the pellucidity of the cry
stalline, in whole or in part, that we ought to attribute the
more or less perfect restoration of sight.
    Veterinary surgeons and farriers have also informed me,
that horses which have lost their sight from a cataract, had
recovered it in proportion as this cataract had become less
extended.       But can it be nothing else than the return of
the transparency of the crystalline which occasions the re
s-oration of sight ? I think that this is the effect of another
cause,  — it  is the    diminution, even the entire destruction of
the crystalline which takes place in certain eyes, as well by
the consequence of the alteration of the crystalline which
had given place       to the cataract,      as also   by various other
causes,    particular    to the crystalline, or common to the va
rious parts of the body.
    The crystalline has      been   often sought after in vain in the
eyes of such persons         as   had  died a long time after being
couched for the cataract,but no traces of it have ever been dis
covered : it had been completely destroyed.                A human eye,
which I dissected a short time ago, was deprived of the cry
stalline, which had been destroyed perhaps by some morbific
cause ; at least, I discovered no cicatrix upon the transparent
cornea which might afford reason to suppose that it had been
ever operated upon.         Are there not alterations which hinder
the crystalline from nourishing         itself sufficiently to retain its
volume    ?
   The moment       the crystalline     is displaced,     it becomes  like
a strange body ;      it is decomposed, diminished in volume,
and destroyed.       Abandoned in its residence, after its cap-
gules   have   been    opened    by a crucial incision, and having
been altered itself in its anterior beds by the needle of the
oculist, is it not decomposed, injured, and even annihi
lated ? Was it not for this reason that the lady upon whom
                                                                       the

                   without the Assistance of  Art.                29
 the operation was performed in this manner recovered her
 sight, having then no longer any obstacle to hinder the rays
 of light from arriving at the retina ?
    May it not sometimes happen, that in consequence of a
blow,    a fall, or other accidents, the crystalline undergoes
some alteration, from which the loss of sight soon results,
and at last its restoration, when the crystalline is completely
destroyed    f
    The   celebrated  Scarpa proposed, in place of extracting the
crystalline,    to destroy it by degrees, by numerous opera
tions : this method has been employed, with equal success,
by several of his imitators. But are there not cases in which
such operations, although made by the most expert opera
tor, or one of the best anatomists, are rather dangerous than
useful  ?   May not    these operations augment    an ophthalmia
when it exists, or even attract it when there is a predisposi
tion in the eye ? Would it not be better to desist from such
attempts, and to allow Nature, which labours also for the
destruction of the crystalline, to complete the work herself,
or at least a great part of it ?
    The remarks which we have made upon the spontaneous
destruction of the crystalline prove that Nature, in this case,
is not idle, and     that she seconds  the views   of the surgeon,
slowly,    to be sure, but without any bad consequence.
    To conclude : — This destruction of the crystalline produced
by Nature is not more surprising than that which she pro
duces upon other parts of the body, and which we shall
mention here : for instance, the destruction of the fragments
of the pupillary membrane, with which the opening of the
iris is closed, and which is torn asunder after birth. What
becomes of these membranous fragments ? They are decom
posed, destroyed, and enter into the circulation like the par
ticles of the disorganized crystalline. The destruction of the
entire body of the ossa longa, which takes place on their se
paration for a length of time, is still more surprising.        It is
so much so, that in subjects who have died a short time after
a supposed formation of such a separation, the substance of
the bone was almost entire, while in such      as had  lived a long
time after the disease      of the bone, there was only a small
                                                          fragment

30                  On the Restoration   of Sight.
fragment of this same bone in the osseous envelopment, and
sometimes none at all.
   There are other examples of the destruction of more or
less considerable portions      of bone.     Ruysch remarked in
those individuals who had received a fracture of the neck of
the thigh bone, and which had not been cured, that the
heads remaining in the cotyloidal cavity had so far dimi
nished in size, that they were almost reduced to nothing.           I
have equally observed in some subjects in whom the rotula
was broken transversely, that the portion of the bone at
tached to the ligament of the tibia was diminished in size in
a singular manner, as well as that attached to the extremities
of  the extensor muscles      of  the leg, but the latter  in a pro-
portionably   less degree.    In all  these  cases,  it is for want
of nourishment      that the parts decrease, and this nourish
ment diminishes or ceases as soon as the circulation of the
nutritive  matter slackens or is interrupted.         And it is this
which takes place     when  the  lymphatics,   or blood-vessels, or
the nerves,     are  compressed    or destroyed.      May   we   not
ascribe to this cause the diminution which takes place, after
birth, of the liver in general, and of the left lobe in parti
cular ? The diminution happens from this ; that the blood,
which was conducted there by the hepatic artery and by
the portatory and umbilical veins, is no longer removed by
the latter vein, and which was principally distributed through
the left lobe. Anatomists      have remarked, that    in the foetus,
the   super-renal   bodies and their blood-vessels       were very
great relatively to the kidneys and the vessels,      but that after
birth   the vessels of the super-renal bodies        diminish,   and
those of the kidneys grow large in proportion : this occa
sions the diminution in volume, and even the annihilation
of the former parts and the increase of the others. I do not
doubt that the thymus is effaced in a similar manner.           It is
certain that it loses its volume in proportion as its arteries
contract ; and is it not because the lungs receive incompa
rably more blood after birth than before, that the vessels of
the thymus, with which the pulmonary vessels are connected,
receive less blood also, and therefore at last disappear ?
   There is another example      of a no less remarkable destruc
                                                               tion,

tion, which we may mention here ; and that is, the destruc
tion of a division 'or separation, which is common to the
two ossa longa of the leg of the foetus of all the cloven-
footed        animals,    the sus       genus        only      excepted.           These
two bones, which in                the foetus       are very well            separated,
unite together after birth ; about the fourth week they are
joined together by their sides, which had been only conti
 guous ; and about the fifth month, the common division,
 which separated their two cylindrical cavities, entirely disap
 pears, .n such a manner, that of the two bones one only re
 mains, which is vulgarly called the cannon.
    This was very distinctly remarked by Fougerpux *, with
 out his being able to ascertain the cause, notwithstanding
 the ingenious experiments made by that philosopher to dis
 cover it.
    Thus it is evident that Nature is as wonderful for the
 manner in which she effects the destruction of different
 parts, as for the great use which she derives from      as well             it,
 in the perfection of our organs as in the cure of our diseases.

       Contexture. —The mass partly in small grains and almost
   compact, partly in large grains, very much laminated, each
   grain presenting distinctly a rhomboidal figure, and being
  half  an inch in size.       Its surface is bristled with large len
  ticular crystals nearly an inch high, which are very obtuse
   rhomboids, and a little deformed (the equiaxis variety of
  M. Haiiy).      These crystals form a continued mass with the
  part  not  crystallized, and are evidently the same substance.
      Colour. — Grayish white ; in some places of a deep dirty
  flesh red.    The compact        parts  are the whitest.    The sur
  face, particularly that of the crystals, is of a brownish yel
  low, having sometimes a slight red reflection.
      N. B. The latter colour appears to be the effect of the
  contact of the atmospheric air ; the alteration does not ap
  pear to penetrate into the mass.
      Transparency. — Very translucid upon the edges.
     Hardness. — A little harder than the calcareous spar.          The
 compact part is, besides, of considerable consistency ;            it is
 fresh, and by no means altered.
      Gravity — 3-83.
     This specimen appeared pure and homogeneous ; we saw,
 however, in it some grains of quartz and pyrites, but in
 small quantity, and very small in size. A fragment of this
 specimen, tried in the forge, yielded a fine button weighing
40 per cent. It was brought from Ustelegny, near Baigory,
 in the department of the Lower Pyrenees.

     This specimen differs from          the preceding   in so far as  it
does not present distinct crystals,         although  the whole mass
is crystalline in large grains, presenting the rhomboidal form
very distinctly.       It is not so white in colour ; it is of a deep
brownish yellow.          It has little lustre or transparency ; it is
not so hard as the other, and its consistence is less.               Its
gravity is 3"60.         It was brought from Vaunaveys, three

      It is necessary to remark that this specimen, among these
   rhomboidal grains, contained some grains of carbonate of
   lime, which were white, and very distinct from those of the
f spathic iron     :  there  were   also  some   veins and crystals of
  quartz and some atoms of pyrites in the above specimen.
      No. 3. Spathic Iron of Allevard, Department of hire.
      This specimen was transmitted to me by professor Has-
  senftatz.      It very much resembled No. 2. in colour, lustre,
  and transparency ; it is well crystallized, very homogeneous,
  and in good preservation.            It is easily divided into rhom
  boids, the plates of which, when they are slender,              are per
  fectly diaphanous.
                                  Analysis.
      (A) I   first endeavoured      to ascertain   if  the three speci
  mens of spathic iron contained any lime.                In order that    I
  might     not   confound'    that  which   might     be  in the matrix
  with that which formed         part  of the crystals, I carefully     se
  parated the particles which differed        in  appearance    from the
  dominant part       ; I also took care only to employ crystalline
  fragments.         After having reduced them into impalpable
  powder, I      introduced five grammes of each of the speci
  mens into three glass phials, numbered.              I added a little di
  stilled water in order to dilute the powder and to diminish
  the action    of the sulphuric acid, which I poured in by de
  grees   to complete saturation.        As in the cold the action was
  almost nothing, the three phials were exposed to a heat
  scarcely capable of bringing the mixture to the boiling
  point ; the combination of the sulphuric acid then slowly
  commenced ; it was accompanied with the effervescence
  usual in the disengagement of carbonic acid gas until the
  solution was complete.          No. I. yielded no residue; No. II.
  yielded what scarcely weighed 0-01 gramm. ; that of No. III.
  the only one which could be ascertained, weighed 004
  gramm.        It was nothing else than a little silex, which had
  probably escaped observation from being in the crystals.
  The solution was preserved a long time, and remained co
  lourless, and deposited nothing. Had these substances con-

34                           Analysis of Iron Ore,
tained ever so little lime             *, sulphate of lime would             have
been    infallibly precipitated, particularly after cooling, be
cause the water in the solution was but little; and that there
might not be an excess of acid, I had the precaution not to
add any new sulphuric acid before that previously poured in
had entered into combination : besides, in a preliminary
trial which I made by means of the muriatic acid, I obtained
no precipitate by the oxalate of ammonia.
    (B) In order to separate the oxide of manganese                       which   I
supposed        to be contained       in the spathic iron,        I thought the
following        process    the most proper      :
    I diluted with distilled           water five .grammes of the same
substance.          I poured nitric acid on it by little and little,
with the same precautions as above detailed.                       The solution
took place very rapidly ; the same phenomena were again
produced, but with a disengagement of nitrous vapours.'
The solution was afterwards decanted into a porcelain cup,
evaporated         to dryness, and        diluted in a new quantity              of
water.        I  repeated these operations twice             successively, be
cause    I   had remarked that once was not sufficient, the oxide
of iron remaining          suspended    in the liquor    and passing through
all the filters.        I   would    even   advise    those who wish to re
peat these processes,           previously to imbibe the filtering paper
with   a   little distilled water; the oxide of iron will not then
pass through so easily, and will also be more easily sepa
rated. If it should happen that the oxide is so much in-
crusted that it is not possible to detach it without a great
loss, the best course to follow would be to incinerate the
filter in a crucible         of silver or platina.         By following this
method       I  extracted     the following quantities of the red oxide
of iron :       from No. I. 3'05 grammes; from No. II. 2-45;
from No.         III.  2-45 grammes.

M. Lenoir, engineer of the mines. This specimen, which had the appear
ance of some of the stones for Kiilding (limestones), fuund in the neighbour

were perfectly colourless        : after having concentrated them,        I
precipitated     from     them, by carbonate of soda, a white flaky
matter, very light, which, at first sight, I took for the oxide
of manganese.
     Jt having appeared,       upon pouring a little caustic soda into
the liquors, that in spite of the excess of alkali a portion of
white matter remained in solution, I boiled them in order
to drive off the carbonic acid, which it is believed has the
property of dissolving several earthy and metallic substances.
 I  filtered them afterwards in order to collect the precipitates :
after having cleaned them well, I separated them from the
filter, and calcined them for fifteen minutes in a crucible              of
platina:      No. Ii weighed 0-25 grammes;                No.   II. O-7Ol
No. III.      0-68.
      (D) The gelatinous        appearance    of   these precipitates sur
 prised me so much the more,           as I  did not know this property
 in    the carbonate    of manganese : I was still more astonished
when I took them out of the crucible as white after calcination
as they were before ; because the carbonate           of manganese loses
its    acid and becomes black at a degree         of heat even inferior to
 that which      I had used,     while the matter of which we are
 now speaking        had retained a good deal        of carbonic acid and
 preserved      all its whiteness.      A   second    calcination did not
 produce any remarkable change.                 This substance melted
 by the blowpipe with glass of borax, dissolved with effer
 vescence      without     being coloured : nitrate of potash thrown
 upon the burning mass did not produce the violet colour
  which characterizes the oxide of manganese, notwithstand
  ing 1 made use of a supporter of baked clay in place of char
 coal, in order to remove every thing which could obstruct
 the colour. The precipitates obtained from the salts of man
 ganese by the caustic alkalis          speedily becoine brown in the
 air; the above substance presented no such appearance:
 dissolved in the sulphuric and nitric acids, it- was neither
 precipitated by the hydro-sulphurets nor by the alkaline
  prussiates : the latter scarcely give it a blueish cast. By
  means of the oxalate of ammonia              a slight precipitate is ob
  tained,    which     is 'slowly formed, and which is red^ssolved
  in water or in     an excess     of acid.     I  ought to observe here,

 that it is right to be on our guard against a circumstance
 which may impose upon us : frequently, after a certain
 number of precipitations and nitrations, the re-agents indi
 cate the presence of lime, in a small quantity to be sure, in
 the acid liquors which formerly appeared to contain none at
 all. This lime generally proceeds from a little chalk which
 some filtering papers contain, as is proved by the efferves
 cence which takes place when these liquors are filtered.
     (E) The properties   here  explained of the unknown sub
 stance appear to me to characterize sufficiently one of the
 earths to direct my attention to that quarter. Magnesia was
 the earth which seemed to have the greatest resemblance to
 the above substance ; in fact, both were equally well dis
solved by sulphuric acid ; with the latter a bitter salt
 was formed   as well  as  with the former.     It is not precipi
tated from its solutions in the acids (when the latter are
properly diluted with water) by means of the carbonates of
soda and ammonia ; with caustic alkalis it yields a precipi
tate insoluble in an excess of alkali, but very soluble in the
carbonate   of ammonia.      One property alone, that   of retain
ing   carbonic acid, even after a very strong calcination,  seems.
to exclude all parallel of this substance with magnesia ; be
cause, according to the generality of chemists, nothing is
easier than to deprive the carbonate of magnesia of its acid
by means of calcination.       But I had often occasion to ex
perience that this result is not so easy to obtain as is gene
rally imagined; the identity of the above substance with
magnesia, then, appears to me sufficiently established not to
regard it as a new earth.
     (F) In order to complete this analysis, it still remained to
know whether the three minerals of spathic iron contained
water and carbonic acids. For this purpose, I calcined five
grammes of each in a crucible of platina.          No. I. lost by
this operation 1-70 grammes, No. II. lost 1-85, No. III.
lost 1-83: these numbers, it is true, could not represent
the amount of water and carbouic acid : the loss in weight,
occasioned by their disengagemet, was diminished by the
hyper-oxygenation of the iron.        In fact, the nitrous gas,
produced by these minerals when they are dissolved in the
                                                            nitric

 nitric acid,   and the    green   precipitates obtained from their
.solutions in the sulphuric and muriatic acids, prove. evidently
 that the iron they contain is very little oxygenated.             But as
 I  collected all the products of the analysis in the state in
 which they are found in the minerals after calcination, it
 follows, that the results ought to be similar. To conclude,
 it is easy' to make the necessary correction, by admitting,
 with M. Proust*, that iron, in order to oxidate itself at the

    (G) The celebrated Bergman, in a memoir entitled De
 •
Mineris ferri alth *, announced that he found a very great
quantity of manganese in spathic iron.                  The authority of
the above chemist and of his followers was sufficient to in
duce me to inquire if the oxide of this metal could not have
been kept in combination          by the oxide of iron.          In order,
in the first place, to ascertain its existence, I melted the ore
by the blowpipe with glass of borax, as well in its natural
state as after being calcined, without obtaining, even with
the assistance       of nitre, any colour which announced the
presence of manganese.           I perceived, indeed, marks of this
metal    on  melting   five  grammes     of each mineral with three
parts of caustic potash ; but the green tint which the alkali
took was very feeble ; it quickly disappeared, and the oxide
of manganese which I extracted was not appreciable in the
balance. ,
    Jt is probable, then, that Bergman           mistook the magnesia
for   the oxide     of manganese.        We may even ascertain that
the presence      of this metal in spathic iron is by no means
established     by the facts quoted in his dissertation upon the
                  *
                     Opuscula Physica ct Cliemica, vol. ii.
                                                                     white

white ores            of iron * ; and, notwithstanding                  the author has
described at such length the properties of manganese, we
may say with M. Fourcroyf, " that one would be led to
believe, on reading it with attention, that it was written by
its author rather to furnish him with an opportunity of
speaking of this last metal under the name of white ore of
iron, than to detail the properties of carbonate of iron."
   By even supposing that lime                          J
                                       and manganese § enter
into the composition of spathic iron in any notable quantity,
we ought to conclude, from all the facts above stated, that
the denomination of carbonated ferriferous lime with man
ganese,  cannot apply to all the white ores of iron.  But if
the identity in the form of carbonated lime, with the speci
mens which are the subject of this memoir, is well esta
blished, how can we conclude that mineralogical character
istics, drawn from external form, are sufficient for deter
mining           the species   ?

Bergman substituted the expression of magnesium to designate manganese for
that of magnesia, to which the epithet of nigra  added,in order that the metal
                                                            is

alba.

 tIt       is   not astonishing that several chemists        have found lime, since the ma
trix of certain    of spathic iron visibly contains a very great quantity of it.
                      ores
   Bergman says, in speaking of this earth, —" Pondus calcis multum variat                   ;
in quibusdam paucas centesimas reperimus.      In spathosis circitcr decima para
ea constat, in aliis dimidium,           nunquam verft penitus defuit."
 §    As to      manganese,   it   is   so much the more interesting to ascertain   if   these
ores contain any of it, because the generality of metallurgists attribute to this
metal the property of producing natural steel.

  mens of the plants are reserved in the repository of the
  society, where they may be seen by agriculturists.
          Gentlemen,
      Every one of you, I think, will allow that fences are
  material objects to be attended to in agriculture; you must
  also be convinced that there is no plant in this kingdom of
  which     they can so properly be made as the Crataegus                 oxya-
 cantha Linnaei, or common White Thorn.                       In consequence
 of my being convinced of this, I                have been induced to make
 a few experiments to effect the better propagation of that
 valuable plant ; the result of which, along with specimens
 of my success, I beg leave to submit to your inspection.
      In the    year 1801,       I  had occasion to purchase a quantity
 of thorns,      and finding them very dear,             I was determined to
 try some experiments, in order               if  possible to raise them at a
 less expense.       I tried to propagate them from cuttings of the
branches,      but with    little or no success. I likewise tried if pieces
 of the root would grow            ; and    I cut from      the thorns which
 I  had purchased       about     a  dozen of such roots       as pleased  me,
and planted them in a border along with those                   I had bought.
To my       great astonishment,           not one of them died; and in
two years they became             as  good thorns as the average of those
I had purchased. The thorns I purchased were three years
old when I got them.                  In April 1602, I had occasion to
move a fence, from which I procured as many roots of
thorns     as made me        upwards of two thousand cuttings, of
which I did not lose five in the hundred.
     In the spring of 1803, I likewise planted as many cuttings
of thorn roots       as   I  could get.        In   1 804,  I did the same ;
and this year       I  shall plant many thousands.
    I  have sent for your inspection specimens                 of the produce
of    1802,    1803,   and 1804, raised after my method,              with the
best     I could  get   of those      raised from haws in the common
way, which generally lie one year in the ground before they
vegetate.       They are all exactly one, two, and three years
old,    from   the day they were planted. — I was so pleased with
my success in raising so valuable an article to the farming
interest of this kingdom, at so trifling an expense, (for it is
                                                                       merely

                       On the Growth    of While Thorn.                   41
merely that of cutting the roots into lengths and planting
them), that I was determined to make it known to the world,
and could think of no better method than communicating it
to your society; and should you so far approve of this
method of raising thorns, as to think me entitled to any
honorary reward, I shall receive it with gratitude, but shall
feel myself amply repaid for any trouble I have been at,
should you think it worthy a place in the next volume of
your Transactions.
     The method of raising the thorns from roots              of   the plant,
is   as   follows.
     I
    would advise every farmer to purchase a hundred or a
thousand thorns, according to the size of his farm, and plant
them in his orchard or garden, and when they have attained
the thickness of my three-year-old specimens, which is the
size      I always prefer for planting in           fences,   let him    take
them up and prune the roots      the     in       manner I
                                               have pruned
the specimen sent you, from which he will upon an average
get temor twelve cuttings from each plant, which is as good
as thorns of the same thickness; so that you will easily per
ceive that       in three   years he   will   have a succession   of plants
fit for use, which he may         if he   pleases increase    tenfold every
time he takes them- up.
   The spring (say in all April) is the best time to plant the
cuttings, which must be done in rows half a yard asunder,
and about four inches from each other in the row; they
ought to be about four inches long, and planted with the
top one-fourth of an inch out of the ground, and well
fastened; otherwise they will not succeed so well.
   The reason why I prefer spring to autumn for planting
the roots,       is,
              that were they to be planted in autumn, they
would not have got sufficient hold of the ground before the
frost set in, which would raise them all from the ground                   ;
and,    not entirely destroy the plants, would oblige the
          if
farmer to plant them afresh.
 I        have      the produce of my three-year-old speci
                 attached
men to the plants      came from, cut
                            it                       in
                                          the way always           I
practise; on the thick end of the root  make two, and on
                                                  I
                                                                          the

42               On the Groivth of White Thorn.
the other end one cut, by which means the proper end to bt?
planted uppermost, which is the thick one, may easily be
known.
    Although    I recommend the roots to be planted in April,
yet the farmer may, where he pleases, take up the thorns
he may want, and put the roots he has pruned off into sand
or mould,     where they will keep until he has leisure to cut
them into proper lengths for planting; he will likewise keep
them in the same way until planted.
   The. great advantage of my plan is: first, that in case any
one has raised from haws a thorn with remarkably large
prickles, of vigorous growth, or possessing any other quali
fication-requisite to make a good fence, he may propagate it
far better and sooner, from roots, than any other way.
Secondly, in three years he may raise from roots a better
plant than can in six years be raised from haws, and with
double the quantity of roots; my three-year-old specimen
would have been half as big again, had I not been obliged
to move all my cuttings       the second year after they were
planted.
    It would not be a bad way, in order to get roots, to plant
a hedge in any convenient place, and on each side trench
the ground      two yards wide, and two grafts deep; from
which, every two or three years, a large quantity of roots
might be obtained, by trenching the ground over again, and
cutting away what roots were found, which would all be
young and of a proper thickness.       I do not like them of a
 larger size than the specimens sent.
    I  am at present engaged in several experiments, to en
 deavour to propagate the thorn from the branches, which, if
 successful,  I  will communicate to you; but T am  of opinion,
that what is now done is sufficient.
    Should the society require any further explanations, I
 shall be happy in doing my utmost to furnish such ex
 planations.

latter end of   April,   1802,   which   I  was obliged to remove
the spring after I first planted them ; this of course retarded
 their growth, by having fresh roots to make.            These speci
mens are pruned in the way I always prune thorns when I
plant them in my fences; the roots, you may see, are cut,
 and the top I should have cut at the mark you will find about
 four or five inches above the root, and shortened the branches
 below that mark, to about three inches from the stem.               I
 have attached to each specimen the roots I pruned from            it,
 cut into such lengths as I should have done had I used the
 thorns myself.     I think one produced sixteen and the other
 twenty-two; but that you will be able to judge of when you
 see them.

 A
-A. regard for   the interests of science has long occasioned
me and others to regret, that a truly valuable and extensive
body of facts on the stratification of England, Wales, and
part of Scotland, the labour of 14 years or more, spent in
the most intense application to the subject by a gentleman of
Bath (Mr. William Smith, engineer, now resident in Buck
ingham street, Strand, London), should remain useless on
his hands, for want of sufficient public encouragement to
induce him to publish his Maps, Sections, Drawings and
Descriptions of extraneous Fossils and other particulars, most
of which are new, and appear quite essential to the placing
of   the Geology  of our own country, and perhaps of the whole
terraqueous Globe, among the accurate sciences. Mr. Smith
has traced the out-crop of a stratum of Chalk, that            its           is,
appearance     on the surface of the land, or rather in the
hangings    of certain ranges of our English hills for near 700
miles in length        The exact uniformity of appearances of
                        !
this out-crop   in innumerable   instances, corroborated      the           by
sinking of wells and other works of art upon or in this
stratum, in the greatest variety of situations, has fully
warranted the conclusions      that this immense mass of mat
                                       ;
ter consists of    vast
                   a    number  of layers of chalk and siliceous
substances, the latter in almost every variety of form, from
that of solid black flint, to white and fine sand or grit-stone;

so much the appearance of chalk for 400 feet or more in
thickness,     as hitherto to have passed under that denomina
tion, and which       may perhaps be well still to retain as
                        it                                                         a
general  name for  this assemblage of strata.  In like manner
the out-crop has been traced of an immense succession of
argillaceous, siliceous and ferruginous matters lying upon
the above chalk              stratum, wherever the same             is   found     to
have    any regular strata           upon     it   in England   ;   which strata
                                                                     Mr. Smith

Mr. Smith may         be well entitled to denominate the London
clay,    from the circumstance         of    the metropolis and its en
virons (where alluvial gravel, sand, &c. or peat do not in
tervene) standing immediately upon a very considerable and
remarkable red clay layer or stratum, forming part of this
uppermost assemblage of the British strata.   It is not my
present intention, nor would it be proper towards my friend
Mr. Smith, to attempt, were I able, completely to develop
the theory which the immense body of facts in his posses
sion (and numerous others in my own, collected before and
since 1801, when I first became acquainted with Mr. Smith)
go to establish : suffice it to say, that the most complete and
certain rules have been, or may in every instance be, de
duced for ascertaining the relative position (which pro
bably never varies) of each distinct stratum, however thin,
with regard to those above and below it in the series (or
natural order of the strata, as Mr. Smith called it in his
first printed prospectus) ; rules equally general have, or will
on sufficient inquiry, be found, for identifying each parti
cular stratum, either by the knowledge of its relative po
sition with other known atrata in its vicinity, by the pe
culiar organized remains imbedded in                   it,
                                              and not to be
found    in   the adjoining     strata, or    by
                                      the peculiar nature and
properties of the matter composing  the  stratum itself. By                    a
reference to the rules above alluded to, and the considera
tion of other well-established and unvarying particulars, the
alluvial matters can be certainly distinguished         which ;     by
term are here meant, the fragments of the regular strata,
more or less mixed with each other, or with extraneous
matters, and rounded or worn, lying upon the regular strata
(for such are rarely or probably never seen in or under the
strata) and are there found deposited, apparently by the action
of violent currents of water          (assisted perhaps      by   tbe general
principle of gravity, in circumstances which have never yet
been contemplated among the physical inquiries   of mathe
maticians),        the manner    of these alluvial deposits being         per
fectly    different    from,    and
                                  apparently regulated   laws        by
quite dissimilar       from those which obtained when the de
position      of   the strata   took place.        A   further remark     it   is
                                                                    essential

    40                 On the Stratification           of England,
    essential    to make,      and which relates to the truly enormous
    and violent breaking up, which the strata have almost uni
    versally undergone (probably owing to their gravity under
    the circumstances above alluded to), the effects of which
    are well  known to miners, and to all others who extensively
    open the soil in directions nearly horizontal, by the name
    of faults, troubles, dykes, fissures, &c. &c.
      I was led, Sir, on the present occasion, to make the above
 remarks, from having lately, for the sake of information,
 visited the works going on near the Horse Ferry, in Rother-
 hithe, (about 2f- miles below London Bridge) for making an
 archway under the Thames river, intended for the passage
of horses        and carriages,      in   case,   on executing the perpen
dicular shaft, now in hand, and                   a drift or drain therefrom
under the river, it shall be judged practicable at this place
to tunnel and form an archway under its bed, upon a suf
ficiently high level for carriages to descend down into                                  it,
and ascend again at the opposite end,        sloping roads    by                         of
easy     and convenient             lengths.       Should        the   result    of the
present experiment appear against      carriage archway at
                                                        a

projector and superintendant   of the works, that   smaller                a
arch may be here formed under the bed of the river, at
a depth not inconvenient to foot-passengers, who are to
descend to the same                 by
                         circular or well staircase at one
                                      a

                   a

     I  have already, sir, declared myself convinced * of the
 practicability and usefulness of forming archways under
 Rivers in almost any situations, and it is principally from
 a desire to contribute my mite towards promoting this
 highly useful mode of communication that I have troubled
 you herewith.            The shaft or well at present sinking in
 Rotherhithe,        is,  as   Mr. Vazie informs me, intended, in
 the first instance, for ascertaining, more fully than boring
 can do, the nature and condition (as to springs of water)
  of the strata or alluvial matters under the south bank
  of   the   river; and, during the progress thereof, I beg to
  call the attention of Mr. Vazie and those concerned, to
  the circumstance of preserving frequent and ample speci
  mens of all the matters sunk through, with reference to the
  exact depth and          thickness   of each, and the state of the wa
  ter,   as ascertained      by the strokes of the engine-pump from
  time to time.          I beg further to mention, that, as far as my
   recollection of Mr. Smith's map now serves me, the top of
   the great Chalk stratum abpve mentioned, is to be found on
   the surface      at no great     distance south of the head of the
   Croydon canal, about ten miles from London : also, that at
   the foot of Ridge Hill, 16£ miles from London, on the road
   to St. Albans, the same stratum appears again ; the surface
   between these two places (passing through the metropolis)
   being occupied by the whole or the lowermost of the strata

   comprehended in the London clay.               I  have mentioned the
  above two points, one sufficiently near in direction to the
  south and the other to the north of the proposed archway, as
  a guide to the inquiries which I am going to suggest ; but in
  all probability some other line, nearly north and south, (par
  ticularly on the north side of London,) may be found more
  eligible, in which I beg to recommend that it should be mi
 nutely inquired by means of the many different Wells which
 have been sunk, by the recent cuttings of the Croydon Canal
 and other excavations,     as  well as by the croppingof the several
 strata which compose the London clay, both at its southern
 and northern edge, what are the nature, the actual succession,
 and thicknesses of the several strata, which may be expected
 to exist under the vale of the Thames at London, after the
 alluvial matters therein have all been sunk through, and the
 strata reached.     During  the last autumn,      I, and  others, had an
 opportunity of making part of the above inquiries on the line
 of the Croydon canal, and am enabled to state, that, pro
 ceeding northward from Sydenham town to near Brockley-
Green,i the canal will be found all the way cut in a thick
stratum of very strong red clay, whose characteristic mark
seems to be, two or more remarkable layers           of Indus Helmontii,
or clay-balls; which clay-ball         stratum forms the surface in
most parts near London that I have examined, except where
either gravel or alluvial matters exist thereon, or where an
excavation or abrasion of the surface            has taken place, and
exposed      strata  which are to be found        lower in the series.
In going southward from Brocklcy-Green, and descending
from the surface of the stratum above described (for the
course of one mile and a half, or rather less,) to the foot of
Plough -garlick Hill, near the London and Greenwich road,
a great number       of the upper strata    of  the  London clay may
be traced in succession,       and ample specimens         of  each may
be obtained from        the new banks      of the canal. It may be
necessary     here to mention,    that  the  exposure of the edges of
the strata, in the cutting of the canal between Brockley and
the Greenwich road, and in numerous other places on the
southern side      of the Thames vale,      seems owing to an enor
mous dislocation or lift of the          strata  in   those places,  and
to an amazing abrasion or wearing away              of  the edges  of the
                                                              uppermost

               the intended Thames             Archways, &c.                 49
uppermost of those strata.                 The dislocations       above  men
tioned present to naturalists            a  most favourable opportunity,
by ascending from             the several        chalk-pits in Greenwich,
Chalton, Woolwich, &c. towards the top of Shooter's Hill,
of distinctly tracing, as I apprehend, every stratum in the
London clay. 1 have ventured to suggest these, as among
the numerous methods which might be taken to ascertain,
whether     regular strata        have      already   or may hereafter be
reached by the borings or sinkings for the Rotherhithe                    arch
way : justice, perhaps, requires of me to say, in this place, that
the borings above given, and specimens shown to me by Mr.
Vazie, present to me none of the characters of the undisturbed
London strata, but decidedly those of alluvial matters ; and
which matters, I have too much reason to fear, extend
to still vastly greater depths at Rotherhithe.                  I  have hinted
elsewhere, that had the regular or clay-ball stratum appeared
at the surface on each bank of the river, still, before an ex
pensive tunneling is undertaken, it would be prudent to bore
at short intervals across the river sufficiently far into the clay
to ascertain whether any fissures filled with alluvial matters
exist therein under the river, which it may be extremely dif
ficult if not impossible to work through.                     It has long ap
peared probable        to  me,    that    the    vale of  the  Thames, from
Charing-Cross to the Tower on                     the north side,     and from
the foot   of Camherwell Hill             to the foot     of Plough-Garlick
Hill on the south, has been occasioned by two fissures, one
along each of those lines or nearly, and that the whole of
the strata between those lines are sunk down, perhaps, to a
depth far below practicable boring or well-sinking, and that
this chasm (a similar             and    remarkable instance of which          I
have traced at      Woburn, in Bedfordshire,) has been filled up,
almost to its present level, by successive alluvial deposits of
sand, clay, and other matters washed from the neighbouring
eminences     ;   and that,      in   after and more quiet periods, the
growth of peat,          and the gradual subsidence of mud, have
completed       the   filling up of the valley to its present state.

    with Fish Oil.          By Mr. Thomas Vanherman, of
     Mary-le-bone-street,        Golden-square*           .
  In  the session 1805, the Society for the Encouragement of
  Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, voted its silver medal
  and  twenty guineas to         Mr. Vanherman for the following
  communication :
       Gentlemen,
    Having applied       a great portion of my time, for several
 years past,  to  discover     a method of preparing a cheap and
 durable composition for the defence and preservation of all
 work   exposed  to the inclemency           of   the weather,      I  have now
 the satisfaction of laying before the Society for the                   Encou
 ragement of Arts, &c. specimens of some of the above co
 lours ready prepared for use, which will, I flatter myself, be
 found superior to all others for cheapness and durability,
 equal to any in beautv, and not subject to blister or peel off
 by the sun.
    The vehicle made use of for the said paints is fish oil,
the preparation of which is so simple, that, when known,
gentlemen who have large concerns to paint may have this
composition of any colour manufactured, and laid on by
their labourers.      I  have    sent    a bottle      of    the prepared    oil ;
also a number of patterns of various colours.                      The highest
price of any does not exceed threepence per pound, and many
of them so low as twopence, in a state fit for use.                       I have
likewise sent a pot of white lead which has been ground
with prepared fish oil, and which, when thinned with lin
seed  oil, surpasses    any white       hitherto made use of, for re
sisting all weathers and retaining its whiteness.                        I hope
my bumble      endeavours        will  merit      the    approbation of the
society, before whom I will, at any time they shall please
to appoint,   make the various experiments they may require.
    Relying on your encouragement,                 I am, gentlemen, with
due respect,
                       Your most obedient humble servant,

     If  the oil  is wanted   only for coarse purposes,    the linseed
 oil and oil of turpentine may be added at the same time that
 the prepared vinegar is put in, and, after being well shaken
 up, is fit for immediate use without being suffered to settle.
    The vinegar is to dissolve the litharge, and the copperas
 accelerates   the dissolution,   and strengthens the drying qua
 lity.
    The residue, or bottom, when settled, by the addition of
 half its quantity of fresh lime water, forms an excellent oil
 for mixing with all the coarse paints for preserving outside
 work.
    Note. All colours ground in the above oil, and used for
 inside work, must be thinned with linseed oil and oil of
 turpentine.

      First, pour six gallons of lime water into a large tub,
  then throw in 1 1 2 pounds of whiting ; stir it round well
. with a stirrer, let it settle for about an hour, and stir it
  again.       Now you may put in the 1 12 pounds of road dirt,
  mix it well, then add the blue black, after which the yellow
   ochre, and, when all is tolerably blended, take it out of the
  tub and put it on a large board or platform, and with a la
  bourer's shovel mix and work it about as they do mortar.
  Now add the wet blue, which must be previously ground in
  the incorporated oil (as it will not grind or mix with any
  other oil). When this is added to the mass, you may begin
  to thin it with the incorporated oil in the proportion of one
  quart to every eight pounds, and then "the linseed oil in the
  same proportion, and it is ready to be put into casks for
  Vise.

farthing per pound ready to lay on, and the inventor chal
lenges any colourman or painter to produce a green equal
to it for eighteen-pence.
    After painting, the colour left in the pot may be covered

usual, should be cleaned           with    the  painting-knife, and kept

black     ; and

   The Spanish brown must be in powder.
   A  good chocolate colour is made by the addition of blue
black in powder, or lamp black, till the colour is to your
mind,   and a lighter ground may be formed by adding ground
white lead.
   Note. By ground lead is meant white lead ground in oil.
   Yellow is prepared with yellow ochre in powder, in the
same proportion as the Spanish brown.

black or blue black.

                                     §   I.               Pavia, Sept. 23, 1805.
Muriatic Acid may be obtained by Galvanizing Water with
          Gold, Platina, Iron, and Oxide of Manganese.
It    is a long      time since several chemists, who had turned
their     attention    to Galvanic      experiments,       discovered that
muriatic       acid might be produced by these processes.                  Mr.
Simon, of Berlin, the first who made this curious observa
tion, published it in the Journal of Gilbert in 1801.                       He
made use       of two   tubes filled with distilled water.        They    were
closed at the bottom, and placed in communication by means
of a muscular fibre, and a gold wire was passed into each
tube through the corks ; one of these wires communicated
with the positive pole of          a pile of Volta, and the other with
the negative pole. At             the end of twenty-four hours the
water on the zinc side of the pile assumed a yellow tint, and
it liberated a good deal of oxygen gas. This yellow water
had the smell of the oxymuriatic acid ; it whitened the
cork    ; it reddened the tincture of turnsole ; it occasioned an
 effervescence      with the carbonate of potash, with which it
^fterwards      yielded cubical crystals which decrepitated              in the

fire, and the solution         of which    decomposed       the nitrate   of
silver and converted it into muriate        of silver. The
                                                    above che

                       had
riatic acid at first, and afterwards the same acid oxygenated,
which dissolved gold.
   He tried to vary the apparatus            by employing only one
tube bent in the form of the letter        V.   A gold wire was in
serted into each branch, and communicated with the two
opposite poles of the pile.  He did not then obtain any ap
pearance of muriatic acid in the branch on the side of the
positive pole ; and we shall soon see that this acid could
not be formed there, because           the water of this branch was
in    free communication         with that upon which the negative
pole acted. This difference in the results made him suppose
hat the formation of the muriatic acid in his first e,xperi-
ments depended upon the presence of the muscular fibre
which formed part of the Voltaic circuit.
   Cruickshank (Additional Remarks on Galvanic Electri^
city, 1801), on plunging in a solution of muriate of lime
a gold wire communicating    with the positive pole of a pile,
discovered that, after having completed the Voltaic circuit,
the water      of the solution     was decomposed,  that the liquor
became yellow,         assumed   the smell of aqua-regia, and that
the gold wire was attacked. Brugnatelli, upon repeating ihfs
experiment, always observed a yellowish precipitate, which
he discovered was not lime, the base of the muriate, but a
true oxide of gold,
   By proceeding in the same manner with a solution of
muriate of soda, Cruickshank also obtained oxymuriatic
acid, but without the decomposition of any part of the
water; so that this acid must have been of new formation.
Brugnatelli,       upon repeating the experiment" with gold wires
in solutiqns       of muriate of potash and ammonia, likewise
saw oxymuriatic         acid formed by the Galvanic action.
     He   observes,     that the muriates which dissolve      veryi,n
little water, 'as muriate        of   lime, are the most prompt in
evincing     the    production   of oxymuriatic      acid   by   means    of
Galvanism.

sitively galvanized, as well as that which we have men
tioned, is converted afterwards into the oxygenated acid by
the oxygen generated during the process. This is an expe
riment often repeated      by the author,     and always    with suc
cess.
    Pacchiani was the first in Italy who obtained muriatic acid
upon galvanizing with gold wires pure distilled water, after
the manner of Simon       : but this water, being always in con
tact with animal or vegetable matter in the apparatus, it was
supposed that these substances        had some share in this pro
duction.     Several chemists also believed that the muriatic
acid procured by Cruickshank and Brugnatelli from the so
lution of muriates was not a new formation, but proceeded
from a partial decomposition of these saline substances. In
order to settle the dispute, the author galvanized with very
fine gold wires distilled water, which had no connection
whatever with any vegetable          or animal substances, or any
muriate.      His apparatus was     a simple glass tube closed at
bottom and filled with distilled water, in which was inserted
a very fine wire of pure gold (a very essential requisite), or
platina, placed in contact with the positive pole of a pile.
The circuit was completed by another tube, bent, four lines
in diameter, equally full of distilled water,      and which passed
from the tube in which the gold wire was inserted into a dish
full of water, which was placed in communication with the
negative pole by means of a strip of tin, or of caoutchouc
 softened in warm water.
    In  the   first experiment made with this apparatus, the
water galvanized for some hours reddened the blue tinctures
 strongly; but the most sensible metallic re-agents did not
 affect them,     and consequently did not indicate, by any cer
 tain sign, the presence of the muriatic acid.
    The author tried to carry up his pile to a hundred pair of
 disks of two inches, whereas it was only fifty before ; he
 submitted to this new apparatus distilled water contained in
 tubes a little larger than a large  writing-quill,    and two "niches
 long, by employing wires of very pure gold, which he pre
 pared expressly for the purpose ; he then ascertained            that
 the acid obtained      without the   intervention    of any organical
                                                            substance

 substance      was the true muriatic     acid.  It  had    the   same
 smell   l it quickly whitened   the nitrates of silver  and  of mer-
 eury,    and turned the blue tinctures into a lively red.
    With the same apparatus the author afterwards obtained
 muriate     of soda upon galvanizing with a gold wire a weak
 solution of pure soda until all the alkaline character had dis
 appeared.
    Upon galvanizing with       an iron wire instead    of a gold one
 pure water with the positive pole of the pile for sixteen hours,
he obtained a white precipitate, which became a bright blue
 with the prussiate of potash, and black with the infusion of
 galls.
    In  lime water, submitted to the same process, the decom
 position of the water was very rapid. The liquid, when re
duced to two-thirds      pf its volume, exhaled the smell of the
muriatic acid and reddened the blue tincture a little;          it was
formed     of muriate of lime, precipitable by potash but not
at all by oxalic acid, which is consequently a re- agent, not to
be trusted for detecting lime       in its various combinations,
particularly when they are acidulated.
    Induced by theoretical reflections, the author tried to sub
stitute in place of gold the crystallized oxide of manganese
in the Galvanic        decomposition of water.       He filled two
tubes, in each of which was plunged a piece of this oxide
suspended by a copper wire : one of these wires touched the
negative and the other the positive pole of the pile ; the two
tubes    were placed against the inner side of a conical drink-
ing-glass, at the bottom of which water completed the cir
cuit.     The water in the    tubes was in contact   with   the man
ganese     only, and not touching the copper.     At the   end   of 24
hours the water of the positive tube contained muriatic acid
united to     a little manganese, by means of which the silver
precipitated from its solution assumed an obscure red tint.
The water of the positive lube      was strongly alkaline.      There
had been a considerable disengagement         of gas in the      other
tube.     The manganese, however, on the negative side did
not appear to have been reduced by the influence          of the hy
drogen in the act of its formation.

Muriatic Acid h         not obtained   with all   the   Metals from pure
                   Water positively galvanized.
   The author, proceeding in a course of experiments upon
the  reciprocal effects of water and of various metals when
submitted together to the Galvanic action, began with silver.
He placed two thick wires of this metal, as fine as he could
procure  it,  in two separate tubes filled with distilled water,
closed at bottom with parchment, and supported together
against the side of drinking-glass, at the bottom of which
                         a
water completed the circuit.         The wires approached two
opposite poles   of   pile
                        a  of  two  columns,  which communi
cated together     bymeans of     stripe of metal. After being
                                   a
galvanized   some   hours, the  surprise of the author was very
great upon finding the water of the positive tube not at all
acidulated, as   was when gold or platina wires were em
                 it
ployed, but very decidedly alkaline.  The experiment was
often repeated with silver wires still finer, and always with
the same result.
   Upon plunging,    during    whole night, two silver wires
                                  a
coming from the two poles of the pile in the same vessel
full of water, at the distance of some lines from each other,
alkalized water was likewise obtained.
   Copper wires in separate tubes filled with water, yielded
by  the Galvanic action (continued for 12 hours)   good deal a
of hydrogen gas on the side of the negative pole. On the
other side, no gas nor any sign of oxidation was obtained.
The water in the two tubes was alkalized.   Antimony pro
duced the same effects.
   Among       the metals     employed       by
                                       the author as agents in
these Galvanic decompositions,   tin "and zinc evinced them
selves the most energetic in rendering the water alkaline on
the side of the negative pole, where, at the same time,                 a
good deal   of hydrogengas was liberated.               It
                                             was only after             a
very long time that signs of alkalinity were observed on the
sideof the positive pole.

  while   their other extremities were inserted in the water of
  the two separate tubes, produced the following effects : — there
  was,  as  usual, a good deal of gas disengaged at first from the
  negative side, without any sensible alteration in the metal,
  although it was slightly blackened.          On the positive side no
  bubbles were perceived, but a good deal of white oxide was
  formed, which made the water milky, and was partly pre
  cipitated.    At the    end  of six hours of Galvanic action the
  water was     neither acidulated nor alkaline ; but in twelve
  hours it changed the blue tincture of althaea into a green.
     When the two stripes of tin were inserted in one vessel,
  the water constantly became alkaline and of a milky colour
 from the effects    of  the precipitate on the positive side.
     Upon substituting zinc in place of tin in two separate
 tubes, signs of alkalinity were very speedily obtained in the
 water on the negative side l but on the other side very weak
 signs only at the end of twenty-four hours.               Both of the
 stripes of zinc were equally covered with a blackish coat,
 which    the author supposed      to be the hydrogenated metal.
                                  §  III.
 Experiments which demonstrate that, in the Decomposition
    of Water produced with Gold JPtres attached to the posi
    tive Side of the Pile, Muriatic Acid is not always formed.
    The author galvanized nitric acid for twelve hours with a
 gold wire attached to the positive pole of the pile.          Oxygen
 gas   was   continually   liberated.     The  acid  did  not  undergo
 any perceptible change, and the gold was not dissolved,
which proves that aqua regia was not formed in the process.
 Cruickshank, when galvanizing positively this same acid
with platina wires,      and Davy     with gold wires, did not pro
duce any change upon it: but VassalH-Eandi has maintained
that if this same acid is very much concentrated it is de
composed by Galvanism.
    Upon treating in the        same    manner on the positive side
of the pile   a solution   of crystallized   acetate of lead, the gold
wire became speedily        black   towards   the highest part intro
duced ; a little lower, a deep red ; and at last, citron. After
twenty-six     hours continuance      in  the Galvanic   circuit with-
                                                                   uut

out the appearance of gas, the surface of the gold was co
vered with a substance of a brilliant black.        When the gold
wire was taken away the solution remained transparent,
without     the least appearance   of muriate of lead, which would
have been manifested if there had been any production of
muriatic acid. The oxygen, then, was liberated from the
water, and the black coating which covered the gold in the
preceding experiment was hyper-oxygenated lead, as Ritter
had observed.        It was separated in small brittle fragments
like glass.     It was an exciter and a conductor    of Galvanism  ;
It  converted into muriatic acid the oxymuriatic acid gas, by
changing itself, in sight of the operator, into very white
muriate of lead.        Finally, when mixed with phosphorus, it
fulminated by means of percussion.
    When it was tried to substitute the solution of nitrate of
 silver in place of that of acetate of lead, no precipitate was
 obtained at the end of fifteen hours      of Galvanic action ; but
 there was hyper-oxygenated oxide of silver.
    On Galvanizing for two days black oxide of mercury in a
 Straight tube full of distilled water, and communicating with
 the positive side of the pile by a gold wire, the author, in a
 great measure, converted the black into the red oxide ; the
 water of the tube reddened a little the blue tinctures,      but it
 did not contain an atom       of muriate of mercury.

     The author galvanized on the positive side, in a separate
  tube, and with a gold wire, a dilute solution of nitrate of
  mercury made in the cold.         At the end of a few hours the
  wire was covered with very small yellowish crystals of a
  prismatic form.        This salt was not the ordinary muriate
  of mercury, which is opake, very white, and does not cry
  stallize.    It was not a nitrate of mercury, because this is
  soluble in water.       It became as black as charcoal when put
  into lime water ;     and the author is persuaded,   from what he
  remarked, that it was true sweet mercurv.

                       tively ivith a Gold Wire.
      Cruickshank     and other chemists have supposed             that the
  acid formed in water exposed           to the Galvanic action on the
  positive side of the pile is nitric acid. The author observes
  upon this occasion, that silver, which he had often submitted
  to this influence, never yielded (however long or vigorous
  the Galvanic action) any thing else than a brownish gray
  precipitate without the least symptom of nitrate, which,
  being very soluble, ought to have manifested itself in the
  water.    Cruickshank, in maintaining             the existence    of this
  salt in the above      case,   tries   to explain   its  insolubility by
  attributing  it to an excess        of   base as well     as of oxide of
  silver.
     The author, in order     to ascertain if the precipitate of silver
 thus   obtained  contained     any nitric acid, treated it with pure
 potash ; and he never obtained the slightest appearance of
 nitre.
     He placed this precipitate of silver, recently produced,
 in a little tube full of pure water, and galvanized it a whole
 day with a gold wire attached to the positive side of a strong
 pile.    The precipitate remained insoluble; and the water
 did not appear to contain an atom of any salt with a base of
 silver. We shall speak by and by of the difference which
exists between the deposit furnished by silver wire galva
nized in water, according         as  it answers    the   positive or ne
gative side   of the pile.

      Upon the Nature     of   the  Alkali formed in Water          by
                               Galvanism.
    All the chemists who supposed that they had formed an
alkali in water galvanized by the negative side of the pile,
believed that this alkali was ammonia.             Its formation, from
the hydrogen liberated in the process, and a little azote,
which may     be met    with in water even when distilled, ap
peared natural enough.           Our author, however, who never
                                                                    found

  found the characteristics         of ammonia in water thus alka
  lized,   opposes    this opinion.     This water speedily changed
  into green the spirituous tincture of purple allhea, a re-agent,
  according to Brugnatelli, the most sensible of all others to
  the presence of the alkalis ; it whitened the solution of sil
  ver:   sometimes this alkali is effervescent, and precipitates
 lime in lime water ; but it is so diluted in water, that it
  gives  it no sensible    taste.
      An experiment,      made     by the author two years ago, had
 already proved     that Galvanism      does not form ammonia. He
 placed the black oxide         of mercury at the bottom of a tube
 filled with distilled      water, into which a gold wire entered
 in communication         with the negative pole of a pile. At the
 end   of twenty-four hours this wire       was covered  with revived
 mercury wherever it had touched the water. This water re
 mained insipid, but it quickly turned the infusion of althea
 into green.      It might be pretended that it contained ammo-
 niuret of mercury, but no traces of this metallic combina
 tion were found in it ; and although it is always formed by a
 prolonged contact of ammonia (even when very much di
 luted) with oxide of mercury, yet water alkalized by means
 of Galvanism,       however long continued upon this same ox
ide, produces no ammoniuret.
     In order to determine, in short, which of the known al
kalis existed     in water negatively galvanized, the author di
stilled   two  pounds of this liquid, alkalized by Galvanism in
various experiments, with a stripe of tin foil which came in
contact with the negative pole of some very energetic piles.
When       the  distillation   was well advanced, pure water was
found in the receiver, and the residue in the retort had the
smell of fixed alkalis.          Muriatic acid was added to it until
saturation : it was evaporated slowly in the air, and a great
many small cubes of muriate of soda were obtained.
     The author repeated this interesting experiment several
times, and always with the same success.              Supposing that
the soda might come from the pile, the pasteboard disks of
which were impregnated with a solution of common salt,
which had been decomposed by the action of the zinc (as
it   has often done), and made its alkaline base appear out of

the pile under the form of an efflorescence ; he repeated the
experiment with a pile of a hundred pairs of very good
metallic disks, separated by small rounds of pasteboard mois
tened with pure water. This pile not seem ing active enough,
he steeped the disks of pasteboard in a solution of sulphate
of magnesia (Epsom        salt) ; the decomposition     of  the water
succeeded    then very well,     and the alkali produced was again
soda.
   As muriatic     acid was formed by galvanizing       water by the
positive pole, and soda by the negative pole, the author flat
tered himself that by plunging in the same pure water two
gold wires (each of which operated in its own way, t. e. the
one negatively and the other positively), by means of the
action   of a strong pile, of a hundred pairs, he could obtain
common salt ; but although, in consequence of a Galvanic
action thus established and continued for two days, the
vater had considerably diminished, not the least change was
observed,   as had been already     remarked by Pacchiani.      There
was no peculiar smell or taste, no effect upon blue tinc
tures, no precipitate in metallic solutions ; and, upon eva
poration, not an atom of any salt whatever.
   But after having galvanized        several times, both negatively
and positively, a certain quantity of pure water with gold
wires inserted in separate tubes, until the re-agents gave un
equivocal signs of the production of the acid on one part,
and  of alkali on    the other,    the two liquids mixed to perfect
saturation,   and evaporated in the air, always gave cubical
crystallized muriate of soda.         No doubt,' therefore, remains
with the author, that water, negatively and positively gal
vanized by gold wires, produces or disengages muriatic acid
in the one case,     and   soda   in the other.     But he observes,
that the formation     of  the alkali by the effect  of  the negative
pole of the pile ia quicker and more abundant than the
formation of the acid by the influence of the opposite.

  X. New Process for clearing Feathers from tlieir animal Oil.
    By Mrs. Jane Richardson, Willis's Piace, Chelsea*.
 In    the session    of  the Society       of Arts, &c. 1805, twenty
 guineas were adjudged to Mrs. Richardson, being the pre
 mium offered for the best process for clearing feathers.
                               The Process.
     Take for every gallon     of clean water, one pound of quick
 lime; mix them well together,                and   when the undissolved
 lime is precipitated in fine powder, pour off the clear linre-
 water for use, at the time it is wanted.
    Put  the feathers    to be cleared in another tub,             and add to
them a quantity of the clear lime-water, sufficient to cover
the feathers about three inches when well immersed and
stirred about therein.
    The feathers, when thoroughly moistened, will sink down,
and should remain in the lime-water three or four days,
after which the foul liquor should be separated from the
feathers by laying them on a sieve.
    The feathers should be afterwards well washed                    in clean
 water and dried upon nets;         the   meshes     about   the fineness of
cabbage-nets..
    The   feathers  must from time to time be shaken upon the
nets, and     as  they dry will fall through the meshes, and arc
to be collected for use.
    The admission of air will be serviceable in the drying. The
whole process will be completed in about three weeks ; after
being prepared as above mentioned, they will only require
beating for use.
    Mr. Jolly, poulterer, of Charing-cross, attended a com
mittee   of the society appointed to inspect the feathers, and
stated   that Mrs. Richardson           had bought from him forty
pounds weight of       feathers,     in   the state they were plucked
                                                               '

been kept in the bag only four days, without being cleansed,

they would have been very offensive; that the feathers ex
hibited by Mrs. Richardson appear to be the same he had
sold her, but that they were now in a much cleaner state,
and seem perfectly cleared from their animal oil.
    The committee, in order to authenticate more fully the
merits of Mrs. Richardson's process, requested Mr. Grant,
a considerable dealer in feathers, to furnish some specimens
of   feathers   of different kinds in an unclean state, to be
cleansed by Mrs. Richardson ; in consequence whereof an
application was made to Mr. Grant, and the following letter
received from him :

    I  take the liberty of sending herewith three samples of
feathers, on which the experiments may be tried ; but
 should the quantity not be sufficient, on being favoured with
your commands,          shall with pleasure  send   any quantity ne
 cessary.
    The   bag  No. 1, contains the commonest feathers we ever
 make use of — it is a Russian produce of various wild fowl ;
 No. 2, gray Dantzick goose; No. 3, a superior kind of
 Dantzick goose.
    The two first are in their raw state, just taken out of the
 bags in which they were imported;               the last have been
 stoved    the usual time (three days), but retain their un
 pleasant smell.       Should it not be considered giving you too
 much trouble,      shall be extremely obliged by your favouring
 me with a line when the experiment has been made, and I
 shall be happy in waiting upon you to know the result.
                                        I am  respectfully,  Sir,

     After  the feathers    last mentioned were sent back by      Mrs.

  declared that they appeared to he perfectly well cleaned.

her father     a shoe-maker,      for five months had been afflicted
with fits, frequently from eight to ten in a day. The dura
tion of these convulsions was from ten minutes to a quarter
of an hour. At length she became perfectly blind ; and she
had been in this state three weeks when she first came under
my care.       The plan of treatment was             as follows  :

                        Observations  on this Case.
    1.  The marked symptoms in this            case,    with the duration
of   the disease,      and  the sudden    return of vision so quickly
after inhaling a superoxygenated air, is a strong proof of the
efficacy of the means employed.
    2. These fits, with the blindness, arose from the gradual
deposition of water in the brain.
    3. The absorption was occasioned by the powerful action
of the vital air on the absorbents, aided by other tonic me
dicines.                                                 „
   4. Under the other usual practices, this disease commonly
terminates in death ; and even when cured by oxygenated
mercury leaves the constitution so enfeebled, that the patient
soon after falls a victim to some other disease.

 Fifteen guineas were voted by the Society of Arts to
 Mrs. Morris, for communicating this new process, which
 is  as  follows   :
     Take raw      potatoes,    in the state they are taken out of the
 earth, wash them well, then rub them on a grater over a
 vessel of clean water to a fine pulp, pass the liquid matter
 through a coarse sieve into another tub of clear water; let
 the mixture stand till the fine white particles of the potatoes
 are    precipitated, then pour the mucilaginous liquor from
 the fecula, and preserve this liquor for use.                   The article to
 be cleaned should then be laid upon a linen cloth on a table,
 and    having provided a clean sponge, dip the sponge in the
 potatoe-liquor, and apply the sponge thus wet upon the article
 to be cleaned, and rub it well upon it with repeated portions
of the potatoe-liquor, till the dirt is perfectly separated ;
then wash the article in clean water several                     times, to re
move the loose dirt;             it may afterwards            be smoothed or
 dried.
    Two middle-sized         potatoes      will   be sufficient   for  a pint of
 water.
    The white fecula which            separates       in making the mucila
 ginous liquor will answer           the purpose of tapioca, will make
an useful nourishing          food with soup or milk, or serve to
make starch and hair-powder.
    The coarse pulp w hich does not pass the sieve is of great
use in cleaning worsted curtains, tapestry, carpets, or other
coarse goods.
    The mucilaginous liquor of the potatoes will clean all sorts
of silk, cotton, or woollen goods, without hurting the
texture    of  the article,    or spoiling the colour.
    It is  also useful in cleansing           oil paintings,       or furniture
that is soiled.

    Various experiments were made by Mrs. Morris in the
presence       of  a committee, at the society's house     :   the whole
process       was   performed before them upon fine and coarse
goods of different fabrics, and to their satisfaction.

            To the Editor    of the Philosophical Magazine.
A few           evenings ago, when making some electrical ex
periments, the following circumstance occurred, which was
 quite unexpected, and which, I believe, has been very little
 noticed hitherto.         The phaenomenon related by your cor
 respondent C. R. in your numbers for March 1 805 and last
March,        appears to be occasioned by the same cause.
    Happening to take two cylindrical pieces of wood, covered
 with tin-foil, in my hands to discharge a loaded jar — on re
moving these cylinders from each other (after the discharge
had been made) there was a small adhesion between them,
 which     I  at first thought might be occasioned by a piece           of
wax, but this was not the case; this adhesion                I  perceived
 several     times that evening, and also since, and sometimes
there was a small protuberance raised at the part where the
 cylinders touched ; I also perceived the same sort of adhesion
 between one of the cylinders and the coating.            The phaeno
 menon alluded to above, of your correspondent's, is that of
 a shilling, or other piece of metal, which being placed
 between       the knob   of the discharger   and the coating     of ajar
 adhered to the side      of the jar after the discharge : this experi
 ment    I   tried and succeeded     in; a shilling adhered for longer
 than twelve hours to the coating, and perhaps if it had not
 been taken off might have kept on for days.             Whether this
 adhesion and that before mentioned betwixt the cylinders
 were caused by a fusion         of the tin-foil or not,       I will  not
take -on me to determine.          I  once conjectured that this effect
                                                                      was

                       On the Cometarium.                       73
was caused by a vacuum (of air) being made by tbe passage
of the electric fluid : but I scarcely think, had this been the
case, that the shilling would have adhered for so many hours
as- it did.    I hope your readers will be induced to make ex
periments for the purpose of determining the cause of the
adhesion, which appears to be a remarkable circumstance,
and worth attending to.

XIV.     Letter from Ez.     Walker,    on his Instrument   called
           a Cometarium, described in our last Volume.
_       SIR,
                          To Mr. Tilloch.
                                                Lynn, May 31, 1806.
  JL he editor of the Retrospect of Philosophical, Mechanical,
 Chemical, and Agricultural Discoveries, after having copied
from your Magazine, No. 93, most part of my paper respect
ing an instrument which I have called a cometarium, makes
 the following observations :
     " This contrivance is founded upon a property of the convex
 lens, which does not appear to be generally known : it will
 probably furnish a representation of the figure of a comet
 more accurate and natural in most respects than has hitherto
 been obtained.      But the name of cometarium is not very
 appropriately applied to the instrument, since it neither ex
 hibits the relative magnitudes of the sun and comet, nor
 nearly the true orbit and motion of the. latter. Indeed, there
  is reason    to apprehend that the contrivance,     so far from
 serving    as  a cometarium in its present state,    cannot even
 be adapted successfully to any system      of machinery which
  will correctly exhibit the phaenomena   of the solar system."
  — Retrospect, vol. ii. p. 20.
     The objections made by this gentleman        to the name     of
  my instrument do not appear to be well founded ; for a pla
  netarium neither exhibits the relative magnitudes, distances,
   motions, nor the true figures of the orbits of  the planets, and
                                                                 yet

   74                        On the Cometarium.
  yet the instrument is called a planetarium notwithstanding.
  Nor, indeed,       has any system of machinery yet been made
  **
      which    will correctly exhibit the phenomena of the solar
  system."
      " An orrery     is a very fit machine to show the system of
 the world, and some of them have been made at an enor
 mous expense, with a great multiplication of wheels and
 other parts, by which means they have imitated the prin
 cipal movements of the celestial bodies ; but even the best
 of them fall very short of real accuracy, and of course they
 are quite unfit       for the purposes , of calculating    the future
 situations of      the celestial bodies."  — Cavalh's Elemtnts of
 Philosophy, vol. iv. p. 281.
     My cometarium was never intended to be adapted to any
 system of machinery made for exhibiting the phaenomena of
 the solar system ; for those phaenomena are so various, that
it is found expedient to exhibit different parts of the system
by different machines        ; and, perhaps, this is the best way of
exhibiting the phaenomena of a comet.                The instrument
 described in my former paper was intended only to represent
a comet revolving in a circular orbit, with its tail turned
from the sun; but        I have since added machinery, constructed
on the principle of the elliptical compasses, by which a comet
may be represented as describing an elliptical curve, either
accompanied with a tail as before, or when deprived of that
luminous appendage, by taking away the great lens.
     The sun is now represented by a lamp placed in a lantern
with    lenses so adjusted     as  to throw a circular  spot of light
upon the screen.          This lantern Elands between the cometa
rium and the screen, but unconnected            with either,   so that
the sun is represented       as stationary in the focus ofithe ellipse
which      the  comet describes. Although the instrument is
turned only by hand, yet by this means the relative motion
of a comet may be shown sufficiently near the truth for con
veying a general idea ; but those who wish for a more regular
motion      may easily add machinery for that purpose.            The
effects of this apparatus are seen to advantage upon a trans
parent screen, and, when used in this manner, it promises
to b« useful in a lecture-room.
                                                                  The

    The optical principle on which this instrument is con
 structed seems to merit more attention than I have hitherto
been able to pay to it ; and in the instrument itself there is
still room for further improvements.

   With    great pleasure we announce this useful publication,
which may     be considered as a new           work, though modestly
announced     as   only  a  new edition     of the work published be
fore under the same title. We consider this as one of the very
best works that has yet appeared on the subject of which it
treats. While it presents a well arranged collection of che
mical facts and processes, it is at the same time well adapted
to direct a learner to such a train of simple and easy experi
ments as may best enable him to make rapid progress in ac
quiring correct     ideas  of the theory.        It embraces   all the new
facts that have arisen since the last edition was published,
and is illustrated with engravings of every article of appa
ratus that is essential to the pursuit of operative chemistry.
They   are by  Lowry, and         executed   with his usual accuracy,
precision, and elegance.

   Chemist.     8vo.    Published      by Symonds.       Price 12s. 624
   Pages.
   The object of this publication             is to   unfold  the science
of chemistry     to artizans and young people            by way of ques
tion and answer.          It is written    in   an elegant and popular
manner, and rendered          as   amusing as it is instructive.       The
answers are concise, and fitted for the memory.                      Occa
sionally the subject is dilated, and difficulties cleared up by
a more ample elucidation, and this is very properly brought
forward in the form        of notes.
   The work is divided into thirteen chapters ; viz. Chap. I.
Introductory and Miscellaneous: II. Of Atmospheric Air :
III. Of Caloric: IV. Of Water: V. Of Earths : VI. Of
Alkalies: VII. Of Acids: VIII. Of Salts: IX. Of Simple
Combustibles      :   X. Of Metals : XI. Of Oxides            :   XII.   Of
Combustion: XIII. Of Attraction, Repulsion,                     and   Che
mical Affinity.       Each of      these  chapters is a distinct tract,
                                                                         in

hi question      and answer,       with full explanatory notes neatly
printed at the bottom of each page. The Appendix contains
34 pages of additional notes, which are extremely interest
ing; 14 pages of Chemical Tables, some of which are en
tirely new;         154 instructive     and   amusing Experiments; a
very copious Vocabulary of Chemical Terms ; and a general
Index to the whole.
      A few short extracts will be sufficient to point out the
 method       of  the author,      and the perspicuity with which the
several subjects are treated.            From Chap.        III.  Of Caloric,
p. 113.      " Will     the thermometer     sliow the quantity of caloric
 in all bodies P       No   :  it will not show that portion which is
 latent or chemically combined with any body : for instance,
 fluids require a certain portion of caloric to keep them in a
 state    of fluidity   ; which portion is not indicated by the ther
 mometer.          Is the thermometer,      then, of   no use in ascertain
  ing the temperature af fluids           P   Yes  :  fluids operate upon
 the thermometer in the same manner as solids ; for what
 ever free caloric be contained in any liquid, that portion is
  accurately shown by the thermometer.                   What do you call
  that portion of caloric which is a necessary part of fluids P
  It is called the caloric of fluidity; but different fluids require
  different portions -of it to preserve them in the state of fluids.
   What are the effects of caloric upon bodies P The general
  effects   of caloric    are to increase the     bulk of     the substances
  with which it unites,          and to render them specifically lighter
   than they were before.           What are the particular effects of
   caloric on bodies P It favours the solution of salts, and pro
   motes the union of many substances. In other cases it serves
   to separate bodies already united ; so that in the hands of
   chemists it is the most useful and powerful agent we are
   acquainted with.           Can you recollect any other effect that
   caloric has upon bodies P           It is the cause of fluidity in all
   substances      which      are capable   of becoming fluid, from the
   heaviest    metal to the lightest gas.            How does caloric act
   upon hard bodies to convert them into fluid P It insinuates
    itself among their particles, and separates them from each
    other.    Thus     ice is converted into water, and, by a further
    portion of caloric, into steam."
                                                                            In

      In the chapter of Earths, each earth is first separately
  described, with its distinguishing characteristics ; then the
  origin of each ; and, lastly, its uses in the arts and ma
  nufactures.      In  the subsequent chapters    the alkalies, acids,
  oxides,   and    sails,   are treated  in an equally    perspicuous
  manner.      The chapter on Metals occupies 72 pages, and is
  thus divided.      First we have the characteristics of metals in
  general, how they are procured and purified, and how classed
 by modern chemists.           Each metal is then separately treated
 of under     five   distinct  heads, thus : — " How is platina pro
 cured? What is the nature of platina? What is the effect
 of oxygen on platina? What salts are formed of platina?
 What are the vses of platina?" Direct answers are given
 to each of these questions, which are further elucidated by
 a large body    of  very valuable and learned notes.    The chapter
 concludes with an interesting recapitulation         of  the general
 properties of that class of bodies.                          -
    A few extracts from the Notes to this excellent work, we
 trust, will not be unacceptable to our readers.         Thus in the
 chapter on Air:
                       "  Every chemist must be aware that a large
 quantity of cariuretted hydrogen gas is evolved at the sur
face of the earth ; he must also know that this gas is fatal
to animal life.       I could adduce a melancholy instance of a
gentleman who inhaled it by mistake, and died almost im
mediately in consequence of it.          How then has the all-wise
Artificer of the world contrived to protect its inhabitants
from the baneful influence of that immense quantity with
which     the atmosphere is perpetually contaminated          ?  The
means are as simple as they are important.            Vegetables are
so constituted      that   carbon  and  hydrogen are the necessary
food of    plants, and conduce to the support of vegetable life:
their vegetating organs seize the carbonic acid gas which
comes within their reach, and, while they appropriate the
carbon to themselves, the oxygen is thrown off to renovate
the atmosphere by its union with the nitrogen rejected by
animal respiration.         Thus, what is noxious" to man is ren
dered beneficial to vegetables; and the oxygen, which vege
tables are not in want of, is separated by them in its utmost
purity for the use      of man."     In the chapter on Water the
                                                           following

                    Notices respecting New Books.                    1%
following remark occurs        :—
                                   " Nature,    in (Economizing    the
primary materials of the universe, has constituted oxygen
the basis both of the atmosphere which surrounds the earth,
and of    the water   which forms its     seas and oceans.      We  see
in this   and other instances, by what simple means the most
beneficial effects have been produced."
         " For mark how oxygen with azote gas
           Plays round the globe in one aerial mass;
           Or, fused with hydrogen, in ceaseless flow,
           Forms the wide waves which foam and roll below."
                                                               Darwin.
    We copy the following remark from the chapter on Salts :
— " It is remarkable      that, though phosphate of lime is always
 found in the urine of adults, this salt is not evacuated by
 infants.     The rapid formation of the bones in the first pe
 riods of life requires that there should be no waste of any
 of the phosphoric salts ; and Nature, ever provident, has
 provided accordingly."
    The following note occurs in the chapter on Metals : —
 "   A combination of the white oxide of tin with sulphur, by
means of mercury, forms aurum musivum, an article used
 by artists to give a beautiful        colour to bronze.      I suspect
 that the change produced in tin by this process gave rise to
 the idea of the transmutation of metals.             If the alchemists
 were acquainted with this substance, no wonder that they
  should indulge the hope of being able to form gold.               An
 experimentalist without theory is the dupe of every illusion."
 The chapter of Metals concludes with this remark : — It is      "
  no unusual thing for the votaries of chemistry to call it a
  fascinating science. That it is the most useful of all sci
  ences, cannot be denied ; nor can there be the least doubt
  that it has a strong tendency to enchant those who devote
  their attention to it. It serves as a powerful stimulus to
  youth, by occupying their time so satisfactorily to them
  selves,  and rendering all low and unworthy pursuits truly
  detestable."      The chapter of Oxides is closed with the fol
  lowing note     : — " All  organized beings, whether vegetable
  or animal, possess the materials of which they are composed
                                                                   only

  only for   a  limited time      :  life itself is a boon which is only
  lent to serve the purposes of infinite beneficence.                 At the
  proper period oxygen, or some other powerful agent, effects
  the decomposition of the curious fabric, and sets all the ele
 mentary particles at liberty,             to form     other equally perfect
 and complicated existences,
          " Which thus, alternating with death, fulfil
            The silent mandates of the Almighty's will ;
            Whose hand, unseen, the works of nature dooms
            By laws unknown, — who gives and who resumes."
     The chapter of Experiments concludes with the following
 note: — " To read or practise the foregoing experiments
 merely for the sake of amusement, may occasionally have
 its advantages ; but a resolution to repeat them, and examine
 all the phaenomena, for the sole purpose of receiving instruc
 tion, is what the author would principally inculcate.                   Let
 it never   be forgotten, that no effect, however extraordinary,
 or even trivial, it may appear to us, can ever happen but in
 consequence of some previously established law of unerring
nature.      The following apostrophe of Dr. Darwin to the
Fountain of all goodness, may possibly tend to impress this
important truth upon the student's mind                  :
              "  Thus, at thy potent nod, effect and cause
                  Walk hand iu hand, accordant to thy laws ;
                  Rise at volition's call, in groups combin'd,
                  Amuse, delight, instruct, and serve mankind."
     Prefixed to this work is            " An   address to parents on the
importance of        an early cultivation       of  the understanding,   and
on the advantages          of giving youth         a taste for chemical in
quiries," in which the use of chemical knowledge to the
superintendants of a variety of manufactories is pointed out
in considerable detail, and placed in several striking points
of view.
    We cannot conclude without strongly recommending this
work, not only for the instruction of youth and mechanics,
but also to Chemists,           as  furnishing an admirable epitome of
chemistry, and          as  giving a number of new observations
chiefly relating to the manual part of the science.                It is not

 Poland,    executed by     M. Frey, from professor Vogel's draw
ings   ; and   will  also   hand down to posterity engravings of
the monuments, palaces, and antiquities, &c. of that country,
hitherto so little known.         This work of Messrs. Vogel and
Frey is the first attempt of the kind in Poland, and deserves
the attention of all the friends of science throughout Europe.

     June 19. The President in the chair. — E. Home, esq. fur
 nished an interesting paper on the comparative anatomy and
 physiology of the camel, particularly on its stomachs and
 water-bags, or reservoirs, in which it can retain a quantity
 of water sufficient         to support    it for  several weeks.     The
 camel, like all other ruminating animals, has several sto
 machs : the first receives its food, in which it remains un
 changed ; the second, its water, which also remains pure ;
 the third communicates to the water a yellow colour ; and
 the fourth unites the contents of the others, and is the ge
 neral digesting organ of this animal's food. The author con
 firms the account of this animal given by Bufibn, whose vivid
eloquence is no where more happily applied, nor more
agreeably, than in the history of the camel.                Mr. Brande
analysed     the water contained in the stomach,           and also the
animal's      urine  ;   in the latter he found, besides carbonate of
ammonia, uric acid, which is considered rather singular in
this class of animals, and might perhaps be the product of
disease, as the creature was old and decaying before it was
put to death for the purpose of dissection.

    June 5. Sir H. C. Englcficld, bart. vice-president, in thq
chair. — An account was read of the spleudid equipage and
sumptuary retinue of the earl of Northumberland at his em
barkation       for France       in the reign of Henry VIII.         The
Rev.    Mr.   Milner exhibited a small M.S. volume, bound in
red leather, (supposed          to be of the time of  queen  Elizabeth)
written     011   parchment,       in Roman     characters mixed with
Saxon, of the gospel of St. John in Latin.              The learned au
thor traced the existence and history of this volume to the
time of St. Cuthbcrt, of Durham, who died early in the
sixth century, and contended that it must be more than
1200 years old        !   To   prove  this high antiquity, a tradition
respecting the funeral of St. Cuthbcrt was circumstantially
                                                            <U+2666>

  and the existence (as supposed) of the present M.S. being
 entrusted to three friars, at the death of one of whom it is
 to be communicated to another, and in this manner perpe
 tuated to the latest posterity, always known only to three
 friars ! The Roman characters of this M.S. are all in capi
 tal letters, without any points or marks, and written in short
 and long lines irregularly.
    June 12. The President in the chair.^An etching by
 Mr. Moore, of the florid gothic church of St. Mary Mag
 dalen, at Taunton, was exhibited ; likewise a gun of a con
 struction in use very early after the invention of gunpowder.
 The stock, which is heavy, is covered with figures partly
 gilded and delineated in the same style as the paintings in
 the illuminated M.S.S. of the fourteenth century, and also
 consisting of scripture history pieces.
    Several    particulars respecting the death and burial-place
 (St. John's, Westminster) of sir' Walter Raleigh were read,
 as was a curious account of the embalment, or rather of the
 preparation of the body of queen Catharine Parr with
wax, &c. What will render these facts highly important to
many is the following singular circumstance, not generally
 known ; that the tomb of this queen was opened not long
 since, and the body, more especially the face, found as per
 fect and as beautiful as the day she died ! The action of the
atmosphere, however, produced           a sensible and instantaneous
 effect.
    June   19.  Mr. Orde in the chair. — The Rev. Mr. Stone
 communicated several decrees or regulations of Henry VIII.

French,     and   in  a  black letter character.    Their antiquity,
and not their contents, constituted their merit.

    It  has been observed, that those who        cultivate any parti-?
cular branch of      experimental science are solicitous     of asso
ciating with others engaged in similar studies ; a common
interest in the same subject of conversation excites a spirit
of inouiry ; thought gires rise to thought ; and new ideas,

collected in the friendly intercourse of society, often lead fo
investigations of the greatest importance. The student finds
many difficulties removed which impede his progress, by the
ready information he obtains from men of higher acquire
ments, whilst those who are skilled in chemical pursuits
frequently receive important observations from the mere
lover of the science ; to this may be added, that men, how
ever great their learning or ardour may be for any particular
branch of inquiry, yet, when deprived of the opportunity of
communicating their ideas to others, not only become neg
ligent and uninterested in improving the stock of knowledge
they already possess, but are seldom solicitous about the
further cultivation of their mental powers.
   From a conviction of these truths, a number of gentle
men who have a taste for philosophical chemistry are deter
mined to form themselves into a society, in which the ta
lents of a number may be united, and become extensively
useful   to each other, by mutual communication of their
views,   their labours, and acquisitions. That their endeavour
may prove as interesting as possible, particularly to those
promoters of chemical science who cannot devote much
time to the perusal of literary journals and periodical publi
cations, arrangements will be made to collect, as speedily as
possible, all the chemical news which issue from the labora
tories of other operators, both at home and on the conti
nent ; and correspondences will be established to obtain the
earliest and best information respecting whatever shall offer
itself as new and important in the departments of chemistry,
of natural philosophy,   and the arts and manufactures,  which
are dependent on these      branches of knowledge.    To keep
pace with the existing state of chemical science, the intelli
gence thus collected shall be regularly detailed in their re
spective meetings ; and a book of reference kept as a register,
containing the growing mass of philosophical information,
which will be laid on the table for the use of the members ;
together with all those publications and academical journals
of repute which exhibit the transactions of ingenious men
in  every part  of the world.
   The views of this society, however, will not   be confined
                                                             to

                      London Chemical Society.                          £5
 to the mere detail      of literary intelligence      and chemical con
versations ; a principal part of their labour will devolve to the
practical department of the laboratory.               To accomplish this
as perfectly as possible, all the interesting discoveries, which
from time    to time enrich the domain            of chemistry,  and par
ticularly those complicated, expensive, and difficult experi
ments, which can be repeated by few individuals only, shall
be exhibited in their own laboratory ; being persuaded, that
important experimental inquiries, when once witnessed, sel
dom fail to excite that degree of ardour which gives increas
ing energy to scientific research.
   From this     the Chemical      Society will direct their attention
to all such original and specific experiments as may indivi
dually be proposed, and the results they afford shall be mi
nuted in the journal of the laboratory kept for that purpose,
and afterwards published in such a manner as may be di
rected.    These     inquiries will embrace          whatever is deemed
worthy of experimental research in the extensive departments
of philosophical, practical and technical chemistry. It is
perhaps   needless     to state,   that their laboratory will be open
for the analysis of      ores, soils, manures, and such substances
in general as are found in           the    British dominions,    and are
deemed    of private or public importance.
   And,   as  it is certain that the progress        as well as the accu
rate and extensive ideas,         which the cultivators of chemical
science may acquire, are greatly facilitated and promoted
by attending to the manipulations and processes of the prac
tical chemist ; it is likewise intended, that all the multifa
rious operations of the laboratory shall be regularly employed
for obtaining from the trade materials of nature, all those
substances    which     the society requires as instruments        of  re
search, or as specimens of truths, as well as those articles
used in the chemical arts, and by manufacturers and artists.
This part of the views of the Chemical Society will consti

    the annual subscription fixed at three guineas.
        An unlimited number of gentlemen, residing in            the coun

    annually, which shall entitle them to visit the Societv as
    members whenever they reside in the capital, provided their
    stay. in town does not exceed three months.
        After    the  first meeting the admission of members shall
    be decided by ballot, and those who are not inclined to adopt

        A code of laws will be formed, and proper officers elected
    so as to form a regular society, which shall bedenominated

        The admission of members is for the present confined to
    a committee, who, on the present occasion, address the
    chemical public, and request,- that such gentlemen as are

   THE NEW RUPTURE SOCIETY, FOR THE RELIEF OF BOTH
       SEXES AFFLICTED WITH HERNIARY COMPLAINTS AND
      PROLAPSES.
      With     a view to interest the public        in the success of this
  institution, it is thought necessary            to submit to them the
 following concise statements, with               respect to the nature  of
 those calamities for the relief of which it is intended.              The
 facts here mentioned, it is presumed, will be amply suffi
 cient to excite attention and to induce inquiry.
      It has been estimated that at least one person in fifteen is
 ruptured : but among those classes of the community which
 are much exposed to laborious employment, the average
 may be fixed       at one   in eight or nine. The proportion, how
ever,     of   sufferers  from    this disease, is incomparably greater
in places of which the situation is low and damp, and the
atmosphere relaxing.             The committee of this institution,
which      the public are now requested          to patronise, have been
credibly      informed,     that, in some      particular   parishes, this
proportion may be computed at even a fourth                of the labour
                       '

     This complaint       is not confined to any particular        age or

sex*, nor is it the consequence of depraved habits or im
moral behaviour : but it arises from a natural bodily defect,
or from very unusual exertions, at any period of life ; and
can be neither foreseen nor avoided, either by the wealthy or
the poor.       Its tendency is so alarming, that without timely
aid   it generally terminates by a painful and rapid dissolution,
in early life, or during the vigour of manhood ; although,
in a majority of cases, its fatal consequences may almost
certainly be prevented            by the application        of  an appropriate
truss or compress.
    Prolapses (a species of disorder vulgarly called a bearing
down of the body) are extremely similar to ruptures, ori
ginating in a similar infirmity of the bodily frame, and re
quiring a like plan of treatment. They are not, indeed,
equally common; but yet occur much more frequently than
an inattentive observer might be apt to suppose, and are espe
cially incident to the weaker sex.               The idea of delicacy at
tached to this complaint,           hae   the effect of concealing from
public    view   both  the   number     and  the sufferings of its victims ;
circumstances which could not fail, were they fully known,
to produce a powerful impression on every humane and be
nevolent mind.          But perhaps the sufferings adverted to will
not     bear  a  minute     description; and it may therefore suffice
generally to observe, that they can hardly be conceived, ex
cepting by, those who have had some opportunity of knowing
them, either from personal or from professional experience.

  Among     the afflicted poor, where no means                    of relief have
been resorted   to during       the existence          of ruptures
                                                         and pro
lapses,   the unhappy   objects  are  commonly      disabled from
fulfilling the ordinary duties of their stations ; insomuch that
in the army and navy it is an invariable rule to dismiss from
the service those men who become ruptured by the violence
of their exertions.       How lamentable           a    fact is   it,   that many
thousands of individuals, perhaps during the period of full
health and activity, should drag on   most useless and mi
                                               a
serable life,   for want      of either
                                the means or the knowledge
requisite to obtain relief, when that knowledge and those
means can so easily be provided           by
                                   their affluent neighbours                       !
  The extreme danger of these complaints, and the great
inconveniences entailed on those pitiable beings who survive
their misfortune, have given birth to an innumerable host
of truss-sellers, rupture-mongers, women-doctors, and igno
rant impostors  so that         "
                           no disease," as the late celebrated
                           "
                 ;
Mr. Pott observes,     has ever furnished such        constant      a
succession of quacks  as ruptures have."    These pretenders
are to be found in almost every city, town, and village
                          '
throughout this kingdom      for whoever can forge an iron
                                  ;

lified to undertake the cure of an infirmity, the treatment of
which demands      much anatomical and surgical knowledge
                     as
as that of any disorder incident to human nature.                             If   a
greater mischief can happen to the ruptured poor than the
malady with which they are visited,      that of unhappily
                                                   it   is
falling into the hands of unprincipled self-taught rupture-
doctors and truss-makers, who have no ideas beyond those
pf money-getting  and mechanical action.
   The   great national importance of relieving the necessitous
and  afflicted class of people here alluded to, must be suffi
ciently obvious to every reflecting mind; and, when                           it   is
distinctly made known how small         sum will be annually
                                               a
required for the comfort and security of so many deplorable
Sufferers, no feeling spectator of such wretchedness can
withhold his contribution. The expense of procuring truss,                a
and   other incidental    means for the relief of   ruptured        a
person,   need    not, with proper arrangements, exceed the

   sum of nine shillings, provided it be a single rupture of the
   groin or thigh; and in cases of double ruptures, as well as
  in those which occur near the navel, the expense will seldom
  exceed     eighteen shillings for each patient.                 The apparatus
  for prolapses will not, in general, be more expensive than
  for ruptures.
      By adopting a system of oeconomy * in the formation and
  management of a permanent fund for these purposes, a
  number of subscribers of one or two guineas each, per
  annum,      may be enabled       to administer consolation              to thou
  sands    of their fellow-creatures,          who would otherwise die
 miserably, or live unprofitable members of the community.
      One objection, and only one, it is here proper to antici
 pate, lest some benevolent persons should suppose there is
 no absolute necessity for the establishment of this institu
 tion ; namely, " that there already exists a society for these
 specific objects."
      During    the year 1 796, a society was formed in this metro
 polis   for  the  sole purpose of gratuitously affording surgical
 assistance      and trusses to ruptured persons, of either sex,
 in indigent circumstances. The benefits of that establish
 ment were extended to those ruptured soldiers and sailors
 (properly recommended by their commanding officers) who
 had been dismissed from his majesty's service ; on which
 account the war-office contributed fifty pounds per annum
 towards the support of that society.                   Popurar instructions
 were likewise printed and circulated by the subscribers, for
 conveying       to the    afflicted poor such needful information
concerning the nature and consequences of ruptures as
 should lead them to adopt means for their personal safety.
But, unfortunately, some circumstances occurred which in
duced the principal patrons of that institution (after calling
a general meeting) to discontinue their sanction, and at
length to withdraw from it entirely.
     These facts are now too publicly known to require further
    •  The surgeon and all the other officers of this new institution, except the
collector,  serve gratuitously; and there is no expense whatever for house-
rent, or committee-rooms, 3tc. &c. — so that nearly the whole of the funds of
this society are exclusively applied to the relief of the afflicted poor.
                                                                   explanation.

 sent appeal in behalf of the ruptured poor to state, that there
 is ample room to commiserate and improve their condition,
 notwithstanding former efforts to relieve them. With such
 design, a new and efficient institution has been recently
 established for the relief of ruptured persons, which will af
 ford a similar extension .of benefits to the army and navy as
 soon as the funds shall prove adequate for that purpose. At
 the same time it is resolved, that this new institution shall
include, within the sphere of its bounty, a description of
 sufferers (namely, persons afflicted with prolapses) who have
 hitherto been left unprotected and forsaken.
    The affairs of the New Rupture Society are managed by a

Vice-patrons, one president, twelve or more vice-presidents,
 two joint treasurers, all the life subscrihers of fifteen guineas,

 each) as may be approved by a ballot of the said committee,
 and confirmed at an annual general meeting ; among whom
are also included      the surgeon or surgeons, and secretary        or
 secretaries   for the time being, so long as they or either of
them do render his or their services gratuitously to this in

 denominated members,           and are allowed   to recommend     pa

    For every guinea subscribed per annum,              as well as for
every    life subscription, two patients (whether afflicted with
 ruptures or prolapses) may be recommended within the year,
to be provided with trusses or bandages not exceeding the
expense of nine shillings each ; or one patient, requiring a
 truss or bandasre valued at more than nine shillings, and not
 above eighteen     shillings.    The same ratio to be observed, and
 similar advantages       extended in the like proportion, to sub

the cow-pock      inoculation,   under   the  regulations of this in
stitution, according to their experience, is decidedly prefera
ble to that of the small-pox.
    2. That since the offered      reward of five guineas to any
person who has been here certified, not one has applied in
consequence of a failure.
    3. That, in general, patients decline to accept of the cer
tificate, on account of their experience showing the security,
after vaccination, on living with persons ill of small-pox.
    4. That   as   in a small proportion persons considered to
have been duly vaccinated have taken the small-pox, it is
thought proper to grant certificates to those only who have
been duly tested at this institution.
    5. To give further satisfaction, and        considering that the
vaccine disorder is a new morbid          affection, which requires
investigation (one of the great objects of this institution) it
is requested that any persons who apprehend that they have
taken the small-pox, or have any disorder from vaccination,
will apply   to the board any Tuesday or       Fridavat   one  o'clock,
to execute    the design    of  a faithful publication     of accumu

    Dr. Pearson communicated         several   instances of failures
after vaccine inoculation,      which, from the respectability of
the practitioners under whom they occurred, arid the accu
racy of their detail, must be admitted.          He had been fortu
nate in not, to   Jiis knowledge, having had, in his own         prac
tice, a single instance of small-pox after cow-pock ; but,
from what has of late happened, it would be unjust to
 ascribe the exemption to any ciroumstance but an early
 opinion that    the vaccine disorder would require some years
 to complete its investigation for secure practice, and hence
to use precautions not taken by those who represented the
 subject as exhausted on its first promulgation.         It is in vain
 any longer   to impute   the failures to  the  matter taken   beyond
 the appearance     of the areola ; the use   of a rusty lancet ; the
 bursting of   the vesicle ; the use   of  " spurious matter" ; the
 susceptibility of taking small-pox more than once, and there
 fore of small-pox after cow-pock; the using matter              " de
 composed" by drying on a warmed lancet, or by the heat
 of sealing-wax melted in sealing       a letter containing matter;
 the inserting the vaccine fluid into a wound deeper than the
 skin, &c. 8cc. These circumstances served as bolsters to
 prop up the practice by those who were either too inexpe
 rienced to know, or did not possess candour to own, that
 experience was wanting to determine the advantages of the
 new practice.      The publications in favour of vaccination are
 written, for the most part, with the spirit of animosity and

 without due regard to the laws of evidence.              Neither party
 seems to   be   aware    that vaccination may leave one out of a
 thousand still liable to the small-pox, and yet finally be ren
 dered to effect the grand objects in view, viz. the extermina
 tion of the small -pox, by substituting an. affection that in not
 one case of a hundred is worth calling a disease, and pro
 duces death scarcely once in ten thousand cases ; for small
 pox inoculation,     which produces a severe disease in one case
 of 25,   and death    in one of 150 or 200 inoculated persons.

                            SOLAR ECLIPSE.
 We      have   received an account of two observations of the
eclipse  which     took place on the 16th of June.           One of the
observers, situated in long. 11 ",5 east of the royal observa
tory, saw the beginning at 4h 38ra 49s M. T. The other.,
situated   in   about long.     l",0 west,      observed    the end   at
5h 57m   54'   M. T.      The beginning of      the eclipse took place
about   2m  27' later than the tables gave it.          The end agrees
to  within   about 6" of the calculated time.

    We   are happy to    inform our     readers    that the statement
of the  death   of Mr. Chenevix,       the celebrated    chemist, con
tained in    a  foreign journal,     is altogether erroneous,     as we
arc well assured that the last accounts from Constantinople
announced him to have arrived safe and well in that city.

   At Sir   Joseph Banks's converzatione on the 22d of June,
a very curious and perfect fossil tooth, belonging to an ele
phant, or to some other huge animal of a former period, was
exhibited.     It is twelve inches long,near six broad, and of a
proportionate thickness.         This surprising tooth seems to
Jiave belonged to a young animal,           as less  than unerthird of
                                                                     it*

  this tooth sawed in two lengthways and polished, by which
  its internal organization is finely shown.          It was stated that
  this tooth was lately found on the surface of the great clay
  stratum near Ealing, or Acton, in Middlesex, about 1G feet
  beneath a bed      of gravel.

      Late experiments      made at   Berlin  have ascertained   that the
  yellow beet-root       (Leta luted) yields    more than double the
   quantity of sugar that       any    other species   of that vegetable
   affords.
                              MISCELLANEOUS.
      The following extraordinary event took place on the 4th
   of May last at Assmanshauseu, in the electorate of Mentz :
   —About three o'clock in the morning the earth was heard to
   crack with    a  most dreadful noise : every body was alarmed,
   but nobody     knew    the cause.     At day-light it was perceived
   that the high mountain near the village had opened about
   the breadth of a hand, and about eight o'clock it extended
   to about seven or eight inches.            Between two atid three
   o'clock in   the afternoon a considerable part       of the mountain
   fell down, and covered four houses, the inhabitants          of which
   had fortunately escaped.
       Owing to the cold on the night of Wednesday, the 14th
   of May, several hundreds of the swallow tribe, called mar-
.
   tins,  had clung to the toll table against the turnpike house
   at Whalley, in Yorkshire : those again had others covering
   them four or five feet in thickness, all of whom seemed quite
   in  a torpid state.     Several dozens were stroked off the board,
   and those taken up appeared completely lifeless ; until about
   seven o'clock on Thursday morning, when the sun's warmth
   caused re-animation,        and   they gradually moved off to the
   water-side,     a  distance of about 30 yards.        In a short time
    afterwards they began to skim the surface of the water, and
   fly with the usual vigour of those birds.

           GENTLEMEN,                                       Vienna, Sept. 24, 1805.
   W   hen I last wrote       to you on the subject          of that  celebrated
  quadruped the shawl goat of India f, I think I informed you
  that I intended to lay my philosophical friends in Asia under
  contribution,      by requesting communications from them of
  anything     remarkable       in medicine, surgery, or the materia
 medica. The most zealous and most regular of my corre
 spondents is Dr. Milne, at present residing at Goa, and from
 him I have received some interesting details upon two of the
 diseases   of India,     as communicated by the Rev. Mr. Dubois,
 the missionary,        to Dr. Anderson, physician -general to the
 government of Madras             ; and  Dr. Anderson's answer ; both
 of which are subjoined.
    These observations upon the Guinea worm (dracunculus)
 will be so much the more interesting to your readers, as a
 short time ago you gave an account of the work of Mr.
 M'Gregor upon the diseases of the expedition to Egypt %.
The following details cannot fail to arrest the attention of
the public,       when we consider that they describe the efficacy
of a    remedy which seemed to be completely unknown to
Mr. M'Gregor          and    such medical men            as   have written oh
 the subject    :
Letter of    the Rev.      Mr. Dubois     to   Dr. Anderson, Physician-

       DEAR SIR,
    The principal object of this letter is to communicate to
you two remedies, the efficacy of which I have remarked in
a great number of instances, in two diseases very common
in this district and in some others :               I allude to the disease
known among Europeans by the name of the Guinea worm,
              * From Bitliotheque Britannique, vol. xrx.
              f   See Philosophical  Magazine,  vol. xxiv. p. 97.
              \   See Philosophical  Magazine,  vol. xxii. p. S50.
Vol.   25.  No. 98. July       1 806.        G                           among

9s                               On the Guinea Warm,
among the Indians by the name of naramboo or nvrapoo-
chalandy ; and to the pain occasioned by the bite of a scor
pion.
  These two sample remedies, both of them, I suppose,
equally innocent, were communicated to me by a Hindoo
physician, who has administered them, with very great suc
cess, to a great number of diseased persons who have daily
implored his assistance. As this Hindoo was under obliga
tions to me,          I requested       him to impart these remedies; which
lie immediately did               :   and as he enjoined no secrecy upon
me,   I do not think              I   shall abuse his confidence in making
his communication                public.
     From      the moment         I first knew these remedies,             I   have also
had many opportunities of experiencing the efficacy of the
one against the Guinea worm in particular, and almost al
ways with success, except in two or three instances, where
the persons who had taken the remedy the first time refused
to take it a second time ; which is often necessary                            in obsti
nate cases. But however inveterate the case was, the remedy,
upon the  second   application, forced the departure of the
worm, if already formed ; or hindered it from forming at all,
when taken at the commencement of the disease.
     As    to the remedy against the bite                      of scorpions, I     have
had but few opportunities                       of trying     it, having only admi
nistered       it   three times with equal                 success.   I administered
it one hour after the bite, at the very moment the pain was
greatest   : half an hour after the pain was greatly dimi
                 in
nished, and in an hour     totally ceased.

          is
called the Guinea worm         painful and troublesome
                                           is              be                     is
cause     particularly attacks the legs, often rendering them
          it
entirely motionless for many months.
  When this disease appears    this and some other districts

of the Carnatic            and    of Madura,          it   becomes    sometimes epi
demic to such              a   degree,     that  I    have seen villages the   one-
half of        the inhabitants         of which were           attacked    at the same
time.

                    and the Sting         of Scorpions in India.                           QQ
general in the months of December, January, and February ;
it then rages in several districts at once : at other seasons
fewer persons are affected with it.
  The symptoms of this malady are almost always the same.
A disagreeable sensation is felt for a few days, accompanied
by head-ache, pain in the stomach, and nausea; two or
three days before the pain is fixed in the place in which the
worm appears, an eruption of small pimples takes place, ac
companied with a very disagreeable itching; this itching
becomes  more violent at the place where the worm is about
to force a passage, until the pain is entirely fixed to one
place.        The      part    then swells, and inflammation soon fol
lows.
     In this      case,       the worm often comes away                    with    the pus,
or when the suppuration is upon the point of ceasing; some
times the place where it is lodged swells like a bladder full
of limpid matter, and sometimes only a simple induration is
seen, without inflammation.
              necessary for the discharge of the worm varies
     The period
much    sometimes it happens at the end of ten days, and
          ;
sometimes not for two or three months, and during all this
time the limb continues in a state of inflammation and sup
puration.
  Sometimes it comes                  out all at once,           if   means are taken
to facilitate       it,   and then   it   is   often alive.      I     have frequently
seen these insects move about for several minutes after coming
out of the leg. In general, however,       comes out      little
                                                            it                      by
and little.         About       an inch   of   it   comes out         in   a   day, and   it   is
carefully rolled round            a   straw, or something else, to hinder
itfrom returning.
     If drawnout roughly     breaks, and the piece which re
                                     it
mains   occasions swelling  and  inflammation, accompanied by
acute pain and followed                by
                                suppuration.    In this case, the
disease  becomes  very  obstinate  and very painful.
     However        severe this disease
                                 is,      never followed
                                                       it   is                              by
gangrene      sometimes
              ;   it      happens,   however, that the prin
cipal nerves are so injured that the limb becomes short or
deformed.
     These worms are             of different sizes     ;     some         of them  I     saw
                                        G      2                                          wer

 100                     On the Guinea Worm,
 were a foot and a half long, although they are commonly
 shorter; but in general their size and shape niay be com-
ared to the small string of a violin.
    It  is at the extremities, particularly the legs, that they
appear, and sometimes in the arms. Some Hindoos assured
 me that they had seen them in the nose, the ears, the eye
brows,     &c. ; but I have never seen. them except in the lega
                                                           '
and arms.
    I do  not feel myself capable to divine the origin and causes
of   this singular disease. The Hindoos, accustomed to attri
bute the most of their diseases to the bad qualities of the water
 they use, generally believe that element to be the cause ;
 pretending     the worms       are  there engendered, and, being
swallowed,      that they increase in the human body until they
find an    outlet.    Recording to this system, it would be very
difficult to explain how these insects could pass through the
organs of deglutition and digestion in a state of life.               On
the other hand, admitting that water has no part in their
formation, it will be difficult to explain it.           1st, How does
it happen that the inhabitants of            a village who     drink   the
water from the same well are attacked with this disease,
while others, at the distance of only half a mile, are not
attacked    ?  2d,   How    does  it happen that     those   who live at
the distance     of   a mile from    a river, and who are obliged to
drink well water, are almost regularly every year attacked
with the above ?
    The climate also may have some effect upon this malady.
It  rarely attacks those who live near the sea-shore.             I never
saw it in any part of the Mysore, and it is even not known
by name beyond the Ghauts ; while it rages continually ia
the Carnatic,      and other districts       within the Ghauts,       the
neighbourhood        of  rivers   excepted,    as  I  have   already re
marked.
    But whatever is the         cause  and origin     of this  disease,   I
shall be happy      if the remedy I propose        be a specific against
it.    The following example will         at least prove its efficacy   :
    A  long time before this remedy was known to me, I was
told that the Bramins were never, or at least very rarely, at
tacked with the above disease, although living in villages the
                                                             inhabitants

                                                                         '
                and the Sting    of Scorpions in India.              101
 inhabitants of which suffered constantly from it every year.
 I paid no attention to this observation, regarding it as one
 of those assertions without foundation so common among
 the  Hindoos, who consider this "exemption as belonging to
 the sacred character     of this class of men. Reflecting after
 wards upon this assertion, after knowing the remedy, I ex
 plained it by recurring to the quantity of assafcetida which
 the Bramins      daily and constantly use in their victuals as a
 seasoning  ;   and. this also is the principal ingredient of the
 remedy.
    The  remedy employed against the bite           of a scorpion may
be applied    with   the same success against the sting       of winged
insects, according to the      following   recipe : —The     shrub, the
root of which is     a specific in this case, is called by the Hin
doos kalelchy-chaddy.         Being ignorant of the name given
to this shrub by European botanists, F send you two speci
mens of the fruit, which are called kaletchy-kabye, in order
that you may ascertain the shrub which produced them.
They are found of different hues ; but, as there are various
species of them, I have to caution you to choose such as
have their fruit of a white colour, because the root of the
other kinds has not the same virtue.
              Remedy     against llie Bite  of Scorpions.
   Take, at the new moon, the root of the shrub called ka-
letchy-chaddy, of the kind which produces white fruit ; cut
then) into pieces of three or four inches long, and allow them
to dry in the shade.
   When a person has been bitten by scorpions, cut off a
piece of root as large as a bean ; let the patient place it in
his mouth,      pressing it gently with his teeth ; he must swal
low his saliva, taking a new piece of the root every ten mi
nutes.    At   the same time pulverize a small quantity          of  the
root, upon which        throw some      drops of water     ;  and, after
having made a paste,       apply it to the wound.
                Remedy    against the Guinea IVorm.
    1st, Take    of good   assafcetida,  called by the Tamuls       pe-
roongahyam,       as  much  as  will weigh    seven   fanams of gold
(about three-fourths of a ragoda).

   2d, The fruit, well known in all the gardens of India,
called by the Tamuls katricalie, and by the Portuguese Le-
ringelle.
   3d, Oil of sesamum, called by the Tamuls nalla-yennie,
in sufficient quantity to fry the katricahe or heringelle.
Bruise the assafoetida, and, after having divided the berin-
gelle into  three equal parts with a knife, insert onefthird
of the assafoetida in each portion of the fruit : after having
tied them with a thread, fry the beringelle in the oil of se
samum in       a   convenient vessel         ;   let the patient take one por
tion of   the remedy upon going to bed, another next                    morning,
and the third upon going to bed the second night; rub the
part of the body where the worm is lodged with the oil
which fried the fruit containing the assafoetida, for three
days, and three times a-day.
  If this remedy is resorted to at the commencement of the
malady, it will arrest its progress and hinder the formation
of the worm        ;   if made   use     of after    the worm is formed, it     will
soon bring it away ; and in every case the pain ceases                            in.

      DEAR SIR,
I     have read your letter              with    great pleasure and attention,

worm, or dracunculus, which you have described so exactly,
is  one of the most dreadful maladies to which the inhabi
tants of this great peninsula are subject.
  What you have said upon the Hindoostanee                              names    of
these remedies,         &c.    is   of   real importance to Europeans,           as
enabling them to procure them from the natives when they
are in want of them.
  As the knowledge of these Tamul names, however, will
                India, for the instruction of the naturalists
be only useful in
of Europe,    have to observe, that the kqletchy, which
               I

insects,      is,     according          to Linnaeus,            of the order of Lomen-
tacece and       of     the genus         Guilandina.             Botanists have distin
guished two species, the bonduc       the bonducella. They and
have made no observation upon the colour of the seeds; but
I saw   lady of Bengal, on her way to Europe, who gave her
          a
child,      when attacked                by   an intermittent               fever,    these seeds
of clear brown colour, in preference to Peruvian bark.
     a
  The reason you assign why the Braming are less subject
to    the Guinea             the other natives, led you to
                          worm than                                                                    a
very natural conclusion.     must say, however, that have
                                           I                                               I
remarked the same difference in the susceptibility of our
officers and that of the common soldiers, having often thirty
of the latter under my care at once, and not one of the for
mer. Not observing any difference    their food which might in
lead me to the same conclusion with yourself,       thought                           I
these soldiers contracted the        malady     sleeping on
                                                    above                       by
brick pavements, as was once the custom, and that the re
medy really was to make them lie upon wooden benches,
which are now erected in all our barracks and guardhouses.
     We know well                 that    the ichneumon               fly   lodges its eggs         in

day even in the kernels of fruits, which had been deposited
as    an egg,         without       the    least exterior             sign:     we cannot           al
lege,     with propriety,            that worms enter into the bodies                               of

see them              the eye's     of horses and the livers of sheep.
 I       am inclined to believe                that the Guinea worm                       is   intro
duce^ into the human body                      in
                               the same way as various other
insects which deposit their progeny there, or in the state of

is known over all the world, recourse may be had to                                        it   both
as   preservative and

  104    On the Guinea Worm, end the Sting           of Scorpions.
  saponaceous     quality which it appears to possess softens the
  teguments when strongly inflamed, diminishes the tendency,
  to gangrene, and favours the coming out of the worm ;
  which I have seen sometimes lodged in the pectoral muscles
  as well as in the inferior extremities.
     If  you reflect, that insects spread themselves in clouds
  over districts where we never saw them before, you will find
  it very difficult to ascertain    the local situation  of certain  spe
  cies, such as those known by the name of the Guinea
  worm, while our own vessels alone frequent the mouths of
  some rivers in Africa, whence we first learned the know
  ledge of them. Rajamundry, which is situated on the banks
  of the Codavery,       the largest river on the Malabar coast, is
  very subject to   it :   we know also that it is very common at
  Trichinopoly, upon the river Cavery ; and even at Bombay,
'
  which is a sea-port.        It appears to me, besides, that the cir
  cumstance of their being so common in your district, which
  abounds so much in brackish water., renders the idea pro
  bable that the vitriolic and muriatic salts, which are found
  in wells and in the sea, favour the propagation of these
  worms,     although I have seen them in places             where the
  purest spring water only is drunk.
                          Note by  Dr. De Carro.
     The Guinea worm not being             a disease  to which    Euro
  peans are subject, the remedies recommended by Mr. Du-
  bois can only be used in the case of worms in the intestinal

    XIX.    Chemical Experiments          on Guaiacum,          By  Mr.
                         William Brande*.
Among        the numerous substances          which are comprehended
under the name       of resins,    there    is perhaps no one which
possesses so many curious properties as that now under
consideration ; and it is remarkable that no more attention
has    been paid to the subject,       since many of the alterations
which it undergoes when             treated     with different solvents
have been mentioned by various authors.
                                    §T.
    Guaiacum     has a green hue externally ; is in some degree
transparent;     and breaks    with a vitreous fracture.
    When pulverised it is      of a gray colour, but gradually         be
comes greenish on exposure to air.
    It melts when heated, and diffuses              at the same time a
pungent    aromatic   odour.
    It has when in powder a pleasant balsamic smell, but
scarcely any taste, although when swallowed it excites a
very powerful burning sensation in the throat.
    Its specific gravity   is P2289.
                                   §11.
    1.  When pulverised guaiacum is digested in a moderate
heat with distilled water, an opaque solution is formed,
which becomes clear on passing the whole through a filter.
    The filtrated liquor is of a greenish-brown colour ; it has
a peculiar smell, and a sweetish taste.
    It leaves on evaporation a brown substance, which is so
luble in alcohol, nearly soluble in boiling water, and very
little acted upon by sulphuric ether.
    This solution was examined by            the  following re-agents :
    Muriate of alumina occasioned             a brown insoluble preci
pitate after some hours had elapsed.
    Muriate of tin formed a brown flaky precipitate under the
same circumstances.
    Nitrate of silver  gave a copious brown precipitate.

     Suspecting the presence of lime in the solution, I added
a   few drops of oxalate of ammonia, when the liquid imme
diately became turbid, and deposited brown flakes, which,
after having been treated with boiling alcohol, yielded traces
of oxalate of lime.
     These effects, therefore, indicate the presence of a sub
stance    in guaiacum which possesses the properties of ex
tract *    ; the     action of the re-agent                is,
                                               however, somewhat
modified        by   asmall quantity of lime which   also in solu      is
tion.
   One hundred grains of guaiacum yielded about nine grains
of this impure extractive matter.
   2. Alcohol dissolves guaiacum with facility, leaving some
extraneous matter, which 'generally amounts to about five
per cent.
     This solution        is   of   a    deep brown colour         ;   the addition      of
water separates the resin,                      forming    a      milky fluid which
passes the filter.
     Acids produce the following changes                      :
     A. Muriatic acid throws down an ash-coloured precipi
tate,    which       is   not redissolved          by
                                      heating the mixture. In
this case the resin appears but little altered.
   JB. Liquid oxymuriatic acid, when poured into this solu
tion, forms precipitate of very beautiful pale blue colour,
                 a                         a
which may          be preserved          unaltered.
    C. Sulphuric acid, when not added in too large quan                         a
tity, separates the resin of pale green colour.
                                           a
   D. Acetic acid does not form any precipitate. This acid
is, indeed, capable of dissolving most of the resins.
   E. Nitric acid, diluted with one-fourth of its weight of
water, causes no precipitate till after the period of some
hours.  The liquid at first assumes     green colour, and a                              if
water be added            at this period,          a    green     precipitate may be
obtained    :   the green colour soon changes                     to blue, (when,       by
the same means,    blue precipitate may be obtained;)
                             a                                                           it

wards mentioned.
   The      changes   of colour produced by nitric                     and oxymuriatic
acids in the alcoholic solution are very remarkable, and, I
believe, peculiar to guaiacum : there      moreover, much       is,
reason to suppose that the above alterations in colour are
occasioned by oxygen *.                      It likewise appears from that
which       has been stated,             that the blue and green oxides (if
they may be so called                 by   way of distinction) are soluble in
the mixture of nitric acid and alcohol, while the brown pre

by the alkalis.    If heat be employed in forming this solu-
  •   The following experiments appear to verify this supposition               :
   Fifty grains of freshly pulverised guaiacum were introduced into glass               a
jar containing 60 cubic inches of oxymuriatic acid gas. The resin speedily
assumed  a  brown colour, having passed through several shades of green and
blue.    Liquid ammonia was poured on this brown substance while yet
immersed in the acid      ;   the   whole became green     ;   it   therefore seemed thus to
be deprived of part of the oxygen which              had acquired by the
                                                    it   apparently
preceding experiment. An equal portion of the same guaiacum was exposed,
under similar circumstances, to the action of oxymuriatic acid, excepting
that the glass in which the experiment was made was covered with    black               a
varnish, and placed in     dark apartment. On examining the result of this
                               a
experiment, the resin was found to have undergone precisely the same changes
as when exposed to light.   Ammonia had also the same effect.
   Guaiacum was also exposed over mercury to oxygen gas the resin as            ;

tion,     the resin is speedily decomposed             ; and,   if   the whole      of
the acid be evaporated,there remains a black coaly substance,
together with some sulphate of lime.
  6. Nitric acid appears to exert a more powerful action on
guaiacum than on any of the resinous bodies.
   One hundred grains of pure guaiacum, previously reduced
to powder,   were cautiously added to two ounces of nitric
acid, of the specific gravity of 1-39. The resin at first as
sumed    dark green colour, a violent effervescence was pro
           a
duced, attended with the emission of much nitrous gas, and
the whole was dissolved without the assistance of heat ; which
is not the      case with the resins in general ; for, when these
bodies are thus treated with nitric acid, they are commonly
converted into an orange-coloured porous mass.
  The solution thus formed yielded, while recent, a brown
precipitate with the alkalis, which was redissolved on the
application of heat, forming a deep brown liquid.
  Muriatic acid also separated the guaiacum from this solu
tion ; not, however, without having undergone some change.
   Sulphuric acid caused no precipitate.
   After this solution of guaiacum in nitric acid had remained
undisturbed for some hours, a considerable proportion of cry
stallized oxalic acid was deposited.
   When guaiacum                was    treated   with dilute nitric acid, the
results were somewhat different.                 A   slight effervescence     took
place, and      part   of       the resin was dissolved, the remainder
being converted into a brown substance resembling the pre
cipitate obtained from the alcoholic solution as above men
tioned (2. E.).
   This brown substance                appears    to be guaiacum,
                                                           the pro
perties    of which        are materially alteredby its combination
with oxygen      ;   and    I   am led to think that the changes of
colour produced by nitric and oxymuriatic acids are the
consequence of the different proportions of oxygen with
which the guaiacum has been united ; for we know that the
colours of metallic and many other bodies are greatly in
fluenced by the same cause.
  The brown substance                 was separated by fittration      ;,   the   fil
                                                                             trated

                 Chemical Experiments on Guaiacum.                         109
trated liquor yielded yellow           flocculent    precipitates with the
alkalis, and on examination               was   found to hold nitrate of
lime in solution.
    The undissolved portion was of a deep chocolate brown co
lour. A similar substance may also be obtained by evapo
rating the recent nitric solution to dryness, taking care not
to apply too much heat towards the end of the process.
    The substance obtained by either of these means possesses
the properties of a resin in greater perfection than guaiacum ;
it is equally soluble in alcohol and sulphuric ether, insoluble
in water,      &c; but when burned it emits a peculiar smell,
more resembling animal than vegetable bodies.                        If, how
ever, fresh portions of nitric acid be added three or four
times successively, or if a large quantity be employed to
form the solution, the product obtained by evaporation is
 then of a very different nature ; for it has lost all the cha
 racteristic properties of a resin, having become equally so
 luble in water and alcohol ; the solution of it in this state
 having an astringent bitter taste *.
     7. Guaiacum is copiously soluble in the pure and carbon
 ated alkalis, forming greenish brown liquids.
     Two ounces of        a saturated     solution   of caustic potash took
 up rather more than 65 grains of the resin ; the same quan
 tity of liquid ammonia dissolved only 25 grains.
     Nitric acid formed in these solutions a deep brown preci
 pitate, the shades of which varied according to the quantity
 of acid which had been employed.
     This precipitate was found, on examination, to possess the
 properties of that formed by nitric acid in the solution                     of
 guaiacum (2. E.) in alcohol.
     Dilute sulphuric acid, when            poured into any of the above
 alkaline solutions, formed          a  flesh-coloured curdy precipitate.
 Muriatic acid produced the same effect.
     The two last-mentioned precipitates differ from guaiacum,
 in being less acted upon by sulphuric ether and more soluble

  in boiling water   ; their properties, therefore, approach nearer
  to extract.    Moreover, when these precipitates were redis-
  solved   in ammonia, and were again separated by muriatic
  acid, the above-mentioned properties became more evident.
                                 §  III.
     One hundred grains of very pure guaiacum, in powder,
  were    put into a glass retort, to which the usual apparatus
  was adapted.      The distillation   was gradually performed on
  an open fire, until the bottom      of the retort became red hot.
     The following products     were obtained     :          Grains.

     The coal, amounting to 30-5 grains, yielded, on incine
  ration, 3 grains of lime.     To discover whether any fixed al
  kali was present, 200 grains of the purest guaiacum (that in
  drops) were reduced to ashes ; these were dissolved in mu
  riatic acid, and precipitated by ammonia ; the whole was
  then filtrated, and the clear liquor evaporated to dryness;
  but not any trace of    a neutral salt, with a basis of fixed al
  kali,  was perceptible.
                                  §  IV.
     From the action of different solvents on guaiacum, it
  appears,   that, although this substance possesses many pro
  perties in common with resinous bodies, it nevertheless dif
  fers from them in the following particulars :
     1.   By affording a portion of vegetable extract.
     2.   By the curious alterations which it undergoes when
, Subjected to the action of bodies which readily communicate
  oxygen, such as nitric and oxymuriatic acids ; and the ra
  pidity with which it dissolves in the former.
                                                               3. By

respect guaiacum bears some resemblance to the green resin

     5. By the quantity of charcoal and lime which arc ob
tained from it when subjected to destructive distillation.
                                      § V.
     From the whole, therefore, of the above-mentioned                    pro
 perties,   it evidently appears     that  guaiacum     is a substance     very
 different from those which are denominated resins, and that
 it is also different from           all those    which    are enumerated
 amongst the balsams, gum resins, gums, and extracts: most
 probably it is a substance distinct in its nature from any of
  the above, in consequence of certain peculiarities in the pro
  portions and chemical combination of its constituent ele
  mentary principles ; but as this opinion may be thought not
  sufficiently supported by the facts which have been adduced,
  we may for the present be allowed to regard guaiacum as
  composed of        a resin modified by the vegetable extractive
  principle, and as such, perhaps the definition of it by the
  term of an extracto-resin may be adopted without impro
  priety.
      P. S.   I have observed that the action of oxygen on some
  of   the  other resinous bodies is very remarkable.                It is well
  known, that by digesting mastich in alcohol a partial solu
  tion only is formed, and there remains an elastic substance,
  which is generally said to possess the properties of purt
  caoutchouc : it appears, however, to differ from this sub
  stance, in becoming hard when dried by exposure to air.
  Moreover, I have remarked that the part of mastich which
  remains dissolved by alcohol, may be again precipitated by
  ,water, and, on examination, I found the precipitate to pos-

 XX. Natural History of             the domestic      Pigeons of Spain,
    particularly in      the Province    of  Valentia.      By Don AN
    TONIO JOSEPH         CAVANILLES*.
 HOWEVER easy it is to distinguish the generic character
 of pigeons, it is very difficult to discover the distinguishing
 marks of each class. This arises from the frequent crossing
of the breeds, particularly among domestic pigeons, which
has almost entirely destroyed their primitive forms.                  From
this arise the singular mistakes of many naturalists, of which
I  shall take no further notice.           The following are such ob
servations     as  I  have been able to collect,       particularly in the
province of Valentia, during a long series of years.                I begin
by my division of the races of domestic pigeons.
                           Generic Characters.
    A  straight conical beak ; at the bottom of the upper part
two small protuberances ; the point a little bent. The nos
trils oblong, half covered with skin, and situated obliquely
on the side of the axis of the beak. The tongue entire. At
each foot four toes without any membrane, divided almost
to the bottom ; three before, and the fourth behind.

                                Explanations.
    The pigeons compriged in the preceding division form a
part of the first division of Linnaeus (cauda eequali), which
includes the pigeons which have the feathers of the tail of
an equal length.          In  the first division we find a great many
classes well characterized, because amateurs               have taken great
care to preserve them unmixed              :  on this account, however,
their broods are less abundant.              The most beautiful,     and the
most numerous, are, undoubtedly, thos~e                  of the first   sub
division.
                               First Division.
                             First Sub-division.
    The pigeons comprised in this first division              are nearly oT
the same size      as  the wild pigeons.        Span. paloma campesina.
They    have oval heads, less lengthened towards the beak than
the former ; the beak short, conical, with very small tuber
cles upon the beak; the eyes brilliant, almost always sur
rounded with a bare flesh-coloured skin ; fhe feet not fur
nished with feathers. Many of them have a kind of small
crown, but the feathers of which, in place of falling one
over another, support each other towards the hinder part                    of

  the head   :  in short, on most of         those    pigeons is observed a
  row of curled feathers from the lower part of the beak to the
 bottom of the throat, which in Spanish is called repelon or
  ckorerra, and in the language of Valentia venera *,
     Besides, the pigeons of this sub-division are not the most
 fruitful, nor      the strongest in flight; they are, however, ex
 cellent hatcher?, and always preserve their original beauty.
     The pigeons of classes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, of this sub-division
 have never more than two colours, one of which extends
 over the whole body, and the other only upon the twelve
 feathers of the tail.       Those of classes 6 and 7 have, on the
 contrary, different colours : white always on the tail ; brown
or blackish on the wings ; blueish green upon the throat,
 head, and neck ; and gray or ash-coloured on the other parts
of the body.         The pigeons of the second sub-division of the
 first division have uniformly the head lengthened without
any tuft.      They have only the row of curled feathers to the
bottom of the neck         : otherwise they resemble            those  of the
first sub-division.
     The particular character of this sub-division consists not
only in the large feathers of the wings, which are of a dif
ferent colour from those of the body, but principally in the
determinate number of those feathers ; that is to say, three
in one wing, and two in the other.
     Pigeons are sometimes found of this sub-division which
have only two large feathers in each wing, and which, on
account     of their scarcity,     are highly esteemed.
     As to the pigeons of the third sub-division in the first di
vision, they have always fifteen white feathers in the wuigs;
that is to say, seven in one wing, and. eigbt in the other.
If, however, there should some be found with more, which
is   what very seldom happens ; for instance, eight in one
wing and nine in the other, they are held in the highest
estimation f» They are a little smaller than those of the

    * Linnaeus has formed a particular class of pigeons, which he has designed

he assigns them are not exclusive. — Molt of the French Editor.

preceding sub-division ; their beak is a little mere lengthen
ed ; they have not, however, either the curled feathers on the
neck, nor the tuft on the head *.
     The fourth sub-division of the first division comprehends
the numerous classes of pigeons called columias pasdas y
qxules (columba domestica Linn.), which have the greatest
resemblance to the wild pigeons; and they are- also the most
fruitful, and the most powerful in flight.                      All, except those
which         are named          flamenquillas, No. 9, are of a greenish
blue, more             or  less   clouded on the neck, breast, and head ;
the beak is lengthened ; the feathers of the wings have at
the ends blackish spots ; the rest of the wings is brownish,
or black.            The colour of the back varies very much. In.
some it is ash-coloured,                   almost white,       without     the  least
spot     :  in others it is covered with small round black spots :
many have it lead-coloured, often very deep, without any
mixture; but it is frequently covered with ash-coloured
 spots.
     All    the pigeons         of this sub-division      can inflate their crops;
but those which               are most distinguished          on this account are
 the iuchonas,           No.    7.
     They can inflate the crop to                  the   size of their bodies in
 such a manner, that it hangs before them like a ball.                            As

    The ladronas or palomas de casta, No. 6, have the head
a  little lengthened, with tubercles a little more considerable
upon the beak; but otherwise they bear a great resem
blance to the rasa pigeons ; like them they testify a strong
attachment for the place of their abode, and the same ardent
desire     of coupling themselves.          Thev make    use of  those two
classes for alluring wild pigeons.            They   are taken in the fol
lowing manner          :
    In the beginning of November they separate all the males
from the females, with which they had been paired from
the beginning of May.                Scarcely do they see themselves
abandoned by their mates, when they fly in flocks towards
the steeples, where the wild pigeons generally build their
nests ; they attract in this manner the young males who
have no companions,             and lead them to their pigeon-houses :
sometimes, however, the males appear to be apprehensive of
danger, and return when they are arrived at the entrance of
the pigeon-house.             They can at pleasure exercise this kind
of piracy, whether by males or by females, according as they
separate the one froni the other.
    The flamenquillas, No. 9, are distinguished from all the
other classes by their plumage, which varies much on the
different individuals.           There are some entirely black, others
are white, and some again are so mixed with various colours
 that it is impossible         to fix on any of them.        The eyes are
 encircled with      a   flesh-coloured skin ; the head is less length
 ened    ;  the beak short,       with  large protuberances    :  otherwise
 they are,     if we may so term them, the transition            to the se
 cond division,        from which they differ by their strong and
 rapid flight.      We will now speak of that second division.
                                 Second Division.
                                                                   ft
    We ought       here to observe,       that, in general, all the classes
 of this division          are held in little esteem (except, however,
 those     of the first sub-division), but on account of their fe
 cundity, and the savour of their flesh. Amateurs have taken
 much less pains to preserve their original forms, and all the
 classes are permitted to unite and mix together at will.

                                First Suit-division.
  The character of the class No. 1. is known by its deno
mination, as the feathers are curled and elevated, and not
smooth and joined together like those of the other classes,
which occasions their flight to be extremely difficult and
 troublesome,         because        the       air passes      through     their wings.
We find in this class, in                  regard to size, colour, and quality,
very great differences. There are some white, which are a
little larger than turtle doves, and which, on account of their'
separated and curled feathers, are 'absolutely incapable of                              fly
ing   :     there arc some      of   variegated       colours, nearly of the same
size      as   wild pigeons, having              a   crest, and the feathers less
curled, &c.          In general, they                arc reared rather on account
of their singularity than their utility,
                                      because their broods
seldom succeed. Amateurs are in the habit of covering their
eggs with, other pigeons.
   In regard to the colipavas, No.  the most esteemed are 2,
those which have 36 feathers in the tail, although they also
prize those which have but 34 and 28 but those that have       ;
less are held    no consideration.

The fecundity of             the pigeons          in this country      is   extraordi

the fourth, fifth, or sixth month*; and continue thus unt;l
their twelfth,            fourteenth,       and    even    until    their twentieth
year.
.   In general, they bring up from   22 to 24 couples of young.
They lay two  eggs     less  than

winter, 20 or  21 clays.    This  great vigour and activity of
production must necessarily be attributed to the mildness of

 has bestowed upon the invariable fidelity of pigeons. Birds,
 males as well as females, but the latter less frequently than
 the former, seek for stolen pleasures              even during the time
 of hatching     ; at least, they certainly do not allow any such
 occasions to escape when they occur.                  I have made this

my young       females having found no male, and finding them
 selves, consequently,       consumed with the most ardent desire
 of pairing themselves, contracted for each other the most
 tender friendship ; chose a nest in common ; sought out for
 some    clandestine intrigues; laid at length each their two
eggs; hatched them in common, and brought up their
young in the same manner as if they had been male and,
 female.

      MY DEAR SIR,
Xt    can scarcely have escaped the notice of the most inatten
tive observer of vegetation, that in whatever position a seed
is placed to germinate, its radicle invariably makes an effort
to descend towards the centre of the earth, whilst the elon-

has    beenproved         by Du Hamel * that if      during its a seed,
germination, be frequently inverted, the points both of tha
radicle and germen will return to the first direction.    Some
naturalists have supposed these opposite effects to be pro
duced by gravitation ; and it is not difficult to conceive that
the same agent, by operating on bodies so differently organ
ized as the radicle and germen of plants are, may occasion
the one to descend and the other to ascend.
    The hypothesis of            these      naturalists does not, however,
appear     to have   much strengthened by any facts they
                        been

by   the arguments        of their opponents         ;   and therefore, as the
phenomena          observable     during the conversion of    seed into   a
a   plant are amongst the most interesting            that occur in ve
getation, commenced the experiments, an account of which
            I
I have now the honour to request you to lay before the Royal
Society.
 I   conceived that    gravitation were the cause of the de
                             if
scent of the radicle, and of the ascent of the germen,                                   it
must act either by its immediate influence on the vegetable
fibres and vessels during their formation, or on the motion
and consequent distribution                 of the   true       sap afforded       by   the
cotyledons   and as gravitation could produce these effects
               :
only whilst the seed remained at rest, and in the same posi
tion          to the attraction of the earth,
        relative                                imagined that    I
its operation would  become   suspended                    by
                                            constant and rapid
change of the position of the germinating seed, and that                                 it
might be counteracted             by   the agency     of centrifugal force.
     Having  strong rill of water passing through my garden,
               a
Iconstructed    small wheel similar to those used for grinding
                    a
corn, adapting another wheel of different construction, and
                                               a
formed of very slender pieces of wood, to the same axis.
Round the circumference of the latter, which was eleven
inches in diameter, numerous                    seeds      of    the   garden      bean,
which      had     been   soaked       in
                                       water to produce their greatest

  j 24                 On the Direction     of the
 each other.     The radicles of these   seeds were made to    point
 jn   every direction ; some towards the centre of the wheel,
 and others in the opposite direction ; others as tangents to
 its curve, some pointing backwards, and others forwards,
 relative to its motion ; and others pointing in opposite di
 rections in lines parallel with the axis of the wheel?. The
 whole was inclosed in a box, and secured by a lock, and a
 .wire grate was placed to prevent the ingress      of any body  ca
pable of impeding the motion of the wheels.
     The water be'mg then admitted, the wheels performed
 something more than 15Q revolutions in a minute; and the
position of the seeds relative to the earth was, of course, as
often perfectly inverted, within the same period of time; by
which I conceive that the influence of gravitation must have
been wholly suspended.
     In a few days   the  seeds began to germinate,      and, as the
truth of some of the opinions I had communicated to you,
and of many others which I had long entertained, depended
on the result of the experiment, I watched its progress with
some anxiety, though not with much apprehension ; and              I
had soon the pleasure to see that the radicles, in whatever
direction they were protruded from the position of the seed,
turned their points outwards from the circumference of the
wheel, and in their subsequent growth receded nearly at
right angles from its axis. The germens, on the contrary,
took the opposite direction, and in a few days their points
all met in the centre of the wheel. Three of these plants
were suffered to remain on the wheel, and were secured to
its spokes    to prevent their being shaken off by its motion.
The stems of these plants soon extended beyond the centre
of the wheel; but the same cause which first occasioned
them to approach its axis, still operating,        their points re
turned and met again at its centre.
    The motion of      the wheel being     in this experiment ver
tical,   the radical and germen   of  ever}' seed occupied, during
a minute     portion  of time in   each revolution, precisely the
same position they     would   have  assumed had the seeds vege
tated at rest; and as gravitation and centrifugal force also
acted    in lines parallel with the vertical motion     and surface
                                                                  of

                   Radicle und Germen     of Seeds.              \s6
bf the wheel,    I conceived that some slight objections might
be urged against the conclusions       I felt inclined to draw.      I
therefore added     to the machinery I have described another
wheel, which moved horizontally over the vertical wheels ;
And to this, by means of multiplying wheels of different
powers, I was enabled to give many different degrees of ve
locity.   Round the circumference        of  the  horizontal wheel>
whose diameter was also eleven         inches, seeds    of the bcari
were bound    as in the experiment which I have already de
scribed, and it was then made to perform 250 revolutions
in  a minute.    By  the rapid motion    of the water-wheel much
toater was thrown upwards on the horizontal           wheel, part of
which supplied the seeds upon it with moisture, and the re
mainder was dispersed, in a light and constant shower, over
the seeds in the vertical wheel, and on others placed to vege
tate at rest in different parts  of the box.
   Every seed on the horizontal wheel, though moving with
great rapidity; necessarily retained the same position relative
to the attraction of the earth   ; and therefore the operation of
gravitation  could  not be  suspended, though it might be coun
teracted, in a very considerable degree, by centrifugal force ;
and the difference I had anticipated between the effects of
rapid vertical and horizontal motion soon became sufficiently
ohvious.    The radicles pointed downwards about ten de
grees below,    and the germens as many degrees above, the
horizontal line of the Wheel's motion ; centrifugal force hav
ing made both to deviate 80 degrees from the perpendicular
direction each would have taken, had it vegetated at rest.
Gradually diminishing the rapidity of the motion of the ho
rizontal wheel, the radicles descended more perpendicularly;
and the germens grew more upright; and when it did not
perform more than 80 revolutions in a minute, the radicle
pointed out about 45 degrees below, and the germep as much
above, the horizontal     line, the one always receding from,
and the other approaching to, the axis of the wheel.
   I  would not, however, be understood to assert, that the ve/-
locity of 250 or 80 horizontal revolutions in       a minute will al
ways give accurately the degrees of depression and elevation of
the radicle and germen which I have mentioned; for the rapi
                                                                 dity

 ts6                    On the Direction      of the
 dity of the motion of my wheels was sometimes diminished
 by the coHection of fibres of conferva against the wire grate,
 which obstructed, in some degree, the passage of the water?
 and the machinery, having been the workmanship of myself
 and my gardener, cannot be supposed to have moved with
 all  the regularity it might have done had           it been made by a
 professional nvchanic.         But I conceive myself to have fully
 proved that the radicles of germinating seeds are made to de
 scend, and their gcrmens to ascend, by some external cause,
 and not by any power inherent in vegetable life ; and I see
little reason to doubt that gravitation is the principal if not
the only agent employed, in this case, by nature.                 I shall
therefore endeavour to point out the means by which I con
ceive    the same    agent   may produce effects        so diametrically
opposite to each other.
    The radicle of a germinating seed (as many naturalists
have observed) is increased in length only by new parts suc
cessively added to its apex or point, and not at all by any
general extension of . parts already formed; and the                 new"
matter which is thus successively added, unquestionably               de
scends in a fluid state from the cotyledons         *.     On this fluid,
and on the vegetable       fibres and vessels      whilst soft and flex
ible, and whilst the matter which composes them is changing
from a fluid to a solid state, gravitation, J conceive, would
bperate sufficiently to give an       inclination    downwards to the
point of the radicle ; and as the radicle has been proved to
be obedient to centrifugal force, it can scarcely be contended
that its direction would remain uninfluenced by gravitation.
    I  have stated  that the radicle is increased        in length only
by parts successively added to its point :             the germen, on
the contrary, elongates by a general extension of its parts
                                                                          '
previously organized ; and its vessels and fibres appear
extend themselves       in proportion      to the quantity     of nutri
ment they receive.        If the motion and consequent distribu
tion of the true sap be influenced by gravitation, it follows,
that when the germen at its first emission, or subsequently^
deviates from a perpendicular direction, the sap must accu
mulate on its under side        : and   I have found' in a great va-

friety   of experiments on the seeds of the horse-chestnut, the
bean, and other plants, when vegetating at rest, that the
vessels and fibres on the under side of the germen invariably
elongate much more rapidly than those on its upper side;
and thence it follows that the point of the germen must al
ways turn upwards.               And it has been proved that a similar
increase of growth takes place on the external side of the
germen when the sap is impelled there by centrifugal force4
 as it is attracted by gravitation to its under side when the
 seed germinates at rest.
     This    increased     elongation of the fibres and vessels of the
 under side is not confined to the germens, nor even to the
annual shoots of trees, but occurs and produces the most
 extensive effects in the subsequent growth of their trunks
 and branches.            The immediate effect of gravitation is cer
 tainly to occasion the further depression of every branch,
 which extends horizontally from the trunk of the tree ; and,
 when      a  young tree inclines to either side, to increase that
 inclination       ; but it at the same time attracts the sap to the
 under side, and thus occasions an increased longitudinal
 extension of the substance of the new wood on that side*.
 The depression of the lateral branch is thus prevented ; and
 it is even enabled to raise itself above its natural level, when
 the branches above it are removed ; and the young tree, by
 the same means, becomes more upright, in direct opposi
 tion to the immediate action of gravitation ; nature, as usual,
 executing the most important operations by the most simple
  means.

  opinions), that gravitation could have little influence on the
  direction of the germen were it in the first instance pro
  truded,      or were it subsequently inverted, and made to point
  perpendicularly downwards.                  To enable myself to answer

   1 23                   On the Direction       of the
  this objection    I  made     many experiments on seeds of the
 horse-chestnut,      and of the bean, in the box I have already
 described ; and as the seeds there were suspended out of the
 earth, I could regularly watch the progress of every effort
 made by the radicle and           germen to change their positions.
 The extremity of the radicle of the bean, when made to point
 perpendicularly upwards, generally formed a considerable
 curvature within three or four hours when the weather was
 warm.     The germen          was    more sluggish; but it rarely or
 never failed to change its direction in the course of 24 hours)
 arid all my efforts to make it grow downwards, by slightly
 changing its direction, were invariably abortive.
     Another, and apparently a more weighty objection to the
 preceding hypothesis, (if applied to the subsequent growth
 and forms    of  trees,)   arises from the facts that few            of their
branches rise perpendicularly upwardsj rfnd that their roots
always spread horizontally ; but this objection, I think, may
be readily answered.
     The luxuriant     shoots of trees, which abound in sap, in
whatever direction they are first protruded, almost uniformly
turn upwards, and endeavour to acquire a perpendicular di
rection ; and to this their points will immediately return if
they are bent downwards during any period of their growth ;
their curvature upwards being occasioned by an increased
extension of the fibres and vessels of their under sides, as in
the elongated germens of seeds. The more feeble and slender
Shoots of the same trees will, on the contrary, grow in al
most every direction, probably because, their fibres being
more dry, and their vessels less amply supplied with sap,
they are less affected by gravitation.           Their points, however;
generally show an inclination to turn upwards ; but the ope
ration of light, in this case, has been proved by Bonnet* to
be very considerable.
     The radicle tapers rapidly as it descends into the earth,
and its lower part is much compressed by the greater solidity
of the mould into which it penetrates.                 The true sap also
continues to descend          from the cotyledons and leaves,             and
           •

occasions a continued increase                     of   the growth      of    the   upper
parts      of
          the radicle ; and this growth is subsequently aug
mented   by the effects of motion, when the germen has risen
above the ground.      The true sap is therefore necessarily ob
structed in its descent; numerous lateral roots are generated,
into which               a   portion of the descending sap enters.    The
substance           of   these roots,  like that of the slender horizontal
branches, is much less succulent than that of the radicle
first emitted, and they are in consequence less obedient to
gravitation ; and therefore, meeting less resistance from the
superficial soil than from that beneath     they extend hori  it,
zontally in every direction, growing with most rapidity, and
producing the greatest number of ramifications, wherever
they find most warmth, and     soil best adapted to nourish
                                               a
the tree.  As these horizontal or lateral roots surround the
base     of    the tree on every side, the true sap descending down
its bark enters almost exclusively into them, and the first
perpendicular root, having executed its office of securing
moisture to the plant, whilst young,      thus deprived of    is
proper nutriment, and, ceasing almost wholly to grow, be
comes of no importance to the tree. The tap root of the
oak, about which so much has been written, will possibly
be adduced   as an exception   but, having attentively exa
                                               ;
mined at least 20,000 trees of this species, many of which
had grown in some of the deepest and most favourable soils
of England,              and never having found   single tree possessing
                                                         a
a   tap root,   I        must be allowed to doubt that one ever existed.
    As   trees possess                the power to turn the upper surfaces             of
their leaves and the points of their shoots to the light, and
their tenc'rils in any direction to attach themselves to conti
guous objects,      may be suspected that their lateral roots
                             it
are by some                   directed to any soil in their vicinity

they find most employment, and a soil best adapted to the

XXII.      Chemico- Galvanic Observations communicated          to the
   National Institute of Italy.       By M. L. Brugnatelli.
                         [Concluded from p. 66.]
                                 § VII.
 Various Coatings, Incrustations, and other particular Com
   positions, are produced by galvanizing Metals in pure
    Water.
w ires        of very pure gold, plunged in distilled water and
submitted to the Galvanism of the positive pole, in a sepa
rate tube, are covered in a few hours with a subtle coating
and crust of a saffron yellow colour.          This is not observed
upon gold wires alloyed with copper, nor upon those of pure
gold when negatively galvanized. But the same yellow coat
ing is observed upon platina wires, whether the piles be of
middling or more energetic force.
   The nature of       these  incrustations    has not been exactly
ascertained.      It seems that they ought to be attributed to a
commencement of the solution of the metal by means of the
oxymuriatic acid which is produced in the experiment.
   jne   other metals    present   singular   combinations.     Some
of them     are oxidated ; some combine with hydrogen ; others
unite with pure water by the Galvanic            influence.   The fol
lowing are the details :

(a) Hydrogenated Hydruret of Gold obtained by Galvanism,
   Conversion of this Compound into pure Gold, on which
  depends the Weight         as well as tlie          Polarity of   the Pieces
  of Gold observed by Ritler.
  It was often remarked,   that the metal wires employed to
galvanize pure water,  formed  blacker crusts on the negative
side than on the other. The better to study these effects the
author made use of well polished metal wires, which he
plunged in a glass tube an inch high, and containing nearly
an ounce of pure water; the wires communicating one with
the negative  pole of the pile and the other with the positive ;
they both  descended, at the distance of three lines from each
other, into the tube, which was closed at bottom.
   Pure gold, being more easily oxidated by this process than
other metals, may be more minutely examined.        It was re
marked that the wire on the negative side changed first; it was
covered with a black substance, which increased by degrees,
until the metal could be no longer recognised, and it was
changed in a few hours into a spongy substance very much
swelled.   It sometimes presents itself under the appearance
of beautiful arborizations, formed of small threads, which are
implanted into one another. Theses intricate forms are not
observed, except when the great piles are weakened.    The
water in which the wires are plunged remains pure, and does
not appear to contain any foreign substance.
  The author regards the black matter formed upon the
wire as being a hydruret of hydrogenated gold ; i. e. hydro-
genated gold combined        with water. This compound is in
odorous, and        almost insipid. It blackens linen when first
thrown upon     it,   andafterwards changes to
                            it                        purple coa
lour, which     also occasions applied to the skin.

single gold wire, attached to the negative pole on the one
side, and on the other side          a       strip   of moistened   pasteboard
communicating with the positive pole, this particular mo
dification of gold     not obtained
                       is             good deal of hydrogen

water becomes alkaline.      The author supposed that this al
kali might probably dissolve the hydrat of gold as it was
formed, and thus hinder it from appearing upon this metal         ;
but the substance not being soluble in pure soda, he aban
doned the idea.
    He  made a gold wire descend     from    each  of the poles  of
the pile into the same tube, which contained a         solution of
soda diluted in water.      After a few hours Galvanic action
the two wires were coated with a black crust, so slender that
it could not be collected in a sufficient quantity for examina
tion.   The author thought that it was on one side as well as
the other hydrogenated gold.
   This compound loses its water and its hydrogen by the
action of oxygen at its formation.      The author proved it by
the following curious experiment :
   He took a gold wire covered with this substance, obtained
in pure water galvanized with      the two metals, as has been
indicated,   and he made   this wire pass from the negative to
the positive pole. He even adapted to the negative pole the
gold wire which had belonged Jo the positive pole, always
in the same water. The black substance was then seen to
diminish in volume by little     and little, as if contracting it
self upon the wire, which by degrees resumed its colour and
brilliancy, while the opposite wire was covered, in its turn,
with hydruret of gold. • This apparent metamorphosis was
performed in a few minutes.
   This hydruret of hydrogenated gold      is a conductor  of Gal
vanism   ;  because  the metallic wires, although      completely
covered    with this substance, speedily decompose water as
soon as they are put in communication with the pile.
   The quickness of this union of hydrogen to gold by means
of Galvanism, and the singularity of this production, made
the author suppose that it was upon this new body, very
different from pure gold, that the supposed polarity of pieces
of gold observed by Ritter depends, and which Brugnatelli
has   shown not to exist, except in such of these pieces as
were in communication with the negative pole.                These
pieces, when left for some time in the Galvanic circuit, and
                                                            lodged

  lodged in a fold      of moist      paper,   become black, and colour
  the   paper   very sensibly by the formation           of hydrogenated
  gold.
      In order to explain what           had taken place in this experi
  ment, the author hydrogenated a little, by the process indi
  cated, the extremity of a gold wire carefully cleaned.                He
  afterwards tried this wire upon a frog, prepared after tbe
  manner of Galvani, by placing under the thighs of the
 animal     the   hydrogenated extremity, and resting the other,
 finely cleaned and polished, upon the moistened paper where
 the spine of the back rested. The frog became very strongly
 convulsed,      and sometimes overturned the wire by its strug
 gles.    This   effect was manifested upon the frog even when
 the    gold wire had been hydrogenated, only in the weakest
 degree, by five or six minutes action of the pile.               The au
 thor concluded from this, that the polarity observed by Ritter
 depended entirely upon          the    hydrogenation    of the gold,    an
 operation which renders it positive compared to gold which
 has not undergone it.             Silver, copper, and other metals,
 particularly antimony, have equally evinced this curious
 phenomenon.
 (b)    Hydruret of Silver and hydrogenated Silver                obtained
                              by Galvanism.
    The author had always remarked with surprise, how two
wires of pure silver, submitted to the action of the two poles
of   the pile, in water,   lik^e  those   of gold,   were both speedily
converted      into a gray and blackish substance. In order to
procure    a  certain  quantity of this substance for examination,
he placed in the same vessel two large silver wires coming
from the two poles of a strong pile, and three lines distant
from each other.         He left them twelve hours in this situa
tion.     On the negative side the liberation of gas was very
sensible, but very little of it appeared round the other wire.
At the expiration of the twelve hours he found a copious
deposit in the recipient, and the wires were abundantly co
vered with a particular substance.             That of the negative side
was much more abundant, being of an obscure gray, swelled,
and    full of protuberances.          It  was  collected in  a   fold  of
                                                                '

  paper.   That upon the positive side was also separated ; it
  was black, less abundant, and adhering to the metallic wire,
  although one part had formed a black deposit above.
     The gray deposit of the negative polg was dried in the air.
  The colour brightened in proportion as the drying advanced ;
  and this powder, slightly rubbed with the burnishing stick,
  assumed the brilliant and white colour of the metal, and ap
  peared to be nothing else than very pure silver.           It was then
  a true combination       of water    and silver, as well as a hydrure
  of this metal, — a singular combination, and unknown until
  the present day; "because," adds the author, "the metallic
. hydrates, examined by Proust with so much exactitude, re
  sult from the combination of the water with the metal in the
  state of oxide, and not in that of regulus."
     The crust and the black deposit coming from the positive
  pole were recognised to be hydrogenated silver.               It black
  ened paper, linen, and the fingers ; it was a little soluble in
  ammonia,      and   insoluble     in the muriatic acid.     It was not
  revived  by the action of the solar rays, but very well by heat,
  on allowing the escape of hydrogen gas.
      When the two silver wires in the two separate tubes were
  submitted to the Galvanic action, very little hydrogenated
  silver only appeared upon the negative wire in the form of
  black crust.      There was a little upon the point in a flake.
   (c) Copper and Oxide        of  Copper oxygenated by the Galvanic
                                     Action.
      Two wires of      very fine copper were galvanized for several
  hours,   communicating with the two poles of the pile, and
  inserted in two separate tubes full of water.            A black crust
  was seen upon the negative wire, which was easily separated
  from the metal which          it covered, and which, when folded
   in paper,  gave   it  a black tint   ; the copper from which it had
  been   detached     appeared     of the utmost metallic brilliancy.
  When the two wires           were    galvanized in a single recipient,
   the matter decomposed upon the negative wire showed itself
   in the >jjater of the vessel in the form of a small and very
   black arborization,      in alto relievo, contrary from that upon
   the gold wire.     Gas was liberated round the two wires. The
                                                                    black

black substance of this second experiment was easily col
lected, and was discovered to be hydrogenated copper. It
was insipid,    and insoluble   in water and ammonia ; soluble
in the nitric acid, which was not coloured blue, perhaps
because    the metal was not in sufficient quantity.       The  so
lution took place without effervescence.
   The copper wire galvanized positively in water, in       a sepa
rate tube, or in the same vessel where the negative galvani
zation takes place, is covered with oxide, which soon con
verts   itself into hydrogenated green oxide, passing to the
brown when dried by fire. The wire was coated with a crust
of   a steel  colour,   so slender that its nature   could not be
examined.       When     rubbed   upon paper it left an ashy feel,
and the copper under this crust was little      brilliant, and co
loured ; a circumstance which did not take place upon the
side of the negative pole.
   Two copper wires, less pure than the preceding, and of
the size   of a writing-quill, were galvanized in two separate
tubes.     A  whitish cloud was soon seen to descend from the
positive   wire,  the matter of which even penetrated through
a double piece of parchment with which the inferior opening
of the tube had been closed ; it arrived at the water of the
recipient common to both tubes, and was there converted
into hydrogenated oxide under the appearance of green flakes.
Upon the negative side a very small quantity of black hy
drogenated     copper was perceived ; an effect which the au
thor attributes to the impurity of the copper.           The expe
riment lasted twelve hours.        The  water of  the   two tubes,
and even that     of the recipient, became alkaline.
 (d)  Oxygenated Muriate of Iron, Hydrogenated Oxide of
    Iron, and Alkaline Martial Tincture, produced by Gal
    vanism.
    The author    had observed, that by galvanizing   in two  sepa
rate tubes, full   of pure water, two iron wires,    the one posi
tively and the other negatively, there was formed in the po
sitive tube, in less than sixteen hours action, an oxygenated
muriate    of iron, i.  e. with  excess of oxide of iron    ; a cir
cumstance which hindered the composition from reddening
                                 1 4                             the

 the tincture  of althea,  and made    it give with the prussiate
of potash a white precipitate, which in a few minutes, and
in the contact of the air, assumed a superb blue colour. We
may conclude from this, that the iron itvthis salt is at the
minimum of oxidation, and that, consequently, the first com
position formed is simple muriate, and not oxygenated mu
riate, as Pacchiani supposed. There was no sensible quan
tity of crust upon the metallic wire, and scarcely did the
surface of the negative wire assume the slightest tint of
black; but it rendered the water into which it was plunged
strongly alkaline.
    This   experiment     was  repeated     with    iron  wires   of  a
quarter of a line in diameter, submitted for twenty hours
to the action of a strong pile. A certain quantity of oxide
of iron   was seen filtering through the two membranous folds
which closed the tube at bottom, and         a considerable quantity
of a deposit of the colour of ochre         appeared at the bottom
of the water of the recipient common             to both tubes  :  this
precipitate had all the characters    of  a  hydrogenated oxide of
iron.    A  portion of this deposit, in contact with the parch
ment which formed the negative tube, was decomposed, and
had passed to the deep black.       The water of the common
recipient was neither acid nor alkaline.
    The author proceeds afterwards to the examination of the
changes which happened to the two iron wires attached on
one part to the poles of the pile, and plunging upon the
other side in the water of a common recipient.               Here, in
the same manner, no sensible production of gas was ob
served on the positive side, while it was very abundant on
the negative side.     The water of the recipient soon became
yellow ; which proved that the iron was there in a particular
state  of combination.
    Upon the positive side, besides the portion of muriate of
iron which was dissolved in water, there was a very abun
dant oxide of this metal visibly precipitated, which was soon
hydrogenated.      It assumed   a yellow colour       and a flaky ap
pearance;   it was  insipid, and insoluble in water.      When col
lected upon white blotting-paper, this precipitate assumed a
deep red colour.       On exposure to a gentle heat, the colou
                                                             changed

changed in proportion as the water evaporated, and nothing
else remained than a blackish oxide.
    The author concludes from these facts, that iron positively
galvanized in water does not there experience its greatest
possible degree of oxidation, and that the colour which it ac
quires happens from its particular combination with water;
a combination hitherto unknown or neglected by chemists.
     The negative wire was covered after several hours Gal
vanism     with  a  portion of the oxide of hydrogcnated iron
which came from the positive pole. But this oxide was de
composed there, converted into alkaline oxide of iron of a
yellow colour, and very soluble in water.            It is this singular
combination      which occasions        the yellow   tint of the water
of the recipient,     a liquid thus converted into a true alkaline
tincture of mars.
     Towards the extremity of the wire a portion of the hydro-
genated oxide of iron became blackened, and converted into
hydrogenated iron of the deepest black.
     The yellow water in this experiment did not form blue
with    the prussiate  of potash,    and scarcely greened     the purple
tincture of althea,    which the author employed as the most
sensible re-agent    in  the presence of the acids or the alkalis.

 Disengagement      of   the   Carbonate    of  Soda   in pure JVater
     galvanized with Charcoal; Hydrogenated Charcoal;               Pro
    ject of a solid Vegetable Pile.
     The author determined to examine what was the change
 which water underwent when galvanized by the interme
 dium of charcoal.       He took out of a burning furnace some
 pieces of charcoal      of   about an inch and a half in length,
 and, after having extinguished and cooled them, he shaped
 them with a knife into slender strips of about three lines in
 ii/.c, and pierced at one extremity.            An iron wire passed
 into this hole  ; and one of the wires leading from the char
 coal thus prepared communicated with the positive pole,
 the other with the negative pole of a strong pile.                  The
 charcoal was more         than   half  immersed    in  the water of a
 separate tube.     The     tubes   were closed   below with parch
                                                                   ment,

 ment, and they were all plunged into one vessel containing
 water.
    The    gas   was  abundantly liberated in the positive tube
 during the whole time of the experiment.                At first only
 a few bubbles were seen upon the negative side, and they
 soon disappeared.        After 24 hours of galvanization the au
 thor found carbonate of soda in the water of the negative
 pole. That of the positive tube, in which so much gas was
disengaged, appeared         to contain    only a few atoms     of this
 salt.
    On the positive       side  the   charcoal preserved   its surface
 very black, but that of the negative charcoal was singularly
whitened by combining with the hydrogen as it was forminc;.
    It is the opinion of Kinvan (Phil. Trans. 1785.) and Ber-
thollet (Stat. Chim. t. ii.) that charcoal contains hydrogen,
because     in certain circumstances it yields an inflammable gas :
but the author strongly suspects that the inflammable gas ob
tained, in a close vessel, even from calcined charcoal, comes
from a little humidity attracted from the atmosphere in cool
ing, and which is decomposed at the burning temperature ;
or perhaps that it is only the gaseous oxide of carbon, so
well examined by Cruickshank.             He founds this conjecture
upon     the   observation    which    he had    made,  that charcoal
scarcely beginning to be hydrogenated by Galvanism, changes
all at once the electrometer character, as gold docs; and
from negative      becomes     positive, compared with other char
coal,    and tried with the frog,      after the method of Gaivani.
It is probable that upon thus giving the negative property
to 100 disks of charcoal, and by uniting them to 100 other
disks   of pure carbon, we might form          a solid and active ve
getable    pile, by placing, in the usual way, between the disks
united two and two, rounds of wet pasteboard.                Thus we
might     have   a pile analogous to that of Ritter, which has
been called the charging pile.

The Black Oxide         of Manganese may         be  hydrogenated by
          Galvanism.   — Character     which distinguishes it.
   The author remarked, in the course of all his experiments
                                                                 upon

Upon metals and their oxides, that the former combined with
hydrogen, and that the latter returned to the metallic state
by the action of the negative side of the pile.       He attributes
this last effect to the more powerful affinity of the origi
nating hydrogen.        But the black oxide of manganese forms
an exception.        When it is galvanized in water negatively,
no gas is disengaged      ; the  oxide is not reduced  ;  it does not
become white, but it is united to hydrogen.              One of the
characters which distinguish it is the positive property which
it acquires compared with oxide of manganese, which has
 not been submitted to this operation.

 Disengagement of an Alkali in distilled Water by the Con
     tact of a single Metal, without the Electrometer Appa
     ratus.
     In the course of his experiments upon the galvanization
 of metals in pure water, and upon the influence of metals
 upon water, independently of the action of the pile of Volta,
 the author never remarked          that water acquired acid proper
 ties by any contact, however long, with any given metal.
     We know that zinc        and    iroh decompose water at every
 temperature.       The author placed fragments of each of these
 two metals in two separate phials with a volume of distilled
 water double their bulk ; he left them in contact with this
 liquid until     the decomposition had reduced it to two-thirds
 of its volume.       The metals were sensibly oxidated ; a great
  deal  of hydrogen    was   disengaged   ; but the water underwent
  no sensible change.
      He afterwards poured two ounces of distilled water upon
  five ounces of zinc, in small pieces, contained in a phial of
  eight ounces capacity, closing it with a ground stopper.
  He agitated the mixture strongly for a quarter of an hour.
  The water became muddy, and deposited a trray powder.
  It was agitated again for nearly five hours with little inter
  ruption   ; the  quantity of gray powder was much augmented.
  The muddy      water  was decanted, and allowed to settle.         It
  had a particular smell and a fetid taste. But what most sur
  prised the author was, that it greened the spirituous tincture
                                                                     of

 of althea,         and troubled a little          the solutions of mercury and
 silver.                                                                    .
   After washing the zinc employed in the above experiment
in distilled water, the same process was repeated with it se
veral times, and always with the same effects.
     Filings of copper          and     of iron,   treated in the same manner,
also produced an alkaline substance in water.      Mercury it
self, after a long agitation in distilled water, also produced
alkali in this liquid.              We know that Priestley remarked that
he had also formed              a   black oxide of mercury in water, and
that the water acquired both smell and taste              ; but the alka
line matter which was formed or disengaged                            in his experi
ment had cscapecj him.
     The pulverulent           substances      which are deposited              in water
in which metals have been agitated arc oxides of the greatest
tenuity. That of zinc is gray ; that of copper brown ; that
of iron  and mercury is black.   And as the air contained in
the phials in which these metals are agitated undergoes no
sensible change, it appears evident that by this process the
metal is united to the oxygen                 of
                                            the water, without any ap
preciable quantity of            hydrogen gas beinu; disengaged.
  The water rendered                    alkaline by the processes which we
have mentioned greens                   the purple tincture of althea; but if
it   is allowed to settle some hours upon these same metals, it
loses its alkaline properties. It must follow, then, that the
alkali is either decomposed, or that it enters into some new
combination.
   In order to determine the nature of this alkali, the author
poured        a   little muriatic   acid upon water alkalized by mer
cury       and      by zinc,     and filtered. He afterwards evapo
rated      it,    and obtained      a   salt in short and      transverse
                                                                spicula               ;
but   it   was     in    too small quantity to determine its nature with
certainty.              He ascertained, however, that     was not soda
                                                                 it                   ;
and      he       had    every reason to believe        that   it   was muriate      of
ammonia.

may perhaps excite the curiosity of those chemists who fol
low Galvanic experiments.            I have hitherto abstained from
drawing any      conclusion,     because    I saw the necessity of ob
serving more and more attentively, and of collecting a
greater   number of facts, before          attempting to establish any
theory.       Many researches        still remain to be made, and
many     doubts   to clear up.
    "  1. It must be ascertained        whether the gas which is dis
engaged from charcoal in water positively galvanized, and
from all those metals which in place of muriatic acid yield
at length an alkali, is oxygen gas ; or is it of another de
scription ?
    "  2. Whether the alkali which is manifested in water
 positively galvanized by the metals, is the same with that
which is formed in water by the action of the negative pole,
 and which is soda.
    " 3. If the presence of water is essential to the formation
 of soda by Galvanism.
    " 4. What are the component parts of this alkali.
 -  "  5. If  the carbonic acid with which the soda is saturated,
 that is produced in water negatively galvanized with char
 coal, proceeds entirely from charcoal alone.
    "  6.  If the  Galvanic     fluid, very active in its nature, and
 probably composed of something more than a subtle fluid,
 does not furnish some ingredients to the compounds which
 manifest themselves in the action of Galvanism.
    "  7.  If  we    can  obtain the same products upon galva
 nizing water by the        above processes, without the contact of
 the atmospheric air, or in an atmosphere of gas which was
 foreign to it.      r

 vanism,    and    by the   intermedium of the metals, charcoal,
 and oxide    of manganese.

 of the oxygen and hydrogen in metals galvanized in this
 liquid, are uniformly and exclusively the effect of the de
 composition.

tained from the Galvanic action may be also manifested by
the influence of electrical currents produced by common
machines     ; since the electric fluid does not appear to differ
essentially from the Galvanic, although the contrary has
been asserted.
   " 12. If the    formation of an alkali by the contact of water
with   a single metal comes also from Galvanism,        why is this
alkali not soda ? If it is that of ammonia, as there is reason
to believe, how can this alkali be produced in the midst of
a strong agitation     and in distilled water, which contains no
sensible quantity of azote     ?
   "  13.   Why gold, platina, iron, and        the black  oxide of
manganese, when positively galvanized in water, form mun

   " 14. If the metals or the metallic oxides, which produce
the muriatic acid by Galvanism, always liberate oxygen ga»,
(except iron alone, which is oxidated on this occasion,) why
is muriatic acid not obtained with the other metals also
which    are oxidated   in water, as  well as iron, when positively
galvanized in this liquid ? Why can we not produce muri
atic acid in water by means of iron and zinc, metals which
take its oxygen from it even in the cold, and, without the
assistance of any known electrometer apparatus, which are
even oxidated themselves      ?  and why is an alkali   rather pro
duced in this case    ?
   "   The Galvanic experiments upon which          I am at present
occupied, have for their object to resolve some of the ques
tions I have now announced, aud will form the subject of
future publications."

    Effects of Compression in modifying                the Action of Heal.

Measurement         of the Force required        to constrain the Carbonic
    Acid. —Apparatus with            the  Muzzle of the Barrel upwards,
    and the Weight acting by a long Lever. — Apparatus with
    the Muzzle downwards. —Apparatus with Weight acting
    directly on the Barrel. — Comparison of various Results.
In     order to determine, within certain limits at least,                 what
force    had     been   exerted    in   the   foregoing experiments, and
what was necessary to ensure their success, I made a num
ber    of experiments in        a mode nearly allied to that followed
by Count Rumford in measuring the explosive force                      of gun
 powder.
     I  began to use the following simple apparatus in June
              I
 1803 : — took one of the barrels, made as above described,
 for the purpose of compression, having a bore of 0*75 of an
 inch *,     and   dressed    its muzzle to a sharp edge.               To this
 barrel was firmly screwed a collar of iron (aa, fig. 36) placed
 at a distance of about three inches from the muzzle, having
 two strong bars (bb) projecting at right angles to the barrel,
 and dressed square.             The barrel, thus prepared, was intro
 duced, with its breech downwards, into the vertical muffle
  (fig. 35) ; its length being so adjusted, that its breech should
 be placed in the strongest heat; the two .projecting bars
  above described resting on two other bars (cc, fig. 35) laid
  upon the furnace to receive them ; one upon each side of the
  muffle.       Into   the barrel so placed was introduced a cradle,
  containing      carbonate,      with all the arrangements formerly
  mentioned, the rod connected with it being of such length
  as just to lie within the muzzle of the barrel.                    The liquid
  metal was then poured in till it filled the barrel, and stood
     * This was the size of barrel used in all the
                                                     following experiments, where
  the fact is not otherwise expressed.
                                                                               at

  at the muzzle with a convex surface ; a cylinder                 ef iron, of
  about an inch in diameter and half an                inch thick, was laid
  on the muzzle        (fig. 35 and 37), and to it a compressing
  weight was instantly applied. This was first done by the
  pressure of a bar of iron (de, fig. 35), three feet in length,
  introduced     loosely    into    a   hole   (d),     made for the pur
  pose   in the wall against which            the   furnace stood, the di
  stance   between    this hole and the wall being one foot.                A
 weight was then suspended              at the extremity of the bar (e),
 and    thus   a  compressing force was applied equal to three
 times that weight.         In the course of practice, a cylinder of
 lead was substituted for that of iron, and a piece of leather
 was placed between        it and the muzzle          of   the barrel,  which
 last being dressed to a pretty sharp edge, made an impres
 sion in the lead : to assist this effect, one smart blow of a
hammer was struck upon the bar, directly over the barrel,
as soon as the weight had been hung on.
     It was essential,    in this mode of operation, that the whole
of    the metal    should continue in a liquid state during the ac
tion of    heat ; but when      I  was satisfied     as to its  intensity and
duration, I congealed the metal, either by extinguishing the
furnace entirely, or by pouring water on the barrel. As
soon as the heat began to act, drops of metal were seen to
force themselves between the barrel and the leather, follow
ing each other with more or less rapidity, according to cir
cumstances.         In some experiments there was little exuda
tion ; but few of them were entirely free from it. To save
the metal thus extruded,          I  placed a black lead crucible, hav
ing its bottom perforated, round the barrel, and luted close
to it (fig. 37) ; some sand being laid in this crucible, the
metal was collected on its surface.                On some occasions, a
sound of ebullition       was  heard     during   the  action of heat ; but
this was a certain sign of failure.
    The results of the most important                of   these experiments
have been reduced to a common standard                   in the second table
placed in the Appendix ; to which reference                  is made by the

not sufficient.         I      on a weight of 1 cwt., or
                            then hung
112 lbs.; by which a compressing force was applied of
8 cwt., or 336 lbs. Very little metal was seen to escape,
and no sound of ebullition was heard.    The chalk in the
body of the large tube was reduced to quicklime; but what
lay in the inner tube was pretty firm, and effervesced to the
last. One or two facettes, of good appearance, were like
wise found.        The contents        of    the small tube      had   lost but
2-C per cent.; but there was a small visible intrusion of
metal, and the result, by its appearance, indicated a greater
loss.  I considered this, however, as one point gained ; that
being the first tolerable compression accomplished by a de
terminate force. The pyrometer indicated 22°.
   This experiment was repeated the same day, when                         a   still
smaller quantity        of metal       escaped     at the muzzle ; but the
barrel     had given way below,              in the manner of      those       that
have yielded for want         of sufficient air.      Even this result was
satisfactory, by showing that a mechanical power, capable
of forcing some of the barrels, could now be commanded.
The carbonate in the little tube had lost 20 per cent. ; but
part of it was in a hard and firm state, effervescing to the
last.
   No.     2. — On the 21st       of June     T   made an experiment           with
another barrel, with the same circumstances.    I had left an
empty space in the large tube, and had intended to introduce
its muzzle downwards, meaning that space to answer as an
air-tube ; but it was inverted by mistake, and the tube, en
tering with its muzzle upwards, the empty space had of
course filled with metal, and thus the experiment was made
without any included air. There was no pyrometer used ;
but the heat was guessed to be about 25° where the subject
of experiment lay. The barrel, when opened, was found
full of metal,     and the cradle being laid flat on the table, a
considerable quantity        of    metal      ran from   it,   which had un
doubtedly been       lodged       in   the    vacuity of the      large    tube.
When cold, found that vacuity still empty, with plating

little tube, and the cylinder of chalk, I had put some borax
and sand, with a little pure borax in the middle, and chalk
over it.      The metal had not         penetrated  beyond the borax
and sand, by a good fortune peculiar to this experiment ;
the intrusion of metal in this mode of execution being ex
tremely troublesome.             The button of chalk was found in a
state of clean white carbonate, and pretty hard, but without
transparency.          The little tube was perfectly clean.            Its
weight,       with its contents,       seemed    to  have   suffered   no
change from what it had been when first introduced.                  At
tending,      however,     to  the balance  with  scrupulous   nicety,   a
small preponderance did appear on the side of the weight.
This     was    done away by the addition of the hundredth of
 a grain to the scale in which the carbonate lay, and an ad
dition of another hundredth produced in it a decided pre
ponderance. Perhaps, had the tube, before its introduction,
been     examined with the same care, as great a difference
might     have been detected       ; and it seems as  if there had been
no loss, as least not more than one hundredth of                 a grain,
which, on        10-95    grains, amounts to 0-0912, say 0-1 per
cent.      The   carbonate was loose in the little tube, and fell
out by shaking.          It   had  a yellow colour, and compact ap
pearance,      with  a  stony hardness    under the knife, and a stony
fracture    ;  but with very slight facettes, and little or no trans
parency.        In some parts of the specimen, a whitish colour
seemed to indicate partial calcination.             On examining the
fracture,     I perceived, with the magnifier, a small globule of
metal, not visible to the naked eye, quite insulated and
single.       Possibly    the   substance may have contained others
of   the   same sort, which may have compensated for a small
loss   ; but there could not be many such, from the general
clean appearance of the whole.             In the fracture, I saw here
and there small round holes, seeming, though imperfectly,
to indicate a beginning of ebullition.
    I made a number of experiments in the same manner,
that is to say, with the muzzle of the barrel upwards, in
.^oiTie  ot which I obtained very satisfactory results ; but it
was only by chance that the substance escaped the conta
mination of the fusible metal ; which induced me to think
                                                                        of

  of another mode of applying the compressing weight with
  the muzzle of the barrel downwards, by which I expected
  to repeat,  with   a determinate weight,      all the experiments
  formerly   made   in  barrels   closed by congealed metal ; and
  that, by making use of an air-tube, the air, rising lo the
  breech, would secure the contents of the tube from any
  contamination.      In this view, the barrel       was  introduced
  from below into the muffle with          its breech upwards, and
  retained in that position by means of a hook fixed to the
 furnace, till the collar was made to press up against the grate,
  by an iron lever, loaded with a weight, and resting on a
 support placed in front.       In some experiments made in this
 way, the result was obtained very clean,          as had   been  ex
 pected ; but the force had been too feeble,        and when it was
 increased, the furnace yielded upwards by the mechanical
 strain.
     I found it therefore necessary to use a frame of iron (as
 in fig. 38, the frame being represented separately in fig. 39),
 by which the brick-work was relieved from the mechanical
 strain.   This frame consisted of two bars (ab and fe, figs.
 38 and 39), fixed into the wall (at a and        f),  passing hori
 zontally under the furnace, one on each side of the muffle,
 turning downwards at the front (in b and e), and meeting
 at the   ground, with a flat bar (cd) uniting the whole.          In
 this manner, a    kind   of  stirrup (bcde) was formed in front
 of the furnace, upon the cross bar (cd) of which a block of
wood (hh, fig. 38) was placed, supporting an edge of iron,
upon which the lever rested, the working end of the lever (g)
acting upwards.       A strain was exerted, by means of the
 barrel and its collar, against the horizontal bars (ab and fe),
 which was effectually resisted by the wall (at a and          f)  at
one end of these bars, and by the upright bars (cb and de)
at the other end.      In this manner the whole strain was sus
tained by the frame, and the furnace stood without injury.
    The iron bar, at its working end, was formed into the
shape of a cup (at g), and half filled with lead, the smooth
surface of which was applied to the muzzle of the barrel.
The lever, too, was lengthened, by joining to the bar of
iron a beam of wood, making the whole ten feet in length.

In this manner,         a pressure upwards was applied                      to the barrel
equal to the weight           of    10 cwt.
  In the former method, in which the barrel stood with its
muzzle upwards, the weight was applied while the metal
was liquid. In this case it was necessary to let it previously
congeal, otherwise the contents would have run out in
placing the barrel        in the muffle, and to allow the liquefac
tion   essential    to these trials to be produced by the propaga
tion   of heat from the muffle downwards.                          This method re
quired, therefore, in           every case the use            of   an air-tube; for,
without     it,   the heat acting upon the breech, while the metal
at the     muzzle   was still cold,          would infallibly have destroyed
the barrel.        A
                great number of these experiments failed,
with very considerable waste of the fusible metal, which on
these occasions was nearly all lost. But few of them suc      a

  No.      7. —On the 26th a similar                   experiment was made, in
which     the barrel was thrown open, in spite                  of this powerful
compressing force, with a report like that of a gun (as I was
told, not having been present), and the bar was found in a
state of strong vibration. The carbonate was calcined, and
somewhat frothy ; the heart                    of one    piece        of chalk   used was
in a state of saline marble.
    It now occurred        to me to           work with       a   compressing force,
and no air-tube,  trusting, as happened                           accidentally in one
case, that the expansion of the liquid would clear itself by
gentle exudation, without injury to the carbonate.   In this
mode it was necessary, for reasons lately slated, to place
the muzzle upwards.    Various trials made thus, at this
time, afforded      no remarkable results.                        But I    resumed        the
method, with the following alteration in the application                                      of
the weight, on the 27th of April 1804.
    I   conceived that some inconvenience might arise from the
mode      of employing the weight in the former experiments.
In them it       had     been applied              at the end     of   the bar, and its
effect propagated        along      it,   so as to press against the barrel at
its other extremity.    occurred to me, that, the propagation
                           It
of motion in this way requiring some sensible time,      con                         a
siderable quantity of carbonic acid might escape,      sudden               by   a
eruption, before that propagation had taken effect.  there                       I
fore thought that more effectual work might be done by
placing    heavy mass (fig. 40) so as to act directly and

  foundry a large mass of iron             (f), intended, I believe, for
'
  driving piles, and which, after allowing for the counterpoise
  of the beam, gave a direct pressure of 8-1 cwt.; and I could,
  at pleasure, diminish the compressing force, by placing a
  bucket (e) at the extremity of the lever, into which I intro
  duced weights, whose effect on the ultimate great mass was
  known by trial.       t  Many     barrels failed in these trials  :  at last
  I  obtained one of small hore, inch 0-54, which gave two
  good results on the 22d of June 1804.
      No. 8. —Wishing to ascertain the least compressing force
  by which the carbonate could be effectually constrained in
  melting heats,      I   first observed every thing standing firm in

  bucket, till the compressing force was reduced to 2 cwt.
  Till   then, things continued steady ; but, on the pressure
  being still further diminished, metal began to ooze out at
  the muzzle       with      increasing rapidity.     When the pressure
  was reduced to       1-J.  cwt. air rushed out with a hissing noise.
  I   then stopped the experiment, by pouring water on the
  barrel.    The piece of chalk had lost 12 per cent. It was
  white and soft on the outside, but firm and good in the
  heart.                       -  i

  to work with 4 cwt. only ; but the barrel was no sooner
  placed, than an exudation of metal began at the muzzle,
  owing, doubtless, to the elasticity of the water. I imme
  diately increased the pressure to 8-l cwt. by removing the
  weight from the bucket ; when the exudation instantly
  ceased.     I continued        the fire for three quarters of an hour,
  during which time             no  exudation happened ; then all came
  out remarkably clean, with scarcely any contamination of
  metal.    The loss amounted           to 2-58 per cent.   The  substance
  was tolerably indurated,          but had not acquired the character

as far from complete,                    I   shall add but      a   few observations to
what        I   have already laid before this society,                     in   the sketch   I
had the honour to read                       in this place on the 30th of August
last.
   The following incidental occurrence led me to enter upon
this subject rather prematurely, since I had determined first
to satisfy myself with regard to the carbonate of lime.
  Observing, in many of the last-mentioned class of experi
ments, that the elastic matters made their escape between
the muzzle                 of   the barrel and the cylinder           of   lead,    I was in
the habit, as mentioned above,                          of placing    a piece      of leather
batween          the lead and the barrel            ;     in which position, the heat
to which the leather was exposed was necessarily below that
of melting           lead.      In an experiment, made on the 28th No
vember 1803,                in order to ascertain the power of the ma
chinery, and the quantity of metal driven out by the expan
sion of the liquid, there being nothing in the barrel but
metal, I observd, as soon as the compressing apparatus was
removed, (which on this occasion was done while the lower
part of the barrel was at its full heat, and the barrel standing
brim full of liquid metal,) that all the leather which lay on
the outside of the circular muzzle of the barrel remained,
being only             a   little browned and crumpled                 by the heat to
which it          had been          exposed.        What        leather lay within the
circle, had disappeared ; and, on the surface of the liquid
metal, which stood up to the        of the barrel,  lip
                                                    saw large               I
drops of     shining
                 a    black liquid, which,  on cooling, fixed
into    crisp black substance, with
        a                               shining fracture, exa
actly like pitch  or pure coal.     burned, though not with
                                                    It

The important circumstance                       here,    is   the different manner        in
which the heat has acted on the leather, without and within
the rim of the barrel.   The only difference consisted     com                      in
pression,    which,
                  to  therefore, the difference of  effect must
be ascribed                by
                 its force, the volatile matter of the leather
                   :
which escaped from the outward parts, had within the rim
been constrained to remain united to the rest of the compo
sition,         upon which          it   had     acted    as   flux, and the whole

Had the pressure been continued till all was cool, these sub
stances must have been retained, producing a real coal.
   On the 24th of April 1803, a piece of leather used in a
similar manner (the compressing force being continued,
however, till all was cold) was changed to a substance like
glue, owing doubtless to compression, in a heat under that
of melting          lead.
  These observations led me to make a series of experiments
with animal   and vegetable substances, and with coal ; the
result of which I have already laid before the society. I shall
now repeat that communication,                            as   printed in Nicholson's

Journal for October last (1804).                                                                  ^
     f    I   have likewise            made        some   experiments with coal,
treated       in    the     same manner as             the carbonate of lime : but
I   have found it much less tractable ; for the bitumen, when
heat is applied to              it,
                     tends to escape     its simple elasticity,by
whereas the  carbonic   acid  in marble    in part retained         is                            by
the chemical force of quicklime.     succeeded,   however, in

complete fusion, and to retain its faculty of burning with
flame.         But   I      could not accomplish this in heats capable of
agglutinating             the carbonate;  for  have found, where
                                                      I             ram               I

coal has   lost about half its weight, together with its power
of giving            flame     when burnt,            remaining          in   a   very compact
state,        with
                shining fracture.

has not afforded the desired result,   answers another pur     it

has explained this fact,                      by
                             supposing that the bituminous
matter of the coal has been driven    the local heat of whin

 ried on under the action of a pressure capable of constraining
 the carbonic acid of the calcareous spar, which occurs fre
 quently in such rocks.          In the last-mentioned experiment
 we have a perfect representation of the natural fact ; since
 the coal has lost its petroleum, while the chalk in contact
 with it has retained its carbonic acid.
    " I have    made some experiments         of the   same  kind, with
 vegetable    and animal substances.          I found their volatility
 much greater than that of coal, and           I was compelled, with
 them, to work in heats below redness              ; for, even in the
 lowest red heat,        they were apt to destroy the apparatus.
 The animal substance I commonly used was horn, and the
 vegetable, saw-dust of fir.        The horn was incomparably the
 most fusible and volatile      of the two.       In a  very slight heat
it  was converted into a yellow red substance, like          oil, which
 penetrated    the   clay tubes through and through.            In  these
experiments      I therefore made use of tubes of glass.          It  was
only   after a considerable portion      of the substance had been
separated    from    the   mass   that the   remainder assumed the
clear black peculiar to coal.          In this way I obtained coal
both from saw-dust and from horn, which yielded a bright
flame in burning.
    " The mixture of the two produced a substance having
exactly the smell of soot or coal tar. I am therefore strongly
inclined to believe, that animal substance, as well as vege
table, has contributed        towards the formation of our bitu
minous strata.       This   seems  to confirm an opinion, advanced
by Mr. Keir, which has been mentioned to me since I made
this experiment.         I conceive that the coal which now re
mains in the world is but a small portion of the organic
matter originally deposited : the most volatile parts have been
driven off by the action of heat before the temperature had
risen high enough to bring the surrounding substance into
fusion, so as to confine the elastic fluids, and subject them
to compression.
   "  In   several    of  these  experiments I found, when the
pressure was not great, when equal, for instance, only to
eighty atmospheres, that the horn employed was dissipated
entirely, the glass tube which had contained it being left
                                                                 almost

almost clean ; yet undoubtedly, if exposed to heat without
compression, and protected from the contact of the atmo
sphere, the horn would leave a cinder or coke behind    of       it,
matter wholly devoid of volatility.  Here, then,     would  it
seem as   if   the moderate                by
                                       keeping the elements
                               pressure,
of the substance together, had promoted the general vola
tility, without being strong enough to resist that expansive
force, and thus, that the whole had escaped.     This result,
which should certainly not have foreseen in theory, may,
         I
perhaps, account for the absence of coal in situations where
its presence might be expected on principles         of   general ana-
logy-"
  Since this publication,  very natural question has been
                               a
put to me.    When the inflammable substance has lost
weight, or when the whole has been dissipated in these ex
periments, what has become of the matter thus driven off?
 I   must own, that to answer this question with perfect con
fidence, more experiments are required.    But, in the course
of practice, two circumstances have occurred as likely, in
most cases,     to have occasioned the loss alluded to.      I   found
in these experiments, particularly with horn, that the chalk,
both in powder and in lump, which was used to fill vacuities
in the tubes, and to fix them in the cradle, was strongly im
pregnated with an oily or bituminous matter, giving to the
substance the qualities of stinkstone.
                               a             conceive that the
                                                I
most volatile part of the horn has been conveyed to the
chalk, partly in state of vapour, and partly
                   a                                  by
                                               boiling over
the lips of the glass tube, the whole having been evidently
in   state of very thin fluidity. Having,
     a                                          in
                                             some cases, found
the tube, which had been introduced full of horn, entirely
empty after the experiment,       was induced, as above stated,
                                   I
to conceive, that, under pressure,    had acquired
                                           it        greater a
general volatility than had in freedom
                          it              and find that,
                                                ;    I                 in
the open fire, horn yields    charcoal equal to 20 per cent,
                                   a
ofthe original weight. But more experiments must be made
on this subject.
  Another cause of the loss of weight lay undoubtedly in
the excess of heat employed in most of them to remove the
cradle from the barrel.   With inflammable substances no
                                                                   air-

156          Effects    of Heat modified           by Compression.
air-tube was used, and, the heats being low, the air lodged
in interstices had been sufficient to secure the barrels from
destruction by the expansion of the liquid metal. In this
view, likewise, I often used lead, whose expansion in such
low heats     I    expected to be less than that         of   the fusible metal.
And     the lead requiring to melt    it a          heat very near to that             of
redness,     the subject    of experiment           was thus,         on removing
the cradle, exposed                a temperature which was
                            in freedom to
comparatively high.   But, observing that a great loss was
thus occasioned, I returned to the use of the fusible metal,
together with my former method of melting          plunging     it,    by
the barrel, when removed              from the furnace, into              a   solution
of muriate of lime,         by   which   it   could only receive            a   heat   of
250°  of Fahrenheit.
   The effect was remarkable in             the few experiments tried                  in
this way.    The horn did not,        in the other experiments,
                                              as
change    to  hard
              a    black  substance, but acquired    semi-fluid       a
and viscid consistency, with     yellow red colour, and
                                        a                  very                 a
offensive   smell. This  shows  that the substances which  here
occasioned both the colour and smell of the results, had been
driven off in the other experiments                 by
                                        the too great heat ap
plied to the substance when free from compression.
I    found that the organization of animal substance was
entirely obliterated       by
                           slight action of heat, but that
                                 a                                                     a
stronger heat was required to perform the entire fusion of
vegetable  matter. This, however, was accomplished     and                      ;
in several experiments pieces of wood were changed to jet                         a
black and inflammable substance, generally very porous, iu
which no trace could be discovered of the original organiza
tion.  In others, the vegetable fibres were still visible, and
are forced asunder        by   large and shining air-bubbles.
     Since   publication ef the sketch of my experiments
             the                                                                       I

account of various natural substancesnearly allied to coal,
and  Icould not help being struck with the resemblance
which my results bear to them, through all their varieties,
as   brought into view         by   that able chemist    ;    that resemblance
affording    presumption, that the changes which, with true
             a
scientific modesty, he ascribes to an unknown cause, may
                                                                                    have

                 Effects    of Heat modified        by Compression.              157
    have  resulted from various heats acting under pressure of
    various force. The substance to which he has given the
    name of retinasphaltum seems to agree very nearly with what
    I have obtained from animal substance, when the barrel was
    opened  by means of low heat.       And the specimen of wood
    entering into fusion, but still retaining the form of its fibres,
    seems very similar to the intermediate substance of Bovey
    coal and surturbrand,           which Mr. Hatchett            has assimilated
    to each other.          It is well known          that   the surturbrand       of
    Iceland consists of the stems of large trees, flattened to thin
    plates by some operation of nature hitherto unexplained.
    But     the last-mentioned       experiment seems to afford a plausi
    ble solution      of this puzzling phenomenon.
           In
          all parts of the globe we find proofs of slips, and va
    rious relative motions, having taken place amongst great
    masses      of rock, whilst they       were soft    in
                                             certain degree, and
                                                             a
    which have left unequivocal traces behind them, both in the
    derangement of the beds of strata, and in a smooth and
    shining   surface, called slickenside, produced by the direct
    friction of one mass on another. During the action of sub
    terranean heat, were a single stratum to occur, containing
    trees intermixed with animal substances,                 shell fish,   &c,   these
    trees would be reduced           to a soft and unctuous state, similar
    to that     of   the   piece   of wood in       the last-mentioned       experi
    ment, whilst the substance of the contiguous strata retained
    a considerable degree of firmness.   In this state of things,
     the stratum just mentioned would very naturally become the
     scene of a slip, occasioned by the unequal pressure of the
     surrounding masses.    By such a sliding moi.ion, accom
     panied by great compression, a tree would be flattened, as
     any substance is ground in a mortar, by the combination of
     a lateral and direct force. At the same time the shells along
     with the trees would be flattened like those described by
     Bergman, while those of the 3ame species in the neighbour
     ing limestone rock, being protected by its inferior fusibility,
     would retain their natural shape.

 XXTV. Report of Surgical             Cases   in  the   City Dispensary
   from the 1st of January to         the 30th    of June   1806.    Com
    municated by JOHN TAONTON, Esq. Surgeon to the City
    and Finstvry Dispensaries, and Lecturer on Anatomy ,
    Surgery,      &c.
 OINCE     tbe    last report (Philosophical Magazine, vol. xxiii.
 p. 312.) there have been admitted into this dispensary 362
 patients.

   Sixty-six have       been visited at home, and nine have under
gone operations.
    In the surgical report (see      January     1806) there were 115
patients under cure, of whom             107 have been cured, 6 re
lieved, and 2 are not known.
                              Surgical   Cases.
   S.  B.,   aet.  26, observed    a tumour      in her left   breast  for
several years, without being enabled            to assign any cause    for
its appearance,        having a hard irregular         surface, attended
with darting pain, and occasionally with a sensation of heat.
The emplastrum hydrarg. cum ammoniac, was applied, the
camphorated and saponaceous               liniments were used, and
other gentle stimulant applications, from which, in many
cases,  the most happy results have been experienced.                 This
mode of treatment having been persisted in for several
months without any benefit being obtained, (the tumour
bad even become larger, and was attended               with more pain,)
as there was no doubt with respect to the nature of the case,
it was thought right to propose the extirpation of it by ex
cision ; to which        the patient most readily acceded,        and the
operation was performed on the 16th             of April.    As   the dis
                                                                      ease

             Surgical  Cases in  the  City Dispensary.          1 59
ease was circumscribed,    and situated at the upper part    of the
breast, the removal of the whole gland was not necessary ;
and the integuments being free from disease, a single inci
sion only was required to expose the tumour ; on the re
moval of which, it was found to have taken on the true
scirrhous structure throughout its whole substance.
   She underwent the operation with the greatest fortitude,
and only complained of a little smarting pain for about one
hour after. She slept well at night, and appeared perfectly
easy in every respect on the following day, when two table
spoonfuls of the subsequent mixture were ordered to be taken
twice in the day.

   These were the only medicines required.           She sat up on
the  third  day   without the  least  inconvenience   : on the fifth
day the wound was dressed, which had nearly healed, and
she recovered    from one of the most formidable operations
without experiencing one unfavourable symptom.
   Eliz. J., aet. 20, naturally of a strong healthy constitu
tion,  has had     symptoms of stone in the bladder for about
three years,   during which time she has been under the care
of  several  professional gentlemen, none of whom appear to
have   had   any idea of her complaint; and the gentleman
under whose care she was placed for several weeks during
the last autumn, observed to her mistress, " that some
young fellow had been playing the rogue with her:" inti
mating that it was something connected with the lues ve
nerea.
   On the 8th of January        she was admitted into the      City
Dispensary,     the symptoms      strongly characterizing the dis
ease.    She was sounded      in a few days, and a stone disco
vered.     The operation was performed on the 26th of Febru
ary.    The stone resembled a flattened sphere, was of a firm
texture, and weighed near three ounces.
   She took a mixture of aq. am. acet. cum aq. menth. aa,
for the two first days ; and on the third day some magn.
                                                                 vit.

  vit. cum jalap.      These were all the medicines that were
  necessary,   as she  had neither fever, nor any unfavourable
  symptoms, and continued to recover fast, being up on the
  fourth day ; and on the sixth day was enabled to retain her
 water, when still ; and in a short time her health was com
  pletely reinstated.
     Jane R., an. 35,     of  a delicate constitution  and  low su
  ture, has had   a tumour in the left breast for several     years,
 hard and irregular on its surface, and frequently attended
 with hot darting pain. Several eminent surgeons have been
 consulted, all of whom concurred in its being of a trute
 scirrhous nature, and that it should be removed by excision.
     She was admitted a patient in the City Dispensary on the
  19th of February, and the operation was performed on the
 25th of the same month.           The breast was naturally small,
 but from the extent of the disease it w^s necessary to remove
 the whole gland     :  the integuments were brought together
 and supported by one suture, and straps of adhesive plaister.
    The smarting pain from the operation soon left her ; but
 as there was some     heat on the surface of the body, and the
 pulse  rather  quick, the following draught was ordered to be
 taken in the evening :

     26th.  A  gentle perspiration was     diffused over the whole
body; and, having       slept   all night, she was perfectly easy,
 and expressed herself desirous of having what might be
 thought proper to eat, as she missed her dinner of the pre
ceding day.
    She sat up on the third day after the operation, and in a
few days her health was much improved, not having occa
sion to take any medicines, except a few doses of magn. vit.
cum jalap.       On removing the dressing on the seventh day
from the operation, the wound had completely united by the
first intention, and remained perfectly easy till the 13th day
of March     ; when she complained of much smarting pain ;
and on the removal of the bandages the integuments were
inflamed to- some extent towards the axilla, which was oc
casioned    by exposure to cold the preceding day.        The cera
                                                               |um

 flammation soon dispersed, and her health and strength were

XXVI.        Description         of an improved Geometrical Plotting
     Quadrant, Level,            and Calculator, for the Use of Navi
    gation and Land Surveying, ascertaining inaccessible Di
    stances i and for demonstrating and determining various
    Problems in Geometry and Trigonometry.                        By Mr. Ro
    bert Salmon, of IVoburn*.
v/N      the    instrument        and parts thereof are engraved the
names given by the inventor, and made use of in these ex
planations ; the base line being that at right angles with the
90 degrees        on the arch,         as  it is also to the perpendicular,
which perpendicular always moves parallel to the 90 degrees.
For the use of land surveying, where the instrument can be
made stationary, the sight (marked a, fig. 1. PI. IV.) with
the small hole in it must be applied ; but for sea service, the
one b, fig. 2. with the mirror, must be substituted in its
place.
     Every person who has had occasion to describe or calcu
late the parts of the right-lined figures used in geometry,
perspective, surveying, navigation, dialing, architecture, &c.
&c. must have perceived that all of them are resolvable into
the most simple          of figures —a triangle, or           some   number      of
them.
     Hence the great importance of geometry and trigonome-

 the society, and ten guineas, were voted to Mr. Salmon for this communi

     try, in teaching, either by construction or calculation, the
     knowledge of all the properties or relations between the
     three sides and three angles, of which every plane triangle
     is composed.      Euclid having demonstrated, in the fourth
     proposition of the sixth book of his Elements, that in any
     two similar triangles (by which he means their having the
     same angles, without regard to the actual lengths of their
     sides, for one triangle may be very small and the other ever
     so large,) every pair  of the corresponding       sides  in the two
     triangles are proportional ; it is the business of trigonometry
     to solve such problems, with the help of the tables of sines
     and tangents, or of sectors, sliding or other rules, and scales,
    by which you can find, on inspection, a right-angled tri
     angle, exactly similar to any given right-angled triangle (or
    having one of its angles equal to 90°) which can be pro
    posed, or can occur in practice ; and by the Rule of Three
    we say, As any side of the tabular triangle is to the similar
    side, supposed to be known, of the triangle under consi
    deration, so is any other side of the same tabular triangle
    to the corresponding side supposed to be sought of the tri
    angle in question.     It is evident, that by means      of the  base
    line, perpendicular,    and either  the upper or lower limb of
    my instrument, by     the two motions of which the perpen
    dicular is capable, and the angular motion of which the
    limbs are capable, any right-angled triangle whatsoever, as
    CBE       or CDE, in    the  diagram fig. 6. may be instantly
    formed (by bringing the top corner of the perpendicular to
    touch the limb) with the same or greater facility than it
    could be taken out of a trigonometrical table, measured by
    the compasses on the sector, or set on any instrument now
    in use for that purpose. But no instrument that I have seen
    or   read  of is capable of forming immediately any obtuse-
    angled triangle, as on my geometrical plotting quadrant can
    be done ; nor can the trigonometrical tables be applied to
    produce the sides and angles of such a triangle without some
    trouble in any case, and in some of the most useful cases in
    practice the labour is very considerable.         I shall therefore
    give the solution of five problems.         First, supposing that
    fig. 6. represents my   instrument,    set to answer this and the
                 3                                             following

           Improved Geometrical Plotting Quadrant,                   &c.       165
   following problems         ;    A, B, C,     being the triangle under con
   sideration; then, since the L ACE is by Euclid (I. 20.)
   equal to the /. BAC, it is evident that this angle will be
   shown, or may be set, by means of the divisions on the arc
   FG:     also, that since        CBE      and   ICB   are also equal, the arc
   HI,    with    the addition          of  90°    (for the angle   EB A),    wall
  show the       Z  C B A of       the triangle ; it is equally evident that
   the arc   FH    will show        the sum of the two angles BCA and
   ACF,     at the same      time that the lengths of all the sides may
  be read oft",      on the divisions or scales, on CA, CB, and
  BA.      Therefore,
  First, — To      construct       or set a Triangle, having two           of its
               jingles and the Side between them given.
      Set the limb      CG,     to the division at        G, upon the arc     an
  swering to one of the angles, say A, and make it fast ; then
  to this  i  A add the other given angle (which we will call C),
  and set the other limb CH, and make it fast at the divi
  sion  H, on      the arc answering to the sum              of their  degrees ;
 then on the limb CG seek the length of the given side CA ;
 next, push the perpendicular up or down, till the parallel
 cuts the point A, (always observing the divided edges arc
 those you work to) and by the help qf the mill-headed nut
 move the perpendicular till its top corner just touches the
 limb    CH,    'say in the point B, when it is evident that the
 degrees on the arc H I, added to 90°, is equal to the angle B,
 and that the other sidesy CB and BA, may be read off there
on. Or supposing CBD to be the triangle, whose angles

         Improved Geometrical Plotting Quadrant,          &c.     167
   My solution to the last problem is inferior to the common
method of plotting the triangle on paper, and measuring the
angles with a protractor; but I have introduced it here to
show that      my instrument      is capable  of solving this as well
as all  other cases of obtuse-angled triangles, and might, by
extending the arc to a semicircle, as shown by the dotted
lines on the figure, solve any triangle.            In the practical
problems in surveying, which follow, the triangles can al
ways be taken right- or obtuse-angled, and the instrument
as at present constructed is fully competent.           I might here
add, that    a given line can readily, by my instrument, be di
vided into any number of equal parts; drawings might be
enlarged or diminished as readily as with the proportional
compasses,     and many other equally useful purposes may be
effected thereby.
First. — To measure an inaccessible Distance by a perpendi
   cular Line set off towards the right Hand, from the Line
   or Base between the Observer and Object.
   Set the base line of the instrument in a line pointing to
the object, at the same time place a staff at any distance, at
pleasure, as a perpendicular (being 90 degrees from the base).
On this perpendicular measure any distance (say 50 yards or
other measures) as a second station ; move the instrument
to this distance, and place it with its perpendicular in the
same    line  as before ;   the instrument     being so placed, set
the lower limb pointing        to the object, and    with the screw
make the same fast      ;  this done,    the distance of the object
will   be thus readily    known.       Raise the moving perpendi
cular of the instrument          to the divsion 50 (as before sug
gested), then with this height move the same, by means of
the nut, till the extremity intersects exactly the lower limb
before set, at which intersection the distance from the se
cond station will be shown         ; and  on the base line will also
at the same time be seen the distance        from the first station :
this is a case   of right-angled triangles.
   Note.    As  the divisions on the perpendicular are denomi
nated (either feet, yards, poles, or other measures), so will
the distances be indicated on the other limbs, and on the
base   of the instrument.
                                  L  4                     Secondly.

168      Improved Geometrical Plotting Quadrant, 5£c.
Secondly.   — To determine      the Distances     of any two inaccessi
   ble Objects,   both Objects    lying    in a  right Line from the
   Observer.
   As before directed, place the instrument with its base in
the line of the objects     ; then by means        of the upper limb,
set at 90 degrees,     place a staff as a perpendicular      at any di
stance   at pleasure    (say 50,   as before) .    This  done,   remove
the instrument      to this second station,         and place it so that
the upper    limb  (still at 90°) maybe in the same line as when
at the first station : this done, move the upper limb into the
direction   of  the nearest,    and the lower limb into the direc
tion  of  the most distant object ; which limbs           being so set,
and mafle fast, the distance of both objects from the second
station will be seen on the two limbs, and the distance from
the first station at the same time seen on the base line, by
setting and moving the perpendicular as directed in the last
case.    This is  also a case   of right-angled triangles.
Thirdly. — To measure an inaccessible Distance in an oblique
   Angle, wliere a right Angle cannot be obtained by reason
   of some Impediment        on the Ground.
   At the first station,     from which the distance is required,
place the instrument; then set up a staff, in any attainable
direction, to any distance at pleasure (the more distant the
better).    The instrument being set, with its base in direc
tion  to the staff, with one    of  the moving limbs take the angle
of the object,    and with the screw fix       it thereto. This donei
move the instrument .in the         direction of its base (being be
tween the first station and staff set up) to any certain di
stance (say 50 yards or measures), as a second station. From
this second station again take the angle of the object, and
thereto fix the other moving limb; this done, the distance
both from first and second station, as also the bases and
perpendiculars thereto, will thus readily be seen.               Set the
perpendicular at random to any height; move the same till
the upper point intersect the upper limb, or that most di
stant from the base ; then read off on the parallel the divi
sions parallel to the base subtended between the two hypo-
thenuscs or limbs l if this distance or division be equal to
                                                                     the

         Improved Geometrical Plotting Quadrant,                                         &c.       169
the distance measured                      on the base line              (i.   e. 50),      then the
distance of the object from both stations will be shown on
the two limbs, as will also the base and perpendicular on
the respective lines.   If the divisions on the parallel do not
agree with   the distance measured, the perpendicular must be
altered till that division be shown,                                when the required di
stance will       be given.                This     is   a   case   of our first problem.
Fourthly.— To level or                      measure the             Altitude       of    any Object.
  It   is only necessary                   to set the           plane of the instrument
vertical instead of horizontal                            by   means     of    the       joint under
the instrument,              whence evident every case may be
                                                it   is
known as on the horizon         and to level,   ;  only requisite        it    is
to set the spirit-level at the back  of the instrument, the base
line and every object cut                       by   the same        will   be level thereto.
 Fifthly. — To take Angles or Altitudes at Sea,                                          tvliere   lie
                                                                                                   I
                 Instrument                cannot be made stationary.
   For this purpose,      first requisite
                                  it   is                             to change the sight a,
fig.    and
       1,    substitute the  one    fig.                  b,        2
                                                                    ;    which being firmly
fixed and adjusted                at right angles with the upper                          limb,    it   is
evident that when                 by
                      reflection any object  brought to co                    is
incide on the mirror, at the extremity of the base line, with
another object seen in the direction of such base, the angle
will then        be    known, being double what the upper limb de
notes on the arch            to which true angle, or its double, the
                             ;
lower limb may be fixed, leaving the one with the mirror
again at liberty to take another observation and angle at any
distant place or time; which being so taken, this limb may
be also moved and fixed to double its apparent angle, and
the altitude or distance be then determined,                                         by   setting the
perpendicular              and    parallel           as      in other common                cases on
land.
   From this mode of determining distances,                                          as the use         of
calculations           and       of   tables         of   sines and tangents are super
seded,      it   is    presumed            that much convenience will arise to
the unlettered who may have occasion to use                      and thereby       it,
the errors of calculations will be avoided.
   As well            as   the before-mentioned                      purposes to which the
instrument applies,                   it   is   presumed         there   will      be found other
                                                                                               things

  I "0      Improved Geometrical Plotting Quadrant,            &c.
 things which it will perform, some it is hoped useful and
 some amusing, amongst which may be enumerated multi
 plication, division, rule of three, double rule of three, &c.;
 determining         the area or sides     of any sort of triangle from
 any proper data;           determining     the inscribing or inscribed
 circle   of any triangle,       square,  or polygon ; showing a mean
 proportional between two numbers, &c.
     It is presumed that an instrument, if perfectly made, on
 a large scale, would be found very useful and accurate in
 various practical calculations, as well for making               them  as
for proving them after made in figures.
     The following        are specimens    of the manner   of calculating
 by this instrument         :
 First Question. —        If   £. 100 in 12 Months produce 80 Shil
     lings   Interest,    what     will £.200 produce in 18 Months ;
     and also, what will it produce in 12 Months?
     On   the base line       of the instrument    set  £. 100.    On the
perpendicular set 80, for shillings interest. Then bring the
lower limb to intersect, which angle will then be, as per
question, equal to 12 months at all places on the base: hav
ing so fixed the lower limb, move forward the perpendicular
till it intersect the lower limb at the height 12 on the per
pendicular;         then raise    the perpendicular to 18,    and to the
extremity         thereof fix the upper limb to intersect, which
ans;le    will     then be in proportion as 18 to 12 to the lower
limb, being equal to the different times. The limbs being
so fixed,      it  is only requisite to move the perpendicular          to
200 on the base         ;  and, raising the perpendicular till it inter
sect the upper limb, you will have thereon the answer, 240
shillings; and at the same time, at the intersection on the
lower limb, 160, being the interest for            12  months only.
Second Question. — To determine the inscribed or inscribing
     Circle of any Polygon, the Side being given; for example
    the Hexagon, whose Side is 100 Feet.
    Set one      of the limbs to half the angle included in the re
quired side of the hexagon (i i?. 30 degrees), then sel the
perpendicular to the height of half the side given, being as
per question 50.           Then move     the perpendicular   till the ex-.
                                                                  tremity

           Improved Geometrical Plotting Quadrant,                               &c.       m
tremity intersect the limb before set, on which, at such in
tersection, will be denoted the radius of the inscribing circle,
and at the same time may be seen on the base the radius of
the inscribed circle.
Third Question. — To find a                     mean Proportional                between 600
                                                                                            '
                                         and 200.
This   depends on the well-known                      Property       of    a    right-angled
                                        Triangle.
   Set the perpendicular                    on the base line at the distance                 of
half of        the difference          of   the, two numbers               (i.   e. 600~"200);
this done, raise the perpendicular,                         and      move either          of the
limbs till the extremity of the perpendicular intersect thereon
at half the sum of the numbers, being 400.      This done, the
height of the perpendicular will show the proportional re
quired, being 347.
  Note. On the plate in which the perpendicular slides, will
be found Nonius's for subdividing the divisions on the base
or perpendicular, into ten divisions.

Although            following method of finding the exact time
                        the
of    noon has not the merit of much originality to recommend

limb of the sun's image crosses those semicircles, and there
will be several curves included between those points, through
the middle of which a right line being drawn from the centre
of the semicircles is a meridian line. After the line has been
drawn in this manner, it must be examined by succeeding
observations, and corrected if necessary, by which means
a line may be drawn exceedingly near the true meridian,                            as
appears from my former paper on this subject *.
                          Practical Observations.
  1.  The metal plate, which may be about one-fifth of an
inch thick, must be placed parallel to the axis of the world,
that the sun's rays may pass perpendicularly through it when
he is in the equator.
   2. The aperture need not be more than one-fifth of an
inch in diameter, if it be countersunk on both sides, to admit
the sun's rays to flow through it at the distance of three or
four hours before and after noon.
  3.    If the   surface of the floor on which                the     observations
are to be taken for finding the meridian be not sufficiently
even, the floor may be covered with new boards, taking the
greatest care that they are laid down perfectly horizontal
from east to west.  After the line has been correctly drawn,
and the north and south ends of it marked upon the walls of
the room, the boards may be taken away and others laid
down to draw the lines upon.
  A meridian line, upon a small scale,  but sufficiently cor
rect for regulating clocks and watches, may be had by the
following method :
  Let    a stone      with    an even surface,         about three feet long
and two broad, be fixed horizontally                  upon a brick or stone
pillar at a convenient height for observation,                        with one of
its ends facing the south.    Near the middle of this end of
the stone fix a gnomon,    in a* direction perpendicular to the
horizon. This gnomon, which should be made of a strong
bar of metal, must have a small aperture made through                              it,
for the sun's rays to flow through early in the morning and
late in the evening.   From that point, as centre, which  a                        is

directly under this aperture, draw several concentric semi
circles, and fix the meridian line according to the preceding'
directions. The gnomon should have several other holes made
through it in a line perpendicular to the horizon, that the>
sun's rays at noon, flowing through some of them, may fall
near the north end of the stone at all seasons of the year;
for if only one hole       he used, the sun's image      will fall near
the centre   of the gnomon       in the summer,     and in the winter
it will  be thrown far beyond the north end         of the stone.

 JL he salutary    effects   of the  most tempestuous weather are
so obvious that most persons have observed           them, and what
ever disagreeable   effects we may encounter       while  these august
operations are going on,       we are   fully compensated for in the
    Friday last (11th instant) was a very tempestuous day:
however, about ten o'clock P. M., after our atmosphere
was pretty much attenuated by the discharge of vast quan
tities of rain, much thunder, lightning, &c; and Jupiter
being retrograde      in longitude 9s 1° 521', i. e. in 1° 21' of
Capricorn, right ascension 272°, and consequently in that
part of the heavens which is about south -south-east of Lon
don, my attention was called, by an acquaintance of mine,
to a sight which afforded me a great deal of pleasure, viz.
**  a view  of the third     and   fourth satellite  of Jupiter by the
naked eye."      But though professor Bcauchamp, I think, was
so remarkable for the singular "acuteness of his vision,             that
he could discern these auxiliaries by his natural optics,          I was
apprehensive that I might be deluded by some stars of the
7th or 8th degree of magnitude.             Therefore, to prove the
identity of these secondary planets, I took a good night te
lescope to examine the primary and its satellites, as well as
                                                                       to

discern any : for the two satellites I had observed were in
the places    I   saw them by my naked eye,                    as   well       as the   two
other lesser ones ; that is to say, one of the outer ones was
on the eastern and the other three were on the western side
of their primary, thus            :                        ©        »      •             0

of vapours consequent upon his presence causes so great                                      a.
commotion in the atmosphere as to produce         continual              a
current of wind, and to carry the clouds in one direction
throughout most part of the torrid zone of our earth (called
a monsoon, or general trade wind, &c.). Now,        we were                if

 plain, I   think, that this current must give the clouds lineal                    a
 direction,       by   which they would               assume    the appearance               of
 one or more belts or girdles passing across the equatorial
 parts of the earth, and which belts would change their form
 and dimensions to an aerial                observer       in six months in             a   si

a year in that planet)  therefore think

 ing to suppose that Jovian trade winds, or something equi
 valent thereto, carrying his clouds in an equatorial direction,
 produce these mutations on the face of that planet which we
 call belts, and for which phenomena      have never seen any

     Grains and Farinaceous Substances.                By Messrs. Vau-
     ouelin    and  Fourcroy*.
  Six   years have now elapsed since we undertook a course                 of
  extensive  inquiries upon vegetation, germination,                and fer
  mentation, in the laboratories of the Museum of Natural
  History. Although our experiments were very numerous a
 long time ago, we did not wish to publish them until we
 might consider our labours on the subject as completed. In
 spite of all our exertions this period has not yet arrived ; the
 multiplicity of our experiments, however, has presented us
 with several facts, which, from their novelty, must be useful
 to the arts and sciences        dependent on them.             Besides, as
 several   chemists are about to publish memoirs and experi
 ments upon the same subject, we thought it advisable to
 publish our observations in their present shape.                 We shall
 commence,      therefore, by an analysis of the principal ali
 mentary grains, and by the experiments we had made upon
 their germination and fermentation.             We shall give at the
 conclusion    our labours upon the chemical phenomena                    of
 vegetation.
              § I. Analysis of    the  Farina of Wheat.
    The water in which       this farina has been macerated               in
equal quantities for six hours, clears very slowly ; it is co
lourless, of a mild insipid taste, with the smell of bruised
green corn ; it becomes frothy by agitation ; it does not
redden turnsole paper, and it is not acid like barley water;
it is precipitated by gall-nuts, by the acids, and particularly
by the oxymuriatic acid ; almost imperceptibly by the oxa
late  of potash,    and  not at all by lime water.             It does not
contain phosphate of potash, like the water which has been
used in the maceration of garden beans.
    This liquor speedily becomes sour, and even during filtra
tion ; it precipitates yellowish flakes by means of heat ; re
duced to one-half by evaporation, it becomes a little saccha-

  178            On the Germination and Fermentation
 haling oxymuriatic acid, and afterwards has all the appear
  ances of common gluten.
     It  dissolves    very freely in concentrated acetic acid,       which
 it renders     turbid, and from which           it may be    separated by
 means       of  the   alkalis, with all its properties, even after a
 lapse    of  many years.        This fact is already well known to
 chemists.
    Plunged into water at the temperature of 12° (53-fi Fahr.),
 this gluten melts, bubbles up to the surface, becomes sour
 and fetid, and exhales carbonic acid gas. The water filtered,
 and not clarified,        reddens   turnsole paper very strongly ; i$
 soon precipitated and clarified by the acids ; the oxymuriatic
 acid produces an abundant precipitate, if used in great
 quantity     :  it  is precipitated     also by infusion of ga'l-nuts
 and by the fixed caustic          alkalis,   which disengage ammonia
 from it. The latter, precipitated by the alkalis, is dissolved
 in plenty of water.
    The water of fermentation of the gluten (one pound with
 three ounces of white sugar) converted sugar into good
 vinegar, without either fermentation, effervescence, or con
 tact   of  the atmosphere.
    The gluten         already   fermented, put      a  second   time into
 water at the temperature of 12 degrees (53-6 Fahr.) ferments
 again, disengages carbonic acid, is weakly acidified, and its
 acidity is not increased at the end of three or four days. The
 water decanted, and by this time fetid, reddens tincture of
turnsole but slightly, and precipitates it ; it becomes turbid
by ammonia, the acids, infusion of galls, and the oxalate of
ammonia; it deposits gluten by an excess               of potash, exhaling
an ammoniacal vapour.
    After this      second     fermentation,     which   had formed am
monia and saturated the acid, the gluten becomes of a violet
purple colour, forms at the surface of the water a pellicle of
the same colour, becomes very fetid, passes afterwards to a
blackish gray, and soon exhales the same odour with putre
fied mucous membranes.               At this period the water which
floats above is blackish and muddy; it browns the nitrate of
silver; blackens        that  of mercury     at the minimum of oxida
tion bv losing its own colour          ;  becomes   milky   and inodorous
                                                                        by

 by the oxymuriatic        acid, and is no lunger precipitated by
  infusion of galls.
     After  three months' putrefaction   (March, April.     and  May)
 the gluten      had  a brown colour,    and   exhaled   only a weak
 smell, but presented a great diminution in volume and mass.
 Separated, and then submitted to desiccation, it dried into
 lumps, the smell of which resembled that of the earth of
 burying-places : it softened under the finger like wax ; it
 melted and burned with a flame and a smell like fat, yielded
 very little carbon, and dissolved in alcohol, to which it cave
 a brown colour ; the portion not dissolved         was dry,    pulve
 rulent, inodorous,      insipid, and very like the ashes of char
 coal ; it burned with the sharp smell of wood, without am
 monia, and left reddish gray ashes,       in which iron and silex
were found.
    In this putrid decomposition of gluten azote is united          to
hydrogen, and a portion of carbon to oxygen, in order               to
form ammonia and carbonic acid.           The carbon unitt'd more
 abundantly to hydrogen had produced the fat; and the prin
 ciples superabundant to the formation of the carbonic acid,
ammonia and fat, remained combined in a state something
like that of a ligneous body.
                     §  III.  Analysis of Barley.
    Good wholesome and fresh ground barley contains almost
always the acetic acid completely formed, and an animal
matter more abundantly soluble in water than that of the
farina   of wheat, on account of the         presence   of  the acid.
Some barleys are not acid at all.
    The water in which the farina of barley is diluted in equal
volume, forms a thick, gluey, mucilaginous soup ; when
clarified, it is of an amber colour; its surface becomes
brown,      and the colour fades by degrees.       After  the depar
ture   of  the acid, the water in which the barley is dissolved
remains milky, and does not clarify, except by repeated fil-
trations.      When drawn off, this water clarifies by itself, and
becomes purple. It is very acid, and very nauseous ; it con
tains an acid formed by fermentation, and an animal matter
in large quantity, which the acid renders soluble.

   The   last solution    of the barley contains no more saccha
rine matter ; it however experiences        the acttic fermentation^
is precipitated purple by       gall-nuts, while    by the acids and
the alkalis, which redissolve the precipitate, and it is preci
pitated   green    by the prussiate of potash. The substance?
which thickens the different waters which had washed the
barley, is very analogous to the gluten of wheat.
   The   above waters, heated to 60° (1 10°       of Fahr.),    become:
muddy, deposit very abundant yellowish               gray flakes, and1
yield red pellicles, brown at their surface.         These flake3 and"
pellicles, when burnt, leave a fifth of their weight          of phos
phate of lime and magnesia; they do not cause the               saccha
rine matter to ferment. The liquor, after acquiring            the con
sistence of syrup by evaporation,. mixed with sugar,          ferments
no longer, so that the vegeto-animal matter of barley, dis
solved in water, or already altered by fermentation, is not
the ferment      of sugar.
   The syrup of barley diluted in three or four parts of wa
ter, and the mixtures of the precipitates and of sugar, fer
mented and became sour, but without showing any appear
ance of alcohol ; the vegeto-animal matter of the barley and
sugar contributed to the formation of the acid. These sy
rups always preserved their saccharine matter and their ve
geto-animal viscous matter. The sugar, being greatly dimi
nished by these operations, may thus be acidified without
being first converted into wine, and without the contact of
the air.
   Barley water thickened into syrup is brown, sweet, and
acid ; it is abundantly precipitated by gall-nuts, oxymuriatic
acid, and the alkalis.        Alcohol precipitates from it a very
abundant brown         matter, which furnishes a good deal of
phosphate of lime       by combustion.
   These phenomena, belonging to the solution of a vegeto-
animal matter, explain why the vinegars produced from
grains are less agreeable and less decomposable than those
produced from wine ; and also why they precipitate by gall-
nuts, ammonia,        and the acids, while     wine vinegars do not
present    these characteristics.     We   see  also by this how the
vinegar    of grains  is better  preserved  after a  slight ebullition,

recommended           by Scheele, who,             no doubt, meant this kind
of vinegar alone.
   Barley, exhausted by washings in cold water, when di
gested .a tew days in alcohol, gives a yellow col<3ur to it j
when distilled this alcohol contracts the smell and taste of
spirits distilled from grain ; it leaves a thick oil, yellow,
brown, and greenish, which is even got from barley not di
luted, and which is then mixed with the saccharine sub
stance.        This discovery accounts for              the bitterness       of    the
water of peeled barley, and for the necessity of throwing
away the first decoction of this grain.
  One hundred parts of the farina of barley, macerated for
thirty hours in alcohol, gave it a golden yellow colour, and
the sharp taste of spirits distilled from grain. This alcohol
is precipitated by means of water, and becomes much more
odorous.  When distilled, it preserved its smell, and left
eight grammes of an oily matter, yellow, brown, and bitter,
and which eoudensed into a species of soft beer. This matter
contamed sugar, which the water had separated from      and                  it,
was reduced    to nearly an eighth of its primitive weight, in
such   a   manner, that the oil of the barley only made  hunj                a
dredth part of the grain.
  This oil becomes clotty like olive oil      volatilizes on red

                 ERUPTION OF MOUNT VESUVIUS.
        Extract of a private Letter,     dated Naples,    June  6.
On       the 31st  of last month     we enjoyed the spectacle      of an
eruption of Vesuvius.         A column of very black smoke rose
from the crater about ten o'clock; flashes now and then burst
from this column      ; at  length the eruption appeared in     a mass
of   flame   of immense diameter,         and  occupying    the  whole
vast extent of the crater.       This mass was kept up by succes
sive emissions of whitish flame, which, as it rose into the
air, assumed a more intense red colour.             Ignited or melted
substances     were projected with      violence above this body of
lire, and often fell beyond the circumference of the crater.
At midnight there was not as yet any current of lava, but
frequent rumblings were heard.
    On the 1st of June the eruption continued                the whole
morning,      and we resolved     to visit the mountain the follow
 ing night.
    We set out at eight in the evening. We took horse at
 Resina, near the descent to Herculaneum, and proceeded
 towards the residence of the Hermit. The house in which
 he lives is situated near the southern peak of Mount Somma,
 being an easy ride of an hour and a half from Resina.
    On leaving the hermitage, we proceeded across the valley
 which separates Somma from Vesuvius, and is known by
 the appellation of Alrio del Cavallo.             It is of no great
 depth, being     almost   entirely fiBed   with the  lavas of succes
                                                                    sive

the clouds and the smoke wafted around the summit of the
mountain,          concealing, for a few moments, the vast
                    and
conflagration,   which  appeared again more lively and more
brilliant : this succession of lights and shades, this contrast
of turbulence and tranquillity, this solitude in the midst of
such       a vast      convulsion,    produced a multitude          of contrary
impressions that cannot be described, but the recollection                   of
which will never be erased.
     We returned about four in                the mornihg to Naples, having*
spent eight hours in the excursion.
   On the second, the eruption continued the whole day
with much greater violence than before ; two currents of
lava were formed ; one of these stopped in the morning ; the
other, taking an eastern                  course, spread with great rapidity,
and deluged            the plain.     As our excursion of
                                                    preceding     the
night       not enabled us to form any idea concerning the
              had
progress of the lava, we set out again to observe this extra
ordinary phaenomenon.
   Passing through the villages of Portici, Resina, and Torre
del Greco,          we entered       inclosures,     consisting    of vineyards
and corn-fields,          into which the lava had penetraLed : we ap
proached the current, and I was surprised to find the pro
gress of the lava so different from the conception I had
formed        of it.
     I   always imagined that the substance of the Uva,
          had
resembling melted glass, ran in the same manner, and ad
vanced uniformly             like a river of fire; and indeed           it is   ex
tremely probable that                in    a great   number      of eruptions    it.
actually exhibits this appearance. On the present occasion,
I  saw nothing but an accumulation of stones, some of
which were of prodigious magnitude, heaped one upon
another, to the height of fifteen or twenty feet, and about
half    mile in breadth.
          a                 This formidable mass advanced
                                                                         slowly,

fa'lmg of the different bodies, between which there was no
adue. ion,         and        which,   in obedience to the impulsion they
had       received       on issuing       from the crater, rolled from the
nu:sl        elevated    pomt, and covered the surface of another
strain).            In this manner the stones rolled over, one upon
another, till the •rout rank having attained the same height
as that winch produced                     it,
                              began in its turn to pour down

        After we had contemplated this dismal and astonishing
    sight, we went up to the convent of the Camaldulenses,
    situated  on    kind of peak, of considerable height, that
                         a
    overlook":     the whole plain,
                                which extends from the south to
    the west, from the foot of Mount Vesuvius to the sea. This
    building has hitherto been spared,                     as   well   as the      thick wood
    in which       embosomed.
                   it   is                       It   is   one    of   the nearest points

  often fled, with their most valuable effects ; to wbkh-they'hai'e
  driven their (locks, and conveyed their wives and children.
     Here we staid      a  considerable time; our view extended
  over the declivity of Vesuvius, from which ran several cur
 rents of lava, that issued from the sides of the mountain ;
  while enormous     flames   of fire, of which we had       a nearer
  prospect the night before, darted continually from its summit.
 We    Lad likew ise a view    of  the plain,   in which appeared the
 long windings of      the rivers   of  fire.  The reddish reverbera
 tion of -the lava, and the conflagration in the plain, illumined
 the landscape. On every side appeared the image of desola
 tion ; but yet it exhibited       a picture so splendid, a scene so
 magnificent, that the ravages with which it was attended were
 entirely forgotten in the contemplation of its picturesque
 and poetic/ beauty. In short, when my mind figures to itself          «
 those fiery torrents, the motion of the lava, tlie subterraneous
 thunders, those continual hissings —so many wonders, so
 many subjects of grief and admiration — I should think that
 a dream had deceived me, if the imagination, which pro
 duces such dreams, were capable of creating images so awful
 and so grand.
    On    the  3d, the eruption continued, and the lava still
 advanced ; the thunder was louder and more frequent than
 the preceding day. In the evening the flames shot to a still
 greater    height, attracting the electricity of the air, and      of
 the  clouds,   which emitted splendid flashes.
    On the 4th, the eruption was less violent.
    On   the 5th, Vesusius began to throw out ashes ;         which,
we are assured, announces the conclusion of the eruption.

    A  very singular and     brilliant meteor was seen by many of
the inhabitants of London, in broad day-light, on Thursday
afternoon, the 17th of July, just about eight o'clock; pass
ing in the southern and western part or the hemisphere,
from about south-east to north-west : it seemed about one
fourth    of  the  apparent    diameter     of the   moon, but more
brilliant than Venus      ever appears^    and moved with very great
swiftness, nearly in an horizontal direction, leaving       a conical

.HAVING investigated, by               means        of   the foregoing   experi
ments, some of the chemical suppositions                         involved iu the
Huttonian theory, and having endeavoured to assign a de
terminate limit to the power of the agents employed, I shall
now apply these results to geology, and inquire how far the
events, supposed antiently to have taken place, accord with
the existing state of our globe.
  The most powerful and essential agent of the Huttonian,
theory is fire, which I have always looked upon as the same
with that of volcanoes, modified by circumstances which
must, to a certain degree, take place in every lava previous
to its eruption.
  The original source of internal                  fire is involved in great ob
scurity ; and no sufficient reason occurs to me for deciding
whether    it proceeds by emanation from some vast central
reservoir, or is generated by the local operation of some che
mical process. Nor is there any necessity for such a deci
sion ; all we need to know             is,
                                that internal j§re exists, which
no one can doubt, who believes                   in the eruptions of Mount

Vesuvius.        To require that a man should account for the
generation of internal fire, before he is allowed to employ it
In geology, is no less absurd than it>vould be to prevent him
from reasoning about the construction of a telescope, till he
could explain the nature of the sun, or account for the g'e-
neration of light*.         But while we remain in suspense as to
the prime cause         of this tremendous agent, many circum
stances    of importance with         regard to  it may fairly become
the subjects of observation and discussion.
    Some authors (I conceive through ignorance                of the facts)
have alleged, that the fire of .iEtna and Vesuvius is merely
superficial.        But the depth of its action is sufficiently
proved by the great distance to which the eruptive percus
sions are felt, and still more by the substances thrown out
uninjured by some eruptions of Mount Vesuvius.                     Some of
these,    as   marble and gypsum, are incapable, in freedom,
of   resisting the action of fire. We have likewise granite,
 schistus, gneiss, and stones of every known class, besides
many which have never, on any other occasion, been found
 at the surface of our globe.          The circumstance of these sub
 stances     having been thrown out unaffected by the fire,
 proves that it has proceeded from a source, not only as
 deep, but deeper than their native beds ; and as they exhibit
 specimens of every class of minerals, the formation of which
 we pretend to explain, we need inquire no further into the
 depth of the Vesuvian fire, which has thus been proved to
 reach below the range        of our speculations.
     Volcanic    fire is subject to perpetual       and irregular varia
 tions   of intensity,   and to sudden and violent renewal,             after
 long periods of absolute cessation.          These variations and in
 termissions      are likewise    essential  attributes   of fire,  as em
 ployed by Dr. Hutton ; for some geological scenes prove
 that the indurating cause has acted repeatedly on the same
 substance, and that, during the intervals of that action, it
 had ceased entirely.        This circumstance       affords    a complete
    • This
           topic, however, has of I ate been much urged against us, and an
 unfair advantage has been taken of what Mr. Playfair has said upon it. What
 he gave as mere conjecture on a subject of collateral importance, has been
 argued upon as the basis and fundamental doctrine of the system.

answer to an argument lately urged against the Huttonian
theory, founded on the waste of heat which must have taken
place, as it is alleged, through the surface. For       after                              if,

  The external phenomena of volcanoes are sufficiently well
known but our subject leads us to inquire into their in
           ;
ternal actions.                This    we are enabled                to do       by   means of the
foregoing experiments, in                           90   far   as the    carbonate of lime           is
concerned.
   Some experiments, which formerly* laid before this so
                                                    I
ciety and the public, combined with those mentioned in this
paper, prove that the feeblest exertions of volcanic fire are
of sufficient intensity to perform the agglutination, and even
the entire fusion, of the carbonate of lime, when its carbonic
acid      effectually confined by pressure
          is                               for though lava,               ;
after its fusion, may be made, in our experiments, to con
geal      into   a  temperature of 6° or 8° of Wedge-
                     glass      in   a                              1            1

be affected, must be observed that

is   not to be looked for in nature                           ;   for the mass, even of the
smallest stream of lava,           too great to admit of such rapid
                                               is

vitreous,        but consists              of   a   substance

ments have proved, must have been congealed in  heat of                                    a

                               a
in 27° or 28° of the same scale.       follows, that no part ofIt
the lava, while    remained liquid, can have been less hot
                          it
than 22° of Wedgewood.       Now, this happens to be heat                                      a

 rising through this internal channel, so as to fill the crater
 to the brim,         and flow over it.             On this occasion,          the sides
 of   the mountain must undergo a violent hydrostatical pres

with it. By the laws of hydrostatics, as each portion of
this fluid sustains pressure              in
                                  proportion to its perpendicular
distance below the point    of discharge, that pressure must in

our calcareous mass rose to within GOO feet of the surface,

effect     of   heat would be to drive        off the moisture of the lowest

to them, or would return but slowly                                    ;   and they would be
exposed dry to the action of heat*.
   In this       one of two things would inevitably happen
                case,                                                                                  :
either the carbonic acid of the shells would be driven off                                             by
the heat, producing an incondensable elastic fluid, which,
heaving up or penetrating the superincumbent beds, would
force its way to the surface of the sea, and produce  sub                                     a
marine eruption, as has happened at Santorini and else
where, or the volatility of the carbonic acid would be re
pressed         by
           the weight of the superincumbent water (kit),
and the shell-bed, being softened or fused by the action of
heat, would be converted into                        a       stratum of limestone.
   The foregoing experiments enable us to decide     any par                            in
ticular case, which of these two events must take place when
the heat of the lava and the depth of the sea are known.
   The      table shows,          that under              a      sea no deeper than 1708
feet, near one-third               of   a    mile,       a   limestone would be formed
by proper heat  and that, in

 greater depth of sea would, of course, be requisite to con
 strain the carbonic acid effectually ; and future experiments
 may determine what depth is required to co-operate with
 any given temperature. It is enough for our present pur
 pose to have shown that the result is possible in any case,
 and to have circumscribed the necessary force of these agents
within moderate limits.            At the same time it must be ob
served that we have been far from stretching the known
facts   ; for, when we compare             the   small extent of sea in
which any soundings            can be found,      with that of the      vast
unfathomed ocean, it          is obvious,     that in assuming a depth
of one mile or two, we fall very short of the medium. M. de
la Place, reasoning from the phaenomena of the tides, states
it as highly probable that this medium is not less than eleven
English miles *.
     If a great  part or the whole       of the superincumbent        mass
consisted, not      of water, but of     sand or clay,    then the depth
requisite to produce these effects            would be lessened in the
inverse ratio of the specific gravity. If the above-mentioned
occurrence took place under a mass composed of stone
firmly bound together by some previous operation of nature,
the power of the superincumbent mass, in opposing the
escape of carbonic acid, would be very much increased by
that union and by the stiffness or tenacity of the substance.
We      have   seen numberless        examples     of this power in the
course    of these   experiments, in which barrels, both of iron
and porcelain,       whose thickness did not exceed one-fourth
of an inch,      have exerted a force superior to the mere weight
of a mile of     sea.   Without supposing that the substance of
a rock could       in any case act with the same advantage as
that    of  an uniform and connected barrel, it seems obvious
that    a  similar   power must, in many cases, have been ex
erted to a    certain degree.

complish their entire fusion.  The mountain of Saleve, near
Geneva,    500 French fathoms, or nearly 3250 English feet,
             is
in height, from its base to its summit.   Its mass consists
of   beds,    lying nearly horizontal,              of limestone filled with
shells.      Independently, then, of               the tenacity of the mass,
and taking into account its mere                   weight, the lowest bed of
this mountain must, at this moment,                             sustain   a   pressure     of
3250 feet      of limestone,
                        the specific gravity of which    about                   is
2-65. This pressure, therefore,   equal to that of 8612 feet of
                                              is
water, being nearly    mile and
                              a    half of sea, which

more than adequate, as we have shown, to accomplish the
entire fusion of the carbonate on the application of proper
heat. Now, were an emanation from           volcano to rise up  a
tinder Saleve, and to penetrate upwards to its base, and
Stop there, the limestone to which the lava approached
would inevitably be softened without being calcined, and,
as the heat retired, would crystallize into  saline marble.      a
   Some other circumstances relating to this subject are very
deserving of notice, and enable us still further to compare
the antient and modern operations of fire.
     appears, at first sight, that
     It                            lava, having once pene
                                                   a
trated    the side       of   a   mountain,
                                all subsequent lavas should
continue, as water would infallibly do, to flow through the
same aperture.  But there         material difference in the
                                         is   a
two cases.  As soon as the lava has ceased to flow, and the
heat has begun to abate, the crevice through which the lava
had been passing remains filled with  substance, which soon
                                                       a
agglutinates into mass far harder and firmer than the moun
                         a
tain itself.This mass, lying                  in   crooked bed, and being
                                                   a
firmly welded to the sides of                  the crevice, must oppose                    a
most powerful resistance to any stream tending to pursue the
same course.   The injury done to the mountain           the                          by
formation of the rent, will thus be much more than re
paired, and in     subsequent eruption the lava must force its
                     a
way through    another  part of the mountain or through some
part of the adjoining country. The action of heat from below
seems in most cases to have kept       channel open through

which     is   habitually discharged at the summit during inter

vals   of calm.      On many occasions, however, this spiracle
seems to have been           entirely closed by -the consolidation     of
the lava, so      as to   suppress all emission.     This happened      to
Vesuvius during the middle ages. All appearance of fire had
ceased for five hundred years, and the crater was covered
with a forest of antient oaks, when the volcano opened with
fresh vigour in the sixteenth century.
    The eruptive force capable of overcoming               such an ob
stacle must be tremendous indeed, and seems in some cases
to have blown the volcano itself almost to pieces.              It is im
possible to see the mountain of Somma, which, in the form
of   a crescent, embraces           Mount Vesuvius, without being
convinced       that it is a fragment of a large volcano, nearly
concentric       with the present inner cone, which, in some
 great eruption,       had    been   destroyed  all but this fragment.
 In our own times,         an event   of no small magnitude has taken
 place on the same spot; the inner cone of Vesuvius having
 undergone so great a change during the eruption in 1794,
 that it now bears no resemblance to what it was when I saw
it in 1785.
    The general or partial stagnation of the internal lavas at
 the close of each eruption seems, then, to render it neces
 sary, that in every new discharge the lava should begin by
 making a violent laceration. And this is probably the cause
 of those tremendous earthquakes which precede all great
 eruptions, and which cease as soon as the lava has found a
 vent.      It seems but reasonable to ascribe like effects to like
 causes, and to believe that the earthquakes           which frequently
 desolate countries        not   externally volcanic, likewise indicate
 the protrusion from below of matter in liquid fusion pene
 trating the mass        of rock.
     The injection       of   a  whinstone-dike    into a frail mass     of
 shale and sandstone, must have              produced the same effects
 upon    it  that  the  lava    has just  been stated to produce on the
 loose beds of volcanic scoria.            One stream of liquid whin,
  having flowed into such an assemblage, must have given it
 great additional weight and strength ; so that a second stream,
 coming like the first, would be opposed by a mass the lacer
  ration of which would produce an earthquake            if it were over
                                                                    come,

  come, or by which,          if it resisted,   the liquid matter would
  be compelled      to penetrate     some weaker mass, perhaps      at a
  great distance from       the first.    The internal fire, being thus
  compelled perpetually to        change the scene of its action, its
 influence might be carried to an indefinite extent; so that
  the intermittence in point of time, as well as the versatility
 in point of   place,   already    remarked    as common to the    Hut-
 tonian and volcanic fires, are accounted for on our princi
 ples : and it thus appears that whinstone possesses all the
 properties which we are led by theory to ascribe to an in
 ternal lava.
     This connection     is curiously illustrated by an intermediate
 case between the results         of external and internal fire, dis
 played in an     actual section of the antient part of Vesuvius,
 which occurs in the mountain of Somma, mentioned above.
 I  formerly described this scene in my paper on whinstone
 and lava ; and      I must beg leave once more to press it upon
 the notice    of the public, as affording to future travellers        a
most interesting field of geological inquiry.
    The section is seen in the bare vertical cliff several hun
dred feet in height, which Somma presents to the view from
the little valley, in form of a crescent, which lies between
Somma and the interior cone of Vesuvius, called the Atria
del Cavallo.       (Fig. 42.    represents   this scene, done from the
recollection of what      I  saw in 1785. abe is the interior cone
of Vesuvius ; dfg        the mountain       of Somma ; and cde the
Atrio del Cavallo).         By   means    of this cliff (fd in fig. 42,
and    which    is represented separately in fig. 44), we see the
internal structure of the mountain, composed of thick beds
(fck) of loose scoria which have fallen in showers, between
which thin but firm streams (mm') of lava are interposed
which have flowed down the outward conical sides of the
mountain.        (Fig. 43. is an ideal section of Vesuvius and
Somma through the axis of the cones, showing the manner
in which the beds of scoria and of lava lie upon each other,
the extremities of which beds are seen edgewise in the cliff
at mm and      kk, fig. 42, 43, and 44).
    This  assemblage of scoria and lava is traversed abruptly
and   vertically by streams of solid lava (nn, fig. 44), reaching
                                                                  from

from top to bottom of the cliff. These last I conceive to
have flowed in rents of the antient mountain, which rents
bad acted     as pipes    through which the lavas of the lateral
eruptions were conveyed to the open air. This scene pre
sents to the view of an attentive observer a real specimen of
those internal streams which we have just been considering
in speculation, and they may exhibit circumstances decisive
of the opinions     here advanced.        For,  if  one of these streams
bad formerly been connected with               a   lateral eruption dis
charged at more than 600 feet above             the Atrio del Cavallo,
 it might possibly contain the carbonate of lime.              But could
we suppose that depth to extend to 1708 feet, the inter
 ference of air-bubbles, and the action of a stronger heat than
 was merely required for the fusion of the carbonate, might
 have been overcome.
     Perhaps the height of Vesuvius has never been great
 enough for this purpose.           But could we suppose ./Etna to
 be cleft in two, and its structure displayed, as that of Ve
 suvius has just been described, there can be no doubt that
 internal  streams of lava would be laid open, in which the
 pressure must have far exceeded the force required to con
 strain the carbonic acid of limestone, since that mountain
 occasionally delivers lavas from its summit, placed 10- 954
 feet above the level      of the Mediterranean *, which washes
 its base.   I recollect having seen, in some parts of vEtna,
 vast chasms and crags, formed by volcanic revolutions, in
 which vertical streams of lava, similar to those of Somma,
 were apparent. But my attention not having been turned
 to that object till many years afterwards, I have only now
  to recommend the investigation of this interesting point to
  future travellers.
     What has been said of the heat conveyed by internal vol
 canic streams, applies equally to that deeper and more ge
 neral heat by which the lavas themselves are melted and pro
  pelled upwards.       That they have been really so propelled,
  from a great internal mass of matter, in liquid fusion, seem*
  to admit of no doubt, to whatever pause we ascribe the heat

  of volcanoes.               It    is no less obvious, that the temperature                  of
 that liquid must be of far greater intensity than the lavas,
 flowing from                it,
                  can retain when they reach the surface.
 Independently of any actual eruption, the body of heat con
 tained in this vast mass of liquid must diffuse itself through
 the surrounding substances, the intensity of the heat being
 diminished             by slow gradations, in proportion to the distance
 to which          it   penetrates.  When, by means of this progres
 sive diffusion,              the    heat     has reached    an assemblage            of loose
 marine deposites, subject to the pressure of great superin           a
 cumbent weight, the whole must be agglutinated into                                          a
 mass,        the solidity            of which will vary with               the      chemical
 composition             of   the substance, and            with    the degree         of   heat
 to which                                        exposed. At
                    each particular spot has thus been
 the same time, analogy leads us to suppose that this deep
 and extensive heat must be subject to vicissitudes and inter
 missions like the external phaenomena of volcanoes.      We
 have endeavoured                    to explain' some        of
                                                irregularities,    these
 and    similar reasoning may be extended to the present case.

 Having shown that small internal streams of lava tend suc
 cessively to pervade every weak part of volcanic mountain,   a
 we are led to conceive that the great masses of heated matter
 just mentioned will be successively directed to different parts
 of the  earth  so that every loose assemblage of matter lying
                     ;
 in   submarine and subterranean situation, will, in its turn,
      a
 be affected by tlie indurating cause, and the influence of in
 ternal volcanic              heat     will thus    be circumscribed              within no
-limits but         those  of the globe itself.
      A   series      of undoubted facts prove that all our strata once
 lay in       a   situation similar in all respects to that  which tlie     in
 marine deposites just mentioned have been supposed to lie.
    The inhabitant of an unbroken plain, or of      country                      a

confined to his native spot, can form no idea of those truths
which at every step, in an alpine district, force themselves
on the mind of geological observer. Unfortunately for the

of appreciating their        value.         The most important, and at the
same time the most astonishing truth                which we learn by any
geological observations,             is,   that rocks and mountains now
placed at an elevation of more than two miles above the level
of the    sea, must at one period have Iain at its bottom.                                   This
is undoubtedly true of those strata of limestone which con
tain shells and the same conclusion must be extended to
            ;
the circumjacent strata. The imagination struggles against
the admission of so violent position, but must yield to the

  Another question here occurs, which has been well treated
by Mr. Playfair.   Has the sea retreated from the mountains?
or have they risen out of the sea      He has shown that the
                                                   ?
balance of probability   incomparably in favour of the latter
                               is
supposition;       since, in order to maintain the former, we must
dispose    of   an enormous mass              of    sea, whose depth                 is   several
miles,     and whose base           is     greater        than the surface of the
whole sea.        Whereas the elevation                   of   a   continent           out   of   a
t'ea like ours, would not change its level above  few feet                       a                ;
and even were       great derangement thus occasioned, the
                       a
water would    easily find its level without the assistance of
any  extraordinary  supposition.    The elevation of the land,
too,  isevinced by what has occasionally happened in vol
canic regions, and affords      complete solution of the con

tortion    and    erection    of strata, which                 are almost universally
admitted to have once lain in                     a   plane and horizontal posi
tion.
  Whatever opinion be adopted as to the mode in which
the land and the water have been separated, no one doubts
of the antient submarine situation of the strata.
     An important         series    of facts proves that                    they were        like

fragments, evidently detached from masses similar to our
common rock, evince the action of some very powerful
agent of destruction.     Analogy, too, leads us to believe
that all the primary rocks have once been covered with se
condary ; yet in vast districts no secondary rock appears.
In short, geologists seem to agree in admitting the general
position, that very great changes of this kind have taken
place in the solid surface of the globe, however much they
may differ as to their amount, and as to their causes.
   Dr. Hutton ascribed these changes to the action, during
very long time, of those agents, which at this day continue
slowly to corrode the surface of the earth ; frosts, rains, the
ordinary floods of rivers, &c, which he conceives to have
acted always with the same force, and no more.     But to
this opinion I could never subscribe, having early adopted
that of Saussure, in which he is joined by many of the con
tinental geologists.  My conviction was founded upon the
inspection of those facts            in the neighbourhood of Geneva,
which    he has      adduced       in support of his opinion. I was
then convinced,        and     I   still believe, that vast torrents,               of
depth sufficient to overtop our mountains, have swept along
the surface of the earth, excavating valleys, undermining
mountains, and carrying away whatever was unable to re
sist such powerful corrosion.        If such agents have been
at work in the Alps, it is difficult to conceive that our coun
tries should have been spared.               I
                                            made it therefore my busi
ness to search for traces      of   similar operations here.  I was not
long in discovering such in great abundance ; and, with the
help of several of my friends, I have traced the indications of
vast torrents in this neighbourhood                as    obvious   as those   I   for
merlv saw on Saleve and Jura.                    Since   I   announced my opi
nion  on this subject, in a note subjoined to my paper on
whinstone and lava, published in the fifth volume of the
Transactions of this Society, I have met with many con
firmations    of these views. The most important of these are
derived from the testimony of my friend lord Selkirk, who
has lately met with a series of similar facts in North America.
  It   would be difficult      to compute the effects of such an
agent ; but    if,   by   means of    or of any other cause, the

whole mass     of secondary strata, in  great tracts  of country,
has been    removed    from above   the primary,    the weight   of
that mass     alone must have been     sufficient to fulfil all the
conditions of the Huttonian theory, without having recourse
to the pressure of the sea. But when the two pressures were
combined, how great must have been their united strength !
   We are authorised to suppose that the materials of our
strata, in this situation,   underwent the action    of fire.   For
volcanoes have burnt long before the earliest times recorded
in history, as appears by the magnitude of some volcanic
mountains    ;  and it can scarcely be doubted that their fire
has acted, without any material cessation, ever since the
surface of our globe acquired its present form.        In extend
ing that same influence to periods of still higher antiquity,
when our strata lay at the bottom of the sea, we do no more
than ascribe permanence to the existing laws of nature.
   The combination of      heat and compression resulting from
these circumstances, carries us to the full extent    of the Hut
tonian theory, and enables us, upon its principles, to account
for the igneous formation of all rocks from loose marine
deposites.
   The   sand would thus be changed to sandstone, the shells
to limestone, and the animal and vegetable substances       to coal.
   Other beds, consisting of a mixture of various substances,
would be still more affected by the same heat. Such as con
tained iron, carbonate of lime, and alkali,       together with a
mixture of various earths, would enter into thin fusion, and,
penetrating through every crevice that occurred, would, in
some cases, reach what was then the surface of the ear.th,
and constitute lava : in other cases it would consrcal in the
internal rents, and constitute porphyry, basalt, greenstone,
or any other of that numerous class of substances which we
comprehend under the name of whinstone. At the same
time, beds of similar quality, but of composition somewhat
less fusible, would enter into a state of viscidity, such as
many bodies pass through in their progress towards fusion.
In this state, the particles, though far from possessing the
same freedom as in a liquid, are susceptible of crystalline
                                                    arrangement ;

  808           Effects     of Heat     modified by Compression,
 arrangement*; and the substance, which, in this sluggish
 state, would be little disposed to move, being confined in
 its original situation by contiguous beds of more refractory
 matter, would crystallize without undergoing any change of
 place, and constitute one of those beds of whinstone which
 frequently       occur interstratified         with sandstone and lime
 stone.
  .  In other      cases,      where the heat was more intense, the
 beds    of sand, approaching more nearly                to a state    of fusion,
 would      acquire such tenacity and toughness, as to allow
 themselves to be bent and contorted, without laceration or
 fracture, by the influence of local motions, and might as
 sume ihe shape and character of primary schistus ; the lime
 stone would be highly crystallized, and would become mar
 ble, or, entering into thin fusion, would penetrate the mi
 nutest rents in the form of calcareous spar.                    Lastly, when
 the    heat was higher          still,  the sand   itself would     be entirely
 melted, and might             be  converted, by the subsequent effects
 of slow cooling, into granite, sienite, Sec; in                   some cases,
retaining traces of its original stratification, and constituting
gneiss and stratified granite ; in others, flowing into the cre
vices, and forming veins of perfect granite.
     In consequence of the action of heat upon so great a quan
tity of matter, thus brought into a fluid or semifluid state,
and in     which, notwithstanding            the great pressure,      some sub
stances would be volatilized,              a  powerful heaving of the su
 perincumbent          mass must have          taken place, which, by re-
    * Tin's state of viscidity, with its numberless modifications, is
                                                                       deserving of
great attention, since it affords a solution of some of the most important geo
logical questions. The mechanical power exerted by some substances in the
act of assuming a crystalline form, is well known.      I have seen a set of large
and broad crystals of ice, like the blade of a knife, formed in a mass of clay
of such stiffness that it had ;ust been used to make cups for chemical purposes.
In many of my former experiments I found that a fragment of glass, made
from whinstone or lava, when placed in a muffle heated to the melting point
of silver, assumed a crystalline arrangement, and underwent a complete
change of character.       During this change it became soft, so as to yield to the
touch of an iron rod ; yet retained such stiffuess, that, lying untouched in the
muffle, it preserved its shape entirely, the sharp angles of its fracture not
being in the least blunted.
                                                                           pcated

 peated efforts, succeeding each other from below,            would at
 last elevate the strata into their present situation.
    The Huttonian theory embraces so wide a field, and com
prehends the laws of so many powerful agents exerting their
 influence in circumstances and in combinations hitherto un
tried, that many of its branches must still remain in an un
 finished state, and may long be exposed to partial and plau
 sible objections, after we are satisfied with regard to its fun
damental doctrines.        In the mean time I trust that the ob
ject   of our  pursuit has been accomplished, in a satisfactory
manner, by the fusion of limestone under pressure. This
single result affords, I conceive, a strong presumption in
favour of the solution which Dr. Hutton has advanced of
all the geological phenomena ; for the truth of the most
doubtful    principle which he has assumed, has thus been
established by direct experiment.

       Specific Gravity    of some of    the foregoing Results.
    As many of     the artificial limestones and marbles produced
in   these  experiments were        possessed  of great hardness and
compactness,      and as they had      visibly undergone a great di
minution of bulk, and felt heavy in the hand, it seemed to
me an object     of some consequence        to ascertain their specific
gravity,   compared with each other, and with the original
substances from which they were formed.               As the original
was commonly a mass of chalk in the lump, which, on
being plunged into water, begins to absorb it rapidly, and
continues to do so during a long time, so as to vary the
weight at every instant, it was impossible, till the absorp
tion was complete, to obtain any certain result ; and to allow
for the weight thus gained, required the application of a
method different from that usually employed in estimating
specific gravity.

    In the common method,           the substance is first weighed       in
air, and then in water       ; the difference indicating the weight
of  water displaced, and heing considered as that             of a quan
tity of water   equal   in  bulk   to  the solid   body.    But as chalk,
when saturated with water, is heavier, by about one-fourth,
than when dry, it is evident that its apparent weight in
water must be increased, and the apparent loss of weight
diminished exactly to that amount.                 To have a just esti
mate, then, of the quantity of water displaced by the solid
body, the apparent loss of weight must be increased by add
ing the absorption to it.
    Two    distinct    methods      of taking specific gravity thu*
present themselves,       which it    is  of importance     to keep sepa
rate,   as each   of them      is applicable to a particular      class  of
subjects.
    One of these methods consists in comparing a cubic inch,
of a substance in its dry state, allowing its pores to have
their share in constituting its bulk, with a cubic inch of
water.
    The other    depends     upon comparing          a cubic   inch of  the
 solid matter   of which the substance            is composed, indepen
 dently of vacuities, and supposing the whole reduced to per
 fect solidity, with a cubic inch of water.
    Thus, were an architect to compute the efficacy of a given
bulk of earth, intended to load an abutment, which earth
 was dry, and should always remain so, he would undoubt
 edly follow the first of these modes : whereas, were a farmer
 to compare the specific gravity          of  the   same earth   with that
 of any other soil, in      an agricultural point of view, he would
 use the    second mode, which is involved in that laid down
 by   Mr. Davy.
     As our object    is to compare the         specific density of these
  results, and to ascertain to what amount the particles have
 approached each other, it seems quite evident that the first
 mode is suited to our purpose.            This will     appear  most di
 stinctly by inspection of       the  following table, which      has been
 constructed so    as to   include both.

       The first eleven are the same with those used in the paper
    read in this society on the 30th of August 1804, and pub
 lished in Nicholson's Journal for October following, and
 which refer to the same specimens.  No. 12.     specimen                                is    a
 of yellow marble, bearing    strong resemblance to No. 3.

     order to ascertain its specific gravity, rammed the powder      I
     into   glass

  with water. I thus ascertained, in a direct manner, the
  weight of the substance, as stated in Column II., and that
  of an equal bulk of water, stated in Column VIII.
     Column II. Weight of the substance, dry in air, after
  exposure, during several hours, to a heat of 2 1 2° of Fahren
 heit.
     Column III. Its weight in water, after lying long in the
 liquid, so as to perform its full absorption j and all air-bub
 bles being carefully removed.
     Column IV. Weight in air, wet.              The loose external
  moisture being removed by the touch of         a dry cloth,   but no
  time being allowed for evaporation.
     Column   V.   Difference between     Columns    II.  and  III.,  or
  apparent weight of water displaced.
     Column VI. Difference between Columns            II. and  IV.,   or
  the absorption.
     Column   VII.    Absorption   reduced   to a per ci-ntage   of  the
  dry substance.
     Column   VIII.     Sum of Columns      V.  and  VI.,  or the real
  weight  of water displaced by    the body.
     Column    IX.   Specific gravity, by the common mode, re
  sulting from the division of Column II. by Column V.
     Column X. Specific gravity, in the new mode, .resulting
 from the division of Column        II. by Column VIII.
     The specific gravities ascertained by the new mode, and
  expressed in Column X. correspond very well to the idea
 which is formed of their comparative densities, from other
  circumstances,     their hardness,    compact    appearance,     sus
 ceptibility of polish, and weight in the hand.
-    The case is widely different when we attend to the results
  of the common method contained in Column IX. Here the
  specific gravity of chalk is rated at 2-498, which exceeds
 considerably that     of a majority of the results tried.      Thus,
 it would    appear,   by this method, that chalk has become
  lighter by the experiment, in defiance      of our   senses,  which
  evince an increase of density.
     This singular result arises, I conceive, from this ; that,
  in our specimens, the faculty of absorption has been much
 more decreased than the porosity.         Thus, if a piece of crude
     •
                                                                chalk,

            Effects  of Heat modified       by Compression,            913
chalk, whose specific gravity had previously been ascertained
by the common mode, and then well dried in a heat of 212°,
were dipped in varnish, which would penetrate a little way
into its surface; and, the varnish having hardened, the chalk
were weighed in water,      it is evident that the apparent loss
of weight would now        be greater        by 23 61 per cent.     of the
dry weight than it had been when the unvarnished chalk was
weighed in water ; because the varnish, closing the super
ficial pores, would quite prevent the absorption, while it
added but little to the weight of the mass, and made no
change on the bulk. In computing, then, the specific gra
vity by means of this last result, the chalk would appear very
much lighter than at first, though its density had, in fact,
been increased by means       of  the varnish.
   A   similar effect seems to have been produced in some                of
these results by the agglutination         or partial fusion of part     of
the substance, by which some           of  the    pores have been     shut
out from the water.
   This view derives     some confirmation            from an inspection
of Columns VI. and       VII.  ;  the   first of which      expresses the
absorption;     and the  second, that result reduced             to a  per
centage    of the original weight.             It   there appears,    that
whereas    chalk absorbs 23-97 per cent., some of our results
absorb only 0-5, or so low as 0-11 percent.                   So that the
power of absorption has been reduced from about one-fourth
to less than the five hundredth of the weight.
   I have measured the diminution of bulk in many cafes,
particularly in that of No. 11.             The chalk, when crude,
ran to the 75th degree of Wedgewood's gage, and shrunk so
much during the experiment, that it ran to the 161st.; the
difference amounting to 86 degrees. Now, I find that Wedge-
wood's gage tapers in breadth from O-5 at zero of the scale,
to 0-3 at the 240th degree.        Hence we have for one degree
0-000833.       Consequently,     the    width, at the 75th degree,
amounts to 0-437525; and at the l6lst, to 0-365887. These
numbers, denoting the linear measure of the crude chalk,
and   of its result under heat     and compression,         are as 100 to
83  8; or, in solid bulk, as        100 to 57-5.          Computing the
densitiei from this source, they are as           1  to 1-23.   The spe-
                                 O   3                                cific

 cific gravities in the table, of the chalk, and of this result,
 are as    V551     : 2-435    ;  that is,    as 1 to 1 -57-    These conclu
 sions do not correspond very exactly ; but the chalk em
 ployed in this experiment was not one of those employed in
 determining average specific gravity in the table ; and other
circumstances may have contributed to produce irregularity.
Comparing this chalk with result second, we have 1-551                            :
 S-575, so 1 : 1-6602.

XXXIII.        Catalogue   of   Specimens,      showing the Result of
    Sir James     Hall's    Experiments on the Effects            of Heat
    modified hy     Compression ; which were deposited             by   Sir
    James'   Hall     in the British Museum on the 28/ k           of June
     1806.
 Numbers l,          2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, were all produced, in
 separate    experiments, from pounded carbonate of lime.
 No. I.    was obtained in 1799.        It  is a firm stone, requiring
 a  smart blow of     a hammer to break it.            It  was enclosed   in
 a  cartridge of paper, the mark of which it still bears.              The
 other six are still harder, and more compact, approaching
 nearly in these qualities to common limestone.
     Nos. 2, 4,   and 7, possess     a degree      of semi-transparency
 most remarkable in       No.  4 ; and all      of  these    specimens ex
 hibit an uneven fracture, approaching to that of bees' wax
 and marble.       Their colours are variously, though slightly,
 tinged with yellow and blue ; in particular No. 3, which,
  though produced from common white chalk, resembles a
  yellow marble.
     Nos. 3, 5,    and 6, have    taken    a  tolerable polish.      No. 7k
  contains a shell introduced along with the pounded chalk,
  and now closely incorporated with it.

    Along with No. 3.         is a specimen    (A 3.) of common yel
 low marble, bearing          a strong    resemblance to the artificial
 stone.
    Nos.   8, 9, 10, 11, all formed from pieces          of chalk  exposed
 unbroken to heat and pressure.
    No. 8. is remarkable for a shining grain and semi-trans
 parency.      Nos, 9 and 10. show parallel planes like internal
 stratification, which has often appeared in chalk in conse
 quence of the action of heat, though nothing of the kind
 could be seen in the native mass.              No.    11. very compact,
 and of a yellow colour.          Nos.   12 and 13. examples      of weld
 ing, in which      the pounded chalk has been incorporated with
 a lump    of chalk upon which it          had   been    rammed, so that
 their joining    is hardly visible in the fracture.
    Nos.    14,  15,    16, showing     the   fusion   of   the carbonate
 well advanced, with        a considerable action       on the porcelain
 tube.
    In No.    15. the rod     of chalk is half melted, and a yellow
 substance produced by a mixture of the carbonate with the
 porcelain.      No.    16. is a lump   of chalk in    a state indicating
 softness,   a piece    of porcelain which lay in contact with it
 having sunk a      little into the substance of the carbonate.
    Nos.   17   and   1 8, and all the  following numbers, being         de
licate, are inclosed in tubes        of glass, and fixed with sealing-
wax on little cups of \vood.
    No. 1 7, formed from pounded chalk, shows in one part
the most complete formation of spar, with its rhomboidal
fracture,   I  ever obtained.
    The carbonate, having lost         some    of its carbonic acid, had
crumbled so much in its essential            parts by the action of the
air, that the crystallization         was no longer visible; and            I
had given up the specimen for lost, till some time in July
1804, when employed in examining these results, in order
to show them in the Royal Society of Edinburgh, a mass of
the carbonate broke in two and exhibited the fracture now
before us, nearly in as good a state as it was originally.                  I
immediately inclosed it in a glass tube, and sealed it with
wax, so that      I have hopes     of preserving it ;     and it still con
tinues entire, though now sealed up for a year and a half.
      8                                                           N.O. 18,

                   of Sir   James   Hall's Experiments.             417
No.     18, likewise from pounded chalk,         is perfectly fresh and
entire,     though     made    more   than  two   years ago; it shows
some beautiful clear crystals of spar in parallel plates, but
they are so small as to require the use of a glass.
   Nos.       1 9, 20, 2 1 y show examples of fusion and action on
the tubes.          In No. 19. a shell is finely united to some
pounded chalk. In No. 20. the mass, originally of pounded
chalk,     is   sinking upon itself, and acting at the same time
upon the tube ; the fracture of the carbonate, in its pure
parts, showing brilliant facettes of crystallization. In No. 21,
the carbonate in a state like the last, the compound of
porcelain and carbonate showing its liquidity by penetrating
the tube so as to form a distinct vein of a dark colour, and
then spreading on its outside to a considerable extent, ter
minating with the black line alluded to in the account of
the experiments.
   Nos. 22,        23, 24, give proofs   of entire fusion.   In No. 22,
we    see     two porcelain tubes inclosed for preservation in a
glass    tube    : the end attached    to the little wooden cup must
be held downwards, to show the position in which the expe
riment was made. The innermost porcelain tube stands with
its muzzle upwards, and the outermost covers it in the in
verse position.         The carbonate was contained in the inner
tube   :  during the action of heat, the barrel failed suddenly,
and the carbonate has boiled over the lips of the inner tube,
running down,          as here appears,    almost to its bottom ; thus
proving that immediately previous to the failure of the ap
paratus the carbonate had been in a liquid state.
   No. 23, two masses of carbonate welded together in a
complete state of froth.          The substance shining and semi-
transparent.         No. 24, two separate masses exposed together
to heat; one from pounded chalk, now in a state quite like
the last; the other put in as a lump of chalk, dressed flat
at both ends, and a letter cut on each end (as done in many
of  the experiments).          It is in a shining    and almost trans
parent state ; at one end the flat form and the letter           are vi
sible ; the other end is completely rounded in fusion,              with
a glassy surface.
                                                                No.  S5.

218          Speciinen}    of Sir James Hall's Experiment*.
   No. 65. shows the substance produced by the combina
tion of carbonate of lime with pure silex. Part of the porce
lain tube in this specimen is filled with pounded silex, which,
having a very feeble agglutination, is supported by some
sealing-wax.   Upon the silex during the experiment had
lain some carbonate of lime, the lower part of which had
united with the silex, producing a semi-transparent sub
stance with      a delicate tinge of blue. The termination of this
compound, as          it had advanced downwards into the silex,
shows the round and mammillated form of chalcedony.
  No. 26, result of an experiment with heat and compres
sion, made July 22, 1805, with some pure carbonate of lime
prepared by Mr. Hatchett.   The carbonate was inclosed in
a small tube of platina, and was thus secured against alt
contamination.
  No. 27, result of           an experiment made likewise              in platina
with  a fragment of a periwinkle shell : the form of the shell
is still visible, though the substance is glazed by semi-
fusion.    Along with, on the same stand, is a small drop
like a pearl, formed by the entire fusion of one of the frag
ments; and a portion of shell of the same kind, in its na
tural state, is introduced, in order to show what change had
taken place during the experiment.
   No. 28. is a specimen of coal produced from horn; it is
a shining black substance, exactly resembling pitch, or black
sealing-wax      :   it   was formed in a low           red heat,     and in cir
cumstances       of compression by which, while some of the
                                       ;
volatile parts of the original were allowed to separate, others
were retained.      It has thus acquired a jet black colour,
while it retains its inflammability,                 and burns with bright
name.
  No.      29. likewise produced from an animal substance, flan-:
nel.   '
           In this   case, none   of   the component parts            of the ori
ginal substance seem to have separated from       owing either  it,
to less heat or greater closeness than in the last case. The
consequence has been, that the original colour has under
gone much less change, being               of   a    yellow red, at the same
time the substance has been                in   a   state   of fusion,   and has
                                                                         assumed

         Germination and Fermentation           of Grains, &c.      219
assumed     a polish by moulding itself on the glass into which
it had been pressed. This result seems to bear some analogy
to the substance called ret inaspkul turn described by              Mr.
Hatchett.
    No.   30.  is a piece   of wood partially converted into coal
by heat and compression.           In   some   parts the substance   en
tirely resembles pitch, being full of large and shining air
holes ; in others, the fibres of the wood are still distinctly
visible.    The whole      is jet black,     and    burns with  a bright
flame.          "
    No. 21. is    a specimen    of the substance, like wool, formed
in   several of  these experiments by the exudation         of the fusi

state spouting to a considerable distance, and depositing this
substance upon any obstacle opposed to the stream.

                  § IV. Analysis of        Garden Beans.
  JL he infusion      of the farina     of  garden beans, drawn clear
 off, and put into a phial well corked and completely filled,
 hecomes troubled like milk, and makes an abundant deposit,
 which clears it up. Left in the phial for twenty days, it li
 berates no gas; it is acid, preserves the taste of beans, red
 dens turnsole,     and is precipitated,      by means of lime water,
 in transparent flakes : by the oxalate of ammonia it is preci
 pitated abundantly; by ammonia, but slightly; by gall-nuts,
 in flakes like wine lees ; by the nitrates of mercury and sil
 ver, in yellowish white ; and by the prussiate of potash, in
 green flakes which become blue.
     The spontaneous deposit becomes transparent upon dry
 ing, and burns like horn.
     The same infusion, put into ?. large bottle about three-
 fourths empty, acts in the same manner as at first ; it di
                                                               minishes

£20                  On tiie Germination and Fermentation
minishes         the volume          of air, which afterwards contains a
fifth    part    of carbonic           acid, and      the residue of which is
then formed of 97'5              of azotic     of oxygen gas.
                                                gas and       of   2-5
The liquor                                   without acidity ;
                     assumes a smell slightly putrid,
it precipitates lime water, gall-nuts, &c. &c.
   The precipitate formed by lime water is of a purple colour,
which blackens on drying ; it yields ammonia on being burnt,
and leaves a gray cinder, soluble in the muriatic acid with
effervescence,  from which ammonia precipitates it in gela
tinous flakes, and the prussiate of potash in white.     Thus
this precipitate contains an animal matter — phosphate of
lime and phosphate of iron, besides the phosphate of potash
remarked by M. Saussure junior.
   We burned some dry garden beans to ashes in a platina
crucible. The taste of these ashes was alkaline and caustic ;
they contained potash and phosphates of lime, magnesia,
and iron, which the nitric acid dissolves.
  Garden beans also contain starch, an animal matter, phos
phates of lime, magnesia, potash, iron, and free potash.
No sugar is found in             it,
                       at least not in any appreciable quan
tity.
   The tunic, or         coat   of   these beans, contains tannin             in abun
dance.
     This analysis explains,            I   st, why beans putrefy so easily,
and become infectious            :     2dly, why they are so nourishing,
and susceptible          of filling     the place of all other food 3dly,         :
why, when cooked with    the skins on, they are better pre
served   and, 4thly, why this article yields at once the ali
         :
ment, the basis, and the materials proper to form and co
lour the blood, and to nourish the bones.
                         §   V. Analysis         of   Lentils.
     The farina of lentils,          macerated      in water,       spreads the smell
«f this      green      leguminous herb         ;   after an hour's maceration
the water does not become clear, except after two filtrations                               ;
its taste       is   weak and nauseous          ;   it   is   not acid   ;   it   precipi
tates abundantly           by
                    gall-nuts                   and the oxymuriatic               acid>   a*
well as by sulphate of iron   lime water renders
                                            :                                it    milky.
It becomes troubled spontaneously, and becomes                                    speedily
                                                                                   milky  ;

                of Grains and Farinaceous          Substances.              221
milky; the alkalis render it clear by making it yellow;
the acids, which clear it at first, put into it afterwards
in excess, precipitate it strongly. This seems to indicate
that the liquor owes its limpidity to the alkali which absorbs
the acid, either spontaneous or added.
  The infusion    grows frothy and coagulates at a boiling,
heat   when filtered, it precipitates, but less abundantly, by
       ;
the re-agents indicated.
     Upon inclosing,        at a low temperature, this           infusion,   al
ready troubled, in two flasks, the one filled and the other three-
fourths empty, with Woolf 's tubes, we saw it become clear,
and deposit white flakes after some hours. We did not ob
serve, after a few days, any apparent change                 of   the liquor,
disengagement of gas, or absorption of air ; the water was
acescent, and the air above it contained a little carbonic acid
gas.
   Lime hindered the spontaneous precipitation of the infu
sion until it was saturated by its fermented acid.
   Fifteen parts of alcohol, digested several times upon the
coarser farina of lentils, was coloured a greenish yellow, and
acquired a bitter and sharp taste.      When distilled, the pro
duce yielded a very strong smell of vanilla, which water
caused to disappear by changing it into another very dis
agreeable.   The residue of this distillation is yellowish green ;
a thick green oil floats at the surface ; the liquor is thick and
gluey, of a saponaceous smell, and of a rancid taste; the
acids and lime water coagulate it like a water of soap.
Sulphuric acid, by decomposing               it,
                                     collects on its surface                      a
tancid greenish oil of the smell of populeum upon evapo      :
rating the water    black residue
                        a           obtained of
                                             is     saline ap     a
pearance, but     such
                    in     small quantity that we could not
                                  a
determine the nature of it.
     Whole lentils,      macerated      in double their weight of water,
yield,      after twenty-four     hours,    a   greenish yellow         infusion
of   an astringent       taste.       Water precipitates     a    strong size,
sulphate      of iron   a   fine blue, and acetate      of   lead   a   yellow
ish white, without reddening the blue colours lentils, strip :
ped of their skin, afford no traces of* tannin, which seem
only       to belong to this envelope.
                                                                         When

 322            On the Germination and Fermentation
   When       cleaned   completely by means of water, the skins
of  these lentils macerated        in alcohol gave it a fine yellowish
green colour ;     spontaneously evaporated, this alcohol depo
sited green flakes and a crust          of the same colour ; it black
ened the solution of iron.               After this double treatment,
these skins are dry and arid.             They furnished upon distilla
tion a good deal of oil, the smell and taste of which resem
bled tobacco smoke          ; the   water    of the distillation is acid,
but yields ammonia by means                  of potash. Thus, besides
their feculent matter, lentils contain            a   kind of albumen and
a little green    oil : their bark contains tannin and more               oil.
             §  VI.   Analysis of the Farina of Lupines.
    1st,  This farina is yellow and very bitter; when                 exposed
to the fire, it exhales an animal odour.
    2d, Distilled in    a  retort it yields three-twelfths of charcoal,
nearly seven-twelfths of a foetid red oil, a twelfth of phlegm,
and a twelfth of crystallized carbonate of ammonia.                         The.
water contains a little ammoniacal acetate.                   We find in the
charcoal phosphate of potash,             because its watery ley precipi
tates    calcareous phosphate by the addition of lime water.
We     also fmd in the ashes of the burned farina of lupines,
phosphates of lime, magnesia, andiron.
    3d, It colours alcohol yellow, and renders                 it bitter; the
latter, spontaneously evaporated, leaves a yellow, thick, and
very bitter oil, forming a-seventh of the weight of the farina,
which almost entirely dissipates upon burning coals, with
the smell of fat oii.                                                             .
    4th, The farina of lupines gives water a yellow colour, a
bitter taste, and a frothy quality, without rendering it either
acid or alkaline.       This water precipitates white flakes by the
oxymuriatic acid ; a purple coagulum by infusion of galls* ;
very abundant white flakes by the nitrates of mercury and
silver, and the acetate of lead : there are a few muriates, not
soluble by the nitric acid, in the latter precipitates.                         It
yields also yellowish flakes by means of lime water, and a
white powder of calcareous oxalate by means of the ammo
 niacal oxalate.
      *  M. Vauqudin   attributes this colour to a little phosphate of iron.
                                                                             5 th,

                  of Grains and Farinaceous      Substances.         223
      5th, The farina, treated twice successively by alcohol and
water, is dissolved almost entirely afterwards in the concen
trated acetic acid : this solution, by means of the infusion
of galls, precipitates in abundance oxymuriatic acid,                am
monia,         and mercury.
      6th, Diluted in water, and exposed to a gentle heat, the
                                                                            '
farina of lupine ferments, exhales carbonic acid, forms acetic
acid, without any vestige of alcohol, and soon putrefies, ex
 haling a foetid odour.
       It results from this analysis that the farina of lupines con
  tains :
       1st,   A bitter and coloured oil, to the amount of      a seventh,
 which communicates its properties to the whole mass.
       2d, A vegeto-animal matter, soluble in plenty of water,
  and much more so          in the acetic acid.    It is this which   fur
  nishes oil and ammonia upon distillation, and which gives
  to the watery infusion all its properties of precipitation.
       3d, Phosphates of lime and magnesia abundant enough,
  and small quantities        of phosphates   of potash   and iron.
       4th,    It contains neither starch nor sugar, and, on this
  account, differs from the other leguminous farinas.
          §  VII.   Upon the Germination      of Leguminous     Seeds.
         1st,  In Floreal of  the year 12, we placed lentils and garden
  beans, freed       from  their  husks, under a bell-glass full of at
   mospheric air, placed upon water, and in a capsule of porce
   lain.      The former germinated three or four days afterwards ;
   their radicles were very long, and the plumules very per
   ceptible ; twelve days afterwards their height was three cen
   timetres; their leaves were displayed. The beans had no
   sign of germination at all ; their radicles, however, were
   lengthened, without the plumule having made any progress.
   They began        to turn mouldy,    and   at this period the experi
   ment was stopped.            The air of the bell-glass extinguished
   a taper and      precipitated lime water, although it still allowed
-
   phosphorus to burn a little.
     •
         2d, The same seeds, placed         at the   same period under a

 the radicle;   they preserved their freshness and consistence;
 the beans did not turn mouldy.    The hydrogen gas contained
 carbonic acid entirely formed by the seeds, which afterward*
 germinated in the open air.     Thus hydrogen gas does not
favour germination ; but it does not take away from seeds
the property of germinating.
    3d, Garden beans macerated       in water, deprived of their
skin, and afterwards replunged in this liquid, did not ger
minate in the course of eight days ; the water became sour,
and assumed the smell of sour cheese.
    4ih, The water sharpened with a little oxymuriatic acid
had no more success.      The lentils, treated in the same man
ner, did not germinate.     These seeds no longer germinated
in the air ; those which had been plunged in water, on the
contrary, germinated in the air.
    5th, The same seeds peeled, covered with a little water,
enough, however, to be deprived of the contact of the air,
putrefied instead of germinating.        When only moistened,
however, and without being deprived of this contact, they
germinated very well and sent out coloured leaves, although
in the shade.
   We    may conclude   from these     experiments that the in
fluence of the air is requisite for germination,     as has been
already announced by M. de Saussure.
    § VIII.  Experiments   upon the Fermentation    of Grains.
    1st, Two pounds of ground germinated barley, placed with
six pounds of water heated to 55° (131° Fahr.) in a matrass
furnished with a crooked tube, fermented in four hours in a
heat of 22° (72° Fahr.) The fermentation continued 36 hours.
The gas disengaged and collected was partly formed of
carbonic acid and partly of hydrogen gas pure enough.         Six
days afterwards this barley was distilled, from which a pro
duct was obtained equal at least to one-third of the water
employed.      This produce, heavier than water, was acid and
cmpyrcumatic.      This acidity demonstrates the conversion
pf alcohol into acetous acid. The liquor, which was sac
charine at the period of distillation,   was no longer so after
wards.
                                                         Sd, The

                  of Grains and Farinaceous      Substances.           223
      2d,    The    same    ground and .germinated barley, but de
  prived    of  Its bran by bolting, was treated in the same man
  ner  as   in the first experiment;     it fermented with       the same
 appearances,         and yielded an equal    part of carbonic acid    gas
  and hydrogen gas.           Thus the bran was not the source      of the
  latter gas, as at first supposed.
     3d, Brewers' mash, exposed in the same apparatus to the
  same temperature of 22 degrees, fermented more quickly
 with     a  more rapid effervescence, and its gas was merely car
 bonic acid, without hydrogen gas.             Thus the latter depends
 upon the farina mixed with flour.
     4th, The farina of germinated barley, with water, exposed
 in the matrass to a temperature of l5° (59° of F.) did not fer
 ment until the end of five hours; and its gas was condensed
 by potash.         Upon raising the temperature to 22 degrees,
 there came        off a mixture of gas not soluble and inflamma
 ble, the proportion of which was soon equal to that of the
 carbonic acid. Thus it is necessary that there should be a
 heat of upwards of 20° (68° of F.) before there can be any
 liberation of hydrogen gas in the farina of barley which ii
 fermenting.
     5th, Six pounds of ground barley, not germinated, treated
at three several times with twelve pounds of warm alcohol,
furnished        one ounce two drachms of pure sugar; while six
pounds of germinated barley, treated in the same manner,
yielded four ounces and two drachms, or about 5 per cent ;
which is four times what the barley contained previous to
germination.           Thus, germination forms sugar,        as   we have
announced.
     6th,    We put      24 pounds of farina of barley, not germi
nated, into       a tub with seven times its weight of hot water at
"0° (158° of F.) and four pounds of mild beer yeast. Fermen
tation immediately commenced with great violence, and con
tinued seven days. The liquor submitted to distillation, with
the husks, yielded nine litres of a weak and empyreumatic
liquid, which, being passed again through the still, furnished
                                                                           '

426       Germination and Fermentation     of Grains, &c.
ing    23 ounces,  and   24 pounds    of barley not germinated,
containing only five ounces of sugar, it follows, that four
times more alcohol was formed than there was sugar in this
farina. Lavoisier, however, asserts that 100 pounds of sugar
furnish only 58 pounds of alcohol.
    7th, Twenty-four pounds of germinated and ground barley,
made to ferment under the same circumstances as barley not
germinated, presented the same phaenomena, and only varied
in their products. There were two litres 0-3 of alcohol at
4O degrees,   which makes    five pounds  of alcohol for a quintal
of barley, or  three times more alcohol than there was sugar ;
and this answers    to the produce of barley not germinated.
    It  must be concluded from these results that it is some
other substance     than sugar which is converted into alcohol,
although sugar is indispensable to its production and to the
establishment of fermentation.
    8th, Two pounds of farina of bolted wheat, mixed with
six pounds of water at 60° (140° F.) remained six hours with
out motion. The next day, after having remarked the swell
ing of the mass, we placed the matrass upon a sand-bath a
little heated, and added water to favour the disengagement
of the gas. We obtained hydrogen gas twice larger in vo
lume than carbonic acid. The vessel, having been taken
off the sand-bath, the temperature having decreased to 14°
(57° F.) the fermentation all at once stopped.        The liquid,
when submitted to distillation,     did not yield alcohol, but an
acid liquor.
    The farina  of wheat, therefore,   does not form alcohol by
fermentation   :  yeast is indispensable for this fermentation,
although it does not enter into the composition of alcohol ;
by accelerating the alcoholic fermentation, it opposes the
formation of vinegar.        When, on the contrary,       the fer
mentation is very slow, the alcohol becomes acetous        in pro
portion as it is formed; perhaps even then sugar          and the
other fermenting substances pass into the acid state      without
alcoholizing.

XXXV.        Observations        upon the Disease, in Sheep,        called in
    England Foot-rot.             By M.      Charles Pictet, of          Ge
   neva*.
±   think I     shall render      a service   to the proprietors    of sheep
by calling     their attention to a         malady which,   to my know
ledge, has not been described by the veterinarist3 of any
country, and which, to the present moment, appears to
have been unknown            in France     \.   The following     is the oc
casion upon which I observed it :
    In the month of May 1 804, I received              from Piedmont a
flock of 200 sheep of various mongrel breeds of the second
and third generations.             The animals came to hand in good
condition,     but some of them were lame. The flock was
placed,    with   a hundred other mongrels, on a flat mountain,
the pasturage of which is healthy and of good quality.                   We
did not pay very great attention to the lame sheep, because
in general, upon a journey, they cripple often from fatigue
alone, and their lameness goes off after resting a while.                    I
never yet received a lot of Spanish sheep among which there
was not a few lame ones at their arrival ; but this defect was
never of long continuance.
    In the present case, however, the lame animals became
 worse and worse, and every day others of them began to
 grow lame, while none of the others grew any better.                    Not
 suspecting any contagion, we attributed this affection to the
 rocky nature        of  the    pasturage; to the frequent journeys
 which the sheep topk from a rivulet to go and feed ; and
 also to the circumstance that the sheep-cot was not fre
 quently enough renewed. We took precautions against all
 these various causes,          and yet the     malady continued among
 the sheep.   At    the end    of six   weeks every one among them was
 lame ; and some of them were affected in all their four legs.
 They crawled upon their knees while feeding, and the worst
 of them fell off very much in their appearance.                      It now

became indispensably necessaryto assist this flock by every
means in our power.   We removed them to the distance of
six leagues; their removal was not effected without great
trouble, and was very tedious : we also had recourse to car
riages for conveying the most diseased among them ; but in
spite of all our care, many fell a victim to the disease, un
able to bear the fatigue.
  The different individuals of the flock presented all the
varieties      of the disease   which may be reduced to three prin
                                   ;
cipal ones.          The animals in the first stage of the disease
were only a          little lame, appeared without fever, and pre-
jserved their appetite.                Upon inspecting    the foot,     there was
only                                       of the hoofs, or
           a slight redness discovered at the root
a slight oozing out of matter round the hoof ; sometimes
only a slight degree of heat in the lame foot, without any
apparent irritation.
     The     sheep   which had      the malady in the second degree were
lame all fours, had           a    fever, appeared dull, fed slowly, and
were often on their knees                   if   the fore-legs   were   attacked.
Upon inspecting the foot, there was an ulceration, as well
at the root ef the division of the hoofs, as at the juncture
of the horn to the leg, accompanied by a whitish and fetid
sanies.
  Such animals as were in the third degree of the disease
had a continual fever ; they were meagre and sorrowful, rose
up with difficulty, and lost their wool. The ulceration of
the feet was venomous, and resembled a white gangrene.
Purulent collections were formed under the hoof, and made
their appearance       junction of the horn and the skin.
                          at the
Among some sheep the hoof was detached or entirely de
stroyed, and the flesh of the two divisions of the foot was
one complete ulcer. In others the hoof had kept on ; because
the flowing of the purulent matter made its appearance at the
sole, and had gnawed and completely destroyed it.      In this
case,  the interior of the foot, upon turning  it up  to look
at   it,           putrid mass filled with worms, contained
           offered only   a

     We endeavoured           at first to classify and separate the animals
according to the stage of the disease.   The antiseptic lo
tions, such as red wine, vinegar, extract of bark, and oak
bark, were employed ; as also fumigations of nitric acid,
to weaken the putrid tendency, and second the effect of the
remedies.
   I heard from Piedmont, that the vitriol of copper in
powder, as a drying caustic, was very useful at the com
mencement of the disorder in checking its progress. We
employed         it,
             as well as martial vitriol, without any remark
able success, upon                such animalsonly slightly at
                                                         as   were
tacked.      It probable that the contagious influence, which
                   is
we had not yet learnt to guard against sufficiently, had de
stroyed the effect of this remedy.
   The acetite of lead or saturnine extract was employed with
more advantage.              Antimonial         in drying the
                                                  beer was useful

            is                     Four shepherds and seve
ral assistants were employed in taking care of the 30O lame
sheep,      and   it    was an extremely disagreeable                 business for all
of them.          The animals were examined                      every    day one         by
one, and         such of them as were unable to                   go to pasture were
fed in the sheep-cot,   where the forage was carefully spread
out for them because the sick animals had neither strength
                   ;
nor inclination to pull   out of the racks
                                      it       was necessary     :   it

the sores.

that they could not live              ;    others   of   the lambs died         for want
of milk, and those which survived took the disease       all                         ;
which increased our difficulties.

and during a whole year many of the animals continued
lame.  If we calculate the loss of the animals which died
of the disease, the loss "of the lambs, and the great ex
penses attending so tedious                  a    cure, we may be convinced
that the scab itself, terrible               as    it  is is,

malady than the foot-rot when                     it        contagious and general
in  flock.
     a
     Before pointing out the method of preventing and curing
this evil,    shall mention
                  I           fact which will show how far
                                       a                                                      it
iscontagious, and of how much consequence           to in                     it   is
crease our precautions in order to get rid of it. The rams
who were upon the mountain at the same time with the dis
eased flock, took the            foot-rot. They            were separated from the
rest     of                  and at the end of four months,
              the diseased animals       ;
after having passed through  all  the usual operations, they
appeared to be cured.   They still had tender feet, however,
and walked with pain but as the hoof was well recovered,
                                 ;
and      there    was no appearance               of ulceration upon                it,     they
vere driven  to the neighbourhood of    Spanish flock. Theya
were placed under     pent-house, separated from the sheep-
                            a
cot      by
         wall.a   Some of these rams continued to eat out of
the rack upon their knees, which we attributed to the sole
of the foot not being yet consolidated but at the end of         ;
fifteen days we perceived that an oozing out of purulent
matter had again commenced at the juncture of the horn of
the hoof.             They were then transported into                     an infirmary,
to be submitted once more to the same treatment.                                            The
straw upon which they had lain was not taken away         and                           ;
the Spanish flock having afterwards been sent into this pent
house, the foot-rot began to show itself among them in
about fifteen days. The vigorous measures and precautions
I followed, and the treatment   am about to recommend,
                                                 I
hindered the disease from proceeding any further in this
flock than the second degree otherwise   do not believe

       a    beast would have escaped.
                          Precautions      and Treatment.
     At all times, upon receiving                 a   strange        flock,   it   is   advis
able to keep them separated                until      it   is   well ascertained            that
                                                                                            they

 they are not infected with the scab or any other contagious
  disorder.
     The precaution     is not less proper    in the    case  of  the  foot-
 rot; for although        there  may be no crippled           animal in a
 flock newly come        to hand,    yet  there  may be one among
 them which had been imperfectly cured during the journey,
 and in which the disease may break out anew.                 If there are
 any actually lame at their arrival, they must be carefully ex
 amined.       Sometimes it happens that they may chance to be
 crippled from some other cause than that of foot-rot. On a
journey in a moist season the clay sometimes gets hard be
tween the hoofs, and thereby lames the animal.                   A single
 glance   will  suffice  to  see  whether   this  is   the   cause   of the
 lameness. Sometimes they are crippled in consequence of
the gland between the hoofs being swelled : this is cured
of itself, or at the worst by cutting off the gland, and it is
not contagious.          At other times the animal is crippled
merely from fatigue ; for which a little rest is the obvious
cure.     But if the district from which the sheep come is
suspected, all diseases of the feet must be examined more
cautiously than usual. A heat in the foot is a certain sign

from the rest, and the operation performed which                         am
about to describe.
    If the ulceration    is visible, the place must be cleaned         with
a rag, and Goulard-water         laid upon the sore by means of a
feather, or the powder of blue vitriol.            In order to prevent
any   dirt,  8cc. from  getting   into the  wound,      the diseased foot
should be placed in a little boot, the sole of which is of lea
ther or felt, and the upper part of cloth, in order to fasten
it round    the leg of the sheep.        This precaution is not only
favourable to the animal ; it also prevents contagion, which
seems to be communicated by the pus or sanies which flows
from the ulcers upon the litter of the sheep-fold. But when
the disease is situated     between the division       of  the hoof,     the
boot must be large enough to allow the foot to be moved                   in
its natural way ; for, if the two divisions were locked toge
ther, the disease would fester instead of healing.

     When        the disease is seated           within the horn of        the   hoof,
it            with great pain without any visible disease;
     is attended
the animal does not rest upon the diseased leg, yet it has all
the appearance of being well.  Upon putting the hand upon
the hoof it is found to be very hot; which is easily ascer-
ained by comparing it with the sound legs. We must then
endeavour to discover on what side the abscess or interior
ulcer is     :   in order to do this, the foot                 of the animal must
be slightly pressed with the thumb all round the                        junction of
the horn with the skin, as well                   as the sole     of the foot. The
seat of the abscess may be easily ascertained by the wincing
motion of the foot.   This is the place which must be cut
with a keen-edged knife, so as to occasion the discharge of
the matter and lay the flesh bare.    When the wound has
bled for some time, a feather, wet with the water of Gou
lard,  is laid upon                 it,
                         and the boot above described                                  is
put on.
      sometimes happens, that upon pressing the foot with
     It
the finger no place can be fixed upon as being the seat of the
disease    :     this   is   the case when the abscess             is   seated below
the thickest and hardest place of the hoof. In this case                          it   is
necessary  to make large incisions, sometimes without any
benefit, before finding the disease  and after waiting
                                                    ;    day                     a

comes painful at the place where      necessary to make the
                                                   it   is
incision.
     In general we             need       not be afraid       of cutting into the
quick and bleeding the diseased feet.                        The horn of the hoof
grows again~ with singular expedition.      have often seen   I
feet which were completely unhoofed    others, of which part
                                                         ;
only      of the horn        was taken away, which healed much sooner
than such feet as were scarcely ulcerated.
     would seem that in this disease, the juices which admi
     It
nister to the reproduction of the horn or hoof exist in
greater abundance in the above places in disease than in
health.          When          neglected, and where the sole
                             the disease    is
of the foot has been gnawed off and the whole foot ulcerated,
I often found that the sides of the horn had sent out cross
                                                                                 slips

                Observations upon the Foot-rot in Sheep.                           233
slips from one side of the sole to the other, thereby be
coming a sort of boot, on which the animal rested without
much pain. Sometimes also the horn in growing again                                as
sumes uncommon shapes.
     The dressing must                            day with
                                       be carefully repeated        every
the greatest regularity. It consists in removing the boot
and cleaning the wound with Goulard-water.       The other
feet of the animal must be examined as well as the diseased
one ; for the disease often passes from one foot to another,
and it is sometimes visible to the eye before the animal is
lame in the foot recently attacked. Some drops of Gou
lard-water will then prevent the progress of the disease.
When the            disease is taken in time, five or six days are suffi
cient for the cure.               If    a good deal of the horn has been re
moved it will require a                longer time, until the horn has grown
again, and assumed sufficient consistence for the animal to
walk without being crippled.
  As long as the least matter                   is perceived       and   the wound
is not dry and cicatrized, even although the animal is not
lame, it must not be thought cured, for it will carry back
the contagion to the flock from which it had been separated.
It must not be allowed to pasture with the rest until com
pletely healed, and even then all its four feet ought to be
bathed with vinegar for a few days at first.
  Unfortunately this malady is subject to frequent returns. I
have often seen animals which appeared to be well cured and
walked perfectly well for fifteen days, and then were again
seized. Those which have already had       so far from being it,
less subject to    are more exposed to it.
                            it,                This happens
from the nature               of the treatment.             The    remedies   I   have
prescribed can only check the progress of the disease    and                  ;
until we have discovered purifying specific, we may often
                                            a
see the disease reappear several times on the same animal.
     It   is   of  consequence to be extremely vigilant
                    great                                                           in
placing the animals   in the infirmary, and in taking them
away in proper time.      In the season when sheep do not
leave the fold, the lame ones are not easily discovered, and
sometimes not until the disease                   is   of   some     days standing,
                                                                                    so

 so that the disease        may have been communicated            to many
 others before the diseased animal is taken away.
     If  the least degree     of infection    is supposed     to exist, they
 ought to be walked up and down every day in an inclosurc,
in order to observe if any of them are lame. It is also ne
cessary to remove them from the infirmary as soon as the
ulceration disappears, because they may take the disease again
 from those around them.              Fumigations of nitric acid arc
salutary     for   preventing    the  smell,   and may also hasten the
cure     of   the   ulcers.    The litter should      also be frequently
changed ;       and when removed        it must not be left in a place
where the healthy animals are liable to be exposed to it.
     When the precautions are resorted to, and the care taken
,which I have described, there will be no danger that the
disease     will  assume any serious appearance.
     Every thing pertaining to the knowledge of this disease,
which is absolutely new in France, and I have reason to be
lieve unknown in Spain, is extremely important to the pro
prietors of flocks of Merinos or mongrels.                    I hope that
those who are in possession of any new facts on the subject
of    the  foot-rot will publish them.           1 obtained from a pro
fessional man        of Piedmont      a  succinct memoir concerning
this disease,      and   I shall here insert it.
    "   Sheep, and particularly those with the finest wool,               are
subject to a contagious whitlow, which hinders them from
pasturing, and which, on account of the pain and the sup
puration which it occasions, gives them a continual fever,
which increases in the evening. They fall off in flesh, and
lose their wool ; the rams lose the appetite               for copulation,
the mothers lose their milk, the lambs are weak and die of
consumption.
    "   There are three kinds        of whitlow, which        succeed each
other.      The first    is seated under the epidermis, between the
two divisions       of  the foot ; the animal is seen to halt        : if we
lay hold of the foot it feels hotter than usual, and it has a bad
smell. Upon examining the place, an oozing out of matter
is discovered.
     " The    second species     of whitlow    is seated under the horn.
                                                                           In

              Observations     upon the      Foot-rot in    Sheep.         235
In this    case the lameness and the heat           of the foot    are greater,
as also the degree       of fever.
    "  The third      species attacks      the phalanges or the bones of
the foot, and is caused            by    inattention    to the two former
6tages    of   the disease.     The cure of this last is very trouble
some and difficult.
    "  The      disease arises    from long journeys,             pasturing in
marshy places, allowing            the sheep      to  mix with swine, or
from lying in damp folds without litter.
    "   Preventatives.     — 1st,     Remove     as  much      as  possible the
above causes        : 2d, separate the diseased           from the healthy
animals the instant the infection appears.
    "   Cure for the first stage of the complaint. — As soon as
 the shepherd       perceives   the disease, he must dry the place           af
 fected    very    carefully with a linen rag, and spread               over it
 vitriol of copper in powder.
    "   In   the second species       of   the whitlow, it      is necessary  to
cut off that part of the horn which is detached from the
 phalange.         We should begin cutting at the point of the
 horn and proceeding upwards. This operation must be per
 formed by paring successively thin slips off the horn ; when
 the horn is completely removed and the flesh bare, the re
 ceptacle     of contagious matter          is discovered.        Sometimes it
 has gnawed very deep, and then the ulcer must be cleaned to
 the very bottom, by continuing to cut by little and little.
     " In order to clean the wound thus laid bare, the foot
 must be plunged into water heated to such a degree that we
 can scarcely hold the hand in it. The diseased foot must
 be plunged and replunged             in this hot water several times,
 letting it remain only a few seconds at each time in the wa
  ter. It is then dried with a cloth, and a feather dipped in
  muriatic acid is drawn over the place.               The animal must be
  kept   in  a  fold  where   there   is  plenty   of  straw     for 24 hours.
  Next    day   it may   be put out to pasture         where there are no
  stones    nor thorns.        Every      night   the   feet   of   the animals
  must be inspected; and           if  ulcers are again formed the treat
  ment must be renewed.               They must be always dressed               in
  the evenings, because          the    repose during       the night    greatly
  contributes to the good effects           of  the remedies.
                                                                          « The

    236         . On two     Species  of the Spkex or Wasp,
       "  The whitlow of the third          species     is very difficult to
   cure  :  the horn must be cut,         and the flesh       taken off also ;
   and the carious bone must be then scraped,                and seared  with
   a red-hot iron."
      The manner of operating with the knife, in order to
   discover the seat       of  the disease,  is extremely well described
   in the above memoir. The analogy between the treatment
   of the whitlow in human creatures and that in animals,
   shows how efficacious the immersion              in hot water is     as re
   commended by the author ; and the careful cleaning of the
   ulcers, upon which he insists, is extremely important.                     I
   entreat that some intelligent agriculturists may communi
  cate to the public their observations from time to time on
   this disease, and the best methods of cure.
. XXXVI.          On two Species of tlie Sphex or Wasp, found in
      Virginia and Pennsylvania, and probably existing through
      all the United States. By H. Latrobe, Esq.
  The      two species of sphex whose astonishing industry pre
  sents such interesting particulars, are known in America by
  the names       of   the blue wasp, the mason and the dirt-dauber.
  These wasps are distinguished among all the remarkable in
  sects which belong to the order of the hymenopteree of Lin
  naeus, by the singular and cruel manner in which they pro
  vide for their young.
     The two species of sphex now mentioned are distinguished
  from each other by their manner of building, and by the
  form of their bodies; but they are quite similar in their
  manners, in the materials they employ in making their cells,
  and in the food they prepare for their progeny.
     The first    is probably the sphex ccendea          alis fuscis of Lin
  naeus*.      It   is   by far the most common: its feelers are
  sharp-pointed,        and are extended when the insect is at work ;
  on its snout it carries        a strong beak, with which it works
  sideways, by making            furrows on the surface of its little

 cells, which appear as if channelled ; its thorax is thick, and
 the abdomen is attached to it by a kind of slender stalk like
the petiole of a flower.       To this petiole belongs a scutum
from which issues a strong hook,          very useful    to the animal
 in securing its prey. The       sting is not very painful, and the
 pain of short duration.        The wings, (which Linnaeus de
 scribes as being brown,) besides being of a fine green, are
 also blue and brown.       The joints of the feet are yellow, and
 the whole head, body and legs are of a blue colour.                The
writer   of this article  has seen some      individuals     which had
yellow spots upon the thorax at the root of the wings.
    The other wasp * {sphex nigra, abdomine petiolato atro,
alis suiviolaceis , of Linnaeus,) has a large head, a flat and open
nose; the thorax longer in proportion, the petiole of the
abdorhen very long, it has no hook ; the abdomen is coni
cal and   of  an elegant form.      Its colour in general      is a deep
blue approaching to black, but there are plenty of yellow
spots upon the thorax ; the thighs, legs, and feet are also
spotted with yellow.        Its feelers are longer than those of
the preceding one ; it carries        them vertically,      and crooks
them often.
    The cells of both species are built of clay, which the in
sect collects in moist places ; but the appearance and con
struction of these cells are different for each species.
    The blue sphex chooses in the open air the south front of
a rock, or trunk of a tree, for its residence.           It then seeks
its building    materials on the bank of some rivulet: it col
lects the clay with its feet; and after having made as large a
ball as it can carry, it begins by laying a slender coating
upon the wood or stone.          It spreads the clay with its head,
and a sharp    sound   is heard   while it is at work.     It then flies
off for another load,     and soon forms the upper extremity of
its cell.   It then goes on to a second range, working alter
nately on both sides, and often visiting the interior of the
tube, which it renders perfectly close and compact. It thus
forms a funnel three or four inches long before attempting
to Jay up any provisions for its young.

much light ; and the back of a picture has also the advan
tage of furnishing two walls to its cell. The hollow mould
ings in a pannel retain it strongly, as well as the interior
angles     of   a   table.     In      the   wooden     houses     of Virginia,
such places swarm with their nests.
  I   have seen the empty space between                 the top     of the books
and the upper shelf          of   a bookcase occupied by a whole           family
of these wasps, which had saved themselves a great deal of
trouble in this instance, as they had only to build one divi
sion in their nests.
  The      nests    of   the Pennsylvanian         wasps        differ essentially
from those of the sphex ccerulea.    In place of long tubes
divided into distinct cells, the former construct horizontal
chambers contiguous to each other. They are completely
polished within, but are more coarsely wrought without.
  Both species of these insects, however, prepare the same
kind of food for their young ; that is to say, spiders of every
kind, but especially those which do not secure themselves
by very extensive webs.    It is a kind of yellow spider which
the wasp collects in greatest quantities.   Tile author, how
ever, has seen both species attack very large spiders in the
middle of their webs, and surrounded with the carcases of the
insects they had devoured; he has even seen one of these wasps
dart quickly upon the spider and wound it with its sting.
The wasp then retired to clean itself from some fibres of the
web; which it did like the common fly, by brushing its
wings and head with its legs.          After having been at
tacked several times, the spider tried to effect its escape by
dropping quickly down by means of its thread to the floor,
when it began to run off ; but its antagonist continued to

    The insect      does not      kill   the spiders which                     it collects in
this manner, but leaves enough of life in them to prevent
them from putrefaction or from drying up.    In all the cells
that I opened, I found the spiders in a state of languor,
which admitted of their moving their limbs without chan
ging their places.        We        can       conceive nothing more painful
than their situation         :   they are huddled together for the pur
pose of being devoured piecemeal by the young wasps, for
whose food they are destined.
   Each of the cellules of the Pennsylvanian wasp, being in
tended to contain a certain number of spiders, is separately
constructed ; but the sphex ccerulea, which builds a long
tube, gathers as many spiders as it thinks necessary ; and,
after having laid an egg, encloses it along with the spiders by
means     of           division of clay.
               a transverse               It lays another egg
in the following cellule, which it fills and shuts up in the
same manner, and so on with four or five cellules in the
same tube.
     The egg      is not long      of hatching
                                         being closed up ;    after
but the author was not able to ascertain the time required
for the formation of the young wasp. There are drawings
coloured after nature published with the memoir, giving sec
tions of the cells of the3e wasps, and showing the different
periods of the transformation of the insects.
   As I always found an unequal number of spiders in va
rious cells, but apparently proportioned to their capacity,
I   opened a range      of       the cells          of   the    Pennsylvanian               wasp ;
and having weighed separately                       the contents              of   each,     I   ob
tained the following results              :
In   the first cellule the spiders weighed                                    -              7j.
In   the second, there were               17 spiders            and       an empty
  skin; the worm weighed    grain, and the spiders
                                              -J-                                            Q\
The third contained 19 very small spiders and some
  empty skins the whole weighed                                       »                -     53.
                                                                                             ll

The worm weighed       -       -                                          -            -
The fourth contained only                 carcasses            of spiders, the
     worm was weak and feeble.                 presume that

   The sixth            cellules were empty ; the young
                and seventh
wasp had abandoned them.
  This examination proves that the wasp distributes with
much judgment the quantity of food necessary for its pro
geny ; in most of the cellules, for instance, I ought to have
found twenty-two or twenty-three spiders, and yet some
times there are only five or six, but in this case they are
very large ones. It appears also, that when the worm has
attained its greatest size, its weight is only one half              of that
of the food it has consumed.
  If  it should become necessary to break through the bar
rier antiently traced between reason and instinct, the ceco-
nomy of the whole class of hymenopterce, and particularly
of the wasps, may contribute  to it.  I shall relate a singular
example   which appears to be above  mere instinct.
   For the purpose of inspecting one of these insects (the
Pennsylvanian wasp) while at work, I was obliged to remove*
a small distance from the wall a picture behind which the
nest was placed.        In doing    so   I
                                 deranged several cellules,
because theearthy mastic which joined them to the wall
was broken in several places and exposed the spiders and
the young worms to view.
   I held the frame about an inch from the wall in order to
see what passed behind.   In a short time the wasp arrived,
loaded with a round lump of clay. It came merely for the
purpose of making   new cellule ; but seeing that its former
                        a
works were deranged, it began to run rapidly over the cel
lules, apparently hesitating what to do. At last it depo
sited the clay upon the edge of one of the apertures, and
began to spread it with its snout, pushing it before      in          it,
the attitude of   sow digging in the ground.
                  a                               emitted aIt
shrill buzzing  when  at work.  After  having very properly
replastered the work,    flew away. In four minutes      re
                                                                     in it
                             it
turned with   anew load of clay, which          it
                                             deposited     the
next aperture.      repeated its visits four times
                   It                                 and after
                                                            ;
having finished the repairs and being convinced of the

goodness of the workmanship by running over it several
times, it flew off again and returned with a new load, with
Which it began to form a new cell.
    If  the faculty  of modifying     the conduct     of    an individual
according to circumstances is one of the characteristics of
reason, the fact I have now mentioned is surely a proof of
reasoning in an insect.       The wasp had remarked the unex
pected derangement which           had   been   made      during its ab
sence; the clay which it brought was intended for a new
cellule ; but observing the mischief done to the old ones, it
repaired them before building any more.

 JL HE proper application of combustibles is one of the most
important objects in all the processes of the arts, more par
ticularly in chemical operations ; it is equally useful to
ascertain what advantage in point of ceconomy results from
the employment of this or that kind of fuel, and to deter-1-
mine the force of the caloric disengaged from the sub
stances which we burn.
    Equal quantities of different kinds of combustibles do
not    always yield     the  same     degree    of heat;       and   it  re

The    success  of  an operation     very   often depends upon the
promptitude with which it is             executed.       Manufacturers,
distillers, and agriculturists ought consequently to attach a
great deal of importance to the knowledge of the most ceco-
nomical fuel, or what are the effects            which      result from a
given quantity of any particular kind ; in short, it ought
to be distinctly ascertained what is the most certain and the
easiest method of determining ihe difference of the action of
caloric.

  M. Montgolfier,                  to whom      we    are    already        indebted fof
many useful discoveries,                  has put an end         to all difficulties
upon the above subject, by the invention of an apparatus
to whichhe has given the name of a calorimeter *-.
                        Description       of   the Calorimeter.
   Plate     V. represents          a   section of the above apparatus.
   A,   B,    C, D, is a           case   of tinned iron (if made of wood
it would      be more ceconomical and advantageous)                         which must
be so well joined that no water may be permitted to escape                                     ;
it has a cover A, B, through which is made an aperture a, b ;
in the bottom also is an aperture e,f.
   The small stove a, b, c, d, e, f, is made of plate iron or
copper, having its joinings carefully closed that it may not
admit of any of the water getting in. Its lower aperture
corresponds with that of the case e,
the upper part is closed
                                                        f
                                         ; another aperture in
                                        near   a, b, by a plug, which may be
taken out at pleasure.
   c, d, is        a grate      composed of iron wire upon which the
combustible            is   placed ; the ashes   fall down from the
grate by the aperture g.
  Near h, i,           a pipe k, k,       is adapted    for giving a passage ta
the    smoke which             escapes      by the aperture            I.     This pipe
ought to be made             of plate-iron or copper,             and        so close as
not   to permit the" water which surrounds it to penetrate                               it.
  m, m, is a pipe of plate-iron larger than the former and
which' surrounds             it,
                     so that the water   kept between both. is
  E   the reservoir, of which the covering
       is                                      may be taken      r,s,
off   to fill the apparatus             with water.
  o, o,      is   a   pipe which comes from the same reservoir, and
which communicates with             the pipe m, m.
  p,    is  a     cock to let out the boiling water               ;    and     q±

other cock, by means of which we may empty the appara
tus   if   necessary.

*hich various               combustibles require to extricate                   a    given
quantity of heat, the reservoir                       E   is filled with water,     which
passes through the pipe o, o, ascends into the pipe m, m,
and penetrates by the pipe n, n, into the case A.B. C. D..
As much water is poured in as will fill the whole of the case,
and when full it maybe easily seen by the water not descend
ing below the line t, u, which is the highest point of the wattrf
in   the apparatus, and             its temperature is observed            by means
of a thermometer.               A
                       sufficient quantity of                        the combustible
to be used in the experiment, for instance, wood, cut into
small pieces, is then placed upon the grate c, d : after hav
ing lighted it up, the upper opening of the stove a,                                  I',   is
closed with the stopper, and    must then be noticed how

Jong time        it   requires before the water arrives at              a    certain de
gree      of
        heat (the boiling point for instance^, and which may
be ascertained with the thermometer.     The fire  then with            is
drawn, and the water              as   well      as   the stove are allowed to cool
until they return            to the temperature at             which    the operation
was commenced. Another kind of combustible, suppose coal
or turf, may
           be then placed on the grate, and the apparatus
managed as before, after the fire being lighted up.
  We can ascertain the greater or less promptitude                                   with
which  heat   extricated from the combustible,
                     is                           comparing             by
the length of time which the two experiments required.
  To find the difference of the quantity or weight of com
bustibles of different kinds proper for producing this tempe
rature,    it   is
             necessary to take   sufficient quantity of one of
                                                 a

ample ;—        it    is   lighted up in the stove after the apparatus                      is
filled with water, and its temperature marked. The thermo
meter determines the moment when the water        in ebulli             is

            fire    then extinguished, and all the combustible"

ployed are compared with each other and valued at a mead-
price, it will be easily seen what effect the one has in com
parison with the other, and consequently what species                          of
fuel is the most ceconomical and cheapest.
    We     may      observe further,       that the pipe       m may be made
of wood       ; but    if it    is of plate-iron or copper, it must            be
surrounded with several coatings                 of paper,     by which means
Jess heat will be lost.
    The    pipes k, k, and m, m, may be lengthened at pleasure,
because still a good deal           of caloric     escapes by the aperture /.
    This   apparatus      may be applied to various purposes ; such
as boiling water at a small expense.                  It is of great utility in
domestic oeconomy.                 To render its effect as complete as
possible, the smoke, or rather the burnt air, should be de
prived as much as possible of its caloric, which ought to be
employed entirely in gradually increasing the temperature of
the water surrounding the chimney.                     This air, thus cooled,
being heavier than that of the atmosphere, determines in
the furnace the current             of air;     an effect    which    is not ob
tained in ascending chimneys but by sacrificing a very con
siderable quantity of caloric.                It is consequently advisable
to lengthen the chimney as much as the height of the apart
ment permits *.
   * We very much suspect that this apparatus has never been tried ; for. in
the way prescribed for conducting the experiments, it would be difficult to
obtain the same resuhs twice from the same kind of fuel. Even in»n open
grate it would be no easy matter to find out means by which to make a fico
of wood, of coal, or of turf, always burn up in the same time and with the
same degree    of force in the same rime. The difficulty, nay, the impossibility,
of always laying the fuel and igniting it in such a manner that all the circum
stances  shall be precisely the same, renders it very improbable that results
should ever be obtained that could be at all depended on, by following the
means pointed out.       Still, however, we think the instrument, or something
similar,  might be so employed       as to give useful results — not by snch short
eiperiments as are proposed in the above paper, but by carrying on the
trials with each of the different kinds of fuel for a day or two, and ascertain
ing how much water a given weight            of each of them could evaporate, and
noting the times. — Edit.

of which present             so manv important             differences           as   those   of
spathic iron, and the treatment of which, in some forges,
agrees also so   with the opinion given of its composition
                      ill
in the most of these analyses. After having examined the
processes employed                 by
                         the chemists who have published
them, and having made some experiments upon the same
subject,  think
          I       have discovered the cause of the dif
                            I
ferent results which               they announced,              or the errors which
they committed.     shall explain in this memoir the results
                             I
of my labours, and    shall conclude
                               I           some conjecturesit    by
upon the causes of several metallurgical practices made use
of in    the treatment            of spathic iron,        and which         I    think have
not been hitherto satisfactorily explained.
  Bayen,    I presume, was the first chemist who analysed
spathic iron.   His work, which appeared to me to contain
some errors,          presents,          however,     some       unquestionable re
sults which seem to have been forgotten, and which                                    I   think
I ought to bring to recollection.
     Distillation           and    the       action   of    the        acids      convinced
M.    Bayen,         1st,    That this        ore contains      a     gas   of   the nature
of   fixed air, to which he attributes the property                              of crystal
lizing   the   iron.               That
                              contains fragments of quartz,
                             2d,             it
which remain in the liquor after its complete solution,                                   if   it
has been exposed in small portions to the action of the acids.
  The crystallization of some sulphuric solutions, without
excess of acid, sometimes presented small quantities of sul
phate    of lime,           at other times he did not perceive                        an atom
of it;   and he concluded from this, that the above ore, con
sidered in the mass,              is   found in some places mixed with cal
careous spar.
     The other experiments               he relates, and the consequences                     he

deduces from them, do not appear to me to be so exact ; in as
far   as he asserts    that the calcined ore was attracted                      by the
magnet, that it was dissolved in nitric acid with facility,
and, according to his account, with a very lively effer
vescence; and that it reduced minium, and, lastly, served to
decompose cinnabar : he concluded from all these circum
stances, that the iron in this ore was in the true metallic
state.     This inference          is obviously so inadmissible that we
need not dwell upon     it.
     The following experiment             deserves to be described.                Af
ter having treated      the ore with       nitric   acid   and        evaporated        it
to dryness, he washed          the residue, and obtained from the
liquor   by means      of   fixed alkali a white earth, which he says
he found after repeated experiments to be calcareous earth.
We shall soon see the reasons which I have for doubting
the accuracy     of   these experiments,           as   well    as    his discovery
of zinc in      a remarkable quantity            in this ore.            The small
black flakes which he perceived in the muriatic acid which
had been poured upon this ore, made him think that this
metal existed there.          To convince himself of                 it,   he digested
in    the cold for ten or twelve days some sulphate                        of iron dis
solved in  small quantity of water, upon spathic iron cal
            a
cined and w^ll pulverized, taking care to agitate the mixture
from time to time he afterwards filtered
                        ;                        and obtained  it,
 byevaporation, and allowing    to subside, crystals, which
                                          it
appeared to him to be sulphate of zinc.
  This result    without doubt very remarkable.
                  is                                   Dize
also judged     it
              necessary to verify this fact upon the same
specimen which Bayen made use of in his experiments.
M. Dize,   in order to obtain oxide of zinc, employed the ac
tion of nitric acid and precisely the same kind of evapora
tion which Bayen            made    use   of    to extract       this calcareous
earth, which he had ascertained,                as he says,          by   decisive ex
periments.    The experiment of M. Dize was made upon
fifty grammes he obtained
                 :               means of by fixed alkali five
                                                           a
grammes    of    white
                 a     substance  of an earthy appearance,
which he mixed with double its weight of charcoal, and                              di
stilled in an earthen         retort.      Upon     the apparatus             cooling,
particles of zinc     were found sublimed at the top                  of    the retort.
                                                                                  This

                  Chemical Observations       upon Spathic          Iron.         247
    This experiment        is without   doubt decisive:             but docs      not
    the small quantity      of zinc obtained       in the distillation
                                                                prove
    that the zinc was in very small proportion         in the earthy
    substance     ?   This supposition appears to me to be confirmed
    by what M.        Dize himself says of the action of prussiate of
    lime upon the nitric solution,        and      without       excess       of acid,
    before it had been precipitated by the alkali           :   — it   had a saline
,   taste ; the prussiate of lime did not injure its transparence ;
    and, he adds, the oxalic acid and sulphuric acid do not de-
    vionstrate the presence of lime.   Besides all this, M. Dize
    had nothing in view but to prove                that    the      specimen        of
    Bayen contained zinc.  I repeated               the     same       experiment
    upon          of spathic iron from Vaunaveys, and I ob
               a piece
    tained the results of M. Dize, with the exception of the
    zinc, of which I did not perceive the least traces ; which
    proves, that if some of these ores contain                  a   little,   at least
    they do not all contain it.
      According to what I have said, we may consider the fol
    lowing as the certain results of Bayen's experiments.
      1st, That the iron is combined in the spathic iron with
    carbonic acid.
         2d,   That   the quartz and the calcareous carbonate                  some
    times obtained in the analysis        of this     ore do nflt enter into
    its composition.
       Almost at the same time with Bayen (in 1 774) Bergman
    published upon the white ores of iron ; he proves in this
    work, that the iron in these ores is in the same degree of
    oxygenation as in green vitriol : as for lime, although he
    obtained some very great differences in the quantities which
    he procured from different specimens,            he determined to re
    gard it as a constituent part of spathic iron.     The method
    which he employed    in order  to extract         it,
                                                   consisted in cal
    cining the ore, reducing    to fine powder, and agitating
                                 it                              af             it
    terwards longtime with
                 a              diluted  nitric acid. The. fixed                     al
    kali was then employed in order to precipitate from this acid
    a white earth, which he ascertained to be lime.        do not        I
    think, however, that this result can invalidate the conclu
    sion which Bayen deduced from his experiments.       In fact,
    it   may be rightly judged, that in       a   long course of labours              of
                                      Q   4                                          the

248         Chemical Observations      upon Spathic   If on.
the same description, all the products have not been exa
mined with the same care ; and it may be possible that some
of the varieties may have contained other earthy substances
which may have been considered as lime ;             a circumstance
which might have induced him to say, that            he never found
spathic iron entirely free of' it.
   Bergman, in making known the existence of manganese
jn the same mineral, and that it was to its strong propor
tion in spathic iron that the property was owing which thia
OK has of yielding stetl, has announced a fact of great im
portance, and      his opinion     has   been  regarded    as almost
proved.
    If some   doubts could have been raised upon the exactness
of this result, they could only          have been relative to the
quantity of manganese; but we know that nitric acid and
 sugar, employed by Bergman to separate the manganese of
iron, are very inexact methods.
    M.  Sage, in his Analysis and Concordance of the three
Kingdoms, admits no lime into spathic iron ; but he aci
Knowledges the presence of manganese in the same propor
tion   as the  Swedish chemist,      and   he says  he obtained the
sulphate of this last metal in white prismatic tetrahedral
Crystals, which crystallized lie/ore martial vitriol.           This
form is that of the crystals of sulphate of zinc, and made
him believe at first that this last metal existed in spathic
iron ; it was, without doubt, the samt form which Bayen
had observed, and which made him draw the same conse
quence,      The last opinion of M. Sage appears to me to be
susceptible of some objections.           In fact, if these crystals
are owing     to manganese,      they would have another form 5
they   would    not   he  white,  but slightly red : in short, they
would not crystallize except after sulphate of iron, that of
Uianganese     being much more soluble.
    M. Bucholz published, about         a year ago, in the Journal
Attemand)      edited    by Messrs.    Klaproth, Hermstadt, &c.,
the analysis of     a  mineral, which, from the description he
 gives,   is easily recognized    as spathic iron.      He there an
 nounces 59$ in 100 of iron in the state of black oxide, and
 g,Ji of lime,, which he seemed to regard as foreign to its
                                                        composition^

             Chemical Observations        upon Spathic Iron.            249
composition.        The remainder        is water and carbonic         acid.
It   is worthy   of remark, that     the proportion     of iron   is deter
mined according to those of the other principles, all of
which were examined with care, by deducting their amount
from the quantity of ore submitted to analysis.                     Conse
quently the losses made upon these principles would corre
spond to the augmentation of the proportion of the iron ;
we must therefore suppose, that this proportion is a little too
high in the result of this analysis.
     M. Bucholz     searched   for the manganese particularly, but
 he did not discover an appreciable quantity of it : besides, he
 employed so many different methods, in order to ascertain
 that this ore contained no other substance, either earthy or
 metallic, that we cannot accuse his results of error.
      M. Bucholz     also observed,    that in the calcination       of this
 ore, the carbonic acid is in part decomposed; and that a gas
 is evolved which burns blue, and which he designates by the
 name of gaseous oxide of carbon.
      Lastly, M.Drappier,        in a  memoir lately published*, has
 announced, that the specimens of spathic iron which he ex
  amined did not contain any lime; that they contained only
  a very small quantity of manganese ; but that he found mag
  nesia in a very great proportion.             Before proceeding any
  further, I shall mention two analyses of M. Bergman, re
  lated by   M. Hassenfratz in      a  note printed in the same paper.
  As    the latter had   it principally in view      to make known the
  quantity of lime contained in spathic iron, and as the pro
  portions obtained from the two specimens have been very
   different, we may again conclude that this substance is fo
   reign to spathic iron.       We may draw the same consequence
   from   a third analysis reported       in the same note, and which
   appeared    to  have    been   made     upon a specimen of roasted
   ore, although water is mentioned in it. This is certainly
   occasioned by some mistake of the press or of the editor.
                                                                             "

a positive manner by the former, and not recognised by the
latter; and,         above all, the existence             of magnesia, in variable
proportions, announced by M. Drappicr, while no other
chemist had spoken of                 it,
                           must leave our opinion uncertain
upon the exactitude of these analyses. A desire to explain
the doubts which might be raised upon these very important
facts relative to metallurgy, determined me to examine this
species of ore again,                by
                          taking specimens which presented
differences among them.
 I    consequently chose, out of the fine collection of the
Council of Mines, two                    pieces     of spathic iron   ;   one   of them
was from Vaunaveys, the same from which M. Drappier had
detached some fragments       the other was from AUevard, but
                                         ;
very different in its characters from that which M. Drappier
had received from            M.      Hassenfratz.          1    shall subjoin the cha

the salts which were not decomposed. The oxide of iron.
was collected upon the filter.        I   afterwards precipitated the
manganese with the prussiate of potash ; and I obtained,
with the assistance of a fixed alkali, the earthy substance*
contained in the clear liquor.         Last of all, I separated the
lime from the magnesia by means of sulphuric acid and eva
poration.      It is to be observed that the nitric solution must
not be evaporated too strongly : without this precaution we
run. the   risk of decomposing a great portion of the nitrate
of manganese. I examined, by several methods, the pro
ducts of each experiment, in order to avoid errors as much.
as  possible.

    These results do not indicate the exact proportions of car
bonic acid which exist in these spathic irons, because one
part of this acid is decomposed during calcination, and there
results from it a much stronger oxidation of the metal, in
such a manner that the loss which the ore suffers, and
which might be ascribed to water and carbonic acid, is a
little below the real quantity in relation to this last princi

 pensates for the low estimate of the carbonic acid ; and in
the last result the real loss is a mere trifle.

XXXIX.          Description      of an Improved Crane and Flexible
     Chains.     By Mr. GILBERT GILPIN, of Old Park Iron-
     Works,near      Shifnal *.
JLlAviNG discovered             a  method        of working chains of         the
common construction,              over   pulleys, in all directions, more
safe and flexible than the hest hempen ropes, and at the same
time equally uniform, I have sent, for the inspection of the
Society for the encouragement of arts, manufactures, and
commerce,        a  full-sized pulley in wood,               and    apiece of     a
chain, together with a model              of a crane, exhibiting        its man
ner of application.
     From its simplicity of form,             and    facility of manufacture,
the common chain, formed of                  oval     links, has been      in use
from the earliest ages ; and that it did not answer every pur
pose of a hempen rope, in working over pulleys, was not
owing to its peculiar form, but from                     an error in the appli
cation.
     Every chain of this nature has a twist in itself, arising
from a depression given by the hammer to each link in the
welding     f  ; and this circumstance, so trifling in appearance,
is not so in its effects, and it has in consequence a perpetual
tendency (even when reefed perfectly straight in pulleys, and
on the barrels of cranes) to assume a spiral form, which a
plain cylindrical barrel, and the common pulleys with semi
circular    grooves, are not in the least calculated to prevent.
Hence      the alternate links of the chain, in coiling round a
barrel, or working over pulleys, form obtuse angles in as
suming the spiral form, bearing upon the lower parts of their
 circumferences,       and     forming      as    it were   two levers, which
wrench       open and       crush     each      other in proportion to the
 weight suspended,         as  well   as  prevent the freedom of motion
in the links themselves, and thereby load the chain with ad
 ditional friction.

                          of  Society of Art s, fcc. 18OS.  The silver medal of the
society and 30 guineas were voted to Mr. Gilpin for this invention ; and
 models of the crane and chain are reserved in the Society's Repository, for the
inspection of the public.
    \ The twist may be seen by holding the piece of the chain by one end, and
 viewing the links edgeways as it hangs down.
                                                                            A still

  A   still greater obstruction to the uniformity of its motion,
is the tendency which the chain has to make a double coil
as it approaches the middle of the barrel and crosses its cen
tre, and that of the pulleys at right angles, by means of
which the chain is frequently broken by the sudden jerk
caused by the upper coil slipping                off the undermost.
  It is to these causes that all the accidents that occur to
,workmen and machinery from the failure of chains may be
attributed (bad iron excepted), and which form the sole ob
jection to their becoming a general substitute for ropes.
   As a preventive to these evils, I have grooves cast in iron
 pulleys, of sufficient dimensions to receive the lower circum
ferences       links of the chain, which work vertically ;
                of    the
those which work   horizontally and form the gudgeon part of
the chain    we may be allowed the expression), bearing
                     (if
upon each side of the grooves.
   The barrels             are also   of cast iron, with spiral grooves of the
same dimensions,               at such distance from each other as to ad
mit the chain to             bed  without the danger of double coil
                                                            a            ;   by
these means the              links are retained at right angles with     each
other, the only position for free and uniform motion.
   The links of the chains are made as short as possible, for
the purpose of increasing their flexibility, and they are
reefed perfectly free from twist,                in   the pulleys, and on the
barrels, for the same reason.
   When applied in blocks, the grooves in the pulleys prevent
the different falls of the chain from coming in contact, and
render plates between them (as in the common way) totally
unnecessary    the pulleys are in consequence brought closer
                     ;
together, the angle of the fall from block to block consider
ably diminished, and the friction against the plates entirely
avoided.   Brass guards, with grooves opposite to those in
the pulleys, are riveted to the blocks, to prevent the chain
getting out of its birth from any accidental circumstance.
This method of working chains        first put in practice for
                                                 I

for which purposes ropes had            before     been   solely used at this
manufactory.         In all   cases it has performed         with the utmost
safety, uniformity, and flexibility ; so much so that the
prejudices of our workmen against chains are entirely done
away, and they hoist the heaviest articles with more ease,
and as great confidence          of safety as they Would with           the best
ropes.
   The   same method is applicable, at a               trifling expense, to
all machines at present worked by ropes, or by chains, in th«
usual way : and all the common chains now in use may be
applied to it with equal facility.
   With a view of ascertaining the relative flexibility of
ropes and chains, I wedged an iron pulley, thirty-one and A
half inches in diameter, on the spindle of the pinion of                       A
crane of the following description, viz.

      Bottom block, with 2 ditto, ditto.
   To the large pulley I attached a small rope, for the pur
pose of suspending the weights in the hoisting of the differ
ent loads, and the results were           as follow    :

   The flexibility is inversely as these momenta, and proves
the superiority of chains ; for (on the average of the trials)
with the chain in the grooves,
   One pound raised               -      -      -    -       31-25 lbs.

   And with the chain in the usual way, only               - 24-47 do.
   It also appears (contrary to the general opinion), that
chains are safer than ropes ; for it is an established axiom,
that those bodies whose fibres are most in the direction          of the
strain, are the least liable to be pulled asunder ; and in our ex
amination       of   the   properties of a rope, we find that the
•trands cross the direction of the strain in undulated lines,
and consequently           prevent its uniform action thereon.         A
rope is subject to this inconvenience even when stretched in
a direct line, but more particularly so when bent over a pul
ley,  as  in that position     the upper section, moving through a
greater space        than the under one, is acted upon by the
whole strain       ; and hence the frequent breaking of ropes
in bending over pulleys, from the double strain overloading
the strands of which the upper section is formed.
   The links of a chain are subject to the transverse strain,
where they move in contact ; but as such strain is in propor
tion to the length of the bearing, it must be very trifling. All
the links having axles of their own, the chain moves simul
taneously with the strain, and both are in consequence re
tained in continual equilibrio, A chain in grooves will
therefore sustain as great a weight when bent over a pulley,
as it    will in   a direct line,    and   consequently is safer than
a rope.
   A    safe,  uniform, and flexible method of applying chains
 in the   working of machinery has long been a desideratum
in the    arts ; for they are but little affected      by exposure to
the weather, or the heat of manufactories, whilst either pro
duces the speedy destruction          of ropes.
   The discovery        is of additional importance,  as  it substitute?
a durable article for a very perishable one, and gives employ
ment to our own manufactories at the expense of foreign im-

portations. —The durability is at least six to one in favour of
chains.
  Though the model of the crane is chiefly intended to con^
vey a proper idea   of the new method of working chains, yet
I trust it will be found  to possess several other advantages in
point of construction, which are entirely new, and calcu
lated to increase the safety and durability, as well                             as to   les-
len the expense of that useful machine.
     On reviewing               the principles     of   a   crane, we find that the
gudgeons are the points       of resistance to the machine and its
load, and       consequently the effect of the transverse strain up
on the perpendicular will be in proportion to the distance
of the mortise for the gib from the upper one ; and that of
•the oblique strain, in proportion to the distance of the mot*
tise for the diagonal stay, from the lower one.
     Notwithstanding               these circumstances           are so evident, they
are seldom attended                 to ; for in general a large and expen
sive   piece     of oak, sufficient of itself to make                        a   crane of
double the purchase, forms the perpendicular; the gib is
mortised into             it,
                at eighteen or twenty inches from the top,
to make room for the gudgeon, as      the diagonal stay, at is
five or six feet from the bottom, to allow                           a   birth below for
the barrel.           Thus        the effect     of     the transverse       and oblique
strains    of   the gib and diagonal stay upon the perpendicular,
is   increased    their distances from the gudgeons, or points
                     by
of     resistance, and the perpendicular itself considerably
weakened         bymortises made where the greatest strength                               is
required.        Hence the frequent failure of cranes of the com
mon construction,                  by   the breaking        of the perpendiculars in
the mortises.
     It   appears,        however,           that the various        parts    of   a   crane
formed      of wood, cannot                  be connected together in any other
way than         by
              mortising   and as this method considerably
                                         ;
diminishes the strength of the timber,  make use of cast*        I
iron mortise pieces.
     The perpendicular         of two oak planks, each
                                        is   formed
eighteen inches wide, four thick, and sixteen feet long                                    ;
these, at the top and bottom, are let into cast-iron mortise
pieces, which retain the planks ten inches asunder.     The

                Improved Crane and Flexible Chain*.
barrel For the chain, works between them. The piece at the
top contains in the middle a dove-tailed mortise, into which
a stock for the gib is fixed ; for greater           security; an iron
bolt goes through the whole ; the stock projects two feet
from the mortise, and a plank ^eighteen inches deep, and
four thick,    is bolted to each      side of it to form    the gib,  the
interstice between the planks forming              a  birth for the top
block to slide in. The diagonal stay is           of  the same dimen
sions, formed in      a similar manner, and connected to the per
pendicular, by being let into the lower mortise piece.
    In this mode of construction scarcely any part of the tim
ber is cut away ; and the strength of the materials, so far
from being diminished, is augmented by the cast-iron mor
tise pieces, the gib is brought much closer to the upper gud
geon, and the centre lines         of  the perpendicular and the dia
gonal stay crossing each          other at the top of the lower one,
places the whole strain as         near as possible in a line with the
gudgeons.       The business of the perpendicular becomes in
consequence little more than that of a mere prop, and con
sequently requires no greater strength of materials than the
diagonal stay.
    The top block       is made of cast iron, and has a groove
three inches deep on each side, for the purpose of embra
cing the planks which form the gib.
    To prevent the inconvenience of the dirt of the floor get
ting into the brass of the lower gudgeon, and thereby ob
 structing the revolution of the crane, those parts are reverse
to the common way, the gudgeon being fixed in the floor,
 and the socket part which embraces it is cast in the bottom
 of the mortise-piece,       as is also a channel to convey oil to the
 gudgeon.       I am, Sir,

                              Book-case Bolt *.
1   HAVE taken the liberty of laying before the society a mo
del of my invention, which I hope is sufficient to explain
my intention.         I intended it for a library book-case bolt, to
facilitate the opening of both doors at once, and to secure
the same, without the trouble of boiting iwo bolts in the
common way.            It will   do for wardrobes, French casements,
or folding    sash doors.         It will also make         a good cash fast
ening,     if let into the bottom sash, with a small brass knob
to slide   as  common       ;  it would bolt in the frame by the             side
of  the sash cord, both sides at once.                 I can also make it to
answer sundry other useful purposes                 if required.

 JV1. MARECHAUX of Wesel, correspondent of the Galvanic
 society,    announces      that he      has  ascertained      that water,
 whether     pure or mixed with an acid, or saturated with any
 salt, is not a necessary       ingredient in the production of the
 effects of the Galvanic fluid.          He adds that for some time
 past he   has  constructed    columns     of zinc and brass, with the
 interposition    of disks of pasteboard not moistened, which
 were   of great  service to him. The Galvanic society being in
 terested in a fact of, this nature,        they determined to repeat
 the experiments of M. Marechaux, as described in his let
 ter: disks of zinc which had been employed before were

                                                                 completely

completely scraped and restored to their former polish.                     Si
milar ones of new brass were made. With the interposition
of rounds of pasteboard not moistened, a vertical column
was formed of 49 pairs of disks, resting upon a larger plate
of brass,      pierced    with    three holes in its edges, through
which     were made       to pass as many silk cords, intended to
keep the disks in their position.              These cords were tied all
together     at the  top,  and   the  whole   column     was then suspen
ded from a hook. This pile, which M. Marechaux denomi
nates the pendulous           column,     having heen placed in com
munication        with the electro-micrometer, simplified upon
that of M. Marechaux, by M. Veau-Delaunay, it manifested
a tension * of 360 degrees, which we may be certain was
not   the effect of atmospherical electricity, but truly that of
the Galvanic election.
   This first experiment was repeated and varied in different
manners.         Rounds of blotting paper were substituted in the
room of those of pasteboard, to the number of four for
each, and no effect whatever was produced. Rounds of paste
board dried in a stove were also made use of: the mean term
of attraction in       several trials was 372°.         With    these    same
rounds and only 25 pairs of disks, the attraction was 160°.
The column        was afterwards tried with the same number of
pairs of metallic disks, but without the interposition of
rounds of pasteboard, and nothing was obtained.
   These first results satisfied the society that the fact an
nounced by M. Marechaux was correct ; but this Galvanic
action, by the pendulous column, could only be ascertained
by the assistance of an instrument of great sensibility, and
in quantities scarcely appreciable. It remains for the society
to ascertain the advantage which may be derived to the pro
gress of Galvanism, by the employment of more powerful
means, and by the comparison of the effects produced with
piles kept in a state of humidity, by means of saline solu-
     By the word tension is meant the measure of the distance to which a
  •
leaf of gold suspended to a vertical column of copper is attracted towards an
other horizontal column of the iame metal, terminated by a ball, when these
two columns are in communication with the two poles of the pile. Each de
gree of this measure of attraction represents an 18,OOOdth part of an inch.

  its labours and experiments to this object.
                                   n.
     In   consequence of    Dr. Baronio of Milan having pub
 lished    a description of a Galvanic pile formed of vegetable
  matters, the society occupied themselves with ascertaining
 the truth of Baronio's experiments.          They procured sixty
  even disks of walnut-tree wood, two inches in diameter,
 furnished with a raised edge of about a line and a half, and
 they boiled them in vinegar for some time.           With these
 disks and some rounds of raw beet-root, and radish, (Ra-
 phanus sativus of Linnaeus) a pile was constructed of sixty
 pairs pf disks of beet-root and radishes, separated by disks
 of wood     ;  upon the upper part of each of which, by means
 of   the border with    which they were furnished, they" poured
 acidulated tartrite of potash dissolved in vinegar ; they
 afterwards placed at the lower extremity of the pile a leaf of
 cochlearia, and at its upper extremity a double band of gray
 paper soaked in vinegar. Every thing being thus disposed
 agreeably to Baronio's detailed description, frogs properly
 prepared were submitted to the action of the pile, by pla
 cing the leaf of cochlearia in communication with their
 spinal marrow, and the band of paper with their muscles.
 Three frogs successively subjected to repeated trials mani
 fested no kind of movement: after having made without
 any success every trial capable of producing any effect, the
 pile was placed in communication with the clectro-micro-
nieter without      any effect ; the same instrument was after
wards presented to a pendulous pile constructed after M,
 Marec'iaux's method, composed of 60 pairs of new disks
 of copper and zinc, with the interposition of rounds of
pasteboard      not moistened.     A  tension was experienced of
about 180°.        At  the same moment      the frogs made use of
in   the experiments with the vegetable pile were placed in
communication with the above pile, and they gave no signs
of sensibility.
    The Galvanic society, therefore, have not obtained the re
sults indicated by Baronio ; but their experiments served to
ponyjnee       them   that the   electro-micrometer,  which they

    marthenshire      *.
     GENTLEMEN,                                              .
  J. HE    model of a rail-road          waggon and check or stop,
 which I have this day the honour of presenting to you,                       I
 trust on examination will be found to possess the means of
 preventing those various accidents which have from time to
time proved fatal to the horses employed in such service,
 particularly where the declivity is from twelve to sixteen
 inches to the chain, and the trade on such road principally
 descending.
    The    use  of a horse employed on a rail-road is as frequently
 to check the velocity of a waggon or waggons loaded, (ge
nerally to the weight of two tons and a half each) so as that
 they may not exceed a certain degree of motion, as well as
to draw them on such parts of the road as approach near
upon      or quite to     a  level.    When the horse finds himself
pressed upon beyond his power of resistance ; to relieve
himself, he is compelled to quicken his pace, by which
means the velocity of the waggon exceeds any government
during the continuance of the declivity which 'gave it such
action : under such circumstances, the least trip of the horse
terminates in a fall, by which, from the formation of a rail-
or tram-road, the animal becomes injured notwithstanding
every manual exertion.             For the preservation of that valu
able animal,       and as a preventive to all such accidents                in
future, I turned my thoughts to the invention of the simple
check or stop now before you, and which may be appropri
ated to carriages     in general use.
    As   the  utility of rail-roads daily       increases   in the opinion

 waggon instantly stops, and prevents the horse from receiv

more waggons, arising from their velocity on roads upon ati
inclined plane, as I, Fig. 1, has unfortunately frequently
 occasioned.
    It is  necessary     to dbserve, that to prevent the great trouble
 which would          arise from turning the waggon round on a
 rail-road, it would be better to have a check to each of the
 four wheels ; in which case, after the waggon has dis
 charged its load at the place of its destination, the chains
 FFmaybe           loosened from       the  shafts, and   fastened    upon
 hooks, one        of which is shown         at  K,  so as  to keep     the

JCLHI.     Experiments made upon new Ivory, fossil Ivory, and
    the Enamel of Teeth, in order to ascertain                  if  these Sub
    stances  contained   Fluoric Acid.          By Messrs. FouRCRor
    and  Vauchielin.       Read in the      French Institute*.
By     a letter inserted in No.      165   of the Annales de Chimiet
 (see Philosophical Magazine,           vol. xxiii. p. 264.) M. Gay
 Lussac, the pupil and friend of M. Berthollet, announces
 that Mr. Morichini, a chemist at Rome, had discovered the
 presence of the fluoric acid in new ivory, fossil ivory, and
 the enamel of teeth ; he found that new ivory was almost
 entirely formed of fluate of lime, and that the enamel of teeth
 contained nearly 22 per cent. of fluate of lime.
    This discovery is so interesting, that it becomes every man
 of science to ascertain the truth of it. We shall give in this
 paper the result of the experiments made by us upon the
 subject in the laboratory of the Museum of Natural History.
    As it would have been difficult, and perhaps impossible,
 to make the sulphuric acid act conveniently upon these sub
 stances, if they had not been first cleared of their animal
 gluten, we began by calcining them in an open crucible.

   266       Experiments     upon new       Ivory, fossil Ivory,
     The   differences   which    exist among the losses experienced
  by the different ivories in calcination may be explained by
  the state in which they arc found : the fossil ivory of Siberia
  and  of Loyo     were almost entirely in their natural state ; they
  preserved    the greatest part of their animal gluten and their
  organization, while those of the canal of Lourque, of Peru,
  and of Argenteuil, had lost this matter and had become dry.
  The latter, also, easily split into     scales, were extremely brittle,
  and sent forth only a very slight animal smell during cal
  cination : as to the enamel of teeth, the small loss which it
  sustains by the same operation, announces that ic contains
 much less humidity-or animal mucilage than other bones,
 as was before well      known    :   the latter assumed      a  bright blue
 colour upon being exposed to heat, which proves that it con
 tains a notable quantity of phosphate of lime.
     After having been calcined and pulverized, each of these
 matters was treated in the following manner, to know if we
 could ascertain the presence of the fluoric acid.                   Portions
 of  the calcined ivories were placed in a common phial,                  and
 also in a small retort : four parts of concentrated sulphuric
 acid were poured upon the ivory ; to these vessels was adapted
 a glass tube which was inserted in lime water, and they were
 then heated.       In  each of   these    experiments no more than
 twenty grammes were employed at a time, and never less
 than five.
    Neither fresh ivory nor the enamel of teeth gave any traces
w hatever    of  the fluoric acid   :   the fossil ivories  of Siberia    and
 of Loyo    were alike destitute       of it l but  those  of  the canal   of
Lourque,      and   Argenteuil,     gave     evident signs of this acid.
In   the latter cases, the upper part         of the phials and retorts,
as well    as the tubes made     use of, were covered         with a white
powder, the properties of which resembled                   silex  ;  in  the
other cases nothing similar appeared.
    These first results having inclined us to doubt the exist
ence of the fluoric acid in new ivory, as well as in such
ivory (although fossil) which still retained almost entirely,
and without alteration,       the     animal matter, we made artifi

even in the latter case, we observed, in a very remarkable
manner, the effects of the fluoric acid upon the glass when
these mixtures were treated as above mentioned.        These
effects were even much    more sensible than those produced
by the fossil ivories of the canal of Lourque and of Argen-
teuil ; which shows that the fluate of lime does not exist in
a greater proportion than three or four per cent.
  Those who have announced the discovery of the fluoric
acid in ieory, do not assert that this substance                    was found ready
formed in        it,
               although they recollect that formerly Rouelle
tried in vain to extract phosphorus from it; yet upon treat
ing       30O grammes          of   it   in the same manner in which bones
          for the purpose of obtaining phosphorus from
are treated
them, we obtained 15, grammes of very pure phosphorus
in   very pure state.
     a                This quantity of phosphorus     nearly                       is
the same as that obtained from bones      and       probable ;           it   is
that we might have had still more,   the retort had not bro
                                                       if
ken before the operation was entirely finished.
     If    by
         the first operation to which we submitted the fresh
ivory we had not perceived any vestige of the fluoric acid,
the circumstance which we are about to relate proves that
it contains phosphoric acid in abundance, and probably as
much        as bones     do.
     The pungent smell which                     is   disengaged        at the moment
when the sulphuric acid   mixed with calcined new ivory,
                                          is
cannot be regarded as certain mark of the presence of the
                                    a
fluoric acid, because there                 is   produced in this case             a    degree
of heat      so considerable as to volatilize with the water                        a    small
quantity of sulphuric acid besides, this vapour manifests
                                           :
itself also daring the mixture of the sulphuric acid with
such bones, where the presence of the fluoric acid                            is   not ad
mitted.
          chemists in Paris, having repeated the same expe
     Several
riments upon ivory, obtained results nearly similar to ours.
   Although we have not found fluoric acid in new ivory
nor in the enamel of teeth,                    as announced        by   M. Morichini,
it   is           clear, that such fossil ivories, of whatever
          nevertheless
country they are,  as have lost their animal matter, contain
some hundredths of fluoric acid.      This truly singular cir-
purpstance seems to indicate that these substances are, after
                                                                              cumsunce

  a long period, impregnated        with fluoric acid, — a feet  which
  supposes     that this acid exists in the earth ; for    to suppose,
  with M. Klaproth, that the phosphoric acid is partly con
  verted into fluoric acid, would be to admit an hypothesis too
  distant from our actual knowledge to appear even probable.
     If the   fluoric acid really existed in new ivory and the ena
  mel of teeth,        it must follow that a chemical analysis
  would find it in vegetable and animal substances : at least
 one would suppose that it would be developed in the living
 animal oeconomy l which is extremely hypothetical,                and
 without any rational foundation.
     It   seems more probable, therefore,       that during the long
 continuance of these substances         in the earth, they combine
 with     the fluoric acid.   By the former hypothesis     the fluoric
 acid must be supposed to exist over all the world, since
 fossil ivories, wherever found, always contain this acid ; by
 the second hypothesis we must be forced to admit the change
 of   some     principle  in  the  ivory into fluoric acid, which is
 not altogether impossible :       in truth, as we are ignorant of
 the nature of the fluoric acid, we cannot appreciate the man
 ner or the cause of these transmutations in the present state
 of chemistry.

        GENTLEMEN,
     In   answer to yours this day received, I beg leave to
             I
say, that have not the smallest objection to state my reason
 for having inoculated my own child with the small-pox.
     The child being near         to the village    of Streatham in Surry,
 had been      exposed to the contagion             of small-pox two days
 previous to my knowledge of the same; a child having been
 brought into the same room by accident, then in the fourth
 day of the eruption.           In consequence of this unlucky cir
 cumstance,       I  considered       it most prudent to inoculate hiin
 immediately with variolous matter. He went through the
 disease with much          difficulty,    and no inconsiderable degree
 of danger.        Had    the disease proved fatal,       I should certainly
 have considered myself             in   a  great measure to blame, for
  having neglected to vaccinate him at an earlier period, al
 though he was only four months old when inoculated.
            I am, Gentlemen, your most obedient,

   stances  of  the  small-pox subsequently to the ciow-pockj
   and the occurrence  of disorders imputed to the new prac
  tice.   Two opposite parties have for some time endea
  voured to influence the conduct of the public ; the: one as
  serting and publishing numerous cases or. failure and dis
  ease from    the vaccine inoculation,    the  other disallowing
  such cases, but ascribing the occurrences to inattention, ig
  norance, imprudence, and misrepresentation ; also to the
  human constitution being, in a small proportion of indivi
  duals, susceptible of the small -pox, and in course of the
  cow-pock, more than once. In this state of practice and
  opinions, it appears to be the duty of the medical establish
 ment of this institution to communicate to the governors
  the information derived from their own experience on the
 two points in question of vaccine practice.
     "  I. Concerning the- power of the vaccine infection to
 render the human animal unsusceptible of tlie smull-pox. —
 Two instances only of alleged failure occurred during the
 years 1800, 1801, 1802,     1803,  1804,  and   1805.    I think,
 in both cases, the small-pox really took place after vaccine
 inoculation, at the institution; but as it appeared from our
 register, that one of these patients, Songer Lemon, had not
 duly attended, there was a deficiency of evidence to prove
 that the cow-pock had been excited.         In t'ne other case,
James M'Pherson's,      it did appear from  our  records, that the
•patient had    undergone the cow-pock, and it was admitted
by the medical establishment, that the subsequent disorder
was the small-pox.      Having, however, up to the time of
this last occurrence, an immense body of positive favour
able evidence communicated from all quarters of the world,
particularly by the correspondence of '..he institution with
many practitioners in different parts of the united kingdom,
in addition to the experience of our own establishment, we
were rather inclined to suspect, in the case last mentioned,
some error in our register, than to admit an exception to
what appeared to be a law of the hiMnan animal ceconomy.
To appreciate justly our statements, it is necessary to ex
plain that many of our vaccinated patients were, in the
years 1800, 1801, and 1802, '.noculated with variolous
matter, and on good authority we know that many of them
                                                             were

                  Original Vaccine Pock Institution.                       971
Were also exposed  to the contact of persons  of the small
                                                         ill
pox.   In the evidence of experience above represented, we
should probably have confided without searching for further
facts to prove the efficacy of vaccination,     besides theif
great number       of   asserted casesof small-pox subsequently to
vaccine   innoculation,          many of which, on inquiry, were
found to be utterly unfounded, and others at least unsub
stantiated, there had not appeared from time to time    case          a
so stated as to be undeniably the small -pox after the cow-
pock.       Accordingly, in the summer of            1804, the alarm was
so great,    especially from Mr. Goldson's           temperate    and   judi
cious  pamphlet, that the medical establishment were re
quired by some of the governors to again institute the trials
of re-inoculation.  Sixty persons (chiefly those who had
been vaccinated at the earliest periods of the institution)
were   inoculated in the most efficaciously known circum
stances for the taking effect of variolous infection   viz.           ;
inoculation at the bed-side," and in contact with patients ill
of the natural small-pox     inserting matter of the pock in
                                   ;
the vesicle state;            inoculating in an unusual number of
punctured parts       ;      of course always with recent and fluid
matter  ;but without    exciting, in   single instance, the
                                                 a
small-pox.    By those who have read our printed statement*
of these trials,    may be recollected that the inquiry for
                        it
subjects was the means of furnishing still more evidence
than the cases reinoculated for four out of five families to
                                       ;
which children belonged who had been inoculated for the
cow-pock,        refused      to submit    to the test proposed   alleging
                                                                  ;
that   it   was useless,      as they had been exposed     in vain to the
influence of variolous effluvia after vaccine inoculation,                   by
living with persons ill of the small-pox.
   " A further considerable accession
                                    of evidence was obtained
by   the inquiry madeon this occasion, whether or not any
persons had taken the small-pox who had gone through the
cow-pock in general inoculation of three parishes, as early
                  a
as 1799,      under the direction of two members               of our     esta
blishment.        The result    t   was, that to the knowledge of the

 various practitioners living in those situations, no one * had
taken the small-pox.
     " It will be proper to bring forward another body of evi
dence different from the preceding.                   From its commence
ment this institution has been the appointed office for sup
plying weekly the army, the navy, and ordnance department
with vaccine matter           ; yet this constant intercourse has not
afforded     any authentic cases of failure which can be recol
 lected — as far as known, the reported ones appeared on in
vestigation to be either misrepresentations                    or could not be
proved.
     "   It must not      be concealed, however,            that from time to'
 time cases were made known, in the practice elsewhere, of
 the occurrence of small-pox subsequently to the cow-pock ;
 which, according to the evidence, we could not justly re
ject, although conviction was not always felt that the case
 was one of real small-pox after the authentic vaccina.
     " In the mean time numerous trials were made at this
 institution of opposing variolous and vaccine matter to each
 other in various situations, which demonstrate the anti-
 variolous      power     of the latter.       These experiments cannot
 be here detailed, but they are recorded                 in our minute-book
 as  materials for continuing the investigation of the laws                   f of
  agency of vaccine matter.
     " At     this institution, by a great number of trials, two
 laws,    first  asserted in I799, seem to have been fully con
 firmed, which may be considered as demonstrative of the
 power of the vaccine affection, if duly excited, to induce
 unsusceptibility of the small-pox.                The laws alluded to are,
  1. That the human constitution is incapable of undergoing
 the vaccine affection a second time, if by the first it has
  been rendered       unsusceptible of the small-pox. 2. That the
  human constitution is incapable of undergoing the vaccine
    * A failure   has been lately reported to the   writer of this paper, but there
 has been no opportunity    to ascertain the fact by legal evidence.
    f  The Original Vaccine Pock Institution has published one Report of the
  progress of this investigation, which with the proposed subsequent ones, pro
  bably, will ultimately establish principles for secure practice.   See " The Re

    infection at all,         if it   has been rendered             incapable of under
    going the small-pox               a second         time, by having already gone
    through this disease.                Hence          the truly important        practical
    conclusion,— That inoculation with vaccine matter affords an
    equally just criterion of the state of unsusceptibility of
    either small-pox             or the cow-pock, subsequent                     to either   of
    these affections.
     .   "   On    the grounds     of the     above different sources           of evidence,
    the opinion       of    the medical establishment in general seemed to
    incline to       that   of   the asserted failures after vaccination being
    either imputable to certain circumstances not being attended
    to, which might have shown that the patients were not duly
    vaccinated ; or else that the subsequent disorder was not
    substantiated          to be really the small-pox.                  But   the occurrence
    in May last, of two failures in the practice at this institu
    tion, compelled us to own that persons who have gone
    through the cow-pock with all the appearances, and in the
    course deemed, as we apprehend, by competent judges, to
    be those of the cow-pock, and which are alleged by them
    to give security — I say, that after such an affection the small
    pox may take place in a small proportion of the number vac
    cinated.  These two adverse occurrences unfortunately ren
    dered our opinion of a former case of small-pox after cow-
    pock no longer tenable   namely, that an error had probably
                                         ;
    crept into our register    the case of M'Pherson.

,
    does not appear that the three above failures were owing to
    any known measures or circumstances, and as the inocula
    tions were in circumstances supposed adequate for obtaining
    security, we must conclude, that according to our expe
    rience, vaccine inoculation does not in all cases produce the
    unsusceptibility          desired.            It   is,   however, abundantly proved
    by    the preceding evidence,                  that       the proportion of insecure
    cases    very small.
              is           Every estimate must be on grounds
    merely conjectural   but on such grounds
                                 ;                may be stated          it
    to be one out of   thousand.
                              a    However,     ought to be also        it
    Mated, that this proportion      on the supposition that all

    persons left susceptible of the small-pox after cow-pock
    have taken the former disease, which     obviously hitherto    is
    undecided.          These being truths, false conclusions, as                            it
    now appears,         have been drawn, viz.   1. That the inocula-

tion for the cow-pock is equally efficacious to that for the
small-pox.    2. That the failures are in every instance im-
putable to unskilfulness, ignorance, or inattention.    It is
however easy to conceive, that in places of small population,
or in places where the small-pox is neither epidemical, nor
where persons inoculated for that disorder are allowed to
live with children who have been vaccinated, or to have in
tercourse with society at large, the natural small-pox may
not appear for many years, and with some precautions may
be, perhaps, extinguished.   In such circumstances many
lives may be saved.  In London, the population being so
considerable — persons having greater liberty to act according
to their own opinion — and having been much influenced by
writers, opposers to the cow-pock inoculation — also the va

that such circumstances must excite the small-pox      large          in   a
proportion  of susceptible persons. This     what        is
                                                   happened
in the year 1805, and       perhaps fortunate for the public
                               it
                               is
that the variolous infection was disseminated,                 as   hut for that
circumstance         the state   of insecurity might not             have      been
made appear.    The two cases which have induced change               a
in our opinion were those of Anne Maber, No. 33, and
Mary Maber, No. 34, on Dr. Nihell's list, who, as appears
from the register, underwent the regular cow-pock in the
year 1800.   In May 1806, living in the same room with                            a
child inthe inoculated small-pox, they took the small -pox,
as allowed      by   the members at the board, before whom they
were examined.             The medical establishment          were now con
vinced that many of the cases published, as cases of the
small-pox after the cow-pock, were really such cases,                            al
though not legally proved nor does;appearthat any known

           in                                Accordingly,                        it
would not be just  conduct  to withhold from the public, that
at present no one can be authenticated to be secure from the
small-pox       by   vaccine inoculation,       unless        the test be em
ployed of rcinoculation.   Confiding in our experience, the
vaccine matter    equally to be. relied upon as the variolous,
                      is
to afford the required proof     but those who may not be
                                         l
acquainted with our experience will probably not be satis

valuable fact, it is advisable          to insert vaccine matter in one
arm and variolous in the other.     No one would object to
this proposal, if the harmlessness of repeated insertion of
matter, fully ascertained at this institution, were commonly
known.    By this mode of procedure, a double test is applied,
and at the same time it will be shown that the state or dispo
sition to be affected, or not, is alike to both kinds of matter.
    "   It   is designed   to relate our own experience         ; and that has
not informed us that there   is any such thing as spurious
 matter in any proper sense of the term, i. e. a sort of matter
"which produces an affection mistaken for the cow-pock, by
successiveinsertions of it from subject to subject. Matter
which produces an anomalous pock, either, on the succeed
ing insertions, excites the regular cow- pock, or fails to ex
cite a similar anomalous pock : this            is,
                                           say, according to
                                                    I
our experience. And in the cases of such anomalous pocks,
sometimes we have found the unsusceptibility of the small
pox produced, and at other times not for in such cases we
                                                ;
always insisted upon reinoculation.
    "
    II. Concerning the other supposed fact, which has with
many persons created an unfavourable opinion of vaccine
inoculation   namely, the producing various disorders, even,
                 ;
of new kind, we must have longer experience to arrive at
    a
a determination.  The most experienced we are persuaded
will    accede to this proposal        — If,
                                  on some occasions, seem
                                   :
ingly new forms of eruptive disorders appear, let    be re         it
membered that they do so to accurate and extensive ob
servers, not only in persons who have, but in those who
have not had the           cow-pock.       However,     there    does   appear
probable evidence that certain slight eruptive complaints arc
the peculiar offspring of vaccination    but that the formi
                                                ;
dable diseases represented         by   some authors are the peculiar
effects   of   it,   we must demur either to allow, or disallow, for
want   of more experience. In the mean time we can safely
attest, that on the whole, much less frequently disorders su
pervene  to the cow-pock than to the small -pox inocula
tion. Yet       our duty to declare, that on good authority
                it   is
in the course of the eight years practice of vaccination, four
                                       S   2                                or

or five fatal       cases have          occurred from the affection             of the
part inoculated ; although at the institution, and in our pri
vate practice, we have had no such cases ; and that sore
arms much less frequently occur than from variolous inocu
lation is quite evident.
   "In         conclusion      :    We find in our experience, both private
and public, the vaccine affection a much less painful one
than the variolous inoculation, and in no instance * fatal —
that it is not propagated by mere contact, or effluvia — that
it is never epidemical — that it produces unsusceptibility of
the small-pox if well conducted, in perhaps 499 out of 500
cases — that by modes, hereafter                  to be explained, there is good
ground for believing that the practice may be so conducted
as to make the proportion of failures much less — that the
advantages are on many accounts so great as to amply com
pensate for the small sacrifice and trouble of a second ino
culation — but lastly, it ought to be constantly in view, that
the security against the small-pox cannot be absolutely ob
tained unless inoculation be re-instituted ; and hence, that
for the future it does not seem justifiable to neglect to pro
pose      the second       f   in every instance ; and it is
                                   inoculation
further our duty to propose  as             it,
                                  security for the past, also
                                                  a
to those who have been already vaccinated J."

 )  Although at this time the appearances or circumstances are unknown,
during the vaccine affection, which necessarily give security, and hence re-
inoculation must be provisionally resorted to yet,    reasonable to expect
                                                        ;    it   is
that hereafter the subject may be so far investigated as to determine the
question by one inoculation.
ffnte.—  has been urged, that the evidence in this paper, at most, only proves
          It
  that vaccination destroys the susceptibility of the small-pox fora limited
  time: and hence that the second inoculation only affords       proof of the
                                                                            a
  time for which that unsusceptibility subsists.  This may be, think, justlyI
  redargued.   1st. The failures afford only equivocal evidence of the alleged
  temporary unsusceptibility.    2d. Such   temporary state
                                                  a           against analogy.

  ceptibility.

               Original Vaccine Pock Institution.                2/7
   The following Resolutions         were   next read, and unani
mously agreed to be published :
   I. That it does appear, on adequate evidence, that persons
who have gone through the cow-pock, in the manner com
monly believed to give security, have in the proportion of
one in a thousand subsequently taken the small-pox, ac
cording to the experience of this institution        up to the pre
sent time.
   II.  That disorders which can      be at all reasonably imputed
to inoculation    have been   observed    less frequently after   the
vaccine than after the variolous inoculation.
   III.  That considering    the   slightuess of the cow-pock,
and that no fatal case has     occurred     in the practice of this
institution, vaccination is greatly preferable to variolation 5
and especially on account of its not being propagated in any
way but by inoculation,       it is infinitely    more valuable to
the public.
   IV. That it    be recommended to eve/y one who has been,
or shall be, vaccinated, to be re-inoculated with variolous or
vaccine matter.
   V. That     according to the experience of this institution,
the test  of the insertion of vaccine matter (which is perfectly
harmless) is to be relied upon equally with that of the va
riolous.
   VI. That     there are good reasons       for imputing   the  late
mortality by the small-pox      to its having been highly epide
mical last year, as well as to the influence by which some
writers, opposers of the cow-pock, were enabled to prevail
upon a great number of persons to be inoculated for the
small-pox ; thus multiplying the sources of variolous in
fection.
   Our   readers in general may at first    healitde surprised, and
thesanguine advocates of vaccination hemortifiedon perusing
the above declarations of an independent society; but after
considering the subject, it will appear, that still the cow-
pock inoculation possesses all the advantages ever proposed
by its most reasonable advocates, except that in a small pro-

portion of cases the inoculated persons are still liable to the
small-pox.   To guard against accidents in the course of
life,    re-inoculation         is recommended.The only question
now      is,   whether vaccine inoculation will be preferred to the
variolous subject to second insertion of variolous or vaccine
                            a
matter. At any rate, the institution has discharged its duty
in declaring the risque incurred of not testing subjects after
the cow-pock inoculation, so that no reproach can justly be
offered in the event of any vaccinated person in the course
of life being seized with the small-pox.

                RUSSIAN VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY.
Extract of     a Letter     from Captain Krusenstern to the Aca
   demician Sckubelt.         Dated Peter and St. Paul's Harbour,
   June    8, 1805.
 WE     have   now' happily terminated our voyage to Japan;
the day before yesterday I anchored here.                Upon the 7th of
September 1804, we sailed from Kamtschatka.                     The late
ness  of the   season     induced me         to  think of nothing else
than landing the ambassador           as soon as possible in Nanga-
sacki, and at last we descried          the coast of Japan.      A violent
storm drove us off the shore.        We regained it after its fury had
abated ; but as we were approaching the land we were again
assailed    by a furious whirlwind when close in with the
shore.     A  miracle alone saved our lives, which was a sud
den alteration    of  the wind.       I  sailed  through Van Diemen's
Straits,   because     they    are  so differently     laid down in the
English and French charts, both of which we found equally
faulty.     These Straits I caused to be laid down in our
charts with such accuracy that nothing more remains to be
done on that subject.          We measured at least 1000 angles.
We found five islands in Van Diemen's Straits; and it is
scarely credible how inaccurate all the charts of this part of
Japan    are.   Upon      the   8th  of December         we   anchored in
Nangasacki, whtre we remained until the 18th of April^
 1605. I enjoyed great repose for these seven months, and
did not misspend my time. To ascertain the longitude of
Nangasacki by the moon's distance was the first object of
myself and Dr. Horner. Each of us measured more than 50O
distances.     The situation of Nangasacki, which                has been
known for     these 2OO years, was ascertained             by us to be ex
actly 230° 8' west from Greenwich,              the latitude 32° 44'  50".
The months          of    October,       November,        and   December
were very agreeable;       the weather was      mild,   and never stormy.
With January       the winter commenced           : the thermometer fell
often to the freezing point; it snowed also at intervals, but
                                    S 4                               very

very slightly. The Japanese gave me.every assistance in pre
paring the new plan of the harbour of Nangasacki.                 Our
voyage from the entrance to the inner part of the harbour
 lasted three months, and we halted five different times in
the course     of our survey. These relaxations from our labours
were    of  great    use to us,   and  very pleasant.     Lieutenant
Lowenstern has made a valuable collection of drawings of
 all the vessels we saw in this harbour, with all their various
colours    and decorations, which every man          of rank   carries
according to his degree.         Baron Billingshausen has prepared
several models of Japanese boats, and a very correct drawing
of a Chinese junk. Counsellor Tilesius has made a rich
collection of beautiful drawings of birds, fishes, and marine
 productions, &c., and Dr. Langsdorf has stuffed and prepared
the most    of these birds, fishes, &c.
    I have already acquainted you from          Kamtschatka of my
plan, which is to produce a correct chart of the Great Ocean,
for which I have been collecting materials for these several
years. This idea was strengthened at Nangasacki, where I
liad both time and opportunity : I have it at present in con
templation to write a particular work upon the Great or
Pacific Ocean.         Upon my return to Europe, when I enjoy
more leisure, I shall proceed in that work.
    As soon as we received our dispatches from Jehdo, we
laboured night and day to get away. On the 17th of April,
the ambassador came on board; the Japanese towed us from
our anchorage out into the open sea, although there was
every presage      of  a  storm,  which indeed soon followed. I
weighed anchor on the         18th of April, and put to sea.      We
were    very fortunate in enjoying good weather during our
examination of the coasts of Japan.          As I was obliged to be.
in Kamtschatka         by the beginning of June, we could lay
down     but   a very few points in Japan.        The rocks which
surround     a  little  island near   Cape Patience were the last
part we saw of Sagalia : immense islands of ice drove us to
the south-east.        We then resolved to sail for Kamtschatka
without delay, in order to put ashore the ambassador, who
wished to travel towards St. Petersburg.         At  last I have  an

                      MINERALOGY        OF HANOVER.
    When the French government took                 possession  of Hano
ver,    M. Heron de Villefosse,         a celebrated   mineralogist, wa»
sent from Paris to the mines of Hartz in that electorate, for
the purpose of watching over the progress of these works,
and to protect them as much as possible from the accidents
of war.        The   success of his mission has surpassed the ex
pectations      of  his  government ; and he has transmitted to
the minister of the interior some very interesting detail*
upon the subject of these mines, accompanied with descrip
tions of the various processes in use, both in the mines be \
low ground, and in the forges and workshops after the ore
13 brought out.         Among the treatises transmitted by M. He
ron de Villefosse,        the most interesting are upon the melting
of    the minerals of lead and silver, a survey of the moun
tains and mines        of all Hartz,     and a very fine mineralogical
chart.       The   aspect    of  the   country is rugged and pictu
resque,      the air sharp, and the temperature extremely va
riable. The winters there are always long, and cold.                    No
grain of any kind is cultivated in that district l but it pro
duces a great number           of cattle.    The   people are robust and
healthy, and they are strongly attached to their native moun
tains.
    The population of this district was estimated in 1804 at
 22,282 inhabitants.           Claustbal is the name      of the principal
 town in the Hartz, and its population is 7,622.               The mines
 of lead, silver,    and copper are divided into three districts ; and
 the machinery by         which they     are wrought     is reported to be
 very curious.
    *  Before proceeding on his voyage, Captain Krusenstern caused all the
 water-casks intended for the supply of the crew to be charred in the inside,
 a precaution -which he found answer the purpose of preserving the water
 sweet during    the whole voyage; in the French journals, the merit of this
 discovery    of preserving water during long voyages, is ascribed to M.
 Berthollet.   This expedition lately returned to Europe, stopped for a few
 days at Portsmouth,    and then proceeded for Russia.

                          MUNGO PARK.
    We   are happy to state, that the accounts lately circulated
 of the death of this traveller are believed to be erroneous.
 No such account has reached government, nor have there
 been any late arrivals from that country by        which  the infor
 mation   could have been received.        It  is the opinion  of Sir
 Joseph Banks and other gentlemen personally acquainted
 with Mr. Park, and deeply interested in the success of his
mission, that it is the old report of the death of part of the
soldiers and carpenters     newly revived      and   greatly exagge
rated.
                         AEROSTATION.
   The misfortune which lately     befel   M. Mosment,      at Lisle,
has not put a stop to the rage for aerial exhibitions on the
Continent. In the months of May and June last, Dr. Jun-
gius, of Berlin, made several ascensions in the neighbour
hood of that city, with complete success.             He is the first
German aeronaut.
   Madame     Blanchard,    the wife   of    the aeronaut    of that
name, ascended from Bourdeaux in the beginning of May
last, and descended a few leagues from the place of ascen
sion, without any accident.      Her husband is at present in
volved in a dispute  with   his brother-aeronaut       Garnerin, on
the subject of the proper requisites of a balloon.         M. Blan
chard maintains, in contradiction to M. Garnerin, that bal
loons in the constructing or ornamenting of which any me
tallic body is made use of, run no more risk than any others
upon meeting with electrical meteors. M. Blanchard says,
that he has often passed through electrical clouds in gilt
balloons without meeting with any accident. — Much may
be said on both sides   of this argument.

   On Wednesday,       the 22d    of April, a very uncommon
phenomenon      was observed at   Arbroath, between the hours
of two and four   P.M. A bright halo      appeared round the sun
of   a very uncommon magnitude,          the diameter being      i4°;
also a large luminous circle parallel to the horizon, diameter
about 98°, its altitude equal that of the sun, Its centre
                                                               nearly

nearly in the zenith of Arbroath.     The periphery of this
circle passed directly through the centre of the sun : on the
eastern part of this circle two beautiful parhelia were di
stinctly visible,     as   also   two much more resplendent on the
western part.

 tions, will be taught practically.
     Gentlemen zealous in the pursuit of zoology will meet
 with uncommon opportunities             of prosecuting their re
 searches in comparative anatomy.
     Surgeons in the army and navy may be assisted in re
 newing their anatomical knowledge, and every possible at
  tention will be paid to their accommodation as well as in
  struction.
     Anatomical converzationes will be held weekly, when the
  different subjects treated of will be discussed familiarly, and
  the students' views forwarded. — To these none but pupils
  can be admitted.
     Spacious apartments, thoroughly ventilated, and replete
  with every convenience, will be open at five o'clock in the

  sors,) may have the pleasure of seeing them preserved, ar
  ranged, and registered, with the names of the donors.
     The iuconvenieucies usually attending anatomical investi
  gations, are counteracted by an antiseptic process, the result
 of experiments made by Mr. Brookes on human subjects at
 Paris, in the year 1782; the account of which was delivered
 to the Royal Society, and read on the 17th of June, 1784.
 This method      has since been so far improved,   that the florid
 colour   of  the muscles is preserved,   and even  heightened. —
 Pupils may be accommodated in the house. — Gentlemen
 established in practice, desirous of renewing their anatomical
 knowledge, may be accommodated with an apartment to
 dissect in privately.
    In the second      week   of September, Mr. Thelwall will

XLVI. Extract from M. KL A FROTH'S Memoir       upon the Sulphuric
        Acid.  Read at the Philomathic Society of Berlin.
 .L HIS memoir has for its object to determine the re
spective quantities of the elements of the sulphuric acid,
and of sulphate of barytes.       It details the analyses made
of these substances by the following different chemists.
   According to Lavoisier^ the sulphuric acid is formed of
0-69 of sulphur and 0-31 of oxygen.
   According to Berthollet, it is formed of 0-72 of sulphur
and 0-28 of oxygen.
   M. Thenard gives 55-56 of sulphur and 44-44 of oxygen,
as its component parts.
   According to Cnenevix, it is formed of 51 '50 of sul
phur and 38'50 of oxygen.
   According to Tromsdorff, it contains 70-00 of sulphur
and 30-00 of oxygen.
   According to Richter, it contains 42-05 of sulphur and
57-95  of oxygen.
   Finally, according to  M. Bucholz, it     is formed   of 42-05
of sulphur and   57-05  of oxygen.
   From the above results, it is evident that the two last
analyses, although made in a different manner from each
other, have the strongest resemblance, and consequently
are best entitled to confidence. /
   M. Klaproth, however, is of opinion that he ascertain
ed, by his own experiments, the respective quantities of
the elements of sulphuric acid, and which he made that
he might apply the results afterwards with more certainty
to the analyses of pyrites or metallic sulphurets.          In or
der to attain this object, he employed, like his prede
cessors, the nitric acid and carbonated barytes : the pro
portion of the elements of the latter he had previously
determined to be 78 of barytes and 22 of carbonic acid.
   But M. Bucholz has since asserted that there are in
this salt 79 of barytes and 21 of carbonic acid.        M. Klap
roth has therefore repeated the analysis with every pre
caution, and has again obtained the same results as before.
M. Bucholz also only admits of 25 of carbonic acid in
strontian, while M. Klaproth found 30 in all the analyses
he made of this substance.
   The results obtained by the analyses of sulphate of ba
rytes, as made by various chemists, are not less at variance.
   According to Fourcroy, it is composed of 66-00 of ba
rytes and 34-00 of sulphuric acid.
   Messrs. Clement and Desormes give 67 -82 of barytes
and 32-18 of sulphuric acid as its component parts.
  Vol. 25. No. 100. Sept. 1806. T                   M. Thenard

290                      Sulphuric Acld.
   M. Thenard     makes it to consist of 74'82 of barytes and
25-18   of sulphuric acid.
   M. Chenevix says it contains 76'50 of barytes and 23-50
of sulphuric acid.
   M. Kirwan gives 67'00 of barytes and 33-00 of sulphuric
acid  as its proportions.
   M. Richter    gives  69-00  of barytes and    31•00  of sul
phuric acid.
   And, finally,   M. Bucholz says it is composed of 67*00
of barytes and 33-00 of sulphuric acid.
   Thus we see that if we except the analyses of Messrs.
Chenevix and Thenard, all the rest have a great resem
blance to each other ; and if we take the medium, that
of Kirwan is the truest, which induced M. Klaproth to
adopt it.
   It is here necessary to explain the means employed by
M. Klaproth in his researches : he introduced into a re
tort 200 grains of pure sulphur, and eight ounces of pure
nitric acid, of the specific gravity of 1-320. He distilled
until about three fourths had passed into the receiver.
What came over was poured back into the retort, and
•was again distilled ; he afterwards added eight ounces of
acid, and distilled the whole.
   M. Klaproth found that the unburnt sulphur weighed
48 grains and a half; he therefore had 151 converted into
sulphuric acid.
   The produce diluted in a certain quantity of water was
mixed with muriate of burytes, until there was no longer
any precipitate produced in the liquor.        The sulphate of
barytes   well washed   and  dried weighed   1 109 grains, but
when calcined in a platina crucible, its weight was re
duced to 1082 grains.
   In order to ascertain the proportion of the constituent
principles of the concrete sulpnuric acid, M. Klaproth
took 100 grains of very strongly concentrated sulphuric
acid, of the specific gravity of 1-850 ; he diluted in in 15
parts of water, and poured in muriate of barytes until no
more precipitate was formed.        The sulphate of barytes
carefully washed and dried weighed 225 grains.           From
these facts it results,
   1st, That 100 parts of sulphuric acid of the specific gra
vity of 1-850, are composed of 74-04 of concrete acid and
25-06 of water ; or, ot 31-05 of sulphur, 42-09 of oxygen,
and 25-O6 of water.
   2d, That 100 parts of concrete acid are formed of
42-03 of sulphur and 5/•07 of oxygen.
   3d, That 100 parts of calcined sulphate of barytes con
tain of barytes 67-00, sulphur 14-00, and oxygen I9'OO.

   XIA II. Principles of the Science of Tuning Instruments with Fixed                                         Tones.
                      By CHARLES EARL STANHOPE.!
            SEVERAL          oi the first mathematicians,                  as well      as many         of the most
distinguished         musicians, have spent much time in endeavouring                               to discover the
best manner of tuning instruments with fixed tones ; but their efforts have not,
as yet, been attended with the desired success.
       When       I   began this inquiry,          I   had the curiosity to converse with sixteen or
eighteen of the most eminent musicians in England                                 upon this subject.            Half of
them did then approve of what is called THE EQUAL                                     TEMPERAMENT.                  This
terra will be explained          hereafter.            The other half, on the contrary, reprobated
that   mode of tuning,           as    never satisfying              the ear      perfectly    in       any one        key
whatsoever.
       A      science   is evidently       in a very imperfect state, when the first proficients
in that science          not only differ, but even                  hold   decided      opinions        diametrically
opposite        to each    other.      I       determined,         therefore, to make a careful and me
thodical investigation,         and        I    can now communicate               with particular         satisfaction
the result to the public.
       An ingenious and useful tuning instrument, called a monochord,                                         has   long
since been invented, by means of which the relation between the lengths of strings
or wires which produce different musical sounds can be accurately ascertained.
     When a string or wire of uniform thickness is reduced in length, it yields                                           a
sharper sound, provided             that the tension of the wire be not altered.
       If   a    string or wire of uniform                  thickness, stretched on a well constructed
monochord,            be reduced to one, half of its original                  length    ;   then, that one half
will yield the sound of that higher note which is scientifically termed the perfect
octave,     provided      that the tension of the wire be not altered.                            If,   for example,
the length of an uniform wire be thirty inches, and be so stretched as to yield
the same        sound as that note, for instance, which                      is   commonly termed the first
bass   C  ;     then, in order for that same wire, under the same tension, to give the
exact sound of the         C   next above, which              is   termed the middle         C,   the length of the
  f    This interesting treatise by EARL STANHOPE                    has been printed in Stereotype; and having
been favoured by his Lordship          with tin- me of the plates, we are enabled to lay                 it   before our
readers entire, and in Die shape in which              it   originally appeared.      This circumstance accounts
for the want of uniformity in the margins of our present Number                   ;   which, however,     is   more than
compensated by the accuracy of the tables, which might otherwise have been less perfect.                                 We
have farther to remark, that these pages have not been worked off at our common press.                                   Mr.
WILSON, of the Stereotype Office, Duke Street, Lincoln's                   Inn Fields, printed them for         us at the
iron press of the tecond construction, invented by EARL STANHOPE,                        and manufactured           by   Mr.
ROBERT WALKER, of Dean Street, Oxford Street.

wire must be reduced to fifteen inches.                                         The perfect             octave      is generally called
the octave,           for the sake of conciseness.
         If   the wire be reduced,                   not to one half, but to two thirds of its original
length, namely, in the supposed case, to twenty inches                                              ;    then, the sound produced
by those two thirds will be that sound which                                             is termed a perfect                        fifth, or      a
perfect quint.
         If   the wire be reduced to three fourths of its original length, namely, in
the supposed case,                    to twenty two inches and a half; those                                           three fourths will
yield the sound which is termed a perfect fourth.
      And if the wire be reduced to four fifths of its original length, namely, in
the supposed case,                 to twenty four inches                    ;    those four fifths will yield the sound
which is termed               third t-
                              a perfect
         In like manner, any pitch whatsoever within the compass of the monochord
may be obtained,                  by regulating the length of the wire to the exact degree that
is requisite for that purpose.
         Having        stated         precisely      what        I     mean by the expressions perfect                                     octave,
perfect quint, perfect fourth,                          and perfect third,                    I will      now shew that there                     is,
in    every musical instrument                       which           has    exactly twelve                 fixed         keys, or exactly
twelve        fixed      tones,        in   each      septave,             a    most curious               circumstance                  which    is
universal and unalterable.            In order clearly to explain what                                             I     allude to, let us
suppose       a     keyed instrument, the lowest key of which     C, to                             is               have exactly eight
Cs.       Let       us also suppose             that there be placed,                         in    the same room,                   a    second,
and also        a     third       instrument;         each        of which            is     similar to the former                       in   every
respect, except as to the method of tuning.
         Let   us suppose that the first instrument                                  be tuned            in   the following               manner.
Let      us begin        by   tuning the lowest              C       to any given pitch.                      Then let           us make all
the successive          octaves,           CC, CC, &c.                 quite perfect.                   We shall then have seven
successive        octaves,        which will bring us to the upper                             C    of this instrument.
         Now, let        us suppose that the second instrument be tuned as follows.                                                        Let   us
                                                   C by
begin, as       in    the former case,                    tuning the lowest                  C ;    and let us give                 it   precisely
the same pitch as the lowest                              of the first instrument.                         Then let             us make the
     t Thirds are divided into malor thirds and minor thirds.     malor third   composed of         A                          is
four intervala, (or four halftones, as they are commonly called,) and    minor third   com                         a                       is
posed of three.
      There     are    two species          of ma;or thirds;               namely,       perfect         thirds, and imperfect thirds.
And    the    imperfect       thirds are also of two species;                       viz. sharp thirds, and flat thirds.
      Example.         If,   in   a   tuning instrument which has two wires of equal thickness, the length
             of some          wire be 300, and                   the   length of the corresponding                             wire, under the
                                                                                                                         E E
                         C
                                                          C if
             same     tension, be 240       :   then,       E     will     be   a   perfect    thii-d.        If   the         wire be shorter,
             (such as 239,) then            C E    will    be     a    sharp     thinl   ;   that   is   to say, a third sharper                than
             the perfect third.  But,        wire be longer, (such as 241,) then
                                                if   the    E                           will be                                 C   E             a
        flat third; that    to say, a third flatter than the perfect third.
                                      is
    Tin' minor thirds are likewise of two species     namely, perfect minor thirds, and imperfect
                                                                           ;
minor thirds.   And the imperfect minor thirds are (in like manner as the imperfect malor
thirds) of two species             also;    viz. sharp minor thirds, and flat minor thirds.

interval between that C and the                               G    next above a perfect q*int.           And then, in
like manner, let           us tune all the following                      intervals by perfect quints, until we get
to C again.          We shall then have twelve perfect quints, in the following                                        order,
which will bring us to the upper C of this second instrument,                                     viz.
         C, G; — G, D; — D, A ; — A, E ; — E, B; — B, F sharp, which is the
same      key as G flat t; — G flat, D flat ; — D flat, A flat ; — A flat, E flat ; —
Eflat, B flat; — B               flat,    F; — F,             C.
         Now, let    us suppose that the pitch of the upper                             C in the first instrument be
carefully compared with the pitch of the upper C in the second instrument,                                                and
it will be found that those two                   Cs          are not in unison.         For, the upper C in the
second instrument, which was pitched by means                                    of the twelve perfect quints, will
be found to yield a more acute sound than the                                    upper C in the first instrument,
which was pitched by means of the seven perfect octaves.                                    Or, in other words,
the C twelfth quint in the second instrument will be sharper                                    than the          C   seventh
octave in the first instrument.
         The difference of pitch between those two high Cs will                                     be rendered            far
more perceptible to the ear, by transferring that difference to the lower octaves.
Therefore, let           us suppose that the third                        instrument be tuned in the following
manner,        viz. Let us begin by tuning the upper C in this third instrument to the
same pitch exactly as the C twelfth quint, or upper C, in the second instrument.
And then, beginning from the upper C in this third instrument, let us tune all
the other C s in it successive perfect octaves descending.
         Now, if we strike one of the Cs in this third instrument, about the middle
octave, or lower down, and if at the same time we strike the corresponding                                                  C
in the first instrument, then the C in the third instrument, which was derived
from the C twelfth quint in the second instrument, will yield a more acute sound
than the corresponding                   C in the first instrument which was derived from the
octaves.        A beating will            be heard             between them; and a kind of disagreeable
sound will be produced,                  not very unlike the howling, of a WOLF at                            a   distance.
Now, the difference of pitch,                      between            the C derived from the quints and lite
corresponding            C derived from                  the octaves,      is what is t.echnically called, by
timers,       THE        WOLF.
         Musicians        and tuners are in the habit of talking                            of THE       WOLF in          the
singular number.             I   shall, however, shew in the sequel                         that there are as many
as   FIVE WOLVES,                 in the quints and major thirds taken together, in all those
instruments which have exactly twelve fixed keys, or exactly twelve fixed tones,
in each       septave.      Now, in order to distinguish                        these   FIVE from each other, the
difference of pitch, between the C derived from the quints and the corresponding
C derived from the octaves, (which                                   by
                                           tuners, commonly termed THE WOLF,)

it   what I     shall call       THE QUINT WOLF.                                See the following    TABLE.

        By inspecting the above simple                     table,         it will clearly appear that the
following       series   of major thirds, viz. C,                 E ; — E, G         sharp, which is the same
key as A flat        ; — and A           flat, C, forms   a column,        in which those three successive
major thirds return in constant and regular succession, without                                     ever including
in that series any of the other nine major                            thirds.       So that, nature has, as it
were,     (if
            I     may be allowed              the expression,)          imprisoned          that series    of three
major thirds in          a   column by itself.
                                                    (     7       )

          The       series         of the three major thirds, G, B                             ;   — B, D            sharp, which is the
same key as                E    flat   ; — and E               flat, G, forms a second column.                                                   .    .   .
          The       series of the three major thirds,                    D, F sharp, which is the                                  same key as
G     flat   ;   —G           flat, B flat          ;   —   and B flat, D, forms a third column.
          And, in like manner, the                              series     of the remaining three major thirds,                                      A, C
sharp, which is the same key as D flat ;                                          — D         flat,      F; —        and F, A, forms                      a
fourth column.
          In      order to distinguish these four columns from each                                                   other,       I   shall name
them from the lowest key in each column respectively                                                     ;    thus, we shall have,
                 1st,          The C column, which                         consists       of C, E, and                A    flat.
                 2dly,         The G column, which                         consists      of G, B, and E flat.
                 3dly ,        The D           column,          which consists           of D, G flat, and B flat.
                 4tjily,       The A           column,          which consists of A, D flat, and F.
          Now, it              is a very curious fact, that each                           of these four columns of major
thirds has            its own distinct wolf,                                 exclusively of the                   quint wolf,                which,
as we have already seen,                                affects all the twelve keys without exception.
          If,    in     the   C    column, for example, the three successive                                      major thirds,             C,   E; —
E, G sharp, which                        is   the same key as              A   flat;     — and        A      flat,   C,   be all made quite
perfect;           then,         CC,          which       is   thus produced              by means                of those three perfect
thirds, will not be                 a    perfect octave, but                 it   will   be   flatter             than the perfect octave
C G       would be.                 The difference               of  pitch,       between          the       C   derived from the major
thirds and                 the            octave                                      to it,                 what         shall call             THE
                                                                                                   it is
                                   C                      corresponding                                           I
C     WOLFf.                  I    shall denominate                  it   thus, because                      belongs to the            C    column.
There will              be found an exactly similar                        wolf          in each of the other three columns.
These            fouu wolves                    may very properly                  be distinguished                  by the names of the
four columns to which they respectively belong                                            ;    thus, we shall have,

                                                                                                                     Quarters       Hundredths

                                       --....-...
    Then, the lengths of the same wire, under the same tension,
which would respectively yield the sounds                                  of the three successive
perfect ma;or thirds, would be as follows, viz.
      First       bass     E.                                                                                             96
      First bass G sharp, which                     is   the same key as the first bass               A flat.             76           80
      The middle               C   which       is   thus derived from the ma;or thirds.                                   6i           44
      (Those numbers are found by taking four fifths successively.                                            )
      Now, the length of that wire which would yield the sound of
the   true middle             C; namely,            the sound     of the perfect octave above
the first bass           C,    would be only                                                                               6o
      Consequently,                the    difference        between      those two  last mentioned
lengths      shews       the value of the corresponding                      C    WOLF. -                                 l            44
                                                                       (     &    )

         And those FOUR,                    together with             THE QUINT WOLF,                            make the FIVE
WOLVES which                  I    have mentioned above.                      And it         was from my having observed
these     FIVE DISTINCT                     WOLVES             that   I   was led to find out that superior mode
of tuning keyed instruments which I am now going to describe.
     If, in any musical instrument which has exactly twelve fixed keys or twelve
Fixed     tones        in each septave, the octaves                             be tuned perfect;               then, the quints
cannot all be tuned perfect,                           as the        TABLE         OF OCTAVES AND OF QUINTS,
in page 6, clearly shews.                       And      if,    in    any such instrument, the quints be tuned
perfect   ;    then, the octaves cannot be tuned perfect.
         Now, such            is   the construction of the human ear, that we can bear to hear
a much greater deviation from perfection in the quints than we can bear to hear
in the octaves.               And we can bear               a   still greater               deviation from perfection              in   the
major thirds than we can bear either                                 in   the octaves or           in   the quints.         Musicians
and tuners have therefore agreed not to tune all the quints perfect, as that would
make the octaves intolerable.
         Some tuners, however,                    in    order to assist the quints, have very improperly
proposed to tune the octaves                       a    little imperfect.                    The objections to this method
are obvious.                For,   if   we sharpen the octaves                     to assist the quints,              it   injures the
thirds   ;   and       if   we flatten the octaves               to assist the thirds,              it   injures the quints.
        Besides, however small the deviation from perfection                                               may be in          a   single
octave,      it   will become very sensible    two or three   and, in
                                                                 in                            ;                the   extent of six
or seven octaves,         such deviation will become very offensive.
                                        a
        It   is   necessary, therefore,                    that all the octaves                    should be tuned perfect.
Now, from what                     has been already              said,       it   is   evident that this object can be
obtained          in   one way only          ;   and that             is,   by tuning some one, or more, of the
twelve quints above mentioned                          flatter        than perfect.
        In order for all the                 octaves           to be tuned perfect,                  it   is   likewise necessary
that some          one, or more, of the three successive                                     major thirds, in each                of the
four natural columns above mentioned,                                       must be tuned sharper                     than perfect.
As for example, in the                   C    column,           some        one, or more, of the three successive
major thirds, viz.                 C,E  ;   —    E,    G    sharp, which               is   the same key        as     flat
                                                                                                                     C A    ;   — and
A   flat, C, must be tuned sharper                             than perfect            ;     for, otherwise,         C,       which      is
produced           by   means of those three successive                            major thirds, could not be (as                        it
ought to be)            a    perfect octave        ;       because          three successive             perfect thirds do not
make up        a       perfect octave.           Therefore,               in tuning any musical instrument which
has exactly twelve fixed keys                     or twelve fixed tones in                      each septave,         the problem
does, of necessity,                 resolve itself into this; namely, to ascertain which one, or
more, of the three successive                     major thirds, in each of the above mentioned four
natural columns respectively, ought to be tuned sharper than perfect, and                                                      in   what
proportion         each       is   to be so tuned          ;    and also, which one, or more, of the twelve
successive        quints ought to be tuned                     flatter       than perfect, and             in   what proportion.
        What   I        have just stated           will enable the reader easily to understand what
musical      TEMPERAMENT                         is.   This term signifies the precise adjustment                                       of
                                                               (      9     )

the relative pitch of all the keys or fixed tones of any musical instrument, so as
to distribute the four wolves which are in the major thirds, and likewise the
quint wolf, according to              some given systematic                 proportions.            And the         obiect
of temperament                      is to adjust the relative pitch                       of all the keys           or fixed
tones    in such       a due       proportion       as to render the instrument                      harmonious            and
melodious in the highest degree possible.                          This      is an object           of very great con
sequence       to the musical world.            For,     the finest keyed                 instrument,        even    if it be
played upon in the most capital manner, loses, either when out of tune, or when
tuned according to an improper    temperament, the power of producing those
delightful      and exquisite sensations              which        the very same                instrument          becomes
capable of producing when it is tuned scientifically and correctly.
        There are        a great number of different modes of     temperament, which
may be classed as follows, viz. the                 equal temperament, and the unequal
temperaments.
        That  of temperament in which the quint wolf is distributed in an equal
                mode
proportion amongst all the twelve quints of an instrument is that which is called
THE EQUAL TEMPERAMENT. And every other mode of temperament,
without exception, is called an                 UNEQUAL TEMPERAMENT.
        In that mode of tuning which             is called the equal temperament, all
the twelve quints are made imperfect                      ;    for, every one of them is tuned                         flatter
than perfect.            But, in my mode of tuning, for example, which is one of the
UNEQUAL           temperaments,                 there are,             as   will be explained in the sequel,
seven quints quite perfect,             and five quints            flatter        than perfect.
        The     consequence         of an equal distribution                 of the        quint wolf,              in    the
equal temperament,                        is,   that the           C    wolf         will become, of necessity,
equally distributed amongst the three major thirds                                   in   the   C   column    ;     and that
the G, D, and            A   wolves will            become equally distributed                      amongst the three
major thirds in the G, D, and                   A   columns respectively.
        The equal temperament                            is,   however,         a   mode of tuning which             I    very
much disapprove.               According        to that erroneous system,                       there   is   not    a    single
perfect third, nor        a    single perfect fourth, nor               a   single perfect quint, in the whole
instrument.        That charming and delightful harmony and melody which                                           a   proper
mode of tuning enables fine players to produce,                              is     thus rendered,       in    every case,
impossible.        All    those     chords, which nature has rendered perfect, are,                                    by this
objectionable contrivance,              rendered imperfect.                  And      in   those instruments where
chords are made to sound for                    a   considerable lime, such                  for instance         as organs,
the imperfection          of    the equal temperament                                 is    most striking.             Perfect
chords are pleasing to the ear, they strike to the heart, and they are founded                                               in
the very nature of musical sounds.                     But, by that mode of tuning which                            is   called
THE      equal temperament,                         all those regular                coincidencies       of those duly
proportioned        vibrations which produce true concords are destroyed, and every
thing    is   discord.       Let    us take     a   quint, as an example explanatory of this fact.
We      have already seen,           that, when the wire in                 a   well constructed monochord                   b
                                                     (        10   )

reduced to two thirds of its length, the sound produced                                        by the two thirds will
be that of a perfect quint.                        Now, the number of vibrations of a wire of uniform
thickness, which has any given degree of tension, will be inversely as the length
of the wire.           That     is to say,             that a wire, for example, of thirty inches long, will
vibrate twice, during the time that an equal wire, of twenty inches long, under
the same tension, will vibrate three times.                               If the longer wire be         tuned to C, the
shorter wire will be the                  G            perfect quint.      It follows from this,           that the third,
sixth,    and ninth        vibrations,                  &c. of the G wire          so tuned,    will respectively keep
pace with the second,                    fourth,           and sixth vibrations,         &c. of     the C wire above
mentioned.             And it    is from that very circumstance                       that concords are produced.
But, let us suppose, that the length of the                                   G   wire, instead of being precisely
two thirds of the length of the C wire, be either something more, or something
less ;    then, the third, sixth,                        and ninth vibrations,         &c. of the G wire, will no
longer respectively keep pace with the second, fourth,                                    and sixth vibrations,             &c.
of the C wire.             Therefore,                  instead of concords,          discords will be heard.               For,
true concords can only be obtained by means of exact geometrical                                              proportions
between the vibrations                   produced.                    There        are various classes        of discords.
Some of them are offensive                         ;    others are not.       t Some   of them are characteristic                ;
others are not so.                  How to limit the extent of the discordancies, and how to
distribute        the non-offensive                    discords in such a manner that the various keys,
instead of being injured,                  shall on the contrary be improved,                         will be very fully
explained hereafter.                    But, to have, in any instrument, nothing but discords, is
abominable         ;   and that is always and necessarily the case, whenever that mode of
tuning which is denominated                             the equal temperament                         is adopted.
         By the     scheme       of     equal temperament,                            not only every third is sharp,
but is equally sharp            ;    every         fourth is sharp, and is also equally sharp                 ;    and every
quint is flat, and is equally flat.                        Therefore,     not only every major key is rendered
imperfect, but is rendered similarly and equally imperfect.                                    This of course destroys
the difference of character which                              ought to exist, in a well tuned instrument,
between the different major keys.                               And the minor           keys   are liable to the same
defect, for a similar reason.                            Thus it   is that        dull monotony        is substituted          for
pleasing and orderly variety.                            And modulation            from key to key loses,            in great
measure, the very object of modulation,                               which is to relieve the car, and to cause
us to return to the original key with an increased pleasure, which arises from the
systematic variety of the different keys through which we have successively passed.
         Some tuners, who prefer an                         unequal temperament,                       throw the whole
of the    quint wolf                    into the key of           E   flat.       Others, divide it between the two
keys of       A   flat, and         D   flat   ;       or between some            other two keys.          Those persons
generally say, that they throw                             the wolf           (as they inaccurately         call    it)   into   a
single key, or into two keys, according                                 to their respective method of tuning.
The absurdity of this assertion must now be apparent to the reader.                                                For,    since
there    is   not only        in    the quints            a   quint wolf,             but there are likewise              in   the
major thirds           four distinct wolves,                            each of which four       is   by   nature confined
                                                              (    n     )

 to i/.v own peculiar and unalterable               column; it       is obvious that the        D WOLF, for
 instance, cannot ever be taken from its own column,                         to be carried,       either to the
 key of    E  flat, in the        G   column  ; or to the key of A flat, in the C column                 ;  or to
 the key of D flat, in the A column.                   Such temperaments are, therefore, unsatis
 factory in theory.             They are also defective in practice             ; for, they render some
 keys too bad to modulate into them without offending the ear extremely.
        In my new method, there                 are   none of those defects.            Every       key in my
 TEMPERAMENT                is  made pleasing, and fit for transposition and modulation,                     and
has also a       peculiar character           which belongs to it.             Some keys are fitted for
chearful music        ;  some, for grave.         Some, for martial        ;  some, for pastoral.          Some,
for soft or melodious pieces ; and some, for those which are solemn, plaintive, or
majestic.       How is it possible that the same key, or twelve keys of exactly the
same character,           should be capable of giving to compositions of directly opposite
characters, that effect which is the best suited to each composition respectively f
        In order to introduce the greatest degree of variety which                        is consistent with
proper harmony and with proper                     melody,      it is evident that some one key, at
least,    should    be     made as perfect         as possible.        If  so, the key of C, which so
frequently recurs, ought to be that key.                     It   is besides the only key which              has
neither flats nor sharps in the common construction                        of keyed instruments.
        I, therefore, make the key of C, with a perfect third,                      C,  E;     with a perfect
fourth,    C, F;     and with a perfect quint,            C, G.           In tuning,    I  proceed thus.
        First.     I  begin by pitching the first bass C, to my tuning-fork,                      tuning-glass,
or monochord.            I  consider the first bass C as the key-note.              I then make the next
C above, which is called the middle C, a perfect octave from the first bass C.
        Or, I pitch the middle C, to my tuning-fork, tuning-glass, or monochord ;
and I then pitch the first bass C, as a perfect octave next below.                                  It is of no
consequence which of those                 two equivalent methods be used to obtain the pitch
of those two Cs.               But,    in order to tune the other keys of the instrument,                       I
prefer starting from the first bass C, as the key-note                    ;  instead of starting from the
middle C     ; because         the beatings are more perceptible               to the ear, in the former
case,    than they would be in the latter.                        The reader will do well to turn to
the TUNING            TABLE,         in page 15, and to follow             it in reading tini         pages   12,
 13,   and   u.
        Secondly.         From the first      bass  C,    I make C,       G,   a perfect quint.
        Thirdly.         From the first      bass  C,   I  make C, E,       a perfect  third.      And I then
tune the two octave               Es   next above.
        Fourthly.          From E, I make E, B,             a perfect quint ; and          I   prove B, from
G,    as a perfect third.
        Fifthly.        From the middle C,          I  tune C,      F,  upwards,     a perfect fourth ;        or
(what is equivalent)            I  tune F, C, downwards,            a perfect quint.         I  then tune the
F   next above, a perfect octave.
        Sixthly.        The pitch of F being determined, I tune F, B flat, "upwards,                            a
perfect fourth      ;   or (what is equivalent) B flat, F, downwards, a perfect quint.

          Seventhly.                 I   then pitch         A     flat, exactly half way between                            £   and the C next
above.             If       a monochord            be used for this purpose,                           the length of the wire                      A    flat
must be made a geometrical mean proportional between the length of the wire                                                                               E
and the length of the wire C next above.                                                The two sharp thirds produced by
this method are peculiarly suited to solemn and to plaintive music.                                             The effect
was remarkably                  striking,         in a comparative experiment which                                     I   shall relate in the
sequel.            I    was so struck with the peculiar excellency of sharp thirds of this exact
value for musical compositions whicli are either plaintive or majestic, that                                                                   I   Kave,

name.       from If,               any perfect octave,                  we then

divide the remaining interval into two thirds equally sharp; each     those two                                                      of

simply        by       the ear, its pitch may be ascertained with great precision,                                                   if   the tuner
pay exact attention to the equality of the beatings of the two successive                                                                          major

to the beatings, as that                         is    by   far the most accurate way of tuning                                       by   the ear.
For, whenever either                        a    third,     a     fourth,       a   quint,         or an octave              is   quite perfect,
there        is,   in such case, no beating to be heard.                                         But, on the contrary,                    whenever
either of them                is   in    any degree imperfect,                      but     is   not too distant from perfection,
a    beating           is   always audible.                       A    very slow beating proves that the deviation
from perfection                is    not great.             A     quicker       beating shews that the deviation from
perfection             is    more considerable.                    And, from the equality of the beatings, equal
deviations from perfection may be correctly ascertained.
          Eighthly.                The pitch of             A     flat being now determined,                           I    next pitch         A       flat,
£    flat, upwards,             a        perfect quint        ;   or  I    tune     £      flat,      A   flat, downwards,                a    perfect
fourth.          £      flat will then be exactly half way between                                        B   and the        G     next above.
          Ninthly.             The pitch of            A      flat being determined, as explained above                                    I
                                                                                                                                           ;        tune
A    flat,    D        flat, upwards,            a    perfect fourth        ;       or  I      tune     D     flat,    A    flat, downwards,
a    perfect quint.            I         then tune the            D    flat next above,                a   perfect octave.
        Tenfhly.               The pitch of            D      flat being determined,                      I   tune      D    flat,   G     flat, up
wards,       a     perfect fourth           ;    or   I     tune    G    flat, D flat, downwards,                           a   perfect quint.
        Thus,      I        have already got seven quints quite                             perfect; viz. 1. C, G; 2.                              E,   B;
3.   F,   C  ;     4.   B    flat,   F;     5.   A    flat,   E    flat;    6.   D      flat,   flat;
                                                                                                 A      G flat, D flat.
                                                                                                                  7-
             have likewise got two quints very nearly perfect,                                                     but      a     little flat, viz.
      B, I
1.        F   sharp, which                 is   the same key as             G       flat   ;     2.   E   flat,   B     flat.
        Each            of those two quints differs from                                a      perfect quint,               only ONE           in      two
thousand           six hundred and                     fifty      seven    parts and               a   half       nearly    ;     or only about
1.128.831 parts in 3.000.000.000.                                      See the value of those two quints, in page 23.
       It    is
             a          fact very worthy of notice, that,                               in     each of those two last mentioned
quints, two distinct beatings are to be heard at the same time.                                                                 The one        is   very
                                                                   (       13       )

slow, and the other is considerably quicker.                     Now,      as each of those two quints
does, as proved by the raonochord,                   approach so very nearly to perfection               ;  it is
evident, that it is the slower beating which is the proper beating to be attended
to in the case of each of those two quints which are so very nearly perfect.
        I  have a scientific way of determining                the three remaining quints that are
also flat, which       I  shall now explain.          They are, 1.        G, D  ;  2.   D, A   ;  3.  A, £.
        We have already          seen that the pitch of        G   has been determined,          as a   perfect
quint from the first bass C.              The pitch of         £   has likewise been determined,               as
a perfect third from that same C.               The £ first       octave    above from that £, and the
£   second octave above from that same £, are of course determined likewise.
        Elerenthly and twetfthly.             It   is now requisite        so to pitch the       D, and the
A,   between the         G  perfect quint from C, and the                E  second octave from that            E
which is the perfect third from C, in such a manner, that the interval                            G, E,     may
be divided        into three equally flat quints,            G, D ; D, A        ;  and A, E.          None of
those three quints are of such a degree of flatness as to be offensive to the ear ;
for, each of those three quints differs from a perfect quint,                          only ONE in three
hundred and sixty           one   parts and    a   half    nearly   ;   or only about 8.298.850 parts
in 3.000.000.000.            See the value of those            three quints, in page 23.                    If  a
monochord         be used to determine the pitch of               D, and of A       ;  then, the length of
the wire D, and the length of the wire A, must be made two geometrical                                     mean
proportionals, between the length of the wire                      G,     and the length of the wire E.
But, if a monochord           be not used for this purpose, and if the tuner determine the
pitch of D, and of A, by the ear                ;    it may be done with great accuracy, if he
attend properly to the equality of the beatings of the three successive                            flat quints,
G, D ; D, A ;         and A, E.       That   fact has been ascertained by repeated trials.
        If  the interval    G, E,    be (as in Kirnberger's            method of tuning) divided            into
one perfect quint, and two equally flat quints                  ;   such, for instance, as the perfect
 quiii!   G, D,     and two equally flat quints, D, A, and A,                   £ ;   then, each of those
two flat quints, by becoming too flat, is offensive to the ear.                          I have     made that
experiment with care           ;  and the result was what             I  have just mentioned.           And if
 the same interval        G, E,    be divided      into two perfect quints, and one flat quint                   ;
 then, the flat quint, so produced,               is still more       offensive.      This  was    fully to be
expected.
        I  shall now give a definition         of those three equal and non-offensive quints
 which result from the scientific division of the interval                      G, E,     aboVe     explained,
in order clearly to distinguish            it from the two exceptionable                  divisions just de
scribed.       That    is to say ;   if the  interval       between      the perfect quint from a key
note, and the second perfect octave                 above    the perfect      third from the sane key
note,     be  divided into three equally        flat quints; each of those three equal quints
 is that which       I  sMl call TRT-EQUAL QUINT. And the inverse fourth
                                     a
of any tri-equal quint is that which                 I  shall call a TRI -EQUAL FOURTH.

          After      I   have      tuned,      in the    manner        above particularly         specified,    those
  septaves        which are about the middle                   of the instrument;         I    then tune all the
  octaves     perfect, both in the upper                and in the lower septaves.               If it be a piano
  forte, or any other instrument which has two or more strings to each key                                   ;  then,
  great attention should be paid to the tuning of those unisons perfect.
          When the instrument is tuned, according to the rules above mentioned                                   ; the
  octaves      should      be tried        as   follows.      Strike     four  Cs   at once all through            the
 instrument.            Then four Ds, &c. successively. Try the short keys all through
 the instrument, in like manner.                       And if the instrument will not stand this test,
 we may be quite certain that it is not in tune.
         It will     not be necessary for me to go regularly through the twelve fourths                               ;
 as they always          follow their corresponding quints. Thus, a perfect quint, such as
 the perfect quint, for example, from B flat, namely, B flat, F, will give, for the
 inverse key F, a perfect fourth, viz. F, B flat next above.                                 And a flat quint,
 such as the flat quint from D, viz. D, A, will give, for the inverse key A, a sharp
fourth,        namely,        A, D       next above.      And the degree of           sharpness       of the sharp
 fourth will always, of necessity,                  correspond with the degree of flatness of the flat
 quint, wherever a flat quint occurs.                       My     mode of tuning does not produce                   a
 single offensive quint             ;   neither does it produce a single offensive fourth.
         Having accurately explained how the NEW                            TEMPERAMENT              which    I  have
 discovered regulates the twelve quints, and also the twelve fourths                                  ; I will    now
 shew, in what manner it affects the twelve thirds.                           But, before    I  can make myself
 clearly understood upon this interesting and curious part of the subject,                                    I must
 first state      a few things, by way of preliminary                    observations.
         I   have     established the following               facts,    from   experiments        made with the
greatest attention,             by means of a very excellent monochord,                     and also by means
 of a grand piano-forte,                 built by one of the best piano-forte makers in England.
         I  divided the perfect octave C C, between the first bass C and the middle
 C, into three          successive       thirds, in the three following ways, viz.
         First.        I divided that perfect octave C C, into two perfect thirds,                         namely,
C,     E;    and E, G sharp, which is the same                         key as A flat   ;   and into one third
sharper than           a  perfect third,        namely,    A   flat, C next above.          This sharper third,
so produced,            was, as       I  expected, very offensive.
         Secondly.           I  divided that same          perfect octave       CC,   into one perfect third,
C,     E;   and into two equally sharp thirds, viz. E,                      G  sharp, which is the same key
as     A  flat  ;   and    A    flat, C next above.             The length of the wire A flat, in the
monochord,            was made a geometrical               mean      proportional between the length of
the wire E, and the length of the wire C next above.                                     This last mentioned
division of the octave C C is excellent                     ;   for, the two sharp thirds thus produced
were bi-equal thirds, as was particularly                        explained above.         See page 13.
     .   Thirdly.          I   then divided         the same      perfect octave     CC,       into three thirds,
all equally          sharper        than perfect.         This equal division was effected, by tlie
wires E, and           A  flat, in the monochord,              having been made fuio geometrical                mean
                                                        (     16     )

proportionals between                              the length of the wire                         C, and          the       length of the wire C
next above.                      Those three equally sharp thirds, of this last mentioned value, are
the very same as the sharp thirds which result from that mode of tuning which
is commonly                     termed           the equal temperament.                                                Not        one      of those three
equally sharp thirds has either of those two striking characters winch are to be
found in an instrument that is tuned hi the most advantageous manner.                                                                                 For,
not one of those three equally sharp thirds                                                       has     either the beauty of a third
which           is perfect,               nor the peculiar                    and solemn                character of that other third
which           I   have already denominated a bi-equal                                       third.            This        is,    therefore, another
inherent                defect belonging to that method which                                             is   called            the equal tem
perament                     ;     inasmuch as that defect necessarily extends to all the twelve keys,
in that ill contrived mode of tuning.
       I        can now explain to the reader                                 in   what manner the                     new temperament
                                                                       the twelve thirds,
                                                                                                            in
which       I        have        discovered affects                                                         a          keyed instrument which
has exactly twelve                      t   keys in each septave.
            Two of               those      twelve thirds are quite perfect.                                     Those            two are, 1.        C,   E;
2.    G,        B.
            Six of the remaining ten thirds are sharper than perfect                                                         ;        and each of them
is    of the exact value of                        a     bi-equal third.                    Those six are,                 1.     E,    G    sharp, which
is    the same key as                       A     flat   ;    2.    A   flat,    C ;    3.    B,    D sharp, which                      is   the same key
as   E      flat    ;    4.   E     flat,    G    ;    5.    G      flat,    B   flat   ;    6.   D flat, F.
            The remaining four thirds                                are likewise sharp, but less so than the preceding
six   ;     and each of thein                      is,   in   respect to sharpness,                     intermediate between the other
two       classes above specified                        ;     namely, intermediate between                                 a     perfect third and        a
bi-equal third.                       See page 23.
            Of those four last mentioned sharp thirds, two are nearer to                                                                a    bi-equal third
than to          perfect third.
                    a           Those two are, 1. A,      sharp, which                              C                                   is   the same key
as    D     flat; 2.           B      flat, D.           See page 23.
      t     The         usual      number of twelve keys seems                          to be pointed out to us from the                             natural
number of twelve musical                          intervals.                There are three reasons                for considering that division
of    the    septave          as   a    natural one.
       First.           If    we start from any key, (such, for example, as from C,) then, twelve quints,
duly tempered according                          to my natural and scientific                      temperament                    explained above, will
bring us again to                  a      key of the same denomination.                           Therefore, the number of trcelve succes
sive quints naturally leads to the number of twelve keys of twelve distinct denominations.
       Secondly.              There are four natural sets or columns of ma;or thirds, and each of those four
sets respectively contains three                              series    of ma;or thirds, as was fully                            explained above.         See
pages       7   and      8.  This makes up the same number of                                      twelve      keys.
       Thirdly.           The like number of twelve keys found                     is              also     in the following manner; namely,
by considering                the three          natural sets or columns of minor thirds                         i     for, each of those three sets
respectively contains four series of minor thirds, making likewise twelve keys in all, viz.
                     First     set.         1.    C,   E     flat           E flat,G flat 3. G flat,                                   A, C.
                                                                                                                       B, B ;A
                                                                ;      2.                     ;                                   4.
                     Second        set.     1.    D flat,      E;      2.    E, G;  3. G, Bflat; 4.                          flat,     D   flat.               «

        And, of the four intermediate sharp thirds above mentioned,                the remaining
  two are nearer to a perfect third than to a bi-equal.               Those two last mentioned
 thirds    are,  1.  D, F sharp, which      is the same    key as       G flat;  2.  F, A.       See
 page 23.
        The reader will therefore perceive, that, in my TEMPERAMENT, the most
 easy keys have, for thirds of the key,        those thirds which are the most perfect.
        The two thirds of the key which are quite perfect are in the following keys,
 viz.
                       C major, which    is without either flat       or sharp ;
                       G  major,  which has only one sharp.
        The two sharper thirds of the key which are the nearest being perfect are
 in the following keys, viz.
                       D major, which    has   only two sharps      ;
                       F major, which has only one flat.
        The two still sharper thirds        of the key which          come next in respect to
 sharpness axe in the following      keys, viz.
                       A major, which has three sharps        ;
                       B flat major,  which has two flats.
        And those six sharpest thirds of the key, each of which I term                   a bi -equal
 third, are in the following keys, viz.
                       E major,   which has four sharps     ;
                       6 major, which has five sharps     ;
                       £ flat major,  which has three flats       ,
                       A flat major, which has four flats       ;
                       D flat major,   which has five flats    ;
                       G  flat major t, which has six flats.
                                                                                   i  *,
        As there    is not, in my    TEMPERAMENT,          any third, any fourth, or any
quint,    less perfect than those specified      above and in the following          TABLES      ; it
is evident tlr.it this new mode of tuning must be excellent for transposition,                  and
for modulation.        This fact  has been established    by regular and repeated experi
ments, made in presence of many of the best judges.                  Between sixty and seventy
of the very first professional persons, of both sexes, and of the ablest connoisseurs
in England,      have given to this NEW        TEMPERAMENT their              decided approba
tion.     It answers well,    both in the major and in the minor keys.
      t Some authors call the key of G flat malor, the key of F sharp malor with six sharps.
But it is   more systematic and methodical, to consider (as Dussek does) the five short keya
as flat keys in the malor mode.
                                           (    13   )

        There are             some        few facts,      in particular,         which throw such light upon                      1he
science of music,               that        I    think    it proper        to mention them.                   On an excellent
piano-forte,            tuned        in     my manner,           that       favourite          Portuguese          hymn,     called
Adeste Fideles,               which is commonly printed in A major, was played successively
in that key, in the key of                           A    flat major,          in C major,            and in      D   flat major.
The following             was the result of this comparison.
        First, the piece was the most characteristic and sublime in the key of                                               A   flat.   '
It was better in that key                       even than in the original            key of A.
        Secondly, the hymn was comparatively intolerable in the key of C                                              ;   although,
according          to my        TEMPERAMENT,                     the key of C is tuned perfect;                           having a
perfect third,           a perfect fourth,               and likewise a perfect quint.
        Thirdly,          the piece was better even                     in the key of                D   flat than in the key
of C    ;       although the pitch of the key of D flat (being higher up) is less suited
to the character of that solemn composition than the pitch of the key of C.
        That       is to say,        in other words, that the intermediate key of C, although it
be tuned perfect,                is less         proper for that piece of music than either D flat or
A   flat    ;   one of which has a higher,                    and the other a lower pitch.                         And this fact
is the more remarkable,                         on account of the following                        illustrative    circumstance.
Each of those three major keys, namely,                                    D    flat, C, and          A    flat, has, according
to my       TEMPERAMENT,                        a perfect fourth,          and a perfect quint.                Therefore, it        is
evident that the difference in the effect produced                                       could result neither from the
respective fourths,              nor from the respective quints.
        Consequently,              the striking difference between those three keys, which every
person with a good ear must feel,                             results principally              from the thirds, and from
the sixths, in each key respectively.                            And       those    two keys, namely,                 D flat, and
A   flat, where the             third in           each    is imperfect,           and is of the exact value of                     a
bi-egual third, are beyond comparison                              better suited to the solemn character of
the hymn than the key of C, where the third                                        is,   on the contrary,             tuned quite
perfect.
        We       have been in the habit                   of considering what                 is   commonly termed            THE
WOLF            as an inherent imperfection                   in every instrument which has exactly twelve
fixed keys         in   each septave.               Whereas,      the very remarkable fact just mentioned,
and several others of                     a     like kind,    most clearly prove,                   that, so far from THE
FIVE        WOLVES            being imperfections,               it   is   precisely the proper                   distribution     of
those       WOLVES            which        produces          that charming           and essential            VARIETY OF
CHARACTER,                    between the different keys, which                          is   one     of the chief requisites
      well tuned instrument.

of the principles              which            are to be found            in   nature are            by   us very frequently
unobserved.              But tlie more thoroughly we learn to understand them, the more

XLVIII.      Observations      upon   Alicant Wine, and particularly
      the Alicant Raisin Wine. By M. Pissis, M. D.*
XAHCANT wine, one of the most precious cordials in phar
macy, has the agreeable colour of red wine added to the
mildness of a wine made of must, and it is generally allowed
that it has been prepared in this manner.                It is evident that
the must which produced it had been coloured before fer
mentation.       The only raisin yet known to furnish this kind
of must is called the Plant of Alicant; in our country it is
known by the name of teinturier, or tachant. It is bitter,
and ripens badly in the centre part of France ; but the
further we advance to the southward the better are the wines
it produces, and the more do they resemble the wines of
Spain.     I have no hesitation in saying, that with the culti
vation and treatment resorted to at Alicant, we may be able
to imitate the Spanish wines in the south maritime districts
of France.
    The colouring       matter of the Alicant raisin is the same
.i* that  of  the    red fruits and common red wines ; it has the
singular property of becoming red by the acids : although
blue by nature, it becomes green with the alkalis, and the
colour is destroyed by the strong oxygenating substances ;
but in the common          raisin this colouring matter is not dis
solved except by alcohol, when the must has fermented :
while in the teinturier, and the most of the red fruits, it is
diluted in their juice.        Is the nature of this matter changed
in these different fruits, or is it always the same? and is it
not, except by means of intermediate substances, resinous
or extractive, that this principle is dissolved equally well by
the aqueous juices as by alcohol ?              Several experiments in
cline me towards the latter opinion : besides, it is more con
 formable to the simple and constant progress of nature ; it
ie also that   of M. Chaptal,        who, in his Essay upon Wines,
refers the colouring principle         of red wine to the fecula.
    My object     is not to expatiate      more upon this principle ; I
have already described        it fully  in a letter written to M. Chap-:

 tal, when minister      of   the interior,   who honoured me with
 a   most flattering approbation of its contents.              That letter
 contains     the theory of the deleterious effects of wines and
 casks, with the most efficacious method of preventing in
juries, founded upon authentic experiments collected during
 these    four years.     Circumstances have occurred to hinder
 me from printing this work ; but I think it useful to com
 municate       one of the facts which by chance occurred, and
 which appeared extremely worthy of attention, by its im
 portance to the healing art.
     Last year I attended a patient, to whom I frequently ad
 ministered Alicant wine, which I was perfectly certain was
 genuine,      and it was twenty years old.          The patient vomited
 frequently,      and  violet-coloured     pellicles were seen floating
 upon the matter vomited         :   these I took at first sight for the
 refuse    of  the coat  of  the stomach,      as  I had  often seen the
 like in   cases  of gangrene in that organ, — with this difference,
 however,       that in the latter case the colour is always more
 livid  :  I also remarked that the smell of the former pellicles
 was acid, and not putrid ; they did not appear upon every
 occasion of vomiting, and they were attended with no other
 symptom of gangrene.
     I concluded from these observations that there must be
 some chemical illusion in the case.              I mixed all the liquids
 which     were administered       to the patient with      one  another ;
 and   I  at length discovered       that these pellicles, so alarming
 in their appearance,       were   occasioned     by the mixture of Ali
 cant wine with fat broth ; and of this all the attendants were
 also convinced.
     The moment the mixture was made the wine lost its co
 lour entirely, and violet-coloured flakes floated on the liquor,
 like the scrapings of a cask. No other wine produced any
 such effect. Several kinds, sold for Alicant wines, were also
  tried without effect.        Presuming that the above phenome
 non was occasioned by the peculiar nature of the plant, I
  requested,   M.   Heraud,    a good apothecary, and who has the
  teinturier among his vines, to make some experiments,
  which I was prevented from undertaking myself in conse
  quence of other avocations.             M.  Heraud     accordingly   ex
                                                                   pressed

              and particularly the           Alkanl Raisin IVine.                   3 15
pressed the must from some               Alicant raisins    ;   but this thick
and muddy must produced no sensible effects upon soup.
M. Heraud then set the must which remained to ferment;
and he obtained  a fine red wine, very pleasant although not
very mellow,  and  which precipitated the broth as well as
the true Alicant wine which M. Heraud had in his shop.
It is easy to see that the mucous and saccharine bodies
which                     of Alicant viscous, keep the preci
             render the must
pitate suspended,      it happens with ink when strongly
                            as
gummed ; and that fermentation, by destroying a part of
these viscous bodies, had rendered the play of the chemical
affinities quite free.   It is thus that we extract gelatine from
quinces   and  other astringent fruits, without the tannin which
they contain forming any precipitate with the gelatine.
  The fat broth, well boiled and skimmed, contains, among
other principles, gelatine ; and as of all the known vegetable
matters gelatine is most easily precipitated by tannin, it fol
lows then, of course, that the latter principle exists in Ali
cant wine and raisins.    This tannin serves for the interme
dium to the colouring principle, and keeps it dissolved in the
water ; also the colouring principle forms the greater part of
the precipitate; not that the gelatine acts upon                 it,   since   it   does
not act upon the ordinary red wines, but because in this case
the kind of colouring principle     united to that of the tan
                                                 is

the colour becomes violet, because the malic acid remains
dissolved, and does not redden the colouring principle. The

   We may also conclude, that to clarify the wine or tli*
nmst     of Alicant with animal substances, which will dis
 colour     them more or less, is attended with inconvenience.
 The teintttrier is not the only fruit which contains tannin ;
 several    bitter fruits,  without doubt, present it      to the che
mists also ; it is in the fermented juices that they discover
it by the acid of gelatine.
    It is singular that tannin does not give a bad taste to Alt-
cant wine, considering the disagreeable taste which common
wine derives from being put into a cask of new oak ; but
which     is easily carried off, as   I myself ascertained, by fining
down     the wine with       gelatinous substances. Are there se
veral kinds      of tannin which differ in smell ? or is the smell
of tannin modified in its union with the colouring principle ?
This last conjecture appears extremely probable.                  Wine
which has fermented in a new oak tub derives no bad taste
from it ; we cannot deny that there is here plenty of tannin,
which is modified, without doubt, by the fermentation, and
assimilated to the tannin of the Alicant wine.
    Purchasers of Alicant wine wilj now be in possession of
a sure    and easy method of ascertaining the quality of the
wine sold them as Alicant ; a red colour with a slight orange
cast, a sweet and spirituous taste with a sharp bitterish fla
vour, and       the property   of precipitating gelatine, — all these
are the    characteristics of genuine Alicaut wine.           Without
the last property in particular, no wine, however good, is
genuine Alicant.         Boerhaave, in his treatise on nervous dis
eases, complains       loudly of dealers who colour their wines
with sumach.          Red fruits, and even the teinturier itself,
are also resorted      to for this purpose.     Alicant wine     is also
made in some countries,         but the operation is not performed
in the Spanish      manner.     All these wines ought to precipi
tate gelatine more or less ; we must therefore have recourse
to attentive tastings, and other proofs already known, in
order to discover them.
   The well known nature of Alicant wine enables us to
ascertain in what diseases         it should   be resorted   to.    The
tannin     it contains places    it at the head of the astringent
                                                                  wines

wines of the antients, so precious in atonic and colliquative
fluxes ; it is of course necessary to have it of the very best
quality.  It must not be resorted to in constipations.
  Patients of the lower class often request that their wine
may be mixed with their soups. It can be attended with no
inconvenience to grant them this indulgence;    but when
Alicant wine is made use of, they ought to be told that a
most disgusting beverage results from such a mixture.      It
is even prudent not to allow    fat soups to be taken at the
same    time with Alicant wine, when treating such as have
delicate stomachs. To conclude: the decomposition of Ali
cant wine in the stomach can have no more bad conse
quence than all the other wines have upon meeting with the
digestive juices ; and particularly with the bile, which con
tains pure soda.    Every thing which cannot form part of
the chyle necessarily goes into the alvine secretions.
XLIX.          Chemical        Observations      upon       Spathic Iron.     By

                               [Continued   from p. 251.]
The       results      which     I      in my opinion, prove
                                     have   related,
that the ores of spathic iron vary in their composition, and
consequently explain the difference of those obtained by
Bergman, Bucholz, and Drappier.       Perhaps from new ana
lyses still more variations may  be made  known.
   It would no doubt              be very advantageous         to be able to di
                each    variety by its        exterior characters, because          .
stinguish
their different compositions ought to have a different treat
ment in order to obtain the iron from them. The form of
the lamina;, and their texture, serves to distinguish spathic
iron into two species in the iron-works of Old Dauphiny.
The    one which        is named       maillat     is composed      of large flat
laminae    ;   the other, the crystallization           of which is confused,
and the laminae rounded, is called rives.                 The first fuses with
difficulty     second, or that with small grains,
               ; the                                    on the          is,
contrary, remarkable  for its fusibility and for the quality of
its pigs, which yield steel easily. The latter        generally    is
                                                         white,

 white, while that which       is made  from maillat is generally
 gray,  and   yields iron.    These two kinds     are mixed with
 advantage   in the manufacture of steel.
    Perhaps the specific gravity, the loss by calcination, and
 the alacrity in changing colour, are better proofs of the com
 position than the texture is. This is a conjecture, however,
 which can only     be verified   by a great number of analyses
 upon specimens of     different kinds.
   I ought, however, to remark, that the sulphate of magnesia
crystallizes nearly similar to the sulphate of zinc, and that
this similarity of form probably led Bayen into his mistakes.
This chemist, full of the idea that the flakes which he had
perceived in the muriatic solution came from the zinc, while
they were truly owing to the manganese, must have neglected
to examine the crystals he obtained. This opinion is besides
confirmed by the details given by M. Dize, upon the pro
perties  of the white earth, from which he only obtained a
very few particles of zinc by distillation with charcoal.
   It is probably still this same sulphate that M. Sage re
garded as sulphate of manganese.        In fact, that of magnesia
crystallizes easily enough, and before the sulphate of iron.
   I have made these observations with a view of concluding
from them that magnesia is generally found in greater quan
tity in the translucid and well crystallized ore, to which the
name    of maillat  is given in the department    of Isere,  and is
that also to    which   the chemists    who have been occupied
with this substance have given the preference as the purest.
The specimen described and analysed by M. Bucholz seems,
however, to be an exception to this rule, and          I  ought to
mention it.
   Almost all mineralogists regard spathic iron as the most
fusible ore of iron, and, in fact, in several countries it is
very fusible ; but it does not appear that it is every where
very easy to melt ; and if we reflect on the processes in use
in the founderies in which this metal is wrought, we must
know that there are but few manufacturers who do not em
ploy additions of different kinds, or particular preparations,
for the purpose of rendering it more easily fusible. In some
founderies they add to it carbonate of lime l which shows
                                                               that

               Cliemical Observations         upon Spathic       Iron.          319
that lime is           not very abundant in the great masses: in
others, argillaceous ores are added, and also carbonate of
lime.       If, besides, we compare the melted produce with the
charcoal necessary, we find that this ore requires a consi
derable quantity of fuel.             My colleague, M. Le Livec, en
gineer of the mines in the departments of Mont Blanc and
Leyman, who has made upon this substance very numerous
experiments in the department of Mont Blanc, is convinced
that, in order to obtain one part of metal, two, three, and
even      four     parts   of charcoal     are   necessary.          Besides,    the
scoriae always contain globules              of metal like small shot: this
happens       with all    ores  of difficult fusion.
    In some establishments it is found               advantageous        to expose
the ore to the extremes of the atmosphere during a space of
time more or less considerable.                   In some works this expo
sure takes place after roasting ; in others, before and after ;
and lastly, in some, at the iron-works in Styria for instance,
they content themselves with exposure, and do not roast the
ore at all. They deposit at the opening of the galleries the ore
in   beds or     in  large layers, and leave     it exposed      to the rain and
snow for        a  long space of time.       In  a memoir upon the forges
of this country, M. Rambourg                relates that this exposure con
tinues sometimes fifty or sixty years.                  In Mont Blanc          some
forge-masters keep the heaps of roasted mineral always humid
 by means of a very small stream of water.                      It has been ob
 served      that these      different preparations render the mineral
 much more fusible ; and nevertheless in some iron-works
 the necessity is still felt sometimes             of mixing with the         above
mineral *         a certain quantity      of   the ore called by the         work
 men mild ore, and which comes from the decomposition of
 the spathic iron, occasioned by a very long action of the air
 and humidity.            In this state the ore, which was formerly
    * M. Hericart dc Thury, engineer of the mines, in a report to the prefect
 of the department of here, soys, in speaking of the veins of the Vaunaveys
 Biountains at Visilles: " White or yellowish translucid carbonated iron is the
 most abundant.        When it has been extracted, it is left some time in the open
 air to assist its decomposition, and after roasting they expose   it again to the at
 mosphere to render it more easily fusible. In spite of these precautions they
 are still often obliged to mix it with mild ores (such ores as are entirely de
 composed), to refractory is this spathic ore."
                                                                        refractory,

 refractory, is extremely fusible, and we may obtain iron
 from it by the Catalan method with much success.
     It is evident that in these treatments even the metals are
 oxidated, and the sulphuretted iron, which generally accom
 panies this spathic iron, is converted into sulphate, particu
 larly when roasting is made use of* : this sulphate seems to
 be taken away by the          rains, or by the water which has been
 passed through the heaps of the mineral ; but this separa
 tion does not explain the augmentation of fusibility; it
 seems,     on the contrary,        that this quality ought to be dimi
 nished, because the sulphur is necessarily left in less propor
 tion in the mineral ; and we know that this principle renders
 the iron more fusible.           In order to ascertain the true cause
 of this,    let us first inquire       into the cause       of the refractory
 property of certain spathic ores.
     It is well ascertained that the ores of great lamina', to
 which in Dauphin^ the name of maillat is given, are every
 where regarded as the most difficult to melt.                     This ore, as
has been said above, is precisely that in which magnesia
 abounds; and we know that this earth vitrifies with diffi
 culty.      Bergman, in his dissertation upon this substance,
 expressly says, that it does not enter into fusion, except with
 silex, argil, and lime, or with fluor sparfl and M. Lampa-
 dius has made some experiments of the same kind, from
which he concludes that magnesia diminishes the fusibility
of mixtures into which it            is introduced,     if it does not destroy
it completely.
    • I shall say a few words on the subject of roasting. — We know that the
ore of spathic iron is found in ridges mixed with quartz, calcareous spar, and
sometimes argil, as at Eisen-Arts, according to M. Rambourg, and a quantity
of ferruginous pyrites more or less considerable. The ores of Old Dauphiny
and Mont Blanc arc particularly in these circumstances- The roasting sepa
rates a portion of sulphur;   it drivei oft" the carbonic acid, which would make
the heaps swell up and augment the weight of the ore, and consequently the
expense of carriage to the furnace ; it lastly destroys the cohesion, and gives
the workmen a great facility in separating the quartz and other foreign sub
stances : but one would think that, the pyrites being then confounded with
spathic ore by their colour, the workmen could not separate them, and that
in time they would effloresce.

     a                                       in    the furnace.
   This experiment left me no more doubt upon the cause of
the little fus'bility of certain spathic ores. In fact,                                                it   is
tvident that the redaction of the oxide of iron     effected                                  is
with facility. Tint the metallic globules cannot tmite, owing
to the earthv particles not becoming    sufficientlv fluid, and
which therefore choke the fumnces. One miy ?M?1 conclude
that the ores are more or iess fusible according as thev con

      But it remains to ascertain what change takes place by
  the operation       of the air on refractory ores, as well when not
  subjected to the operation of roasting as when they have
  been subjected : here I can only offer conjectures ; and I can
  only support them by facts formerly knowu, and by no
  direct experiments.
      It is well known that spathic iron ores, exposed to the air
  and to humidity, become brown, and lose their hardness.
  Their cohesion          is almost destroyed.       This effect is produced
  by the oxidation           of  the metals.      The magnesia, which in
  the ore is combined with carbonic acid, preserves                   this acid,
  while its combination             with   the metals     is destroyed    by the
  stronger oxygenation of the latter : thus it ought easily to be
  carried off by rain, because we know that the carbonate of
  magnesia is       a  little soluble; and we should think that during
  an exposure        of sixty   years this earthy salt might be carried
 off"  almost entirely. Its solubility may, besides, be augmented
 by the carbonic acid united to the metals, and which is                       se
 parated from them in proportion as they oxidize.
     After roasting, the same explanation will not be applica
 ble; in fact, magnesia should not retain carbonic acid any
 longer, and it is doubtful that it could have regained enough
 of it in the atmosphere to become again soluble; but as al
 most all the spathic ores which have been submitted to this
 operation contained pyrites, it appears to me that we may
 explain their amelioration by exposure to the air, by taking
in the action exercised on the caustic magnesia which is
 formed in the mineral by the sulphate of iron. The expe
 riment of Bayen will be recollected, which I have mentioned,
 and by which he thought he had separated the oxide of zinc
from the calcined ore, with the assistance of green vitriol.
This action certainly takes effect in the places where the
 roasted mineral is deposited ; and the water, by degrees,
takes     off the sulphate of magnesia*.
     If   this cause should appear insufficient,            I would observe,
    * If there is lime in the ore, and it should happen to be in the caustic state,
it would decompose the sulphate of iron in preference ; but the experiment
of Dsrcet indicates that the salt which would be formed would contribute to
the fusion of magnesia.
                                                                             that

 that all kinds of ores are mixed in roasting, and that the
 proportion of magnesia in the mass is not always so great
 as that   found by     M. Drappier;        and that, lastly, it is some
 times necessary to add mild ore to it.
    Without doubt,         after   a long-continued exposure, an ore
of easy fusibility might be always obtained ; but as this te
dious method is attended with very great inconvenience, se
veral    processes     are in    use  to   shorten the time    :  the most
practicable is to mix some mild ore with the ore of large
lamina newly dug ; in this case the proportion of the mag
nesia is endeavoured to be diminished.
    Some ores,      as   well as that  of Eisen-Arts, contain quartz,
calcareous     carbonate, and argil, the most advantageous mix
ture to promote the fusion of the magnesia ; but it is neces
sary to get rid of the greater part of this earth by exposing
to the air the most refractory species of spathic ore.
    In some iron-works, also, they mix with the spathic iron
carbonate of lime and ochrey ores, which, as is well known,
usually contain argil and sand           : flux for the magnesia is thus
composed.
    It is not improbable that the oxide of manganese facili
tates fusion a little; at least, by repeating the experiments
of Bergman upon the vitrification of magnesia, I think I
have observed that this metallic oxide produces a very great
fluidity in glass.
   To conclude ; it is necessary to remark, that all the man
ganese contained in these ores does not vitrify when it is in
great proportion, a part of it being reduced with the iron,
and    united to the melted metal *.              All  the trials   I made
with    the specimen of Allevard yielded me buttons of white
metal, which contained manganese in great abundance. That
of Vaunaveys, and a melting of Vierzon, only afforded some
slight traces of manganese in the same circumstances.
   The method I employed consisted in dissolving the metal
in aqua regia    :   I  afterwards precipitated with ammonia, and
heated the precipitate to redness, in a silver crucible, with

   I did not endeavour to determine the quantities with pre
cision, but I am convinced that they were very different.
     This observation     agrees   with    the    division   established Uy
M. Stengel among meltings, and may lead to exact experi
ments, serving to prove the ingenious conjectures of this
metallurgist.
     I                  in this memoir to prove that the ores
         have endeavoured

   That the refractory quality of some among them is owing
to the great proportion of imgncsia which they contain.

earth, the different practices made use of in the iron-works
where this kind of ore is melted, and which practices have
not been hitherto explained.
     I
    certainly wish that new observations should confirm my
conjectures ; but if it is proved that I am deceived, I shall
nevertheless congratulate myself on having called the atten

the science to which they belong.

         SIR,
Jc on     the inspection of the Society       of Arts, &c.      I   have for
warded my model, and you herewith receive inclosed a de
scription thereof. The novelty of this mode of bringing
into action a considerable force, will, L hope, appear; and
I   beg leave to observe, that, besides the
                                         principle being ap
plicable to locks, it will apply to many other uses where a
lift or descent is required.       .It

carriage must be brought into the position shown in fig. 1 ;
and this can readily be done by stops, which are provided
ki the proper places on the curved bars, for preventing the
wheels from rolling too far; as much water must then be
poured        into the lock              C,   as   will fill it exactly                to the black
line   (f,   d,    withinside           the same;       and    if        the table          on which

be put under the model where necessary, until the surface
of the water exactly corresponds, all round the lock, with
the top water-mark or line above mentioned        must like                        :   it
wise be observed, to place the model across the table, so that
the weight          h,       when hung over the pulley                    for          g,   may be at
liberty      to descend.                Then bang         the       two-pound                weight      h,

lock   ;     and the carriage, or load                 B,A, will          be drawn forwards
into     the    position shown at fig. 2, and the water          the                               in
lock   C     will pass through    the  shuttle to buoy up  'he cais
son    D,     and its surface in the lock will descend to the lower
level.       Again,           by
                    shifting the weight to the lower end g,
the Joad will again be brought back, the caisson depressed,
and the water forced through the shuttle, again raised to the
                   in the lock, as

   Hence           it   is    evident that the water                     in   the      lock, with or
without        a    boat       therein, may be raised or lowered,      the                         by
application of any               force to move the carriage or load, hori
zontally on wheels. That when          intended to pass boat

raised to the top water-level d,d; the upper gates

then readily opened, and the boat floated into the lock
this done, and these gates shut, the water and boat,                                                     by ;
withdrawing the load from the caisson,     lowered to the                     is
lower level             of    the   canal.         The lower             gates
                                                                                    i,
                                                                                    i,       are then
opened, and              the boat floated              from        the    lock to the lower
canal.        In this operation of lowering                         a     boat,        it   is   evident,
that so far from there being                       a   waste       of water,            a   weight      of
water equal to the boat and its load                           is    raised from the lower
to the upper canal             ;    for when the boat at the upper level first
enters       the    lock,      its own weight            of   water           is    displaced, and
                                    8                                                        forced

                 for  elevating and depressing    Water.           327
  forced into the upper canal.      And again, when it     is floated
 into the lower canal,      as much is again from that canal dis
 placed, and forced into the lock.
     On the same principle that water is gained by a descend
 ing boat, as above described, it will be observed that no
 waste ensues in an alternate passage ; and that in an ascend
 ing passage-a loss of water equal        to the boat   and its load
 only takes place.
     It should be understood that as canals are sometimes more
 or less full of water, locks on this principle must be con
 structed to raise and depress, to the greatest extremes that
ever happen, from the highest high-water         to the lowest   low-
 water mark,      and that being so constructed, they     will apply
 to any intermediate heights; the curved plane a being formed
to adjust and counterbalance the inclination of the wheels
 on the other plane b, thereby maintaining an equilibrium,
at any    intermediate height, which the water in the canal
may happen to be at.
     Having   described   its manner of operating, I shall explain
and compare cause and effect ; for which purpose it may be
 requisite first to state, that the load of the carriage B, A, is
fifty- six pounds, which weight, when advanced, presses di
rectly over the parts c, c, c, c, with all its gravity bearing on
the caisson; but when the load is drawn forwards, it rest*
entirely on the fixed standards      e,e,e,e, and    by this change
the whole effect is produced.
     Now, if   the model be set properly to       work, it will     be
found, that     a  two-pound    weight suspended over the pulley
at either end will put the carriage in motion, and thereby
rai*e or depress the water in the lock, and that to do so,
the two-pound weight will descend sixteen inches.            Hence,
two pounds descending sixteen inches may be denoted the
cause or power to produce the effect.           Further, it follows,
that this two-pound weight descending sixteen inches pro
duces the same operation as      fifty-six pounds laid in the cais
son would perform,       and this sinking of the caisson D may
be denoted the direct effect produced by the two-pound
weight.     The indirect and requisite effect being that of de
pressing or elevating the water in the lock       C,  and the com-

      SIR,
   In reading      over the copy     of the paper which I hastily drew
                                      I
up, and sent\v.th my model, observe that I omitted making
any remarks on its applicability, improvements to be made
in  the carriage to facilitate the moving           of  the load, and on
the different other ways, besides the one shown in the model,
by which it mav be put in action.
   It will readily occur to every engineer, that this sort of
lock is riot confined to the particular shape of the model, or
to any particular form.         The caisson-chamber may be placed
endwise to the        lock, may be of any shape, and placed at a
nearer or further distance,        as may be     required.
   On comparing        the length and       movements of the frames
jn the model with what may be required in practice, it will
appear that the length of timbers at large will not be
such but that strength sufficient may be obtained for any
load.     It is  also evident,    that, although the tramps consist
of only two      bearers  in  the  mode', yet, at large, any number
may be introduced parallel with each other, and as many
wheels as bearers.
   In this operation        the' weight    of  the   carriage itself cont
ributes towards         the   effect,    winch    in   common cases is
otherwise,      as  generally there is an objection           to the great
weight     required to make         a  carriage sufficiently strong for
any extraordinary purpose ; and there is no doubt but, by
 an improvement of the carriage, it may be made to require
much less than the power used in the present model. The
mode I should pursue would be, to make the load in the
wheels themselves;         that is to say, ihe necessary load      fj pro
 duce the effect     should be two solid iron cylinders running
                                                                        on

                  for    elevating and depressing                  Water.              329
     on   asmany bearers as are requisite, and to have a frame or
     carriage for the purpose only of connecting the cylinders-!
     by these means the- strength and friction of the axle trees
     would be reduced very much, and the means required then
     to perform the opera Ljon would be only to put the body in
     motion, and to overcome any little obstacle or ii regularity
     that the peripheries of the cylinders would niett with in their
     progress.
       The advantage of rollers over wheels has been admitted;
     even where the  peripheries ol the cylinders were in contact
     with the incumbent weight resting on the top of them, a*
     well as with the supporting plane below ; but i« the case
     above  suggested they have more advantage, being only in
     contact with the upholding frames.
       With respect to its operation, if any objections should
     he found to the great   animal power that would at large be
     required, it will occur, that various other means may be used
     to put the carriage or load in motion ; some without anv lost
     of water,  and others with a trifling loss, compared with
     what the lock  holds,  Thus, when the caisson is up,     by                      if,
     a .cock,  portion of water be let into
               a                                               it,
                                             the equilibrium will
     be destroyed, the caisson will sink, and the water in the
     lock be raised.  Again,          pump, or other means, the
                                            if   by   a
     water be returned from  the caisson to the lock, the caisson
     will rise,    and   the     load of itself recede,              and    this would he

     the Bodies which it holds in Solution,                 by means of Gal

 Action of Galvanic Electricity upon certain Bodies                  dissolved
                                  in Water.
 I.   W ITHOUT         wasting time on the discussion of the mul
 titude   of   imaginary hypotheses invented to explain the de
 composition of water by the electrometer apparatus,                    I shall
 give a general theory of the decomposition of liquids by
 Galvanic electricity, which, in my opinion, brings the ef
 fects of the latter to a simple and satisfactory explanation.
 I  was led to this theory by the           following observations:
     II.  When      a  current of Galvanic            electricity is made to
 pass through      a saturated    metallic       solution, the intensity of
 this current being proportioned to the interval occupied by
 the liquid, and comprised between the extremities of the
 two conductor wires, interesting phenomena are discovered
 even by an observer who does not trouble himself to inves
 tigate the cause.        At the extremity of the wire in contact
 with the disk of zinc, oxygen is disengaged; while at the
extremity of the wire in contact with the disk of copper,
 the molecules of the metal in solution are revived, assuming
 a symmetrical arrangement,             which       extends  in the direction
of the Galvanic current.
     III.  This arrangement is nothing                else than an imperfect
crystallization of metallic molecules,                exactly similar to that
known by the name of arborisation,                   and  which takes place
 upon precipitating metals in solution "by other metals. The
old chemists added to the word arbor the name of the deity                      ...
to whom the metal was consecrated. Thence come the old
names of arbor Dianee, arbor Mortis, arbor Feneris, &c.                     Of
all the     pbaenomena        presented      to us by Galvanism,       no one

   f  This memoir was printed at Rome in 1805. We presume the perusal of
it here will give pleasure to our readers, as the author himself hai also re
quested us lt reprint it. — Note of French editor.
                                                                             H

is so fine or so' interesting as this vegetation, presenting to
our view the image of a fine shrub, furnished with its foliage
and adorned with the most beautiful metallic brilliance.
     IV. Wollaston,         the celebrated      English chemist,        has al
ready noticed, that upon establishing a current of electricity
in the solution of a metal, the latter is revived at the extre
mity of      the conductor endued with negative electricity ; but
I am ignorant whether or no he also perceived that this re
vival is .susceptible of assuming a symmetrical arrangement,
when the action has enough of energy and has lasted a suf
ficient time.
     V. All the metals in solution            are not equally decomposed
by    Galvanic       electricity.     From    nitrate of manganese I ob
tained gaseous bubbles at the negative pole * in place of a
metallic deposit; and it seems that when in similar circum
stances, the metal, in solution has more affinity for oxygen
than hydrogen has for this principle, it is the water which
alone suffers the decomposition.
     VI. During the arborisation           of the metals at the negative
pole,    no   gas   is seen  to  be   disengaged ; whence I conclude,
either that the hydrogen arising is combined with the oxy
gen of the metallic oxide, or that the action is only exercised
upon this oxide and not upon the water. This last conclu
sion ought to he a true one ; for we can scarcely admit that
the hydrogen is able to carry off completely the oxygen from
the oxides of zinc and iron, as well as from certain acids
their solvents, in which these two metals are not dissolved,
except after having produced an effect contrary to this ad
mission, by decomposing water.
     VII. Of all the metallic salts             which     I submitted to the
action of the electrometer apparatus, the acetate of lead and
the muriate of tin        f   presented the most beautiful vegetation.
    • I ihall in future make u?e of the phraie par.tice pok to
                                                               express the extre
mity of the wire communicating with the disk of zinc, and of the term ntga-
tiie pole to cxpreis the extremity of the wire iii contact with the disk of
copper.
   f  I have also obtained effects more or less remarkable from the nitro-mu-
riates of gold and platina, from the nitrates of zinc, copper, mercury, and
cobalt ; from the sulphates of zinc and iron, from     the stannite of muriated
potash, and from muriate of iron.
                                                                          That

                   On the Decomposition         of Water*
T,h*t of lead imitates, the appearance of fern, lea.yefj and; uppi^
the ramifications of tin 1 have ot'u u seen, by means pf the
magnifying-glass,        octaedraj crystals.        It is remarkable that
the arborisation is always directed from the negative pple
towards the positive pole, whatever is the position, of th^
two poles, and it is consequently always estabtished in the
track of the electrical current.            The vegetation of a metal,
with   the assistance     of electricity,    seems to imitate, in .some
measure, that of the natural plants, which constantly inclinf
towards the light, disengaging oxygen by coming in contact
with the solar rays.
    VIII.   When the metallic tree has extended within a short
distance of the positive pole its increase is stopped,, because.
jts foliage, being infinitely slender in eveiy respect, annihi
lates the electrical action by exercising the power of aa in
finity of points.      It  even seems,      that by the too near ap
proach of the poles,       each may acquire the electric fluid          fronl
the other    ;  for the extremities of the metallic ratifications,
have    sometimes begun to oxidate while deoxidation was
manifested in the positive pole.            It is probable that always
when     the   extremities    of  the   two conductor wires bepptnq
very slender and very nearly approach each other in the
\vater, the gases coming from their decomposition are mixed
one with another.          Here we have, if I am not mistaken, an
analogy between the decomposition of water by an electrical
machine, and that which is effected by the pile of Volta*.
    IX. When the current of Galvanic electricity acts upon
water either pure or when charged with some soluble sub
stance, the positive pole attracts the oxygenating principle,
while the negative pole attracts the oxygenated principle of
the liquid*        If the proportion of the components of the
latter is variable, it becomes oxygenated at the extremity of
the wire in communication with the disk of zinc, and de-
oxygenated at the extremity of the wire in contact with the
disk of copper.        The following      are the proofs      of this fact :
   * Wollaston,
                 upon decomposing water by the electricity of an ordinary
machine, constantly observed that the oxygen and the hydrogen were disen
gaged both at once, while the action, of the pile inclines them to show then*
wives separately.
                                                                     X. The

                   % Meant of Galvank SledtYmty.                              S3*
    X. The      muriatic acid becomes so much oxygenated at the
positive pole that it acquires the faculty of dissolving the-
gold coming from the extremity of the conductor wire. The
Sulphuric and the nitric acids becorrtft transparent, and ap>»
pear to be so surcharged with oxygen in the part surround
ing that pole, that I think they                 are capable     of producing
effects,    when in this State, with            which    we    are   hot as yet
acquainted *.           At   the negative     pole the muriatic disengage*
a good deal      of   gas t> the sulphuric         acid sends forth a strong
Sulphureous smell by depositing sulphur, and the nitric                       ac'rd
becomes the nitrous by assuming a blue colour.                        If the   po>-
 sition of the two poles is afterwards changed, so that the orte
occupies the place of the other, every particle of the licid
 returns, bv little and little, to its primitive state, and the
effects recommence.
     XI. A solution of muriate of tin, traversed by the Gat;-
 vanic current, precipitates, by little and little, a white poW>-
tier, coming from the positive pole. This precipitate, redis-
 solved in the muriatic acid and then tried with corrosive sub
 limate, altered the latter into white, whereas the liquid which
had surrounded the negative pole altered it into black.                        Thfc
 muriate of tin had thus become more oxygenated at the extre
mity of     the wire, which excited the liberation              of the oxygen.
     XII.    After   -a  long action of the Galvanic electricity upoft
 the sulphate      of     iron in solution, the latter becomes turbid,
 HssUrriiilg    a red       colour   in the part which surrounded the
 positive pole. We             may ascertain that it then contains a
 strongly oxidated sulphate of oxygenated iron by trying it
 with the prussiatc of potash, which immediately produces
 a very fine Prussian bine with this part of the liquid, whereai
 that which surrounds the negative pole only produces with
 the same prussiate a precipitate of a greenish white colour.
     Xilt. The molybdic acid dissolved in the concentrated
    * At this
               decree of oxygenation the sulphuric acid seems nmccntible iif
 dissolving gold ; at least, that which I . ade use of in this experiment as-umod
 a yellow colour in proportion as it dissolved the extremity of the gokl wire
 which liberated the oxygen. On pouring into thi» ^ulph^te of gold a aolntiifn
 of green sulphate of iron,    a precipitate was formed like the sulphcn et of g«ild.
    f It would  bo interesting   to examine if this gas comes p-r.ly from the
                                                                                 Jc^

  tulphuric acid,     assumes,    in the cold,    a   tine blue colour,
 which always disappears when heat is applied to the solu
 tion.     Upon exposing it to the action of the pile of Volta,
 the vitreous fluid acts in a manner analogous to heat, while
 the resinous fluid produces an effect analogous to cold ; on
 the positive pole the liquor becomes by degrees perfectly
 transparent, and the molybtlic acid is partly precipitated in
 the form of a white powder, whereas round the negative pole
 it always acquires     a deeper and   dirtier colour.     Upon     after
 wards changing the position of the two poles, so that the
 one occupies the place of the other, the contrary happens ;
 the transparent part returns to the blue colour, and the blue
 part becomes transparent.
    XIV. When the Galvanic           current exercises     its influence
 for  a  long time upon the solution of an earthy salt, the
base   of  the latter is gradually precipitated round the extre
mity of the wire of negative electricity.           These precipitates,
in my opinion, are not the effect of a decomposition by the
alkali which is generated at this point in an infinitely small
quantity ; but I presume that the acid of the salt is there
destroyed, or well decomposed, whence it results that its
earthy base becomes       free.
    The   glass tubes containing     the solutions submitted to the
experiments     I  have here described,     were    often covered with
a metallic crust, which seems as         if melted   upon the vitreous
matter of the interior of the tube,           and which comes from
the particles of metal detached by the action of the appa
ratus of the conductor wires : thus when these extremities
were    of gold or silver, the       glass   tubes   became    perfectly
gilded either with the one or the other metal.

    XV. The     decomposition of water by the electrometer ap
paratus    has for a long time exercised the ingenuity of che
mists and naturalists,       to whom this phenomenon           affords a
delicate   problem to resolve in order to reconcile it with the
theory of the nature of water. It is first necessary to know
                                                                        if

                   by Means       of Galvanic Electricity.                          335
if   the    two products of the two Galvanic poles come from
one and the same molecule      of water, or rather from two dif
ferent molecules       ;   and in the latter case we may ask                       what
becomes      of   the hydrogen at the place where oxygen only                            it
perceived?        and in return, what becomes             of    the oxygen where.
hydrogen only is perceived                ?
   XVI. The column of Volta, which will immortalize his
name, is an electrical magnet, every element of which      e.                      (i.
each pair of disks) possesses its negative and positive pole.
The consideration of this polarity suggested to me the idea
that    might establish
       it                 similar polarity among the ele
                                      a
mentary  molecules of the water  solicited  the same elec       by
trical agent   and confess that this afforded me
               ;       I                           spark of              a
light  on the subject.
    XVII. Let us suppose, therefore, that at the moment of
the generation       of    the hydrogen and the oxygen,                  there takes
place in these two bodies, as well   contact as      by
                                                     the fric            by
tion of the one against the other,   separation of their na
                                                     a
tural electricity in such manner that the former acquires
                                   a
the positive and the latter the negative state;      follows,            it
that the pole from which the resinous electricity continually
flows will attract          the
                       hydrogen                     by
                                      rejecting the oxygen,
whereas the pole animated with the vitreous electricity will
attract the oxygen          by
                     rejecting the hydrogen *. Thus, when
the Galvanic current traverses    quantity of water, each of
                                              a
the two component principles                  of   the latter   is   solicited     by   an
attractive force and         by   a   repulsive force, of which the cen
tres   of action    are reciprocally opposite, and              which,
                                                               acting         by
in the same manner,               determines the decomposition of this
liquid.
   XVIII. The action of each force, in respect to molecule              a
of water situated in the direction of the Galvanic current,
in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance to which                              it is
exercises its influence.    But as the distance of any given
molecule placed between the two centres of action can never
     Considering the diver»ity of substances deposited at the negative pole,
 .
itwould be more simple, and perhaps more just, to admit only an attractive
and repulsive force acting upon the oxygen, without attributing to the poles
                                                                        it
in relation to the hydrogen.
                                                                              diminish

 SS8                  On the Decimposifion       of Hfaet,
 diminish       relatively to the otte, Withoat increasing itself dtk
account of this diminution relatively to the ether, so each
bf the two elements of isuc'h a molecule is solicited by a'con*
Stant force,        which   results from the attractive and the -feptrr-
%ive    force*.
     The effect of the repulsion, although effectively •existing,
is not sensible, on account of the reciprocal action of the
elementary molecules in contact, Whence results a. recorn*
bination of such as are repelled by the Galvanic poles.
     XIX. Let us consider, however, a certain quantity of
Water, composed of oxygen, represented by the negative
Sign (•— ), arid of hydrogen marked by the positive sign '( + ).
See -f fig. l. Plate IX.             At the moment of establishing 'a
current of Galvanic electricity in this water, the electrical
polarity manifests itself among its elementary molecules in
Such a manner, that the latter seem to constitute                  the com
plement Of the pile in action.               At the -same thine all tht
faolecutes of oxygen situated in the track of the current will
have a tendency         to make their way towards the positive pole,
tvherfeas     all the molecules      of hydrogen    situated    in the same
track will tend towards the negative pole.
     It thence results, that when the molecule of water repre
sented by o,h, yields its oxygen o to the vitreous fluid of the
Wtrfe    + , its hydrogen h is immediately reoxygenated by the
arrival of another molecule of oxygen o, the hydrogen of
Which, h, is recombined with r, and so on.                        The same
thing takes place, but in a contrary sense, relatively to the
fiiolecule of water Oj, P, which, on yielding its hydrogen Q,
to the resinous 'fltrid of the — wire, is immediately rehydro-
genated by the arrival          of  the  molecule    X;   and this succes
sion of decomposition           and   of recombination of      the elements
of She water will continue until            the latter is completely de*
Composed.
    XX. It       is clear that  in the whole operation the molecules
of water, situated at the extremities of            the conductor wires,
will alone be decomposed, whereas all              those placed mterme-
   *  I suppose that each force has the same intensity ; a circumstance which
might actually to take place, since neither of the poles of the electrometer
apparatus can acquire electricity except at the expense of the other.
                                                                      diately

                          by Means     of Galvanic Electricity,                337
mediately will change reciprocally and alternatively their
component principles without changing their nature. From
this I infer, that if it were possible to establish a current of
Galvanic electricity in water, in such a manner as to describe
in      the    latter a perfectly circular line, all the molecules of
the liquid         situated in this circle would be decomposed and
instantly recomposed : whence it follows,  that this water,
although undergoing the effect of the Galvanic action, will
always remain water.
       XXI.         Having      exposed     some liquids, contained    in two or
more vases, to the action of the electrometer apparatus, I
perceived the polarity at the extremities of the metallic wires
which  serve to establish the communication between the li
quids inclosed  in each vase. (See fig. 2.)   Thus, when the
vases contained acetate of lead dissolved in water, I obtained
oxygen at the extremities a and c, while the vegetations                       al
ready described rose at the extremities b and d *.
       Upon bringing            the vessels nearer together, and upon cur
tailing the dimensions of the wire be as much as possible,
the electrical polarity was nevertheless distinctly percepti
ble ; by imagining the same wire infinitely small, one may
conceive how the molecules n and p unite upon regene
rating the body which was at first decomposed.
   XXII. The theory of the decomposition of water here
given leads us to the following consequences:
   (a) The proportion of hydrogen could not have increased
in     the part      of   the water which is nearest to the positive pole,
since the oxygen of the whole quantity of the liquid tra
versed by the Galvanic current inclines towards this point,
while the hydrogen endeavours to recede from it.
   (b) An oxygenation in that part of the water which sur
rounds the negative pole is equally impossible, since the
hydrogen is there constantly attracted, while the oxygen is
repelled from             it,    See   §   IX.
    • have communicated my memoir to M. Morichini. This chemist in
       I
formed me that he obtained an analogous result upon examining the gases
which are liberated when the gases only contain water. The extremities

     (c) When even the component principles of water are not
susceptible of any other proportion of combination than of
that which makes it water, the latter would not be less de
composed in the manner described; but there would neither
be oxygenation,          nor hydrogenation, nor acidity, nor alka
linity, in any part.
    XXIII. The production of an acid at the positive pole,
and that of an alkali at the negative *, urged by Galvanic
electricity,     is also   a support to the theory proposed ; for,
according to analogy, we ought to attribute the former to an
oxygenation, and the other to the presence of hydrogen f.
 See §   IX.
    My    apparatus     having remained several days in action, the
cloths moistened with a solution of muriate of soda were
here and there covered with a saline efflorescence,              which   was
nothing     else than soda united to        carbonic acid which it        had
absorbed     from the air.
    XXIV.       The polar arrangement, such as exists in the ele
mentary molecules of water traversed by the Galvanic cur
rent, ought to be established equally among the elementary
molecules of every other liquid body, provided they are soli
cited by the same forces. In the metallic solutions the elec
tric polarity     takes   place  among the elements of the oxide,
the oxygen        of which     passes   to the positive pole, and the
metal of it is deposited at the negative pole.                 The acid re
acts upon these metallic particles which it holds in solution ;
but being decomposed, as well by this re-action as by the
electrical power, the revival does not the less take place.
    XXV. I filled a bent tube with two different metallic so
 lutions, in such a manner that each of them, without being
mixed with the other, occupied one of the moieties of the
   *  Tincture of turnsole, traversed by the Galvanic current, become$ red
around the positive pole, and returns to the blue colour upon changing the
respective position of the two poles; but these effects may be explained by
the action of the oiygen and the hydrogen at the moment of their produc
tion upon the colouring matter, and are not sufficient to deduce from it the
acidity and alkalinity.
   f Hydrogen is a constituent part of volatile alkali, and oiygen enters into
the composition of all the acids with the nature of which we are acquainted.
              I                                                        tube,

  tube, and they had a simple point           of contact in     the  middle*.
  On exposing the two liquids thus arranged to the action of
 the Galvanic current, and on plunging the negative pok both
 into the one and the other, it was always covered with revived
 metal in whatever solution it was plunged.
     If  we knew      any other substance          besides    oxygen which
 may be acted upon by the positive pole, we might repeat
 this experiment relatively to the latter. An analogous re
 sult would then evidently prove that the decomposition of
 water by Galvanic electricity takes place in relation to two
 different molecules ; an opinion generally admitted, and con
formable to the theory which I have now submitted to the
 examination of the learned.
    The admirable simplicity          of   the law to which this          phe
nomenon is submitted, coincides, to               our astonishment, with
 the laws of the universe.          Nature can neither create nor de
stroy ; since the number of bodies is never augmented nor
diminished, but all without exception are subject to a mu
tual exchange of their elements : and when we consider the
wonderful effects of electricity, which acts often in secret,
although spread over the universe, we cannot refratn from
pronouncing it to be one of the most powerful agents of
the grand operations         of Nature.
LI I.    On the Imitation       of Marble and Plaster Figures by              a
    neiv   Composition made of old Paper reduced to Paste f.
John Nicholas Gahdeur,                   an artist  of Paris,   has invented
the method of imitating            the most       beautiful sculptures by
means     of  old   paper    reduced     to paste ; it is also ascertained
that this new species of ornament adds, to a wonderful light
ness and solidity, the requisite truth in the expression of the
figures.
    M. Gardeur is the first who attempted, with success, this
new branch of industry ; and almost all the theatres and
   • We may easily perform this operation if we make use of two solutions
ef different colours; for instance acetate of lead and nitrate of copper.

   These productions are    as cheap as   common painted paper,
and from their lightness may be transported to a great di
stance without much expense.        The encouragement given to
M.   Gardeur by the French government, determined him to
exert himself in an extraordinary manner to bring his in
vention to perfection, and he has now so far succeeded ag
to have nothing left to wish for ; he has extended his in
dustry so far as to render his figures capable of ornamenting
the outside of buildings also, by rendering them impenetra
ble by the weather.
   The members of the National Institute            who were ap
pointed by the minister of the interior to examine the per
formances of M. Gardetir have declared, that to the best of
their knowledge he is the only artist who ever exercised
that branch of manufacture, and that they were perfectly
satisfied with the execution of the specimens shown them
on their visit to his manufactory.
LIII.   Report made by    M, GUYTON       upon a sculptured Head
   in Flint, with   a Covering   of Chalcedony. Read in         the
   French Institute on the 31st    of March 1806.
       MII.LIN,   a member      of the   class   of antient history
and literature, having had occasion to examine, as an object
of antiquity,   a piece of sculpture found at Roule, thought
proper to submit it to the inspection      of the class of Physical
and Mathematical Sciences,        as being     interesting both to
mineralogy and the processes      of the arts; and Messrs. Ber-
thollet, Vauquelin, and myself,      were charged with making
a report on the subject.
   This curiosity    was obligingly lent us by M. Cerf, the
gentleman to     whom    it belongs.    It had been found, four
months ago, in the garden of a house which forms part of
the chateau of Femes, in the suburb of Roule, at present
occupied as a boarding-school.       It was discovered by a gar
dener, at about five or six decimetres below ihe surface.
                                                               This

                  with    a Coating    of Chalcedony.                     341
This is all     the   information     we were able to collect on the
spot, nor has any thing been discovered which could lead
to the least conjecture upon the epoch or circumstances of
its being buried below ground ; but the singularities which
it presents sufficiently excite the attention of the antiquary,
the naturalist, and the artist, to induce them to gratify their
curiosity by an examination of what remains of it.
  It   is a head sculptured      upon a piece of flint of the same
kind   as that of which         gun-flints are made.     From the
lower extremity of the chin to the summit of the cranium
it measures 3 inches 4 lines ; from the forehead to the oc
ciput, 76 millimetres; its circumference, taken above the
nose, is S36 millimetres.
   A hole of 13 millimetres in diameter, made in the lower
part, is still filled up with plaster mixed with lime, and
seems to have served to unite the head with the body of the
figure, the latter part being probably of silex also, or of
some other material more easy to be wrought upon, and
.which, according to the usual proportions, may have been
about 54 centimetres : so that the whole statue may have
been about 63 centimetres, or 23 inches 4 lines in length.
  The head-dress indicates            a male figure ; the hair is short,
and confined by a simple narrow bandage, as worn by the
Greeks and Romans ; a circumstance which, joined to the
style of the figure, seems to ascribe to this work a date far
remoter than the time of the Gauls, although the eye-balk
are strongly marked in    whichit, very seldom seen in any
                                              is
true antique monument.
   But we leave to more competent judges the discussion of
these points, which   appears only necessary in us merely
                          it
to mention in order to complete the description of the mo
nument, and to present in its true light the question which
has chiefly excited the attention            of the Institute.
   The flint of which this           head    is   formed has been covered,
wherever    was not broken or rubbed, with
           it                                   coating of   a              a
fine white, of   thickness scarcely perceptible
                      a                              was at      ;   it
tacked     by
           none of the acids, and   united to    hardness at
                                                  it          a
-least equal    to that of chalcedony,             the vitreous consistence

34*                    On a sculptured Head in Flint,
of an  enamel sufficiently translucid to admit of the different
gray  or blue shades of the silex being seen through it.
   Is this covering (for I do not think I can give it the name
df incrustation) a work of nature or a production of art?
    One would think that analysis might be resorted to in
order to resolve this question ; but the article would be en
tirely destroyed, and even by destroying it we could not get
enough of this covering matter from which to obtain un
equivocal results, and after all, nothing more might be
karnt than is already known from its external characters of
colour,    opacity, hardness, and inalterability in the acids;
i.   e. that its constituent parts are the same as those of chal
cedony.
   The first idea presented by the inspection of this head                         is,
that the block of silex, after having been laboriously sculp
tured with      drill, like other hard stones, had received
                  a                                                                 a
covering in the fire of the nature of that applied to the bis
cuit porcelain.      was not only the gloss of its enamel, and
                        It
its thinness, that seemed  to found this opinion,     was stiH         it
more confirmed            by
                      the comparison of its lustre with the
roughness  of the white  crust of the two fractures at the bot
tom of the left cheek, crust evidently formed since its being
                                   a
deposited       in   the ground.
     But   a   large fracture, more recent, discovers the silex pre
served with all its ordinary characters    and we know that
                                                         ;
this substance loses its colour and transparence in   fire so               a
low as to be incapable of fusing feldspar. The piece which
underwent this experiment was only exposed to        heat of            a
13    pyrometric degrees       ;   it   was divided into several fragments,
and   it   assumed                              of
                                    biscuit in the interior.
                        the appearance               a
  This certainly strengthens the idea, that the chalcedony
which covers this silex could only have been placed there                          by
the humid way, while               it   was in the ground.
  Before adopting            it,
                        thought proper to inquire among the
                               I
collections of minerals of this kind for indications, at least,
of   the possibility     of    the natural production         of   a   similar co
vering.
     Flints     are    generally         seen    incrusted   rather     than     co

vefed    withthis production; the crust is unpolished and
rough to the tongue, imbibes the acids, and even sometimes
gives signs of effervescence. There are, to be sure, some of
them covered           with       a very hard chalcedony,                 but always
thicker,     less transparent, forming an unequal crust, present
ing only     some      brilliant particles in the fractures, where we
may perceive          the  traces of the friction, but never of the
gloss of enamel.
   One would think that the polish received by flint ought
to account for the gloss of chalcedony which covers      and                    it,
produce the difference of the earthy chalcedony which covers
the two fractures; but the chalcedony observed upon several
rock crystals, upou mamellated agates, or that which we
meet with upon cubes of fluate of lime, or on other crystals,
the united surfaces of which may be considered as polished,
never presents any thing like shining aspect.

chalcedony, such as we observe forming passages in pech-
stoncs, petro-silex, &c, are also of  rough white, often  a
even    in recent fractures         ;    besides,          in
                                                     they are always found

                      to the eye approaching
lishing gives them.
  Two pieces, however,                  presented        to me   a   surface polished
enough to encourage the hope of finding the analogy of this
silex in nature. One of these pieces came from the depart
ment of the Indre and the Loire        appeared entirely co

to examine the interior,             I    saw nothing     but    mass of the

what    acquired
        it                  by

all connection with the former.

ferent from common flint, was only an opake white chalce
dony upon a more hyaline chalcedony. It was moreover in
tersected by reddish-coloured lines, which crossed in dif
ferent ways, in the manner of the Indus.
    The doubts excited in my mind by these comparisons
engaged me to examine if the subject of investigation could
not     have been the work      of art, or   at least how nearly   it ap
proached it.
    I   have already    remarked how easily silex is altered by the
fire  ;   it is not necessary, therefore, to have recourse to the
processes       of coating porcelain   to solve our difficulties.     But
might not         the same end be attained by cementations at a
moderate heat, long digestions in saline fusions, or in comu
bined solutions, in order to bring into play efficacious affi
nities? — Chemical experiments can alone throw light on
the subject.
    It will    be sufficient cursorily to explain     the results  of the
first fruitless trials.

sulphate of alumine,        and in the muriate     of soda, experienced
no alteration so long as the heat was not pushed beyond a
certain degree, after passing which it begins to lose its co
lour, transparency,        and tenacity.
    A    fragment of silex,   treated iu caustic potash     in a  platina
crucible,      only experienced a slight diminution of weight,
more or less considerable according to the time that it was
kept in a heat capable of maintaining the potash in fusion.
    Alumine being (although in a small proportion) one of
the constituent parts of chalcedony, I thought that by treat
ing silex in a solution of potash saturated with alumine, and
adding to it a quantity of free potash to act upon the silex,
the well-known affinity of the two earths for each other,
and with a common solvent, would operate a new combina
tion on the surface       of the silex,  at a degree  of heat incapable
of causing any other alteration.
   .Considering, on the other hand,              that an analysis had
ascertained       the presence   of  lime in some chalcedonies, I
                                                                      put

                 with a Coating of Chalcedony.               845
put a little of the former, with silex, in the same preparation
of potash and alumine.
    These two experiments were made in crucibles of platina,
and the success exceeded my hopes, although they had not
been preceded by any preliminary trial in order to regulate the
doses of the agents or the duration and intensity of the fire.
The silex was not altered in the interior ; it only assumed at
its surface a very slender white covering, of an uniform thick
ness, forming one body with the mass, not attackable by
the acids, and of such a hardness that it soon wore out the
stones made use of by the engravers ; and it was no more
affected by the application of adamantine spar, or corindon,
<o it, than was the covering of the sculptured head.
    These pieces came out of the crucible dull white, as I ex
pected ; but some parts, which I wrought in the manner of
hard stones, showed that they were susceptible of the same
polish as that of the sculptured head.
     Ft cannot be dehied that such a perfect imitation     is fa
 vourable to the opinion that the covering of the head was
the work of art. We are not, however, entitled to suppose
 that the chemical affinities which led to this imitation were
 known to the artist who executed this monument ; it is not
 the first process discovered by accident long before the dis
 covery of the true theory.
     This opinion, however, has not obtained general assent.
 Those who oppose it chiefly support themselves upon the
 resemblance of the coverings of several silices found in the
 environs of Femes, specimens of which have been presented
 to the class by M. Chaptal, and which in fact present upon
 some of their surfaces particles of enamel, if not equal in
 colour and thickness,    at least as shining.
     Others are of opinion, with M. Fourcroy, that whether
 the covering of the sculptured head had been formed in the
  earth in the same manner as the crust of these silices, or
  whether they had been added after the labour of the sculptor
  by a process of art; yet, in all cases it must be acknowledged
 that it had received the polish from the hand of man, and
  this is the only method of reconciling the results which we
  are forced to draw from its actual state.

    Many of the       above persons have had ulcers situated on
the   lower    extremities,   in which more pain than is usual has
been experienced, and the cure protracted beyond what
might have been expected.
    Suppuration of the inguinal and other glands has been
frequent, unconnected with the lues venerea or scrophula>
which       have been successfully treated         by the application of
stimulating cataplasmas,          with   tonics  taken   internally.
    Many cases of diseased mammae have occurred ; as ab
scess,     scirrhi,  and cancer    :  in the treatment of scirrhi much
apparent good has been            derived   from the administration of
the     ferri rubigo, with stimulants             applied externally,     as
mentioned in a former report.
    Mrs. R          , aged 47,    Cow-Cross,       has been several years
subject to femoral hernia, which seldom remained down
long; and she could return it at any time previous to the
present attack by placing her body in a horizontal situation.
It   came down          on Saturday the 19th day of April, and
could not be reduced.           The pain became considerable over
the fore-part of the abdomen, attended with sickness, and
occasionally with hiccup.              These symptoms continued to
increase till the 25th, four P.          M., when I      was requested    to
see   her.
    The hernia      was small, and situated on the right side ; the
pulse      120,   thready, and irregular; respiration short and
oppressed ; skin dry ; the tongue brown : the pain was re
ferred particularly to the region of the stomach, from which
every thing was rejected          as   soon   as  taken   :  the hiccup and
vomiting       having now become extremely troublesome, and
as several attempts had been made to reduce the hernia
without effect,       it was thought right to administer            the fol
lowing injection t

This produced great         lassitude ; but the hernia could not be
 returned during its operation ; and of the following pills
 two were directed to be taken every two hours :

came to the dispensary, being perfectly cured.
  J.    F.    aged (58,      Green Arbour Court, Old Bailey, glass-
cutter, has had        a    femoral hernia on the right side for several
years, which he has always been enabled to reduce                              by   pres
sure when in bed.   It came down on Wednesday,                                 the 23d
of July,     and could not be returned              ;   he became sick immedi
ately  an enema was administered without any relief being
        ;
obtained, and cathartics appeared to increase the complaint.
26th, the stomach was become extremely irritable, every
thing bring rejected as soon as taken, and the hiccup was
particularly distressing           ;    the pain and sense         of   heat    in    the
umbilical region               became       almost intolerable.         These sym
ptoms continued to increase, and on Monday, the 28th, in
the afternoon  was requested to see him.

30th, pulse 80, skin soft ; a gentle perspiration was diffused
over the whole body, but the hiccup was almost constant
and very distressing ; the dressing, having become loose,
was removed, and the wound bad healed at the upper part,
and looked much better than could have been expected.
31st, the hiccup continued; but appeared to have been
more troublesome at three o'clock in the morning and at
eleven o'clock       in  the forenoon than at any other time du
ring the twenty-four           hours.    The same observation was
made on the preceding day.

    August 1st, the hiccup had entirely ceased, and every
unfavourable symptom had disappeared : he requested to go
 abroad, which was not permitted ; the wound was dressed,
 which had nearly healed.
    3d, he continued         to improve in strength, walked out
daily,     and   in a  few days was enabled to resume his labour,
 and was discharged cured.
    In  the above cases the operation was performed under the
 most unfavourable         circumstances     ;  the patients being    ex
 tremely poor, not having conveniencies, or even the com
 mon necessaries of life.         It may be asked, Why were they
 not sent to an hospital, where every necessary convenience
and attention would have been afforded, by which, appa
 rently, they would have had a much greater chance of reco-

   very     ?     but experience militates against this opinion ; for            I
   have invariably seen, that patients recover in less time from
   the most severe operations when in the bosom of their fami
   lies, even in distress,             than when taken to a hospital where
   all apparent         inconvenience         is removed.     But in hernia this
  fact is particularly illustrated, and may be referred to two
   causes       :   1st, the state      of  the patient's mind     in leaving his
tfamily         ; and 2dly, the time            in which   the operation is per
  formed,          as   patients iu general cannot be prevailed on to
  leave their home               for an hospital till they are in the greatest
  danger; and as the success of this operation depends on its
  early performance, all delay beyond the necessary attempts
  at reduction tends to increase the danger.                    "   I have often
 had occasion to lament that                    I had performed the operation
  too late, but never that              I  had performed it too soon *."
       It  is much to be regretted, that a small fund is not pro
 vided and annexed to all charitable institutions for the pur
 pose of supplying the poor with trusses, by which many
 lives would be saved, and                a  painful operation frequently pre
 vented.           This might        be done at a very inconsiderable ex
 pense, comparatively speaking with the benefit that would
 accrue to society from its adoption ; as the same truss could
 be procured for seven shillings for which the patient is
 obliged to pay. a guinea or even a guinea-and-a-half,                     to the
 great      distress      of  his  family   ;   and  which   in the   majority of
 cases        is totally out       of his power, to      spare,  be the danger
 ever so great.
      It  is my intention to resume this subject in a subsequent
 report, and to make some observations on the hernia which
 sometimes takes place                in the omentum        and in the mesen
tery.

LV. Extract of          a Memoir upon Hair. Ifead at the French
            National Institute, by M. Vauouelin *.
The       principal object which the author had in view on
undertaking his experiments on the above subject, was to
ascertain the nature of the animal matter of which hairs
are formed,       and    if there was any            thing analogous in the
animal ceconomy.            But in the course of his experiments
phenomena presented themselves which, appearing foreign
to the principal substance, led him further than he intended:
it did not enter into his plan at first to inquire into the cause
of the various colours of hair, which nevertheless became
the principal       object with which he was occupied.                        It is
only,    he says,    after labouring a long time upon the same
object, by carefully observing the phaenomena which arise,
and by meditating on the causes which produced them, that
we arrive at results often impossible to foresee d priori.
Nevertheless,       he does not flatter           himself that     he has pene
trated    into all the secrets of nature on this subject ; nor
does    he    propose his ideas but with that reserve which
ought to be shown in such difficult researches.                       He gives,
however,       an  exact    description         of   his  experiments ; com
pares and discusses them, and draws such conclusions as
appear     to him     the most natural.              We shall now give an
abridgment of the chief of his experiments,                     as  well as the
corollaries he deduces from them.
    I  boiled,    says he, some hair in water for several                    days,
without being able to dissolve it ; the water, however, con
 tained a small quantity of animal matter, as was demon
strated on the application           of infusion of galls         and other re-
agents.
    It is probable that this matter, which gives the water the
property of putrefying, is foreign to the proper substance of
hairs.      I conclude from this experiment, that at the tempe
rature at which water boils in the air, hairs cannot be dis
 solved.

  I    succeeded       in dissolving       them without           alteration      in
Papin's digester, by regulating the heat properly.   If in this
operation  a certain degree  of temperature  is exceeded, the
substance of the hair is decomposed in whole or in part ; a
circumstance demonstrated by the ammonia, carbonic acid,
and the fetid empyreumatic oil found in the solution, to
which the oil communicates a deep yellow colour.
   In the one or the other case, sulphureted hydrogen gas
is liberated in great quantity, which acted strongly upon the
copper of the digester, which it blackened : more was found
when the heat was raised; which seems to indicate that this
substance is produced during the operation.
  If  we operate upon black hair; or if the heat is not suffi-,
cient to decompose          it,
                        there remains   black matter, which,
                                                     a
on account of its minute division and the consistency of the
solution,     is                      This matter
                   deposited very slowly.              princi         is
pally composed of     black oil, as thick as bitumen, little
                            a
soluble  inalcohol and the alkalis of iron and sulphur per
haps united with each other.     Red hair leaves    yellowish     a
red residue, containing plenty of oil, sulphur, and      little            a
iron.
   The solutions are almost entirely colourless when they are
filtered; .the concentrated acids make them turbid, the

hair,  leaving a black residue formed of thick oil, a little
more animalized, and of iron and sulphur.      There remains,
after the solution of red hair, a yellow oil, containing sul
phur and an atom of iron.             '
   The acids form in these solutions white precipitates, solu
ble in an excess of the above menstrua.    These precipitates
being rcdissolved in the acids, there appeared upon the li
quor, after some time, an oil under the form                   of a prismatic-
coloured pellicle.
  The solution          of hair in potash precipitates              lead      of   a
black colour, owing to the hydrosulphuret it contains ; that
of red hair appears to contain more of it. When they are
freed from the sulphur by exposure to the air, they have
merely the smell of soap, and become frothy                      in the      same
manner.
   The acids act upon hair each in their own manner : the
sulphuric acid and the muriatic acid assume at first a very fine
rose colour, and afterwards dissolve it.     The nitric acid
makes it yellow, and dissolves it also by means of a gentle
heat      :   the solution     presents     at its surface a black oil when
black hair is used, and           oil when red hair is made use
                                   a red
of.       Both the one and the other of these oils become white
after some time, and become concrete by cold.
   This same solution evaporated properly yields a good deal
of oxalic acid, and the uncrystallizable mother-water con
tains a bitter substance, plenty of iron,                   and sulphuric     acid
coming from the sulphur of the hair.
   The solution of red hair in the nitric acid contains less
iron, but more sulphuric acid than that of black hair.
   The oxygenated muriatic acid gas whitens hair at first,
afterwards softens           it,
                       and reduces    to the form of viscous

gave a brownish yellow colour to the ashes, phosphate^ suK
phate, and carbonate of lime, a little muriate of soda, and a
considerable quantity of silex. The ashes of red hair are
less coloured, because they contain less iron and manga
nese ; those of white hair contain less also, but abundance
of magnesia       is found      in them relatively to the other prin
ciples.     Hair leaves little more than 1*5 of ashes.
   Alcohol extracts two kinds of oil from black hair             ; the
one white, which          is deposited upon cooling in the form of
#mall   brilliant   flakes   ; the other, which separates in propor
tion as the alcohol volatilizes, is of a greenish gray, and
also becomes concrete in time.
   Bed hair also yields        a  white and concrete oil like sperma
ceti ; but alcohol leaves a deposit by evaporation          of another
oil, which is as red as blood. What is remarkable ami in
teresting in this experiment is, that the reddest hairs upon
which alcohol was employed became brown or deep chest
nut-coloured.          I conclude from this, that the colour of red
hair is owing to. the presence of this oil.
   According       to the experiments reported     in this memoir   of
M.    Vauquelin, (a great many of which we have omitted, as
being only accessary to the principal object,) it appears that
black hair is formed of nine different substances, viz.
   1.   An animal matter, forming the greatest proportion.
   2. A white concrete oil, in small quantity.
   3. Another greenish gray oil, very abundant.
   4. Iron, the state of which in hair is as yet uncertain.
   .5. Some particles of oxide of manganese.
   6. Phosphate of lime.
   7. Carbonate of lime, in a very small quantity.
   8. Silex, in a notable quantity.
   9. Lastly, a considerable quantity of sulphur.
   The same experiments ascertained that red hair does not
differ from black, except that it contains a red oil in place
of a greenish-black one ; finally, that white hair differ*
from the two former, in so far as its oil is almost colourless,,
and it contains phosphate of magnesia, which is not found
in the others.
   According to this knowledge of the nature of the consti
                                                                 tuent

fuent principles of hair, M. Vauquelin thinks that the various
colours which distinguish this substance may be accounted
for. The black colour, according to him, is produced by a
black and bituminous-like oil, and perhaps also by the com
bination of sulphur with iron.   The red and flaxen colour*
are owing to the presence        of   a   red    or yellow oil; the in
tensity of which diminished by a               small quantity of brown
oil makes the hair red.   Lastly, the white is owing to the
absence of the black oil and sulphuretted iron.   He thinks,
that in red and yellow hair, as well as in white, there is al
ways an excess of sulphur; since when the white metallic
oxides are applied to such as those of mercury, lead, bis
                           it,
muth, Sec, they become black very speedily.  The manner
in which this body acts upon metallic substances makes
him think that   it  united to hydrogen.
                      is
     M.Vauquelin endeavours afterwards to explain the white
ness which suddenly takes place in the hair of such persons
as are struck with profound grief, or surprised    great fear. by
 must be supposed, he says, in order to explain this phaeno-
It
menon, that at the moment when nature       in state of re
                                                         is   a
volution,   and when consequently the natural                 functions are
suspended or changed in their nature, an agent  developed       is
in the animal ceconomy, which, passing into the hair, de
composes the colouring matter of it.
     But what agent can produce this            effect   ?    The acids      ap
pear to him to be alone capable           of   it:    this at least   is    cer
tain, that black hair plunged some time                  in
                                           these menstrua,
and particularly in the oxygenated muriatic acid, becomes
white very sensibly.
     The rapid production of     an acid        in   the animal ceconomy
does not appear impossible to         him, upon considering that              a
movement   of passion in men, as well as    animals,   in
                                                      suffi           is
cient to change the nature of certain of their humours .and
render them poisonous    and seeing that the Galvanic fluid
                             ;
often determines in animal and vegetable matters the forma
tion of an acid or an alkali, according to circumstances.
As to the whiteness which hair gradually undergoes from
age, he attributes to the want of secretion of the colour
                      it
ing matter.
     Independently    of the animal           matter which forms             the

    basis, there is in hair              a    colouring matter which may                     be se
    parated      from       it,   and    the shade          of   it   varies according to the
    colour      it    shows.       It   is    to this fat substance              that     M. Vau-
    quelin attributes the pliability, the elasticity, and the inal
    terability of hair.       certainly also to the same substance
                                    It   is
    that they owe the property of burning so rapidly, and form
    ing soap so abundantly with the alkalis.
      After' having treated the colouring matter of hair,                                             he
    endeavours to characterize                         the       animal       substance          which
    forms       it,   by
                  comparing     with all those already known.

     Without detailing all the experiments he made with this
     view, we shall only say that   was not gelatine; since the

      DEAR SIR,                                     Sept. 2O, I80G.
1 HAVB the honour to inclose you the following very inter
esting case, proving the efficacy of the vital air.
            Case  of Loss of yoke     cured by  vital Air.
   Miss Norton,      a  very amiable young lady, daughter of a
culler in Fish-Street Hill, London Bridge, from a severe
cold lost the use of her voice ; and notwithstanding much
medical assistance, she continued in that state upwards of a
year and a half.     She could not be heard except by the closest
attention; and spoke as in the lowest whisper. Her general
health was somewhat impaired, hut her lungs seemed unaf
fected.    I ordered her bark, and zinc, with valerian, and
the inhalation    of the vital air, a gallon a-day, diluted with
five   of common air. This plan was continued a month
without any sensible alteration.        No warmth was felt after
the inhalation, no alteration as to appetite ; in short, no
sensible difference, and the aphonia continued as before the
application.     I requested, therefore, to see the young lady
inhale the super- oxygenated air myself.            By mistaking the
orders delivered for using the pneumatic apparatus, I found
she had only been inhaling commoii air, and             I  pointed out
to her the mistake.       The same medicines were continued ;
and at once the benefit was perceptible to every one.               In   a
few days the voice recovered        its powers ; the     appetite    was
increased   ; a peculiar glow was felt ; and       in a fortnight this
lady was completely restored, and has since remained cured
upwards of six months.
           Observations    on this Case by  Dr. Thornton.
    1.  The loss of voice is     a disease  that   usually resists     all
common means made use of ; therefore, here the vital air is
a desideratum.

     $, The mode of cure is probably by strengthening those
 muscles which give tone to the voice.
     3. Hence, in the more oxygenated climate of England,
 the nightingale has so melodious a strain.
     4. And probably for the same        reason this poetic song
  ster only croaks  in Egypt, inlo which country it         retires  in
  the winter.
     5. Several of my patients have observed a remarkable
 strength of voice arising after inhaling the vital air.
     6. A decided experiment was made on this subject by a
 pneumometer invented by me, by which the capacity of the
 lungs may be ascertained : trying with this instrument the
 capacity of the chest of the right lion. Charles James Fox,
 Mr. Courtenay, Mr. Kemble, sir James Mackintosh, Bryan
 Edwards, &c.,     the power  of voice was found      to be in exact
 proportion to the quantity    of air inhaled,   and therefore pro
 bably to the oxygenation    of  the muscles    of the larynx.
     7. Mrs. Siddons made the following decided experiment.
 After inhaling a super-oxygenated air, she stationed a lady
 in a remote part of the boxes ; and upon the days the vital
 air was inhaled only, all her lower tones were most distinctly
 heard, and I noticed myself this remarkable effect.
                       I remain, dear sir,
                              sincerely yours,

        SIR,                      .           Beeston, September 1806.
XTAVING for      some time been     engaged    in making      experi
ments to ascertain what composts are most advantageous for
my land, I send you this letter for insertion in the Philoso
phical Magazine, hoping that it may be of some use to
farmers, and throw light upon a subject which has lately
attracted much attention.
    I will not now take up your time by relating the various
                                                            mixtures

mixtures made use of in my experiments ; suffice it to say,
that lime and dung, properly blended and fermented, proved
to be by far the most fertilizing of all that I tried.
   Having ascertained this fact, I was desirous to know
what proportion of lime was best to be mixed with the
dung.   I found, after various trials, that the best was one-
fourth by weight ; the largest quantity of nitre being pro
duced when the two were mixed in this proportion.
     To    hasten the process            of fermentation,
                                            I made my expe

through  which  a current of air was allowed to pass. When
the fermentation was over I analysed the residue; and I con
stantly found that pari of the lime had disappeared, and
that the nitre formed was always nearly iu the proportion of
two and one-twelfth to one of the lime anissing.
   From the results of my experiments I was led to con
elude, that potass takes about two-thirds of lime into its
composition.    The remaining one-third I suspect is oxy
gen, for reasons of which                        I    will inform you in my next,
in which you will                 receive an         accurate detail of my experi
ments.

     1806*.
A.   he superb blue colour known by                       the name of ultra-ma-
rine has not          as        yet   been   an      object of chemical inquiry :
chemists have              hitherto only made experiments upon lapis
lazuli, which             is,in some measure, the ore of ultra-marine,
and   it   is   never found in the state               of crystal one specimen

only excepted, in the possession                       of M. Guyton.
  A process employed to extract ultra-marine from its ma
                     is
trix which seems to have nothing analogous, and of the theory
upon which       founded we are entirely ignorant

this mixture is well made it is allowed to cool, and then
bruised, or ground with a pestle or roller in warm water.
This water soon        gets  dirty; it is then thrown away and new
water made use of, which soon assumes               a very   fine blue co
lour    :  when it is sufficiently saturated it is allowed to stand
some time, and then several other washings are taken from
the lapis lazuli, until the last water is no longer of a blue
colour.       These washings afterwards deposit a blue powder,
beautiful      in proportion to the richness of the lazuli. The
matrix       of the ultra- marine        remains    blended      with  the
mastic.
    In our      researches   we employed ultra-marine of various
qualities; but that which was the foundation of our estimate
of the proportions of its constituent parts, was the most beau
tiful     we could procure ; we only got it at the rate of two or
three percent, from a beautiful lazuli : nevertheless it was by
no means completely pure, but it was at least fifteen or twenty
times more so than the lazuli from which it was procured.
    The following are the results of our labours           :
     1st, The specific gravity of ultra-marine is          to that  of war
 ter   : : 2360   : 1000.
     2d, This substance, such         as   the process yields,    contains
 oily or resinous matters, which             are decomposed by fire ;
 their     charcoal is completely      burnt by the contact         of the
 air  ; the    ultra-marine    becomes     red, and   upon cooling re
 sumes its former         fine colour: in this operation it loses a
 little of its quality, and it is only by means of attrition
 that it is brought back to this state of fineness and softness
 which it had at first.
     3d,    In   a more violent     heat,    which    may be to 1500
 degrees of the centigrade thermometer,                the ultra-marine
 melts into a black enamel, if the mastic which is mixed
 with it is not completely burnt ; and it melts into transpa
 rent glass, almost colourless,          if  the mastic is completely
 burnt.       In this fusion it loses    12 per cent, of its weight.
     4th, Treated in the fire with borax, it easily gives a very
  transparent glass ; sulphur is liberated, and a little carbonic
  acid, the quantity of which varies according to the quality
  of the ultra-marine.
                                                                  5th, Ex?

   Sth, Exposed to the action of the electrical pile, the oxy
genating side discolours it completely ; the hydrogenating
side occasions no change.
  6th, Oxygen gas alters the colour of ultra-marine exposed
to a red heat, it makes it turn to a dirty green ; there is an
augmentation in weight of one per cent., probably owing
to sulphuric acid which is formed and fixed.
  7th, Hydrogen gas, in the same circumstances as oxygen,
Changes completely the colour of ultra-marine; it gives it a
reddish colour, and takes offils sulphur; no water seems to
be formed, although there is a loss                     of weight exceeding                 a
liltK- that of the sulphur.
    8th, Sulphur in fusion                does not discolour           it,   and after
volatilization the ultra-marine  as beautiful as ever.
                                              is
   gth, Liquid sulphurated hydrogen has no action upon                                  it
at all.
   10th, Neither has lime water.
   llth, Barytes water discolours         when heated, and
                                                       it                               is
afterwards found to contain silex and alumine.
   12th, The sulphuric, nitric, muriatic, and oxymuriatic acids
suddenly discolour ultra-marine      the three former, when
                                                   :
Concentrated, form with          very thick jelly; the latter
                                      it   a
acid dissolves  almost entirely.
                       it
   If the sulphuric and muriatic acids are diluted in water,
there     liberation of sulphurated hydrogen
         is   a                                the action of      ;
the nitric acid produces nitrous gas and sulphuric acid.
   13th, The acetous acid a:ts like the above acids, but much
more feebly.
   14th, Potash and soda in solution, heated with ultra-ma
rine, diminish its weight they then contain alumine. The
                                    ;
colour   is     not altered.
   If pure        potash    is   heated    strongly with ultra-marine, its
colour     is   destroyed    ;   the result   of the fusion   reddish, and
                                                                  is
acts almost as         if   the ultra-marine       was argil, or      a   stone com
posed of silex and alumine.
   15th, Ammonia has no action at all upon this substance.
   16th, Upon heating oil with ultra-marine, the weight of
the latter        is   found to be diminished               after washing        it   in an
 alkaline solution.
                                                                             1   7th, The

   303                    Memoir      upon   Ultra-marine.
      I /th, The analysis of ultra-marine appears to us more dif
  ficult than that of a stone composed in an analogous manner,
  although it is very attackable by the acids and alkalis.                 The
  disunion of its principles is not complete until the most de
  cisive action      of each o* the reagents generally employed.
      The quality of       the   ultra-marine we employed (which we
  could not regard as perfectly pure), and the variation which
  we found in it» constituent principles, determined us to study
  their nature better than their quantities.                   We assigned a
  distinct portion of ultra- marine to the investigation' of each
  of these principles, and, after uniting our results, we came!
  to the conclusion         that 100 parts of ultra-marine           are com
  posed     of,
                    Silex           -             -      35-8
                   Alumine               -        -      34'8
                   Soda              -          "
                                                  -      23-2
                   Sulphur            -           -        3-1
                   Carbonated lime                -•       3-1
                                                        100-0
     We always experienced              losses  of about  five p'er cent., and
 sometimes more.
     The carbonated lime which we found is not essential to
 the composition of ultra-marine, no more than the iron met
 with in ultra-marine of the first quality, produced from lazu-
 lite   a   little  saturated    with sulphurated        lime.    We do not
 even always meet with sulphur in this substance.
     The following        is the manner        in which we recognised      the
 nature     of   the four substances,         which to us appear to be     es
sential to ultra-marine:                              •
     Thirty grammes (one ounce) of fine ultra-marine, heated
with sulphuric acid, left a residue weighing 14-0. The li
quor evaporated presented some crystals of alum*, and plenty
of sulphate of soda in long needles.
    • It is
            probable that the alkali which had caustd this sulphate of alumine
to crystallize was potash arising from the ultra-marine; we do not, however,
assert this as a fact, because we could not protect this salt from the ammo-
niacal vapours which might be in the laboratory.
                                                                           All

                        Memoir upon Ultra-marine.                     363
       All these crystals, and       the liquor remaining, yielded, by
   means    of ammonia, 6-85 of dry alumine, and melted in the
   fire 9-60 of sulphate of soda. .
      We    have seen, by other experiments, that the alumine and
  soda were generally in greater quantity than that indicated
  by the action of the sulphuric acid.
      On passing muriatic acid gas through water in which 20
  grammes of ultra-marine was incessantly agitated for some
  time, we dissolved 18'4S. The remainder, being 1-52, had
x all the characters of silex.      We obtained from the solution 4'6
  of drv alumine;          muriate of soda, containing about four
  grammes of alkali ; and lastly, sulphate of barytes, contain
  ing six decigrammes of sulphur, supposing it composed of
  -Arodths of sulphuric acid, and the latter of -f^^ths of sul
  phur.
      If with alcohol      we treat the result  of the fusion  of twenty
  grammes       of  potash  with  five grammes     of ultra-marine, the
  weight of       the latter is diminished   one gramme, and the al
  cohol contains but very little silex and alumine; this loss is
  evidently owing to the soda of the ultra-marine, which aban
  dons the other principles, because            their combination     was
  broken by the potash in the fire.
      Upon treating of ultra-marine by carbonated soda, we
  got from 10 grammes 3-3 of silex, which had all its proper
  qualities in a less equivocal degree than it had formerly pre
  sented, when arising from ultra-marine treated by the acida
  or caustic alkalis.         We thought at first that it contained
  some foreign substance, but we could not discover any.
  In order      to characterize this silex properly we employed the
  usual methods ; among others, volatilization by the fluoric
  acid, which left it deposited like a jelly in the water which
  it  had passed through.
      Thus ultra-marine         yields on being decomposed,         silex,
  alumine, soda, and sulphur.
      Let it be recollected that this precious substance, such as
  the present process of extracting it affords, contains oily
  particles   ;  that soda is one     of its elements  ; and it may be
  added,    that the water, which was made use        of  to separate the
  ultra-marine from the mastic with which it was incorporated
                                                                        in

  364                     Galvanic Experiments,
 in  the ore, was soft to the touch,           like an alkaline ley ; it
 gave,   on  evaporation, an alkaline residue, and we may easily
 deduce from it the following theory :
    The mastic is mixed with the lazuli to combine oil with
 ultra-marine       in order to form a kind of soap, which warm
 water takes       away, rendering it a little soluble; while the
 matrix remains entangled in the mastic, from which it can
 not be dissolved so easily as the ultra-marine, because it
 wants    soda,    and   consequently cannot separate, like ultra
 marine, from the fat resinous substance, which forms a kind
 of net for it.      In a word,   the process   of extraction of ultra
 marine is     a true savonnage    (ley-making) ; — k-l the awkward-     .
 ness of this expression be excused on account of its con
 venience.
    We have here given what appears to us may be concluded
 from our experiments without hazarding too much.                 May
 this first experiment, upon a substance equally little known
 as it is singular, be followed by its artificial production !
 JJ X.   Gnlvanic Experiments by Mr. D. GARDNER, Lecturer
                on Chemistry at ike City Dispensary.
                             TO  Mr,   TUloch,
      DEAR SIR,
J.N the course of performing          a few galvanic experiments,     I
was induced to try the effect of that fluid on some of the
vegetable     infusions.
    Turmeric in distilled water was the first submitted to trial;
about six drachms in a glass tube containing two bright iron
wires, forming the circuit between two batteries containing
twenty- five plates of six inches square surface.             Gas was
given out from both wires, and the infusion became gradually
changed from a bright yellow to a deep brown, beginning
at the upper part      of the tube; both wires became black, most
probably     from    their combination with the oxygen evolved
from the water. The same quantity of the infusion of lit
mus in distilled water was subjected in the same manner to
the galvanic action : in a few minutes the blue tinge began
1p fade,    the liquor became more diaphanous, and at length
                                                             exhibited

       On the Oxidation       of Metals, particularly of Lead.            365
exhibited a greenish colour, gas being given out from both
wires, which also were turned black.
    These two experiments led me strongly to conceive that
an alkali must have been formed during the operations, see
ing that alkalis produce precisely the same effects : to prove
this,   I restored    the blue colour     of  the litmus by a few drops
of dilute sulphuric acid, thinking that              the acid would com
bine with the alkali formed ; which was the case : it was
again submitted to galvanic action, which effected a change
of the blue colour, and the production of a green as before.
    Taking a fresh quantity recently made, I changed its co
lour to red with the above acid, and, on galvanizing it in the
same manner,         had the pleasing satisfaction to find that the
red became very soon blue in consequence of a production of
 alkali which must have saturated the acid.
    Having     repeated these experiments several times with the
 same results,     I  was  fully  satisfied   as to the formation       of an
alkali ; but wanting more proof, to a portion of the infusion
 of litmus, which had been turned green, I added a few drops
of   the sulphate    of iron,   a slight precipitation of which in the
 state  of a  red oxide took place       : this is always the case when
 an uncombined          alkali is present.       Syrup      of violets diluted
 with an equal quantity of distilled water, and galvanized
 with silver or iron wires, turned as perfectly green as it
 could have done on the addition of pure ammonia, potash,
 or soda.      If these facts are in the least new or interesting,
 by their insertion in your valuable magazine you will much
 oblige,                       Yours respectfully,

     upon     the  Oxidation      of Metals,          and particularly       of
     Lead*.
 X have      been some time        in   the habit    of pursuing,     as often
 as my other occupations             would permit,          some experiments
                  • From Annates    de CHmie,  torn, lviii.  p. 52,
                                                                          upon

366         On the Oxidation  of Metak, particularly of Lead.
upon the         oxidation of metals, and particularly that of lead J
and as the results               I
                              obtained were of a nature sufficiently en
couraging            to induce me to proceed in my researches, I re
quest that, if you are of the same opinion, you will give that
degree  of publicity to them you may think proper.
  We know that upon rinsing a glass bottle with a littk
water and lead (small shot), the friction soon detaches small
portions of the lead, which, being suspended in the water,
give it at first a slate colour ; if the agitation is a little longer
continued, the water becomes grayish, and a little longer still,
it becomes whitish, until at last it is of a very fine white.
   This oxide of lead has such a tendency to unite with car
bonic acid, that when exposed to the open air, upon being
taken out of the water, it becames almost immediately co
vered with a pellicle           of a brilliant whiteness, which                      seems to
be nothing           else   than carbonate of lead.
     This oxide of      remains always under water without
                                 lead
experiencing any   sensible alteration, either in the shade or
in the light ; but    when         inclosed in
                                  if>            crystal bottle
                                                it   is                     a
full of atmospheric air, and containing      small quantity of       a
xvater, there         is    any of       it   sticking      to the      inside pf the bottle
above the        level      of   the water, and             if   the bottle   is   exposed    to
the rays of the sun, in this case the portion of oxide exposed
So    the   light will be seen to pass successively to the yellow,
and      from the yellow to the red, and thus furnish masticot
and  minium.
   This white oxide exposed       glass capsule to the heat of
                                                   in   a
afire, soon passes from the white to the yellow, and from the

   In  order to procure a continual         supply of fresh air in the

which almost met in the centre of the barrel in the form of
radii ; the other end of these tubes           protruded a few inches
from the outside       of the barrel,    to which they were soldered
at their   junction with it       so closely as not to admit     of any
water escaping.

   In No.     2. there are pieces     of oxide dried in    the  air in a
glass capsule;       the  brilliant white surface of it    was exposed
to the air of      a room during its desiccation, and the porous

the glass of the capsule.

the tube, and become yellow,            then red, by simple exposure
to the light of the sun.           The tube is sealed hermetically,

   InNo. 4. is      the same oxide, hanging in a tube hermetically
sealed,   also filled partly with water and partly with air, ext-
posed    for  a very long time to the light on one side, but
coated on the other with a mixture            of wax  and lamp-black.

     Correspondent at Munich, upon some galvanko-magnetie
     Experiments recentty made ty M. RITTER *.

AT      the last sitting of       the    academy     on the 16th instant,
M.    Rittcr communicated           the first part   of a series of experi
ments intended to ascertain            the nature of magnetism ; hav
ing    been led to the subject by the questions proposed by our
academy in 1776 and 1777.                 He begins by establishing the
analogy      between    magnetism        and    electricity.      The principal
results of his experiments, of which I have often been an
eye witness, are as      follow      :
     1. That   each magnet or needle may be regarded as equi
valent    in  point of electrical relation to a pair of heteroge
neous associated metals. The different poles respectively
represent the two dissimilar metals.
     2. Consequently       each magnet, like these metals, pro*
duces electricity.      One of the poles gives positive electricity,
and the other negative         electricity.
     3. A circle of magnets also constitutes in analogous cir
cumstances a battery of Volta; and in this manner the au
thor    succeeds in demonstrating, by means of the electrome
ter, the electricities produced by the poles of this circle of
 magnets.
     4. This battery of magnets exercises upon living bodies,
or such as are recently dead, on account of its strength, the
 same effects as a     Voltaic column of           equal strength.
     5. These experiments demonstrate, that in iron magnet
 ized, the south pole yields positive electricity, and the north
 pole the negative.         On the contrary, in the magnetized
 steel, the north pole yields positive electricity, and the south.
 pole yields negative.
     The   same inverse distribution          is observed       in the oxidabi-
 lities (modified by magnetization) of the magnetized body.
In iron submitted to this operation, the south pole is the
 most oxidable, and the north pole is the least. In magnetized

oxidahle, and the south pole the least.
    M.   Ritter concludes his report with conjectures upon the
application of his results to the earth, considered as one
great magnet.        In this    he finds the explanation          of several
phaenomena,      chiefly of    the physical diversity     of the two     he
mispheres and       of the  aurorae borealis and australis.
    According    to these principles,       the   earth  considered     as a
magnet may be represented            as equivalent to a   Voltaic column
of  an enormous size, in which the poles are on one hand in
continual communication           by the intermedium of the waters
of the ocean ; while on the other the superabundant electric
matter, finding no conductor, flies off into the free spaces of
the heavens, and there produces the polar aurora.

 J. HE above society has announced two prizes, the one a
gold medal of 200 franks in value for the best essay, and
the other of 1 00 franks in value for the next in merit, on
either of the nine following questions :
    1. Does there exist a process for constantly                  obtaining
kermes of the same colour and nature ?
    What     are   the   causes     of the differences presented by
kermes, prepared        several     times successively after the very
same process     ?
    2. How comes it         that whey does not always clarify             of
the    same   colour?      Why       does  it  sometimes redden, and
sometimes render green          the  blue colours?    And to what cause
ought we to attribute its faculty of keeping a longer time
in vessels of tin than in those of clay ?
    3.  Which    is the best process for obtaining the purest and
most energetic emetic        ?
    What change       does   the emetic tartar, or its solution           in
pure water, undergo through time, either on account                  of the
action of light, air, or heat ?

    What   are the alterations which the above salt undergoes
in the various vehicles employed to administer it in, and
particularly lemonade, orange-water, whey, &c. &c. ?
     4. What is the difference between electuaries recently-
prepared, and those which are several years old ?
     5. Which is    the best method       of preserving the various
parts of plants, in regard to their      aroma,   colour, the time of
gathering, their alterability, and the method of preserving
them from insects ?
     6. Endeavour to ascertain the natural families of the ve
getables   from their chemical properties ; i. e. determine the
principles which occasion the differences between them.
     7. Point out the best method of preparing distilled wa
 ters from aromatic plants, or such as are said to be inodor
ous either in B.    M. or in    the open fire.
     Which of    these waters ought       to be prepared    with plants
 previously carefully dried ? and
                                 —       is drying a good method     of
 preserving them     a long time without alteration?
     8. Which are the extracts that ought to be prepared
from green, and which from dry plants, by maceration, in
 fusion, decoction, or evaporation ?
     Q. The products of the infusion or decoction of inodorous
 substances   not being the same, determine wherein the dif
 ference consists, compare the two methods of analysis upon
 vegetable matters which do not contain volatile principles.
 Thus, for instance, we know that an infusion of coffee dif
 fers very much from       coffee   a long time boiled ; we know
 also, that meat-broth       is   more    gelatinous when obtained
                                                                     we
 by slow ebullition than by a hasty boiling; lastly,
 know that the extracts      of   plants  become   partly  insoluble by
 means of the prolonged action of boiling water.               Give the
 theory of these phaenomena.
     The members of the Pharmaceutic Society themselves are
 excluded from obtaining the above prizes; but every fo
  reigner whatever may write for them.
     The various essays must be transmitted on or before the
  1 st of December,    1 806, to M. Bouillon Lagrange, secretary
  to the society, at Paris.

              BLEACHING      BY THE MURIATIC ACID.
JJouBTS    having been started on the advantages of this
process, the following publication appeared on the subject
in the Monileur of the 1 6th of May, 1 806.
  Messrs. Descroizilles,     bleachers, after Berthollet's method,
at Rouen,   having       been consulted by the prefect of the
Lower Seine department, were desired to found their report
upon the opinion of one of the most celebrated calico-printers
in Europe,    M.
               Oberkampf. The result of their application to
M.   Oberkampf, as contained in the answer of M. Widmer,
his nephew, who directs the manufactories, was ; that for
these fifteen years past, M. Oberkampf has constantly used
this process for bleaching linens and cottons, both mixed
and unmixed,                             much stronger
                   and that they always assumed
colours than when bleached by the old process.    It is             "
true," says M. Widmer, " that there are many pieces of
cloth in the market extremely        ill   bleached ;   England in par-
                                Bb    2                             ticular

 3T2               Martial Ether — Miscellaneous.
 ticular   has exported the greatest         quantity of such cloth.
 The fault does not lie with the process, but arises from the
 ignorance of some bleachers, who have made use of the oxy
 genated muriatic acid without knowing how to appreciate its
 effects.    When    the stuffs   have  been    incompletely bleached
 by this process, they labour under the serious inconvenience
 of retaining a wine tint after being maddered. Let bleach
 ers acquire some notions       of chemistry, and these inconve
 niences will soon give way to the superior advantages of the
 Bertholian process.
    Messrs. Descroizilles      add, that care must be taken not to
 employ      soap in bleaching cloths intended for printing.
 Cloths    well bleached by any process, but finally soaped, will
 never receive a perfect impression or maddering, unless, be
 fore they are printed, they be cleaned with great care from
 the oil left by the soap.       It cannot be taken off by the most
 careful washing,       and  it absolutely requires new alkaline
         '
 leys.
    Thus    the discovery of M. Berthollet, when properly em
 ployed    and  without the interference of soap, certainly de
 serves to be preferred to the old process, which requires
much more trouble, and besides is not practicable in winter.
                           MARTIAL ETHER.
    M. Tromsdorf       has maintained     sulphuric   ether, when di
gested over red oxide of iron, to be a very good medicinal
preparation as a tonic and antispasmodic.                 M. Cadet, a
chemist of Paris, has endeavoured          to ascertain from his own
experience the reality      of  the action    of this fluid upon the
metallic.oxide;     and it results from his experiments, that ether
never acts upon the red oxide             of iron unless it still con
tains some acid ; and in this case        a  sulphate of iron is form
ed, which is generally precipitated in such a manner that
the presence of the portion retained by the ether is only
manifested by the most sensible reagents.

    On Tuesday, the 2d of September, the Knippenbuhl Rock,
which formed the summit of Mount Rosenberg, in the can
ton of Switz in Switzerland, was suddenly detached, along
with a great portion of the mountain.               This tremendous
body    rolled  down   into the  valley,  which   separates the Lake
of Zug from that of Lauwertz, overwhelming four whole
Tillages, and destroying part of several others.          Upwards of
1000 persons were killed by this disaster, and only thirty re
main alive out of the whole population of the district where
it happened.

  I.  Recipe for an elastic and permanent Varnish for Hats
     or Helmets of Felt, Gaiters, or other Parti of Dress in
     leather, «.* Boo/5 and Shoes, and winch may be also cm-
     ployed with Success in varnishing Cloth and           Linen*.
                             First Operation.
  JLx is necessary, in the first place, to free the hats, or other
  articles of felt, from all the gum which they may contain.
  This maybe easily effected hy washing them in warm water,
  and afterwards pressing them.             Before they are perfectly
  dry, they must be placed on moulds in order that they may
  be preserved in their proper shape, and be without wrinkles,
  —a very essential requisite. New leather, as well as old,
  must be scraped in order to clear its superficies from the
  wax or grease with which it is impregnated.                Colophony,
  or resin in powder, laid upon a coarse brush, also removes
  the grease perfectly well.
     Second Operation.   — All    felt hats have    a kind   of down or
  nap, of which they must          be cleared, when dry,        hy means
  of pumice-stone    ; and every part      of  the hat where the var
  nish   is to be applied must be smoothed             in this manner.
  Leather must be smoothed in the same manner also to re
  move all inequalities, and even the marks of the scraper.
     The same method must he pursued with cloths or linens.
     Third Operation. —The down being removed in the man
  ner above described,     a coat  of the black varnish, to      be after
  wards mentioned,     must be laid on the articles to be var-
, nished. They must be allowed to dry well upon their moulds,
  that they may not assume any wrinkles, which prevent the
  proper distribution of the varnish.

4       Recipe     J$r      an clastic and permanent Varnish,
   Fo'urth Operation. — This first coat of varnish being per
fectly dry, the pumice-stone must be again resorted to, in
order to remove any small inequalities which may remain.
   Fifth Operation. — When the air is dry and warm, a se
cond coat of the black varnish must be applied,                                  and also
polished with the pumice-stone.
    Sixtk Operation. — The finishing hand must now    be put
to the article by laying on the varnish to be afterwards de
scribed, taking care to emptoy for this purpose a small and
compact pencil, in order to spread the varnish uniformly
and equally.
    When the first coat of varnish               is well      dried, it must be
sprinkled with puniire-stone           to fine powder, and
                                              reduced
then rubbed all over with      wet sponge, or a piece of
                                          a
fine linen rag also wetted, in order to render the varnish
perfectly smooth; or in place of pumice-stone, with tripoli
soaked in oil and rubbed with the palm of the hand.      As
to the second and last coat of varnish, it must be polished
when well dried, by sprinkling it with starch and rubbing it
with a piece of old linen rag, which will give it a very fine
lustre.
   In the event of the varnish being tarnished, or losing its
lustre by long usage, in order to restore                    it,   place the articles
of felt or leather in boiling water for                      a     minute,       then let
them dry thoroughly, sprinkle them with starch, and rub
them with     piece of dry Imen, and they will resume their
              a
former lustre.

AMONG those whose professions                             lead them to the prepara
tion and application of medicines, there are various opinions
upon the efficacy of waters distilled from plants described as
inodorous.    shall
                  I            by
                        no means decide upon the question
in   medical point of view
     a                         shall only request that before
                                            ;  I
entering on the discussion the question be stated in precise
terms.
 I       was induced         kst summer              to repeat some experiments on
the distillation        of inodorous plants, in consequence of                             read
ing   some observations on the subject                       in     a   former number         of

 The observations of the learned author in the above me

a   new direction to his useful researches.

  faction when they have been distilled in B. M.; and I hope
  to be able to prove by and by, that the putrefaction to \\liich
  even waters distilled from aromatic plants are subject, is
 owing to    a portion of the decoction of the plants being ex-
 Iravasated, or forced into the tubes of the apparatus, uheu
 distillation in the open fire is made use of.
    Before proceeding to explain some of the probabilities
 upon which I rest my opinion, that down to the present
 moment the greater part of such waters as are distilled from
 plants in the open fire have been adulterated with th^ir re
 spective extracts, I consider it my duty to say a few words
 on the subject of alembics.          My hints are the results of a
 course   of reflections  and  experiments on the improvement
of the    above apparatus, in which      I have been constantly oc
 cupied since the year 1775, a space of more than 30 years.
    The old chemists had certainly observed, that during the
ebullition of water a part of that fluid is thrown to a height
of more than     30 centimetres in a multitude         of small drops
or globules,     which can with difficulty be perceived by the
naked eye.       They must have also observed, that during the
 time of distillation the decoction of plants has the property
of swelling up when boiling, and of being raised with the
greatest facility into the neck of the cucurbits; they conse
quently contracted their distilling apparatus to moderate the
 tendency of the boiling liquor to bubble up, and they inter
posed between the cucurbit and the           head   cylindrical   tubes,
«ther straight or spiral, or zigzag,          8cc., and    of  a length
equally inconvenient and unreasonable.
    Baume, to whom, in spite of his obstinacy in rejecting the
theory of pneumatic chemistry, we are indebted for a great
number of useful observations,         has particularly contributed
to the reform    of  the construction   of alembics;      but in bring
ing   the head so near the   body of   the alembic as     he has done,
he has fallen into an opposite extreme, the inconvenience of
which did not occur to me until within these two years.
At the above period I interposed between the body and the
head of my alembic a cylindrical             funnel 40 centimetres
high. Besides, gave I       an  inverse   inclination    the length of
a decimetre to the beak, at the place where it is soldered to
                                 A  4                                the

the head of the alembic.          I  had a long time before       sup
pressed the ridge or furrow in the latter.
    By means of      these precautions, and of some others which
I   am   about to communicate, I obtained distilled waters,
which never putrefied although the plants were distilled in
the open fire, and with a strong ebullition ; and although
I  afterwards put these waters into bottles with ground-stop
pers exposed to the rays of the sun, and in an apartment
constantly heated by a stove, they preserved all the delicacy
of their aroma and their limpidity.
    We know that the orange flower water,            prepared  at Paris
with great care, ouo;ht to be kept in a eool place, and in the
shade, in vessels not closely corked, if we wish to prevent
their undergoing any alteration ; but we know also that the
orange flower water, which comes from our southern de
partments in large bottles of very thin copper, is preserved
a much      longer time without         alteration, although they are
,well corked.      I  have  reason    to believe that this difference
arises from the distillers    of Provence making       use of alembics
of   the old form      with long necks, while those       of Paris em
ploy   the  modern flat alembics.         I know it will be said that
a little spirit is mixed with the Provence orange water; but
I  do not think, if that were the case, that the quantity ot
spirits thus added is sufficient to stop, for so long a time, the
putrefaction of a distilled water, which contained a little of
the extract from which it was produced.
    Some chemists complain that pure water, when distilled
onec, still shows traces      of  the    muriatic acid when tried by
the nitrate of silver ; they consequently prescribe that this
water should be redistilled.        I request them to take the pre
cautions     I  have   here suggested,     and they will obtain  at the
first distillation purer distilled water than they could other-
wise do by two distillations.                •
    Although these observations are very succinct, I flatter
myself they will excite the attention of such chemists or
artists  as    make use of alembics ; and the question of the
properties     of waters distilled from plants being plaeed in this
new point of view, there must consequently be more cer
tainty in the observations of such medical gentlemen as have
a partiality for these kinds ot' medicines.

   Before concluding my observations on distillation b? alem
bics, I shall briefly notice the various improvements I have
successively made on these articles, a great number of which
J   have made both for myself and my friends.
  Since the year 1775, I have used cylindrical instead of
serpentine tubes, sometimes straight, flattened, inclined, or
vertical, but always so disposed as to accelerate the distilla
tion greatly by their largeness ; and being perfectly well po
lished,      I
         could easily clear them, after every new operation,
from every foreign taste or smell.
  Before any thing had been announced relative to what
might be made of the heat contained in the vapours which
form by their condensation the distilled liquids, I presented
to the National Institute an alembic, where this heat was
rendered profitable in producing the rectification of the pro
duce of an anterior distillation, and in preparing the subse
quent distillation.
    The following are the principal advantages of the alembic
of which I       about to publish a description ; and in the
                  am
construction of it I have observed every possible precaution,
in order to oeconomize the heat and to facilitate the opera
tions.
  Every part of it must be of pewter.

tion  consequently effected much more quickly, and with
        is
much less fuel.

  Itt      On Waters distilled from inodorous Plants.
     After  the most nauseous   distillation,   all the parts of the
 alembic may be so cleaned in a quarter of an hour, that the
 most delicate liqueur may be immediately distilled in it.
     Such is the result of the experiments of more than thirty
 years.    I alone know what this experience has cost me;
 I shall, however, consider myself in some measure indem
 nified for my labours, if these hints shall be of any service to
 the progress of the arts and sciences.
     Note by M. Deyeux.-^-l do not rightly understand what
 the author means in the beginning of the above memoir.
 He   seems desirous that the question        relative to the efficacy
of waters distilled from inodorous plants should be stated in
 precise terms.     It appears to me that this question cannot
 be presented    in the form of a problem, since it has been
proved, by a multiplicity of experiments, that it is highly
improper to doubt the efficacy of waters distilled from these
kinds of plants.
    As to  the observations relative to the necessity     of distilling
these waters    in B.  M.,  or at least  of rectifying them in this
manner, I am not only          of   opinion, that in some cases
such a process may be useful, but I also think that the
above method is not always sufficient to obtain distilled
waters in a state which may bid defiance to all alteration.
I have often had occasion to distil waters in B. M. ; and in
spite of this precaution I have remarked that some of these
waters become turbid at the end of a month, and that they
often acquired a disagreeable smell and taste.
    To conclude : As the author announces a work upon di
stillation in general, and as he also promises us some details
upon the best form of alembics, I shall wait for the pub
lication of his memoir, which will, without doubt, contain
the results of experiments made         with that    care and acute-
ness    which characterize    every   production     of M. Descroi-
zilles.

III.    Extract of a Memoir, by A. LAUOIER, on a new Prin
     ciple in Meteoric Stones.   Read in the French National
     Institute March 10, 1806 *.
OIXCK       the period when        Mr. Howard called                     the attention       of
the learned      to   the substances           called meteoric stones,' every
chemist who repeated his experiments has met with the same
results. All agree that they had discovered in these stones,
at whatever time or place they had fallen to the ground,                                    the
same principles ;viz. silex, iron, magnesia, sulphur, nickel,
and accidentally traces of lime and alumine.     Upon com
paring the results of their analyses, we find that the above
principles were found very nearly in the same proportions
in   each experiment.          M.          Proust      has latterly discovered the
existence of     manganese          in such meteoric stones                       as he    ana-
lysedj      and the fact has since been confirmed by other che
mists.
     M. Laugier, assistant-professor of natural history, is
charged with the analyses for the Museum of Natural His
tory. Upon analysing a meteoric stone which had fallen at
Verona in 1663, he discovered                     a   principle hitherto unknown
to exist in these substances.                     This new principle,               which is
chrome,       is the subject       pf M. Laugier's memoir.
     "    It is probable,"     he says,           "   that     I   should not have dis
covered the chrome, had                I    not made use            of   a   mode     of   ana
lysis totally new.   Hitherto                 the acids
                                        have been always re
sorted to ; and this         is,
                         perhaps, the most natural and conve
nient process on the present occasion, however, employed
                  ;                                                           I
caustic alkali.   This has the peculiar advantage of showing
the presence of chrome, however small in quantity whereas                         ;
it   almost impossible to perceive
     is                               when      dissolved in

the acids, particularly since      then mixed with

quantity      of iron, manganese, &c."
     M.Laugier had recourse, therefore, to the following pro
cess for separating the chrome    and he determined its pro
                                                  ;

  with    three parts  of caustic potash; he diluted the mass with
  distilled water, which became of a yellow or greeriish yellow
  colour on account of the manganese; the latter was precipi
 tated on being allowed to rest, and the solution then resumed:
 its pure yellow colour. This solution, joined with the water
 of the washings, and sufficiently diluted in water, which is
 necessary to prevent the precipitation of the silex, is hyper-
 saturated with a slight excess of nitric acid..       He poured into
 this solution      nitrate  of mercury    at the minimum, recently
 prepared ; there was immediately formed an orange red pre
 cipitate or chromate of mercury, which he allowed to rest
 until the evening of next day. He decanted the liquor, and
 added several fresh waters in order to wash the precipitate,
 and when the latter had become quite tasteless he poured
 the whole into a platina crucible ; the water was evaporated,
 the chromate      of mercury    became   dry, and was soon decom
 posed into a green oxide of chrome, the quantity of which
 amounted to one hundredth of the stone employed.
    As this Verona stone is similar in its physical properties
to all the other meteoric stones, the author of the memoir
thought       himself   bound to examine      if the latter contained"
chrome       as  well  as  the former.     He successively examined
fragments of       stones which had fallen at Ensisheim,       1'Aigle,
Barbotan       near   Bourdeaux,    and  at  Apt  ; and he also found
chrome in these four stones.
    It   is also remarkable that the Verona stone         in which he
first discovered this metal        contained the least of the wholes
five ; the others contained one hundredth part, while that
only contained half that quantity of chrome.
    M. Vauquelin has made a very favourable report of the
above memoir.          According to its author, M. Laugier, 'the
following conclusions may be drawn :
    1. That the five meteoric stones which fell at Verona,
Barbotan,       Ensisheim,    1'Aigle,  and  Apt, contain   the metal
called chrome in the proportion of about one hundredth part,
exclusive of the other principles already ascertained by other
chemists.
    2. That it is very probable that all the meteoric stones
                                                              contain

             On Me ligneous Part        of Gray Ipecacuanha.            13
contain    this principle, since they resemble each other so
much in their chemical and physical properties, and as it
seems they have all the same origin.
   3. That in most cases          it is indispensable, in ntaking a
correct chemical analysis, to treat the same substance both
by the acids and the alkalis, since it has been demonstrated
by experiments that a principle which the acids could not
discover, may be ascertained by means             of the alkalis.
IV.    Observations upon the emetic Property of the ligneous
   Part of Gray Ipecacuanha, and Analysis of that Root.
   By M. HENKY, Professor of Chemistry In the School of
    Pharmacy, and Member of the Pharmaceutical Society of
   Paris*.
ZXMONG        those  authors who have          written      on the subject
of ipecacuanha,      we may reckon Adrien-Helvetius, Boulduc,
Geoffrey,     Neumann,      Cartheuser, Lewis, and more recently
Lassone jun. and Cornette, who, in the Memoirs of the
Royal Society of Medicine of the 31st of August 1779, have
given analyses of this root, and have demonstrated that
"  the ligneous part is very nearly as emetic as that which is
separated from it."
    Last of all, Murray, in the first volume of his Materia
Mcdica (Apparatus Medicaminum) , p. 804, relates, without
asserting any thing positively,
                                        " that, lately in France, (he
quotes Lassone and Cornette,) it has been remarked that
the ligneous part of this root was equally efficacious with
the cortical part ; that it contained as much resin and ex
tract ; and that an equal dose        of it excites vomiting and al-
Jays dysentery."
    In  spite   of the experiments of Lassone and Cornette, it
seems    that  the ligneous part is never used, and apothecaries
are condemned who are not careful of rejecting it from their
preparation of the ipecacuanha powder.
   .Nobody, so far as I know, has repeated the experiment*

                                                                announced

    14               On the emetic Property        of the
    announced by Murray, and extremely well described in the
    memoir of Lassone jun.        In order to set aside every doubt
   which may be yet raised,     I   shall give an account of the ex
    periments lately made in the hospitals of Paris.
       I made choice of gray ipecacuanha, the ligneous part of
   which I separated carefully, so       as   to leave no doubt   of any
   of the cortical part remaining.          I  collected 500 grammes
   (one pound), which I pulverized.         The powder was whitish :
   I sent portions of it to the different chief apothecaries of the
   Hotel-Dieu, the Hospital of St. Anthony, and the Hospice
   de la  Maternite.
      The experiments     made    in  these    different places  proved
   that this part was,  as announced by Murray, equally         emetic
  and purgative.      M. Chaussier, professor in the School of
  Medicine and physician to the Hospice de la Maternite,
  assured   me   that the wood of ipecacuanha had succeeded
.  every time he employed it.
      The experiments were pursued for a month at least, and
  the results were constantly the same.
      Messrs. "Latour and Morisset, of the Hotel-Dieu and the
  Hospital of St. Anthony^ deserve my warmest thanks ; they
  traced the effects of ligneous ipecacuanha with the utmost
  precision, and they assured me they were constantly similar.
      In confirming the experiments of Messrs. Lassone and
  Comette, which establish the emetic property of the ligneous
  part of ipecacuanha, I do not mean to announce any new
  fact ; but, as I had often heard of its inefficacy, I thought
  the best method would be to analyse ipecacuanha carefully,
  in order  to put an end to all doubts on the subject.         I  shall
•
  now proceed     to communicate     my analysis.
      After having carefully  separated     the cortical and ligneous
  parts, I  treated each separately, by sulphuric ether, rectified
  alcohol, and water.
      Ten grammes of the cortical part, digested in 150 grammes
  of ether, slightly coloured the liquor: the ether evaporated
  to dryness ; there remained upon the sides of the vessel seven
  decigrammes of resinous matter, inflammable and inso
  luble in water, and presenting all the characters of the
  resins.

                  ligneous Part      of Gray Ipecacuanha.              19
    An   equal      quantity of the cortical part yielded by the
medium of rectified alcohol six decigrammes of resin.
    This same part of the root in the same quantity, digested
in   20O grammes         of distilled water, furnished by evaporation
a dry     extract weighing one gramme eight decigrammes.
This extract is entirely soluble in water, of a citrine tolour,
and   of  a slightly bitter taste.
    Lastly,     the same     substance, treated     by boiling water in
the same        proportions, yielded      a greater  quantity of extrac
tive matter by nearly two grammes five decigrammes.
    I now operated upon the ligneous part in the same man
ner with the same agents, and             I obtained the following    re
sults :
    1st,  By the sulphuric ether, three decigrammes of resin.
    3d, By rectified alcohol, two decigrammes five centi
grammes of resin.
    3d, By cold water, one gramme four decigrammes                 of dry
extract.
    4th, By boiling water, two grammes and eight decigram
mes    of extractive matter.
    It often happens that alcohol diss«lves more soluble matter
than ether;        this difference is owing to the fluid taking off
with the resiu a small quantity of extract, but it is easy to
separate    it.
    In order      to    ascertain which of those      two parts excited
vomiting,       or   if  both  of   them had equally an emetic and
purgative property,          I  tried each   of them    separately in the
hospitals of Paris.
    From     the observations        of medical practitioners it results
that the    resinous part, in a dose of four grains, possesses a
decisive emetic and purgative property.
    The method of administering it consists in mixing the
resin with a small quantity of sugar, and adding thirty or
fifty grammes of water.
    As to the extractive part, the effects were the same : but
the dose was greater, namely, about six or eight grains.
    After this short explanation it is easy to see, that if the
cortical part of the root of ipecacuanha and the ligneous part
bolh contain the same principles, they should enjoy the
                                                                    same

  16         On the ligneous     Part of Gray Ipecacuanha.
 same properties, although          there  is  a  very    small difference
 between the proportions of resin and of extract they furnish.
    The cortical part, exposed to the action of boiling water,
 swells up like Bassora gum ; treated with the nitric acid, in
 the proportion of six parts of acid, of thirty degrees, to one
 of the bark, there is a good deal of nitrous vapours liberated,
 and malic acid is obtained as the residue              :  this leads us to
 regard    this matter not      as  a  resin, but    as a   particular gum
mixed with resin and extract, which alone give it an emetic
property ; for I am certain that this matter has no property
at all, after having experienced the action of alcohol and
water.
    But   there is a fact  of which no author,        to my knowledge,
has    spoken.      Every   time   we   boil  the  cortical   part, the de-
eoction becomes turbid, and a kind of cloud is formed in
the liquor    :  if it is filtered a whitish       matter is deposited,
which at first I took for glue, but when well examined it
presented some of the properties of caoutchouc.                 It becomes
coloured after some         time without experiencing any altera«
tion ; is easily dissolved in ether and alcohol at 60 degrees.
This particular matter, which I am certain is an elastic gum,
retains    a great  quantity of ieculum.
    An infusion of the cortical part yields by the re-agents
the following results :
    It strongly    reddens   the colour   of turnsole.
    The solution of glue does not change the transparency of
the   liquor.
    The sulphuric acid makes it very turbid.
    The nitrate of silver forms a white precipitate.
    The muriate of barytes forms no precipitate.
    The tartrites of potash and of antimony form no precipi
tate.
    The oxalate of ammonia furnishes a slight precipitate.
    The same results are got from an infusion of the ligneous
part.
   Decoctions       of the ligneous      and   cortical parts act in the
same manner.
   These experiments seem to prove that the root of ipeca
cuanha contains, 1st, free acid of a vegetable nature decom
                                                                    posable/

 posable    by   the action    of caloric    ; 2<1,  different salts with     a
 base  of lime    : in short,  that the cortical        and    ligneous parts
 contain very nearly the same materials ; which confirm the
 experiments of Lassone and Cornette, and those recently
 made in the hospitals of Paris.
    This root, distilled in the naked fire in a small glass re
 tort well luted, yielded the following products; water, oil,
 acetous acid containing oil, and elastic fluids.
    In my last analysis I incinerated the root of ipecacuanha:
 thirty grammes of it placed in a crucible were reduced to a
 small quantity of ashes, which, being leyed, yielded very
little saline matter, about fifteen centigrammes of sulphate
of lime, mixed with a small quantity of a muriate of a kind
 I did not know.
    Such is the result of my experiments.                   I hope they will
remove all uncertainty, and be productive of some utility.
V. Memoir         upon Coffee.       By C. L. CADET, Apothecary
             in Ordinary to the Imperial Household*.
(CHEMICAL         researches   are often directed to the analyses            of
substances more curious than useful;              while those which are
familiar   to every one, and in daily use,              are but too much
neglected.      Such were the considerations which induced me
to undertake the following experiments upon that salutary
article of nourishment — coffee.
    When we reflect that this colonial produce takes out of
France more than thirty millions annually, and that it oc
casions an immense consumption of sugar, always to the
advantage      of foreigners, it certainly         becomes        chemists to
examine its nature and explain its medicinal virtues.
    BourdtTm, Geoffrey, Rihiner, and some others, have al
ready   published analyses         of coffee; but their          labours, have
taught us    nothing,    because science, at the time they wrote,
was    not far enough advanced, and they wanted the most
useful re-agents. Without thinking myself wiser than they,

 I shall     perhaps be more fortunate in throwing                    light upon
 this substance, iu             a   manner   as yet   new.
                              Examination of dry       Coffee.
      Dry
        Coffee treated               with Water. —When boiling          water is
 poured upon dry coffee,            nitet wiih in the shops,

the water becomes yellowish green *.    If the action of heat
is continued, the decoction becomes brown, and a slight
scum is formed, which remains insoluble; when filtered it
passes      very   clear, and becomes           turbid upon cooling.  A
little caustic       potash          poured into this decoction makes it
more brown.     Ammonia produces the same effect.      Lime
water produces an abundant flaky precipitate ; sulphate of
iron converts it into a black ink. Solution of gelatine does
not become         turbid        upon being mixed with this decoction.
The oxymuriatic                acid only partly discolours it ; and if an
alkali is added to the mixture it becomes red.
   Distillation. — I distilled eight pounds of water over a
pound of dry coffee.      I obtained a very aromatic water, on
which floated some drops of a concrete oil like that of the
myrica cerifera.     The decoction remaining in the alembic
was viscous.     I diluted it a little with w.ater, and poured
alcohol into  it;  an abundant matter was precipitated, which
being collected on the filter was soluble in water, and had
all the characters of a mucilage.    The coffee from which
the water had been distilled, dried in a stove, and digested
in alcohol, furnished a tincture which precipitated by means
of water.
  The watery decoction of dry coffee does not redden the
blue vegetable colours : it even gives a green colour to turn
sole tincture.  Every chemist who has analysed coffee before
my   time has  said that the decoction holds a free acid su
spended in         it,              the blue vegetable colours.

     General Proportions of the abo«e constituent Parts. — Al
 though it maybe of little service to ascertain the proportions
 of   the immediate principles          of   coffee, since these proportions
 must vary on account of the greater or less maturity or rich
 ness of the article, yet I considered it my duty to estimate
 these proportions as nearly as possible.                 After   several com
 parative     experiments,       I  found that       eight ounces of coffee
 yielded about one ounce of mucilage, one drachm of resin,
 one drachm of extracto-colour'mg matter, 3-4 drachms of
 gallic acid, five ounces 3^- drachms of parenchyme, and ten
 grains of vegetable albumen.
     I compared       the decoctions and tinctures         of the    three dried
 coffees     of Bourbon, Moka, and Martinique. Bourbon and
 Martinique coffee seemingly furnished the same principles
 in the same proportions.                That of Moka differs essentially
 from the rest.         Its decoction       was     much less saturated, its
 alcoholic tincture was higher coloured than similar tinctures
 of the Bourbon and Martinique coffees ; it contains less
 gum, less gallic acid, more resin, and more aroma than the
 others.
                                Poasted Coffee.
    In order       to ascertain the changes            produced upon coffee
by roasting, I         examined the phenomena which took place
 while it was burnt in the open air.
    At first it augments in volume as it is penetrated by calo
ric; it crackles and becomes fawn-coloured;                         the pellicle
which envelops the bean is detached ; as it is very light and
 slender, it flies off with the least breath. The coffee then
emits      a very    agreeable     aromatic flavour.         This vapour in
creases      in its intenseness, the            bean  smokes and becomes
brown      :  the smell then       changes and         becomes     slightly em-
pyreumatic;         the coffee exudes         and becomes oily at its sur
face*; it       ceases to    smoke;       and    if the action   of    the fire is
continued the coffee is charred.

     The interval between roasted coffee becoming higher co
loured and its being charred, is so long, that it is extremely
 difficult to determine the point when it is necessary to stop,
 in order to preserve the agreeable properties of the beans ;
 but, in order to approximate to this point, so important to
 ascertain, I reckoned three distinct epochs in the roasting:
  1st, The bean loses its natural colour and passes 10 that of
 bread- raspings or dry almonds:              2<1, The coffee becomes of
 the brownish red colour          of Indian chestnuts: 3d, Although
almost black, it is not, however, charred.
     I took six ounces of Martinique coffee and divided them
into three parts, which I roasted separately, and each of
them to one of the above three degrees.
    The two ounces, lightly roasted, of the colour of dry al
monds,       lost two drachms in the fire             :  this I shall call   the
first degree.
    The two ounces roasted of the chestnut colour lost three
drachms: this was my second degree.
    The two ounces         roasted    black    lost three drachms forty-
eight grains      : third degree.
    No.    1. passed    through the mill with difficulty*.              A   cold
infusion      of it contained tannin,           and precipitated the solu
tion of gelatine.          Its taste was strongly aromatic          f;   its fla
vour was that of almonds ; it had no bitterness, and had a
decisive green colour.           A   warm infusion had the same aro-
   *  M. Cadet de Vaui, my uncle, has remarked, that to grind roasted coffee
is not the best method, by bruising it in a mortar much more of the aroma it
preserved.
   f  The desire of retaining the aroma which ii dissipated   at too strong heat
has suggested   two processes, not altogether useless; the one is in use in India
and France, and consists in putting a little fresh beer upon the coffee when it
begins to colour in roasting in the cylinder : as much beer must only be used
as will slightly varnish the surface of the grains.    The beer retains a part of
the essential oil which would have been evaporated. 1'his is not a bad me
thod, but it sometimes    gives the coffee a flavour which docs not suit every
one's palate. The other process consists in spreading the roasted coffee while
hot and exuding, upon white paper, and then strewing it lightly over with
sugar : the sugar absorbs the oil of the coffee and retains the aroma. This
method, in my opinion, does not add to the agreeable qualities of tht coffee,
and make* one uncertain what quantity of sugar to put into a cup ot coffee.

imtic qualities    ;  its taste resembled        that of almond cake:
rt was not bitier,      and wa? not so green as the former.
    No.   2. was    more easily ground.           A cold infusion of it
furnished less tannin, its aromatic flavour was weaker, its
taste more sugary       ; it was neither bitter nor green.      A warm
infusion neither yielded more taste nor more aroma.
    No. 3. was very easily powdered. A cold infusion was
almost free from aroma          ;  its taste was cmpyrcumatic,    and a
little hitter ; it formed     a   precipitate scarcely perceptible with
solution of gelatine: the warm infusion was more bitter, more
empyreumatic, and the aroma was niore distinct.
    All these infusions contained mucilage and gallic acid,
but in an inverse progression to the tannin ; because the
proportions of gum and acid increased with the roasting,
whereas the tannin diminished.
    M. Bouillon-Lagrange,            in a very excellent paper upon
gall-nuts, has already considered the gallic acid as a modi
fication of tannin : these experiments support his opinion.
    Roasted Coffee. — As the immediate principles of coffee
are not equally soluble or volatile, it was necessary to exa
mine comparatively the cold and warm infusions of the
three kinds of coffee,       as   well  as their decoctions.
    Infusion in cold Water.
                                  — I poured eight ounces of distilled
water upon one ounce of roasted and ground coffee ; I al
lowed it to infuse two hours, and I filtered it. The infu
sion was of      a very   clear brown      ; did not redden paper ; be
came black by the sulphate of iron ; and slightly precipitated
the solution of gelatine.             Alcohol separated from it a little
mucilage, and gave the infusion the smell of juniper. Moka,
Bourbon, and Martinique coffee, presented the same cha
racters.

hour, one ounce of roasted and ground coffee in eight ounce*
of water at 70° (158° Fahr.). This infusion did not redden
turnsole paper; did not precipitate solution of gelatine ; and
formed ink with sulphate of iron. Alcohol separated more
gum from it than from the cold infusion.                The three kindi
of cofiee   acted  in  the same manner         in these experiments.
                                                              Decoction.

    Decoction^ — I boiled    two ounces of ground coffee in one
pound of water for two hours.            The decoction had an infi
nitely less  agreeable    and less    aromatic     smell than the infu
sion.    It did not change the colour of blue paper; did not
precipitate the solution of gelatine ; and became black with
the sulphate of iron.       Alcohol separated much more muci
lage from it than is found in equal proportions of the infu
sion.    The three kinds of coffee yielded the same results.
    If we boil, for   a long time in the open air, a filtered and
limpid   decoction   of  coffee, it becomes turbid and deposits a
black powder, which has been sometimes taken for resin,                    .
but it is only a highly oxygenated extract.              Physicians and
apothecaries have not yet sufficiently well ascertained the
action of the atmospheric air upon vegetable decoctions ;
they might derive some experience of the greater or less
energy of certain remedies from experiments on this subject.
    Extract of Coffee. — The decoction of coffee, filtered and
evaporated    to the consistence      of  an extract,      has no longer
the aromatic smell      of the infusion    ;  its taste is bitter; heated
with alcohol the extract colours the liquor, but this colour is
not precipitated by water.        From this we may conclude that
the decoction of coffee, when it is filtered or has rested some
 time, contains no    roiu.
    Alcoholic Tincture     of roasted    Coffee.
                                                  — Roasted     coffee, di
gested in alcohol yields       a strong coloured tincture, which
 precipitates, by means of water, a greater quantity of resin
as the coffee is dry or green.          In green coffee the resinous
 matter is white; in the tincture of roasted coffee it is fawn-
coloured.
                             Observations.
                                          \
    It results from     these  experiments that roasting develops
 in coffee odorous and resinous principles, and forms tannin,
 which is only soluble in cold water ; a very singular pheno
 menon.      The gallic acid manifests itself in coffee at ail the
 temperatures of the water employed to dissolve it.                    The
 gum and    the  colouring extractive      matter   are  more abundant
 in decoctions than in infusions ; but the aromatic principle
 is more sensible and more agreeable in the latter.

from roasted coffee      ;  this water was saturated with the aroma
of the  coffee, and it carried with        it  some particles    of concrete
esseniial oil, like that obtained from the distillation of dry
coffee.    The re-agents did not demonstrate the presence of
any substance in solution in this water.
   Infusions and Decoctions compared.
                                                  — In order to ascertain
the different solubility of the principles of coffee, it remained
to submit the same roasted powder to the successive action
of infusion and decoction. I therefore placed two ounces
of coffee in   a filter,    I poured cold water upon il until              the
re-agents ceased to indicate to me the presence of any mat
ters in solution.      Sixty-eight ounces of cold water must have
been employed        to clear     this coffee of its soluble matter.         I
divided these washings into seventeen portions                of four ounces
each, as they came through the filter.                All these seventeen
portions contained the gallic acid in proportion to their order
of priority ; the four first contained gum, and the first alone
precipitated the solution of size, which showed the presence
of tannin.
   The   coffee,   withdrawn        from    the   filter,   was   dried in   a
stove;   I  afterwards poured upon             it eight ounces of water
heated to 75" (167° of Fahr.) ;           the smell of ihis secondary
infusion was agreeable, but weaker than that                 of coffee which
is prepared for the table : when examined by the re-agents
it furnished a little mucilage and a good deal of gallic acid.
I found neither tannin nor resin in it.
   I took once more the same coffee, washed cold and in
fused warm as above described, and boiled it in six ounces
of water until it     was     reduced   to four.      This decoction con
tained a great deal of gum and gallic acid, little aroma, and
yielded by the re-agents no signs of tannin or resin.
                                Observations.
   These experiments prove that cold water clears roasted
coffee of the little tannin which it contains, of a part of its
extractive matter, of a great part of its aroma ; but it only
takes off a small portion of its gallic acid and its gum.                 We
have already      seen     that   a  warm     infusion    is more   saturated
with   these last principles,       but that its aroma is weaker.           In

  This decoction, when filtered, turned into green the aqueous
  tincture of turnsole.
      1 mixed a part of this decoction with a solution of sul
  phate of iron, and I obtained a precipitate of a very deep
  blue, drawing        towards black     ;  I redissolved       this precipitate
  by the oxymuriatic acid, by weak and                   strong acetic acid,
  by the tartarous acid, the citric acid, and even by the ben-
  zoic acid.
     The muriatic acid changed           the   liquor into yellow        ; and it
  resumed    its transparency on depositing a heavy precipitate                 of
  oxygenated extractive. This precipitate, redissolved by am
  monia, gave a fine red brown colour to the liquor.
     The immediate precipitate of              the sulphate         of iron   dis
 solved     by    the    acetic   acid    acted     like    the    former,     the
  colour only excepted, which              was    violet blue ; it was, be
 sides,   redissolved by ammonia.                The other        acids   yielded
 nearly the same precipitate          as the    muriatic acid.        Their    ac
  tion, in general, followed the ratio of acidities.
     I treated in the same manner some precipitate of sulphate
 of iron obtained by the gallic acid, and the results presented
 no differences from the former.
     I precipitated by the muriate of tin what remained of the
 coffee in decoction.          This salt occasioned a very abundant
 deposit    in   the   liquor.     I washed the precipitate until the
 washings no longer exhibited any signs of acidity; I after
 wards put this metallic compound in a Woolf's bottle, and
 I  poured plenty of distilled water on it.               I  placed the appa
 ratus of   Woolf      so as to cause      sulphuretted hydrogen gas to
-pass   over    the   precipitate.     As   soon as the first portions of
 gas began to pass, the mixture acquired a brown colour,
 which    became darker in proportion             as   the liquor was satu
 rated with sulphuretted          hydrogen gas.         The precipitate was
 decomposed       ;  there  was    formed a hydro-sulphuret of tin,
 and the liberated acid passed into the liquor.                    This liquor,
 filtered, was evaporated at a gentle heat until it was reduced
 to one-eighth.         This product, supposed by M. Paysse to
 be coffic  acid,    seemed     to me to be nothing else than gallic
 acid. Not only did I submit it to the action of all the re
 gents, comparatively with            the*   acid drawn from gajl-nuts
                                                                               by

by tire ordinary method ; but, in order to leave no doubt on
this subject, gall-nuts by the same process. The muriate
of tin formed a more abundant precipitate in the latter than
in   coffee ; this precipitate, decomposed, like the former, by
the sulphuretted hydrogen gas, yielded me an acid of the
same colour and the same taste, enjoying the same proper
ties, and presenting no difference except in the proportions.
I then thought I might conclude that the cnffic acld does
not exist, but that coffee contains less gallic acid than gall-
nuts.
     It is possible that this gallic acid may present, in its com
binations and compounds, some slight shades which make
it differ a liule from the acid, produced from oak-galls, but
it is not the less of the same nature. We know that the
immediate        materials     of  vegetables, although of the same
species      and   perfectly analogous, are not rigorously identi
cally the same; the gums and the saccharine matters pre
sent variations in their physical properties ; nevertheless the
saccharine substance          and mucilage     are the same when che
 mically considered *.
     Proust has proved that tannin, obtained from several ve
getables, presents differences.           It is possible, therefore, that
 the gallic acid drawn from coffee is not absolutely the same
as that of gall* ; but it is by no means a distinct acid.
                                Recapitulation.
      It  seems   to be demonstrated by the above analysis that
 the coffee-berries (as known in commerce) contain muci
lage in abundance, a good deal of gallic aqid, a resin, a con
 crete essential oil, some albumen, and a volatile aromatic
 principle.      To these principles we may add those which are
 found in most vegetables, viz. lime, potash, charcoal, iron,
 &c.f Rpasting develops the soluble principles ; but it ought
                                                                              to
    * The feculum of potatoes does not resemble that of wheat ; the latter
differs from that of sago, arum, maize, &c. ; ueverthelcM, all the chemist*
 tell us that it is an amylaceous substance, and tuey acknowledge the same
 principal characters in all of them.
     *• The presence of iron in a vegetable is a common thing, but the pre
 tence of iron in a vegetable which contains plenty of gallic acid, without this
                                                                            acid

to be moderate              if   we wish to preserve the aroma, and not
decompose the acid,                the gum, and the resin.
    Roasting adds a new principle, which is tannin, in very
small quantity ; the cold infusion is very aromatic, but a
little charged with mucilage and gallic acid ; the warm in-
fusiori preserves the aroma, and the principles dissolved are
in such proportions                as   to please    the palate ; the decoction
has little aroma, and is strongly                    saturated      with     gum and
gallic acid         ;   the resin itself may perhaps be suspended               in it.;
it       is less agreeable than the        infusion.
  Bourbon and Martinique coffee present no differences be
tween them ; but that of Moka, as already remarked, is
more aromatic, less gummous, and more resinous.                         It is
probable that the resin of coffee, like that of most                  of the
astringent vegetables, has               peculiar medicinal properties. As
we cannot obtain it either by the infusion or the aqueous
decoction, the habitual use of coffee can throw no light upon
its action in the animal ceconomy ; it belongs to physicians
alone to make useful experiments on this subject.
         If I
        may be allowed to draw any precepts from this ana
lysis applicable to the ceconomical use of coffee, I should
say that it is possible to drink most excellent coffee from all
the kinds of it known in commerce, provided it is not adul
terated.  Amateurs require three qualities in the coffee they
use; they wish to find an agreeable aroma in           slightly        it,   a
bitter taste,  fine colour, and
                        a          certain density which they
                                              a
call body*.   In order to attain all these advantages,    think              I
that good coffee ought to be had in the following manner                            :
   1st, Choose     dry grain, which has no mouldy or sea
                            a
taste.
         2d, Divide the quantity            to be        roasted    into two equal
parts.
         3d, Roast the first part merely until                it   has the colour   of
acid being combined with    and giving
                                  it       blue or black colour to the vege

the 24th volume of the Philosophical Magazine, p. 240,

             the dignity
    after giving an imperfect account of my theory, he com
    mences his observations thus :
       "     It will      be seen,          that, although          Mr. Walker's hypo
    thesis is supported by the authority                         of mathematical demon
    stration,       it may, notwithstanding,                      be inadmissible,         since
    there is a principle assumed in the demonstration which
    is not completely established.    Is Mr. Walker certain that
    the figure of the crystalline, its position in the eye, the di
    stance from      pupil to the retina at the back of the eye,
                         the
    or, in other words, the general dimensions and conforma
    tion of     the eye,        continue unchanged,                 while     the magnitude
    of the pupil         varies   ?    If he                                 on
                                                 be, he has attained conviction
    a point        respecting which              Harris, Wood, Porterfield, and
    others    of our   best writers on vision,                   have still many doubts.
    Yet, unless this be a decided point, we conceive the whole
    of Mr. Walker's demonstration nugatory."
       It does not appear, from the above observations, that the
    writer knows whether my theory is true or false; all that he
    has been able to discover   (and that,
                                               is,
                                            seems, not without     it
    some difficulty,)           that   if    my data be
                                           false,                        "   he conceives the
    whole    ff    my demonstration nugatory."
       Now, sir, my demonstration depends no more upon the
    string of questions mentioned    this writer, nor on theby
    doubts which, he says, our best writers on vision have re
    specting them, than   does upon the shining of
                                       it              Troston                         a
    glow-worm*.
'      For all the data that have used in my demonstration
                                             I
    are well-known truths.   As the crystalline lens converges
    the rays of light to  focus, not only when
                                      a             in the eye,              it   is
    but after                 taken out,                evident, that when 'heteroge-

    with   the pupil      ;    for the same law               of aberration obtains in
    all convex lenses             composed             of   dense refracting mediums.
    Hence the          image of       an    object in       the focus    of the crystalline
    lens increases with the pupil                  ;     apd this   is   a property of the

•ye that is incontrovertible.      In short,   these  observations
om my Theory, although they come in the borrowed dress
of  "  candid philosophical discussion," are mere subterfuges
opposed to mathematical demonstration.
   Although      the phenomenon     of   the rising moon has at
tracted the attention of men in all ages, yet a more extra
ordinary optical illusion, arising from the same cause, takes
place when terrestrial objects are seen through a mist.        Mr*
Dunn, who has given a long dissertation on the phenome
non of the horizontal      moon in the Philosophical Transac
tions,  vol. Ixiv. observes,   that " mountains themselves, at
a distance,     sometimes appear larger than at other times.
Cattle,   houses, trees, all objects on the summit of a hill,
when seen through a fog, and at        a  proper distance, appear
enlarged.
   The following article is taken from           the  Ency. Brit.
vol. xvii. p. 681.
   fc The writer of this article was             the frith of Forth
                                       passing
at Queensferry,      near Edinburgh, one morning which was
extremely foggy.        Though the water be only two miles
broad, the boat did not get within sight of the southern
shore till it approached very near it.         He then saw, to
his great surprise, a large perpendicular rock, where he
knew the shore was low and almost flat.            As  the boat ad
vanced   a little nearer, the rock seemed to split perpendicu
larly into portions, which separated at a little distance from
one aixother.      He next saw these perpendicular divisions
move;    and upon approaching a little nearer, found it was
a  number of people standing on the beach, waiting the ar
rival of the ferry-boat."
   The following extract of a letter, which now lies before
me, is given as another instance of this property of visioa.
This letter I received soon after my papers on the Theory of
the horizontal Moon were published in the Philosophical
Journal, from      a gentleman on whose veracity I can place
the greatest confidence :
    " I beg leave (says this gentleman) to offer my testimony
to that part of your first letter respecting terrestrial objects
seen   through     a mist.   When   I was a young man,       I was,
                                                                like

   like others, fond of sporting, and seldom liked to iriiss a
   day if I could any way go out.        From my own house I set
   out on foot and pursued my diversion on a foggy day, and
   after I had been out some     time the fog or mist increased to
   so great a degree,  that however familiar the hedges, trees,
   &c. were to me, I lost myself, insomuch that I did not
  know whether I was going to or from home.              In W        n
  field, where I then was, I suddenly discovered what I ima
  gined was a well known hedge-row, interspersed with pol
  lard trees, &c., under which I purposed to proceed home
  ward ; but to my great surprise, upon approaching this ap
  pearance, I discovered a row of the plants known by the
 name of rag, and by the vulgar canker-weed, growing on a
 meer balk dividing ploughed fields; the whole height of both
 could not exceed three feet or three feet and a half.              It
 struck me so forcibly that I shall never forget it : this, too,
 in a field which 1 knew as well as any man could know a
 field."
      The following account respecting the effects of mist on
 vision, was related to me on the spot where it happened :
      A shepherd upon one of the mountains in Cumberland
 was suddenly enveloped with a thick          fog or mist, through,
 which     every object appeared    so greatly increased   in magni
 tude, that he no longer knew where he was.             In this state
 of confusion he wandered in search of some known object,
from which       he might    direct his future steps.     Chance, at
last, brought this lost shepherd within sight of what he sup
posed to be a very large mansion, which he did not remem
ber ever to have seen before ; but on his entering this vi
sionary castle to inquire his way home, he found it inha
bited by his own family.           It was nothing more than his
own cottage. But his organs of sight had so far misled his
mental faculties, that some little time elapsed before he could
be convinced      that he saw real objects.       Instances of the
same kind of illusion, though not to the same degree, are
not unfrequcnt in those mountainous regions.
     From these effects of mist on vision, it is evident that the
pupil,   and the picture  of  an object   withia the   eye, increase
at the same time.

   The author of a paper in the Supplement to the Ency.
Brit. vol. ii. p. 641, informs us that, " according as we look
it  an object more or less luminous,            these variations   (of the
pupil) are so great, that in the observable variations of the
human eye the aperture is thirty times as large at one time
as at another."
   Whence it may         be easily understood, thai a cottage, seen
through    a  thick fog, may form         as large a   picture in the  eye"
as a castle when strongly illuminated by the sun's rays.

VII.   Analytical Essay on Asparagus.               By M.
             junior, Apothecary at Vale          de Grace*.
OOMK time        ago   M. Parmentier      engaged     the apothecaries  of
the Military Hospital to repeat the experiments of               M.   An-
toine on asparagus, for the sake of giving us a subject of
study fit to exercise us. My colleagues gave it specially in
charge to meUo follow this labour ; and I undertook the task
with pleasure, conceiving,         at first,  that it would be an easy
one.     Hut   as ray first essays created         some doubts in my
mind respecting the truth of the facts which had been an
nounced, and as there are besides many vegetable substances
of which the distinguishing properties are but little known,
I  was   necessarily involved in very considerable embarrass-.
ment.      1 strove, however, with redoubled efforts              against
these obstacles, till I collected the facts which I have the
honour to present to you.
   As ,in every analysis we should endeavour to isolate, as
conveniently      as  possible, each of the substances which com
pose a whole ;       in place of following the process pointed out
by M. Antoine, which prescribes making a strong decoc
tion of asparagus, then to evaporate it to obtain the extract,
&c.,   I  thought it preferable to employ at tirst a mechanical
analysis, that I might not be exposed to change certain sub-

  stances susceptible   of being    altered by heat    :  thus, after pro
  perly pounding some asparagus,          I extracted    the  juice in the
 ordinary manner, and passed it through fine linen with the
 intention of entirely separating the gross feculence.
     The juice in this state had an odour sufficiently strong,
 and as it were sourish ; it was of a dirty yellow, inclining a
 little to green.   1 filtered   it  to separate    the feculence    :  thi3
 being well washed retained the smell of asparagus, but more
 marked and more disagreeable; treated with boiling alcohol
 it was not entirely dissolved, and the residue, which had a
 grayish colour, presented itself under the form of light
 flakes, which, being collected with care, had the following
 characters : they were soft and somewhat unctuous to the
 touch ; they acquired a horny consistency and much hard
 ness, and turned almost black by desiccation. During com
bustion they gave out a smell like that of burnt horn ; they
 diffused at the same time an oily smoke, and left a pretty
compact coal. When submitted to distillation, they gave at
first a yellowish phlegm of a milky consistence, afterwards
carbonate of ammonia very abundantly, and towards the
conclusion of the experiment a dark red oil in great quantity.
    When left for some days in contact with cold water, the
flakes we have mentioned were decomposed, grew mouldy,
and contracted a fetid odour.             When boiled with distilled
water they were not sensibly altered.
    The alkalis dissolve them entirely.             Vinegar has also a
marked action on this matter, which is insoluble in alcohol,
especially if heat be employed.          The solution in the acetous
acid yields a deposit : by saturation with ati alkali a great
quantity of flakes are obtained similar to the former, if we
except the colour, which becomes less intense.                   I am far
from venturing to pronounce on the nature of this sub
stance; and the fow experiments I have been able to make
from the small quantity of the matter I obtained, have only
authorized me to consider it as very much auimalized, and
to believe that probably it contributes very much to the dis
agreeable odour which asparagus          communicates        to the urine
of   those who make use      of it.
    The alcohol which       had been boiled upon the green fecu-
                                                                       lent

 lent matter was filtered while yet warm, and deposited, while
 cooling, some light jelly-like flakes, which in drying united
in small yellowish masses.           They became soft with heat,
and diffused, when burning,         an agreeable odour.       They  ap
peared to be true vegetable       wax.
    The alcoholic tincture, which became slightly turbid Tiy
the addition of water, left as the residue of its evaporation
a green tenacious substance, of which the taste was at first
a little sharp,   slightly   bitter, and very tart   ;  it had  a  smell
also peculiarly insipid, and even nauseous         ; properties which
may create a presumption         that  if it is a resin it is not pure,
and that it is probably united to a portion of volatile oil.
    I think that those substances, although they are not of
great importance, deserve to be mentioned in the analysis
of asparagus.      I shall pass, however, to the examination of
the filtered juice : it had a colour nearly resembling that of
whey,    though inclining a little more to yellow, and redden
ing very sensibly the tincture of tor;isole.           I exposed it to
the action of fire, to see if it contained a small portion of
albumen.     Before ebullition it showed some flakes, oi which
the number augmented           considerably     in proportion    as  the
heat acquired intensity.      The liquor, after having     been boiled
a  certain time, was filtered, to separate from it          the coagu
lated albumen.
    My principal object being to obtain malic acid and gela
tine, I evaporated (as M. Antoine had done) the liquor to
the consistence of an extract, which I treated with alcohol
at 39°;   and after   having washed        the extract,   obtained by
several repetitions   of   the experiment,      always  with   alcohol,
I dissolved  in water the portion       that was insoluble in spirit
of wine   ; but I did not obtain, as      M. Antoine did, a residue
which that gentleman designates          by the name of an oxyge
nated extract. From the process he followed it was possibly
owing to a little of the albumen remaining in the solution,
which separated in the progress of evaporation. But this is
only a conjecture.
   I tried the alcoholic liquor, and was much astonished to
obtain, by the acetate of lead, only a very slight flaky preci
pitate, which, according to M. Antoine, ought to be abun-

dant, simc he assures us that this alcohol             contains malatej'
of potash and of lime in manifest quantities. I observed, on
the contrary, that the aqueous solution precipitated a larger
quantity by the same reasrent ; and what surprised me much,
more was, that neither the one nor the other of these preci
pitates was resoluble in vinegar; from whence I was able
to conclude that it was not malate of lead, or at least that it
was not pure.        It is true, however, that the animal matter,
might very much alter the result. I again 'consulted the
memoir      of M. Antoine,        to know    if he had made mention
of this experiment; and I saw he had, buj only to support
his opinion, that malic acid exists in asparagus.               I believe,
he has been deceived on this point ; for we .know that ma-
late  of  lead   dissolves easily in vinegar, and that it is even a
test employed to detect the presence of sulphate of lead in
vinegar.
    Suspecting that there existed in the juice of asparagus a
little earth, I treated a portion of the alcoholic liquor, pro
perly evaporated,-     with the sulphuric acid diluted with three
parts of water.       I proceeded to distillation, and there passed
into the receiver an acid liquor, which did not precipitate-
the metallic solutions nor those of barytes, &c.; in a word,
easy to be recognised as vinegar.                                          ,
    Tic   ashes of this part of the extract,          which  was soluble
in alcohol,      were   composed, in a great measure, of potash
and a little lime ;    whence it seems natural to conclude that
the acetic acid was combined with the potash, and that the
supposed malic acid was combined with the lime; for I
ought here to mention that this calcareous salt, whatever it
may be, has the property of dissolving in acetous acid, and
that the alcohol always preserved a portion of it free.
    The acid contained       in the  juice of   asparagus   appearing to
have some properties different from those assigned to             known
acids,   I  directed  my attention chiefly to this point, and en
deavoured to procure it in a state of purity.              For this pur
pose   I took    some   juice   of  asparagus   filtered and  coagulated
by heat ; 1 pourediupon it the acetate of lead until it ceased
to form any more precipitate : this, being collected and well
\vashcd, was treated with a third of its weight of concen--

moments after. mixture the mass became uiore liquid-, and
took a beautiful rose colour. I heated it slightly to facili
tate      the decomposition ; and after some hours digestion the
liquor was filtered : it still contained a little sulphuric acid,
which I separated by means of caustic harytes. I again fil
tered      it,     and after         having evaporated    to the consistence
                                                                      it

acid had carried along with         in solution    little animal

                    constituent principles.

necessary to have this acid in the purest possible state.  We
might suspect that the acetate of lead had precipitated at the
same time with the acid   great quantity of the matter which

and which      has much       resemblance to that of burnt onions.
M. Antoine,      however, compares it to the odour of caramel.
The alkalis form with it soluble salts, and that of soda,
among others, of a fresh savour, slightly bitter, and which
leaves in the mouth a taste like that of green nuts.
   Barytes. strontian, or lime, united to this acid give very
insoluble salts, susceptible of solution in an excess of acid,
but difficultly : all of them present themselves under the
form of flakes more or less light.           It  possesses the  remark
able   property of decomposing, in general, all the earthy
acetates without having recourse to double affinities : it also
decomposes     several    metallic   solutions,    and in a remarkable
inanner    those   of iron, which it precipitates white though
at the maximum        ; those of copper it precipitates of a blueish
green. The acetate of lead is also precipitated in white
flakes, which are insoluble in vinegar.
   If in place of employing this free acid we take one of its
alkaline combinations,        precipitates arc obtained, in the so
lutions, of aluminous       and ;nagnesian salts; but it is neces
sary   that the latter be very much concentrated,                without
which the precipitates are redissolved immediately.

Cm,ofNE      the   principal   causes   of  the imperfections     in the
air-pump    arises from the difficulty       in opening the valves at
the bottom of the barrels, which imperfection was thought
to have been remedied by the introduction of stop-cocks l
but experience shows that, however accurate they may be
when new, after a little use they became faulty.
   I  here   send   you a description of an air-pump, which I
latcly executed, without either valves or stop-cock.              I have
supplied   their  place  by  a slide,  which    is shifted at every  mo-
tiofl of the piston, in a similar manner to that of a stop
cock, which requires no pressure of the air to open it.                 It
moves between two facings of leather, which lessens fric
                                                                     tion

 use it should at any time be found not air-tight, the defect
 is instantly remedied by means of four screws ; which is a
considerable advantage over stop-cocks.         The manner of its
application is shown in fig. l . (Plate II.) ; the perspective is
 considerably strained for the purpose of rendering the con
struction more intelligible. AB is the barrel, having a strong
plate of brass, CDEF, firmly fixed to the bottom with two
small holes, G and H, that enter the inside ; but near the
edge   of   the barrel   IKLM     is another plate  of brass similar
to the former,     having two holes, N and O, that correspond
with G and     H. In the hole N is closely screwed the duct P,
which leads     to the receiver of the pump; and in the hole'O
is screwed the duct Q, through which the air is discharged.
The plates, being ground smooth,          are faced    with leather,
pierced opposite the holes, and suieared with grease; then
the polished brass slide RS, fig. 2, is placed between them.
In the slide is a hole T, which is put over the hole N.
The    plates  are   then pressed together by the four screws
V, U, W, X,       which screw into nuts that are fixed into the
bottom     part of the machine ; they also serve to direct the
motion of the slide, which is drawn backwards and forwards.
When      the  hole   T  is between   N  and  G,   the piston   Y  is
drawn up, which causes the air to rush out of the receiver
through the duct P into the barrel ; the slide is then drawn
by the ring Z, for the hole T to be between O and H. The
communication between tVie barrel and discharging duct Q
is opened ; the piston is then forced down, and the air is
discharged. The slide is again shifted; which closes up the
discharging aperture and opens the former, and the process
is continued     until the receiver is exhausted. At each end
of  the   slide is a small ridge of brass that prevents its being
pushed or pulled too far, so that the hole in the slide will
exactly correspond with the holes in the plates.
   If  the pump has two barrels, by making the slide a little
longer, and with two holes, it will serve both by only once
moving ; and, from what has been said, it is evident that,
merely by changing the motion          of the slide,   the machine
      condense as well as exhaust.      When the     receiver is ex-

this paper in English might be a valuable addition to the very
little useful matter which we possess on that branch of me

    BY  proposing to determine           the bent     method   of measuring
time at sea, the Academy appears to require, first, such a
measure of time as may give to mariners the knowledge of
the longitude which has been so much desired, that for many-

  ages   it  has been the principal      object   of their researches,      as
  well   as  of astronomers      and  philosophers of the greatest         ce
  lebrity.      In  the second    place, by the expression       "  to deter
  mine," the academy appears to require also palpable proofs
  that the method proposed is the best possible.
     To comply with         these requests,  I shall divide this memoir
  into rour     parts.
      In  the first    I shall go through the different methods hi
  therto attempted, or which may be hereafter tried, for mea
  suring time at sea; I shall make known the insufficiency of
  most of these methods ; and i shall show that, notwithstand
  ing   the irregularities     of our portable watches,        we   are tho
  roughly      persuaded      that the best    means     of obtaining the
  desired     measure      of time consists in       a  kind of perfected
   watch.
      In   the   second part    I will 'endeavour    to point out all these
  irregularities, and to discover the different causes, physical
  or mechanical, whence they are derived, in order to be more
  in a state to correct them afterwards.
     The third shall contain the description of a chronometer,
  or kind of large watch, deposited with this memoir.                  I shall
  show     that   byiits  construction   it is exempt     from   the  defects
  remarked       in common watches,          and   1 shall enter into the
  detail of the expedients which have been used in the work
  manship to prevent them,
     Lastly, I shall terminate this memoir by a recapitulation
   "
  or suite     of observations, forming        so many parallels to the
  methods which          I have employed,      with    those   that may be
  made use      of with    the  same view.      I hope to prove, by       ex-
. periments and palpable reasonings, that mine must obtain
  the preference. If I succeed, I shall be well paid tor twenty
  years consumed in these researches ; since, besides the ho
  nour of being crowned by the Academy of Sciences, this
  discovery concerns          the  good   of humanity,       and   even   the
  preservation of        a number     of lives. If, on       ttte contrary,
  my labour is without success, there will remain at least the
  satisfaction of having spared no pains or expense in endea
  vouring to fulfil the honourable task imposed upon me as a-
            a patriot^   and an artist.

  Examination of different                 methods      which may       be  tried t9
                                measure time at sea.
      Moving bodies beiug evidently the only measures of dura
 tion or of time*, lhat nothing may be omitted in so im
  portant a subject, let us first cast our eyes on those whose
 motions may appear capable of giving an exact measure of
  time.
      The first which           present     themselves       are the stars.       The
 perfection to which             telescopes     have been carried, the suc
 cessful labours         of many      celebrated     astronomers in the theory
 of Jupiter's satellites, and the tables which they have given
 of their revolutions fi give us reason to believe that they will
 presently become of very great help for measuring time at
 ?ea i    the same must be said            of  the theory       of the moon.
      But when       we shall have given to these tables and these
 telescopes       all   the perfection that can be desired, we shall
 find that they are yet insufficient.                     We cannot always see
 the moon,         still   less    the satellites of Jupilcr : supposing,
 even, that we could observe them as often as circumstances
 require, these observations are in some degree useless, with
 out an instrument             that would preserve the hour with exact
 ness    after  we    have    determined      it by the sun J.
     The observations of the heavenly bodies cannot, therefore,
entirely fulfil our wishes: let us therefore look among the
bodies which are more at hand,                      if  there be not some one
which by motions arising from different causes would                               be
proper to give us the required measure of time.
     Those which offer themselves first to our examination                        are
fluids,     and solids reduced           into insensibly small parts, form
ing clepsydras, or sand-glasses ; bodies falling, or making
oscillations by their gravity combined with their inertia;
the vibrations           of magnetic bodies ; and those which solids
make by the           help of an elastic force, &c. By reflecting,

  we shall presently find, that         of all bodies in motion, then
  are   only the latter which can, with any exactness, measure
  time at sea.
      It appears,    first, that all bodies, whether fluid or solid,
  moving by the effect of their gravity, are by that alone in
  admissible in the present case.              Besides that, their motion
  will be always more or less accelerated or retarded by the
  shocks that they will receive from the ship ; we know also
  that their gravity is variable under different parallels : it is
  therefore not probable that we can ever correct this source
  of inequalities.
      1 know of no other person, except Sully *, who in his
  marine or kver clock          has  pretended     to have obviated them
  on this principle, that by adding, proportionally, weight to
  the balance and to the lever, the rate of the clock would not
  be changed ; but the academy, in approving the efforts of
  this artist, declares in its report that it does not adopt all
  Ms reasonings. Nothing caui be more deceitful in effect than
  that on which he founded this pretended property                     of his
  clock.
      To convince ourselves, let us remark, that the vibrations
  cf his regulator, like those of a pendulum, are produced by
  the force of inertia combined with that of gravity ; that the
• first cause operates principally on the balance, whose gra
  vity has no influence on the time of vibration ; that the se
  cond resides in the lever, whose inertia has very little effect,
  because it descends almost vertically ; and that, lastly, the
  time employed in each vibration depends on the proportion
  which exists between the balance and the lever, that is to
  say, the same         as  in the pendulum,        the ratio   of inertia to
  that of gravity.
      The experiment which Sully             f  made before the academy
  proves nothing.           When by adding matter to his balance he
   augments     its  gravity, he makes also the force of inertia to
  increase in the same proportion ; but under the pole, its

 44             Le Roy's Memoir          on the bcsi Method
 gravity augmenting without its quantity of matter changing,
its inertia would not experience any increase.
    In heavy bodies in motion, to compensate the effect of
 fheir different gravity in various climates, (an effect which
may go so far as to retard a second pendulum two minutes in
twenty-four hours, when removed from the parallel of Paris
to the equator,) it would be necessary to find an expedient
by means of which their inertia is proportioned always to
the increase or alteration of their gravity ; but the force of
Inertia of bodies, being a first and               unalterable cause, this
does not appear possible.
    In vain would they        pretend     to estimate the differences we
have just spoken of, in keeping a register of the parallels
under which they would navigate, and of the time which
they would remain there.              Besides all the difficulties of this
method,      and the very complicated calculations which it
titould require, it cannot be exact without a perfect homo
geneity in the different parts of the earth, which homoge
neity appears to be contradicted by the observations of the
different lengths of the second pendulum made in different
climates : it supposes, moreover, that the sailor can know,
several times each day, at what height he is ; which is a very-
 strained supposition.
    A long detail on this subject would be useless. We know
sufficiently the defects of clepsydras and sand-glasses : we
are not ignorant       of the inconveniences of the circular, tri
angular pendulums, 8cc. proposed by M. Huygens ; or of
those coupled together by wheels acting in each other, like
those tried by the late       M. Diuertre*.           Experience has suf
ficiently shown the defects of these methods, and of many
others, which for this reason I shall pass by in silence.
  - I come now to bodies which             make vibrations by their in
ertia, combined with that universal force which directs the
needle   of  a compass.
    The celebrated Dr. Hook f thought that we might apply
it advantageously to a clock in the quality of a regulator.

the same      interval of time, the number of vibrations of the
needle of     a compass made and suspended on a pivot with           <
the greatest care, has found that it was not always constant.
    I have observed also, by means of an instrument, which
I call a mngnimcter, which by a long index marks on a limb
the variations of magnetism, first, that .this force in a body
changes according as it is well or ill placed in the direction,
of    the  magnetic meridian, according as it is more or less
elevated in the atmosphere, and according to the different
degrees    of heat and cold.   I have besides observed that thunder
produces sensible variations in these forces, and that in the
aurora borealis there happen also considerable changes, as
they have observed in Sweden.             I only mention these ex
periments, the detail of which would draw me too much
aside from      my subject  :  I hope  some day to give an account
 of  them to the Academy.
    There     now remain only the bodies in vibration by the
 help of   the clastic force. Every thing induces us to presume
 that these are the most proper to procure the required mea
 sure of time.      The regularity of certain watches which are
 executed daily, but, above all, the trials that have been made
 with the time-keepers of the         celebrated Mr. Harrison, the
 recompense that      he merits for them, confirm,      in some de
 gree,    what was before only a presumption, and appear to
 demonstrate that the true, and perhaps the only means of
 measuring time exactly at sea, consists, as we have before
 observed, in the perfected watch. But as watches in general
 are very     distant from the precision requisite in a "marine
 watch, we should first search out their different irregulari
 ties, and the causes, whether physical or mechanical, whence
 they are derived ; according to the example of a wise phy
 sician, who, before he has recourse to a remedy, endeavours
 to understand the disorder well, and what may occasion it.
 This is what I shall do in the following part: in order to
 render the different objects which are treated of more evi
 dent,    I shall make so many separate articles of them.
     As mechanics is     here continually intermixed with natural
  philosophy,     whatever   is only supported by reasoning, how
  ever solid it appears, will always be'very uncertain. I have but
                                                                 too

  Of   the spring in general,      and   of 'the alterations which may
              happen ui the    force of the spiral spring.
     The first question which presents itself to be cleared up
 in treating of the theory of watches, and which, however,
 appears to be made for the first time, is this : Is the spring
 in itself, abstracting from tlie effects of heat, a constant
power,     on which we may establish         a principle of perfect re
 gularity,    or is it not f
     These axioms of the philosophers, that there is no perfect
 spring in nature ; that it does not admit of any precision,
 &c., would       appear   at first to announce        in the spring a
 power not very proper to give the required accuracy in a
marine clock.         But, on the other hand, many philosophers
 and artists think     that the spring is a constant power, when
 it is but little contracted.
    To have more exact notions on this subject, I have con
 structed an instrument, rig. 1. Plate I.; I call it the elate-
rometer. This is in some degree only a long spring rr,
 stretched by a weight p, which, according as the force of
 this spring increases or diminishes, ascends or descends, the
 distance that it moves being rendered a hundred times more
 sensible by means       of  a  long index II, whose weight on the
 spring is insensible ; this weight being counterbalanced by
 an opposite branch b1, which makes it almost in equili
 brium.
     By means of this instrument we find that the spring loses,
 a considerable part of its force in the first month of its ten
sion ; that then the loss is much less ; that at last it be
 comes almost insensible, unless the spring receives a con
 siderable degree of heat ; for then the index falls several de
 grees]    and when the thermometer             returns to the degree
                                                                 where

                         of measuring      Time at Sea.                         47
where it was before, this index does not ascend to the same
point, but rests below.
    These experiments appear to show that the vibrations of
the spiral spring can measure time but imperfectly : but here
follow several considerations that must convince us of the
contrary.        1st, In the vibrations of this spring, its contrac
tion and opening are only momentaneous : 2dly, By sup
posing that in its contraction, for example, it had been bent
a little, it would return presently to its proper opening. But
even when it experiences some loss on one side, this cannot
be done        without its gaining it on the other, as daily expe
rience proves.          There would result, therefore, from this a
compensation.            All the inconvenience that would follow is,
that the watch will not be so perfectly adjusted in its escape
ment.       Lastly, the experience of watches with dead escape
ments    * confirms again what I            have advanced.         The greater
part, after having gone for several years, are still found to
be regulated when they have been cleaned, if there has been
no considerable wear in the parts of their escapement.
    These observations show, nevertheless, that we cannot
take too much pains            for the spiral spring to be fastened in
a natural and unconstrained situation                f  (as recommended by
Daniel Bernoulli). This is what does not take place in most
watches, and it is (as we shall see in the end) that which                         I
have particularly endeavoured              to execute.
    We must conclude also from what precedes, that nothing
would be more disadvantageous in watches than two spiral
springs in contraction, as John Bernoulli has proposed :                        J
for then      the effects    observed     by our elaterometer would ab
solutely take place.
    Besides, a very simple reasoning suffices to convince us
that there is not in nature any spring which is not in the
case of the constrained equilibrium (I'equilibre force") recom
mended by         M. Bernoulli      %.

      It   is not the massof the spring which produces its
 strength ; without changing this mass, we may augment or
 diminish considerably its elastic power by giving it a higher
 or lower temper, or by other operations. To know, there
 fore, whether a spring, when unwound, is in the case of a
 constrained equilibrium, we must not, as M. Bernoulli did,
 consider the whole of the mass, which by itself is incapable
 of any motion, but examine what passes in the interior of
 its pores, where the agent works, whatever it maybe, thai-
produces the elastic force ; the same as in a foot-ball, the
covering is not the first cause of the spring, but the com
pressed air in its interior. Now whatever may be the cause
of    the spring,    it is easy to        seethat all the particles which
compose it are themselves                 so many springs already wound,
being continually in action to develop themselves.        We
know, in like manner, that all these particles are in a centre
of constrained equilibrium, since the active principle which ;.
they contain, and which tends to dilate them, is necessarily
counterbalanced by the force which compresses the parts of.
the metal one against the other; by that same force, without
•which all in nature would be disunited.
      The constrained equilibriumis made manifest in eflect
very sensibly,- when by a small excess of cold many springs
break of themselves, and when we see steel become faulty
when it is tempered.
for 1736, M. Bernoulli showed several things analogous to the spiral springs
                                 '
that are applied to watches. He recommends to attach two of them to the
centre of the balance) whose spires turn in a contrary direction, to have what
he calls a centre of constrained eyuift/'rium: he pretends to remedy by this mean*
the fluttering, and to render the vibrations more equal ; instead of which,
with one spring, he   says an idle centre   of equilibrium    can only be had, which
has not sufficient action on the balance to prevent fluttering, and to maintain
the vibrations   equal. What he understands by a constrained centre tf eyuiti.
trium  is the two springs, which, being wound, become antagonists to each
other ; that is to say, the first spring which is placed will draw the balance all
on one side, and absolutely out of its escapement ; but the second spiral,
drawing in   a contrary direction, will bring the balance so that the pallets are
parallel to the balance wheel, and place        it,
                                             as usual, in its escapement.
  What he understands by the idle centre of equiliirium, balance with itt
                                                                     is
                                                                     a
common spring fixed. This spring       neither wound on one side nor the
                                           is
other, consequently   it   remains in inaction,       which   is   what   he means   by an
idle centre ofeiiuJUlTUtmi—T.   S.   £.
                                                                               Besides,

     Besides, when we bend an elastic plate much, it begins to
 break in its convex part : does not this show that the pores
 of this part widen, whiUt                those     of the cavity close?
 We therefore cannot bend               a spring without part of the
 fluid which causes the elasticity being lost on one side of
 its strength by a small compression, whilst that of the op
 posite side gains by it. This evidently procures the effect of
 M. Bernoulli's two springs, The idle equilibrium, which
this geometrician conceived, is therefore a chimerical being.
    This error,      I  may remark by the way, comes from the
 same source which occasioned that of the vis viva (forces
 vives*).      Those      who have     admitted ihem have not suffi
ciently discriminated         the apparent from the real obstacles
which a body in motion has to surmount.                        In the spring,
for example, the first are always as the square of the velo
city of the body that surmounts them, but the second are
 only as the simple velocity.
    We may conclude that            the vibrating force         of  a   spring is
a constant force, the effect of heat excepted, provided it is
in a free and unconstrained state ; that, every spring being
in   the case     of the constrained equilibrium, what M. John
Bernoulli says of this equilibrium is absolutely as applicable
to one only as to two opposite springs, such as he requires.
We may consequently infer from these principles, that the
vibrations of the spiral spring are exactly isochronous ; that
being therefore applied to the watch by a good dead escape
ment, abstracting from friction, it would compensate the
inequalities of the mover and of the wheel-work : this is
what     I shall examine in the following article.

 Second source      of inequalities in   watches : the nonTisochronism
    of  the vibrations    of their regulator, arising as well from the
    spiral spring itseif, as from the nature of the escapement.
    Nothing      is more important for the theory               of watches in
general, and to direct the artist who executes                 them, than to

of isochronism of             the vibrations of the spiral spring con
nected       with   the balance*         :       nevertheless      nothing, perhaps, in
 philosophy is more obscure.
    The following experiment, from which it has been at
 tempted to deduce this isochronism, cannot, in my opinion,
 form a complete proof:
    " In sonorous bodies, that are struck or played upon with
more or less force, the tone remains, they say, always the
same ; nevertheless they would heighten or lower sensibly
if there happens the least change in the duration of their
vibrations ; the different extent of these vibrations has there
fore no influence on the time in which they are made.
Now," continue they,                 "
                             balance joined to a spiral spring
                                             a
is analogous to the wire of a harpsichord ; when either of
them vibrates, it is always a mass moved freely by an clastic
force     :" therefore they conclude, balance, assisted by " the
the spring, makes its reciprocations more or less wide, in
times that are perfectly equal."
      This reasoning proves, moreover, that all                          the vibrations    of
a springing          body are nearly isochronous, the ear not being
sufficiently delicate       to perceive the small differences in the
.tones.       Besides,        M.    de       Mondonville           has    found that      the
tone     a chord rises more or less according to the degree of
        of
       which  presses         it,

    cording as they are more or less extended.
      We know, by the theory of forces, that the different ex
    cursions of a moveable body are isochronous, when those
    which push them are in the ratio of the distance of the term
    to which they make it bend.                       The true method of clearing
    up the present question appears therefore to be, to examine,
    by experiment, whether the force of spiral springs augments
    according to the proportion of the space's described in their
    different contractions or their different openings.
       To know what we are to think on this capital point,                                         I
    took the main spring of a common watch and attached its
    interior extremity to an arbor, sustained by very fine pivots,
    which carried a large pulley : I then fixed the exterior end of
    this spring to a fixed point, so that it might rest in its na
    tural state.  This done, I fixed a wire to the pulley and
    wound     it   round ; then         I fixed   to the other end         of this wire a
    small hook, on which I placed successively different weights,
    these weights bending the spring in opening and shutting
    it,
      more than             if
                      had caused
                             it      balance to vibrate

    having a dead escapement : but this is what does not take
    place. In all the experiments that I have made on the dura
    tion of the vibrations of their regulators, making oscillations
    cither by the action of the wheel-work, or freely and inde
    pendently of this action, I have almost always found, as
    well      as    the     most celebrated               artists and men of science*,
    that the long vibrations were always slower than the short :
    I have even remarked that in a double arc the difference was
    most frequently -i-J^. This effect arises, I believe, from the
    mass of the spring, or perhaps from the obstacles which it
    experiences internally                  f
                            to display its strength.
          is only lately that I have at last found, as I shall ex
         It
    plain more particularly, what is very important, and which
    besides must serve as a base to the theory                               of watches,       and a
    guide to workmen                   who construct                 them ; viz. that there is
    in every spring of sufficient extent a certain length where
    atl the vibrations, long or short, are isochronous ; that this
    length being found,                if
                          you shorten the spring, the long vibra
    tions are quicker than the short ones ;     on the contrary,          if,
,   you lengthen            it,   the small arcs arc described                  in   less time than
    the large ones          on this important property of the

    spring, hitherto unknown,   that the regularity of my marine
    watch particularly depends, as we shall see in the end. From
    what precedes we are sensible that the accuracy of watches
    depends, in   great measure, on the length given to the re-

  gulating or spiral spring.            If   with the same kind of dead
  escapement          certain watches go badly, whilst others are
 very regular, we here see the cause of it ; and moreover
  the new observation may be of great help in the disposition
 of pendulums, whether small or second, where the pendulum
 is suspended by a spring : in effect, we know by what pre
 cedes that it must have such a length in the spring of sus
 pension, that all the vibrations of these pendulums may be
 isochronous.
     Though we should suppose,                even in the regulating spring
iof   a watch,       the length requisite to render         all the vibrations
 of    the balance isochronous,             if  it was applied there by the
 common methods,               this isochronism would be presently de
 stroyed by the friction of the pivots of the balance, which,
 according to the remark made by Daniel Bernoulli *, would
 become always less considerable in great arcs than in small ;
 for, by theory,          the obstacles of friction, the tenacity of oil,
 &c,      as those       of gravity, of springs, of cohesion, &c. are
 proportional to the times during which they are surmounted.
 Now, the vibrations independent of these frictions being
 supposed isochronous, these frictions must become much
 less considerable          with    regard   to the force which surmounts
 them,      when,       for example, these arcs are doubled;                since
•this force, being as the arcs, is then doubled,                  and the time
 not sensibly different.

 as   they are curious, which may be consulted f.
     The inverse of what precedes takes place for the friction
 occasioned by the balance wheel on the parts of the escape
 ment, viz. the cylinder in those of Graham, and on the
 plates or planes in those of Debaufre, Sully, Le Roy, Gour-
 dain, &c. These frictions, instead of rendering the long vi
 brations quicker than the short ones, on the contrary aug
 ment the duration of the former : the following is the cause :

doin,  it is impossible to augment the arc withbut      aug-<
meriting   the force which supports the vibrations, and con
sequently the pressure of the balance wheel on the cylinders
or planes,        &c.;   and as, by theory, a quadruple     force is ne
cessary  (abstraction being made from a great number of
causes, both   physical and mechanical, which concur here
tp destroy a part of the motion of the balance) ; as it is ne
cessary,    I   to have a quadruple force to impress on the
                  say,
Balance as well as on the balance wheel a double velocity,
it follows, that the pressure on the cylinders, the planes,
&c. (always in proportion to the motive force) augments
here in a much greater ratio than the force of the regulator
to overcome them, which is only as the velocity. We know,
also,   that when the wheel-work           is impeded.,     whether by
friction, the coagulation of the oil, &c., there must arise
considerable variations in watches with a dead escapement],
for then the force communicated to the balance is necessarily
much less.    But the friction on the cylinders or planes is
not diminished by this, because the pressure of the wheel
on these cylinders or planes is a dead force, and the resist
ances and frictionof the wheel -work have no sensible effect,
except when the moveable parts are in motion.
  We can hardly determine any thing respecting those
causes which affect the isochronism   of the vibrations in
watches with a dead escapement, and which, without any
thing regular, make them advance or retard. All that we
can say     is,   that they augment or diminish     according to the
quantity of friction on the cylindric portions, according to
jhe form of the balance, the size of its pivots, the quality of
the oil, the length of the spiral spring, the number of                vi
brations in given time, the length of the arc, the points of
                  a
that arc where the wheel ceases to act on the balance, the
number of teeth in the balance wheel, its mass, the quan
tity of motive force, &c.
   There are, without doubt,      number and magnitude of
                                     a                  a

th.e best   way, without       any comparison,   will   be always      (as

Third      cause     of variations in        watches      — the      manner in u'liich
   the         is sustained, and the different situations in
          balance
   which they are placed.
   It   is clear that the weight             of   the balance occasions on the
pivots that sustain           it,
                       friction that

judicial  but much less considerable, when, the watch being
           ;
laid flat,     carried on the extremity of one of its pivot-;,
               it   is
than when, hanging, the weight of the balance       borne on              is
the circumference of the two pivots                        by
                                        what precedes, there

the balance, the number of its vibrations, their magnitude,
the length of the spiral spring, its form, ,&c.       Experi
ence     shows, in effect,         that most watches, especially those
which      have          dead escapements, lose when hung up.       To
correct this irregularity, we render the balance more weighty
in that part of its circumference which       underneath when   is
the watch      hung up
                is         but   this

evil rather than destroy               it,
                             and we render the watch more
subject  to vary    shocks  by
                           and  different motions, the effect
of which to be done away requires (as we shall presently
see) that the balance be throughout of equal weight.

Fourth       inconvenience          of watches, — they            lose in   heat,    and
                                     gain in cold.
  This effect arises in watches with   dead escapement,      a
lit,From the different causes which render the vibrations
of the regulator greater    heat: 2dly, Because the dimen
                                       by

these united effects there results                a   variation,       greater or less,

force of the spiral, the greater or less freedom of the ba
lance, &c.    In general, watches with dead escapements
advance about five minutes in twenty-four hours, when,
from the heat of the fob, which is nearly7 equal to that felt
under the tropic,                it   passes to that degree               of cold which pro
duces ice.
     If
      we wish to know how much influence the balance and
the spiral spring have separately on these errors, the calcu
lation is easily made.
   Experience shows that a steel bar of three feet increases
l-60th of an inch nearly, or TiV0th part, when from freez
ing cold it         passes to a heat              which       raises Reaumur's              thermo
meter* to 30°, about equal to the heat of the fob of                                    a   middle-
aged man.
     Now the weight of                    a balance being            known, the resistance
which it gives             to the spiral is in the direct ratio                   of the square
of   the distance              of its circumference of percussion,                     if we    may
so express          it,    from the centre            of its motion
                                                      theory,              ;    and     by
the number of vibrations    in the inverse proportion of this
                                             is

    Fifth   cause   of error in watches, the little power of the
           regulators with regard to their motive force.
    This inconvenience          arises, according to what has been
said above, from the resistance of the air, the friction of
the suspension, &c. causing a considerable loss of motion
in the regulator in each vibration ; and since the balance of
a watch ought to go of itself, (partir au doigt *) as watch
makers say, (that is, it should be put in motion by the mo
tive force, when this motion has ceased from any cause what
ever,) this balance can only be very slight.                  Make the ba
lance of a watch vibrate separately from the wheel-work, and
you will see that if at first the vibration is 180° it will lose
all its motion in 90" in            a horizontal      situation, and in 60"
in a vertical one ; instead          of which       a pendulum      preserves
the oscillatory motion given to it for twelve or fifteen hours
without any foreign help : consequently the impression of
the motive force, and the variations which arise from wear
and from      friction,   are  in watches, with regard to the effect
that they produce on the pendulum, in the proportion of
 15 hours.,    or 900' to !£'.

    If  the defects     remarked in the construction              of watches
are the sources      whence all their irregularities are derived, in
order to render a work of this kind capable of the greatest
accuracy possible, it is necessary, consequently, to collect
together the opposite properties.              Thus, after having given,
to this work the greatest simplicity               of which it   is suscepti

   6thly,        To       render- the machine invariable                in the different
positions and shocks which it may receive.
  This is what I think I have executed in the following
construction.  For greater clearness, after having said a few
words on wheel-work,                      I    shall treat    each"    of       these       articles
separately,       in the preceding part.
                     as
   M.       Bernoulli, in the researches which                    I   have already cited
several times, wishes marine watches to be as large as good
clocks are commonly made, that the pieces may be worked
with  greater exactness, and that their defects, if there are
any, may be more easily perceived : this is nearly what I
have practised in the new marine watch.  It goes 38. hours.
Plate I. fig. 6 and 1, shows the plan and profile of the
movement on                a   diameter of three inches           :   it is composed of
a frame          cccc (fig.          6 and 7-) containing             four flat wheels,
toothed      ;    the      first,     placed below the barrel                   b   li,   contain
ing     the main spring,  fifty teeth, and turns,

called the minute wheel, because      makes one turn in an

        ;                 adjusted on its axis. The minute

                                     it
carries the seconds hand on its axis. Lastly, the seconds
wheel,        pinion p, of seven, (fig.

it is by means of this wheel that the escapement works.
   With regard to the hour wheel, or that which carries the
hour hands,       H,   IV.) it has 48 teeth, and is conducted
                         (Plate
by a lanthorn pinion of four, which being adjusted on the
axis of the centre wheel m, carries the minute hand e (fig. 7,
Plate    I.)   on its extremity formed into a square.
     By this disposition, the hour circle,   and those                 of minutes
and seconds, have each one its centre, as we may see in
Plate IV.  I have preferred this, although the hour hand
necessarily turns to the left, because it suppresses one wheel
and some slight friction * ; for we can never render a
watch destined for the sea sufficiently simple, the acci
dents which may happen to an instrument being always in
the ratio of the number of pieces that compose it.
   Moreover, in this wheel-work, the simplicity of which is
evident, all the wheels are horizontal, and the escapement
wheel moves on the extremity of its pivot ; whence arises
great freedom in the moving part.
                                      Article     II.
Continuation of the description of the new watch : means by
  which llie friction has been reduced to the least value, by
  rendering the regulator as free and as powerful as it
     can be.
     This regulator or balance vvvv (fig. 7, Plate                     I,    and fig.
1    and 6, Plate      III.)   is   of steel.     It weighs about     five ounces;
it   is four inches diameter, and                is mounted on an arbor             AA
(fig. 7, Plate     I.    and fig. 6, Plate         III.)   of about   five inches.
A    frame     of copper xxxx,           6cc. (fig. 6, Plate    III.),      to   which
is adapted the movement, holds this balance horizontally,
suspended by the upper extremity of its arbor, by means of
a very fine harpsichord wire F, whidh is attached to                                  it,
•whose   length     about three inches, and forms the samp
                        is
vertical right line as the axis of the arbor.
  That this balance may turn very freely on its axis, each
of its pivots     retained, with the proper play, between four

     *
Observatory at Greenwich. — T.   £.    S.

 rollers, turning freely in two small frames cc, cc, (fig. 6,
 Plate III.) the one for the lower pivot adapted to the lower
 part of the large frame ; the other to the upper, for the pivot
 or trunnion t, (fig. 7, Plate I .) at some distance from which,
 is attached the wire of suspension. All this is arranged with,
 the necessary precautions,            so that       the wire and the axis       of
 the balance may form always the same vertical                    line.
   This balance thus suspended makes vibrations of about
20" duration each, by means of the elasticity of the suss
pending wire. Two spiral springs ss, ss, (fig. 6, Plate III.)
similar to those which serve as a mover in common watches,
adjusted at the bottom of the balance arbor, by means of
their ferrules, as the spiral in common watchei;, and in a
centre of equilibrium absolutely idle (as M. Daniel Bernoulli
recommends in the researches above cited), act so that these
vibrations are each made in about half a second.
  By this construction I avoid those defects of watches re-,
marked Articles III and V. of the preceding part; for, the
balance being freely sustained by the suspension wire, the
friction which it would occasion by its weight, the very
rapid wear which would result from                    it,
                                          &c., are absolutely
suppressed,  and    means   of
                            by the rollers, whose properties
are well      known, those which             are produced      by   the effort   of
the    regulating spring, by shocks,                 and the lateral motions
of     the balance,      the effect of the

are reduced          to the least quantity     ;     whence  ithappens, that
instead      of only preserving its oscillatory motion for about                 a,
minute,      the balance of the watch in the experiment re-,
              as
lated, (Article V. Part II.) the regulator keeps going here
more than half an hour      the two springs contribute also to
                                  ;
this   their efforts on the pivots being opposite, are recipro
       ;
cally destroyed.

New methsd            by   which the most perfect isochronism          is   given
                      to the vibrations      of the balance.
  It       appears    so simple,            occupied with the
                                      when we        are
theory of watches, to try, first, whether the different lengths
of springs produce no changes      the proportion which exists
                                          in
                                                       between

                     of measuring Time at Sea.                   61
between the      time of their vibrations of different extents, and
consequently, whether in these lengths there may not be one
where the long and short are isochronous ; so many reasons,
drawn from the principles of philosophy and mechanics,
appear to lead us to this conclusion, that we shall find it
difficult to conceive how            hitherto been ignorant of
                                  we have
this important fact ; much less can we conceive that it was
not till after twenty years researches that we arrived at this
discovery.   Happily, men of science are not ignorant that
the simplest things, almost always the most useful, are fre
quently so much the more difficult to discover, as, according
to the remark of an illustrious                Secretary to the Academy,
tue are less inclined to seek         for   thern.
   However it may be, it is constantly the                 case,    as    I   have
already said, Article II. Part II., that in               every     spring of
sufficient extent there is a certain length where             all   the vibra
tions, whether long or short, are isochronous.                I    have expe
rienced this in a great number of springs.
   To procure, therefore, in the vibrations the most perfect
isochronism, I adjust the spiral springs to the balance, and
I set the marine watch to go (which, as we have seen, has
no fusee,) twelve hours in the long arcs and twelve hours in
the short arcs ; that is to say, twelve hours with the moving
spring highly wound up, and twelve hours with it al
most unwound.         If,   in this last case, the going of the watch
is more accelerated          than in the'flrst, it proves that these
springs are too long,           and   I     On the con
                                          shorten them.
                            I
                      lengthen ihem ; and thus I proceed
trary, if it is slower,
until I have found the point where the watch goes very
equably both in the high and low strain of the spring : I
then diminish or increase the weight of the balance until
the watch        is regulated.          This operation     at first       appears
long; but practice       renders       it so easy, that    at first sight        I
know actually,       very nearly,         the length   of spring where all
the vibrations are     of equal duration.            The two spiral springs
are here    of   some help, because we can only act on the one,
and the quantities which we lengthen or shorten produce             it,
less effect. For example, in my marine watch about one
line   of diminution in the lower spring makes               it    gain in the
            8                                                                 high

  high strain of its main spring a second and a quarter in sx
  hours more than in the low strain of this spring, where the
  arcs  of vibration     are reduced       to about a quarter        of what they
  are when the watch has           just   been wound up.
     I  shall add to what precedes, that I am certain, from a
 number of trials, and it is -easy to verify, that, the long and
  short arcs of vibration once rendered isochronous by this
 method,      all the intermediate arcs are ,rendered so also, with
 the greatest       exactness : this is what I do not believe can
 easily be produced by compensation curbs, cycloidal cheeks,
 and other methods, by which they have hitherto attempted
 to render the vibrations of the spiral spring isochronous;
 and when, by dint of penetration and care, an artist has per
 fected such curbs, &c., can others* expect to succeed equally
 as well ?       The Academy, without doubt, want a machine
 whose success does not depend                 on such rare execution.             It
 was probably some case of this kind which made a learned
man say, that the novelties produced by artists rarely have
 their success confirmed by time, it being frequently owing
to the particular attention which they pay to the execution
of    the pieces which they announce as their invention ; in
stead     of which, scientific men set a higher value on things
 more theoretic and less dependant on practice.
                                  Article      IV.
Where we again establish the necessity of giving to the vi
    brations of the regulator the greatest possible freedom.
    I  believe    I have already proved          (Article II. Part II.) that
to give to a clock the greatest               degree of accuracy which it
is susceptible of, it is necessary that the vibrations of its
regulator should have the most perfect isochronUin and the
greatest freedom possible.
    And now that I            am going to treat of the escapement,
(whose disposition         must     always be relative to nature, and to
the properties of the regulator which is used,) .to leave no

I   acknowledge that, in watches, where the very confined
space does not permit us to apply all the resources of the
art,   would be very difficult to determine, whether some
        it
slight differences in the times of the long and short vibra
tions do not sometimes, as well as slight frictions, produce
compensations, whence results      greater degree of accuracy,

to obtain  greater degree of truth.

     In   effect,         friction    is
                                      a  thing subject to        a    thousand varie
ties incompatible with                  much exactness.              Let    the regulator
in its vibrations experience some friction                       ;    it   necessary       fol
lows, that the quantity of this friction will vary according
as the contact of the air alters the polish of the rubbing sur
faces, according as they alter each other, and the softest
body leaves its parts on the hardest, according as the oil
which we apply to soften the friction becomes more or less
fluid, &c.
   Let us suppose, also, that                  the vibrations      of the regulator,
abandoned to itself, are not isochronous,                         but that    some    by
mechanical artifice we happen to render                          them all of equal
duration  (by friction, for example, or,

 said with regard to the pendulum                     is evidently applicable
 here, since we have seen, Article                   II., that supposing the
 vibrations of the free balance isochronous in its application
 to the watch, the long arcs, which arise from less friction
 upon the pivots, would make it advance ; but if they pro
 ceed from an overplusof motive force, they retard    on the              it,
 contrary   ;                    of the
                and that the difficulty action of the wheel-
 work would produce again different effect, &c.

    What will   beit we introduce the changes which arise
                           if
 in the magnitude of the vibrations from shocks and divers
 motions    ?   By    a   little attention we shall find that an escape
ment can never render the vibrations                isochronous in these
 different cases, unless        it   be   a   true Proteus, whose form, con
tinually varying, adapts         itself to      these different circumstances.
 I  shall say on this occasion,that notwithstanding the ex
periments  made   with the time-keepers of Mr. Harrison,
which are so strongly in favour of this work, the methods
which  are used to render the vibrations of the regulator iso
chronous appear to me very imperfect, and that       am here            I
of the same opinion as the person who has made the report
to the Board of Longitude. Supposing, says he, the opinion
 of Mr. Harrison to be true, (he speaks of the short vibra
tions which      Mr. Harrison pretends             are slower than the long,)
lam    by   no means certain, continues he, that the methods                       he
 employs are proper to produce the effect which he expects
from, them.   In truth, this article of the report appears to
 me absolutely unintelligible. Mr. Harrison uses, says the
report, two methods to render the motion      the vibrations  of
equal : the Jirst         is,
                    to put a pin, against which the balance
may  press, which augments its farce but        found to be
                                                     ;        it   is
diminished,      as   Mr. Harrison pretends, when the vibrations
aye greater.       Tlie                 is, to give to his pallets
                            second method
such a    form,    that the wheels may press them less when the
vibrations augment. Although the terms of this Report are
not very intelligible,  and appear even incomprehensible,
since it mentions wheels which press less when the vibra
tions augment, instead of which,                    by   the description,       there
isa  very delicate spring which act*                 on     the balance     by   one
wheel only   ;   we may nevertheless              suspect    that the isochro-
                                                                                nism

bi$m of the vibrations proceeds, in a great measure, from the
curve of the escapement; that thus, by what precedes, this
isochronism does not appear founded on fixed and invariable
principles.
   A still more powerful motive to determine us in favour
of the isochronisin and freedom of the vibrations, as far as
it   is possible                  that the same obstacles, of
                        to obtain them,               is,
whatever nature they may be, arising from the air, or from
some slight friciion; which oppose themselves to the motion
of ih'i regulator, will have so much the less influence on 1he
time of its vibrations a* they are more free     this  what              :       is             it
   so important to clear up, and which       shall demonstrate
by is

stead     of   that    of thirty     ;     in   the penultima it has the necessary
velocity to overcome the resistance of the accelerating force;
in the last it has besides, that of friction, or of the air, which
it   experiences        there; in the antepenultima                        it has the requi
site velocity to surmount                       the            of that

the same reasoning      all the other points of the space
                                     to
twenty, we shall find that in the present case the velocity
there is greater than                if,
                          disengaged from every obstacle fo
reign to the accelerating force,    should describe the spactf

same must be concluded                      for every other space.    Therefore
the foreign resistances                    experienced by      body in vibration
                                                                      a

                                           Corollary         T.
     The inverse of           preceding evidently takes place in the
                               the
accelerated       semi-vibrations.
                                          Corollary          It.
     The    obstacles         which may               be opposed to the motion               of
a body in its retarded semi-vibration, being so many causes
which make         stop the sooner; on the contrary, in the
                       it
accelerated semi -vibrations, the foreign obstacles destroying
a  part of the acceleration, and hindering this semi-vibration
from being made so readily, (since every body which oscil
lates necessarily feels some foreign resistances, whether from
the air, from the friction                      of    the parts which sustain     or   it,
from the particles themselves                         of the spring which holds it;)
it follows, that in every body which vibratos, the retarded
semi-vibration     always quicker than the accelerated semi-
                         is
vibration which succeeds it; and that the more considerable
the resistances          are   which        we have         just spoken of,      the greater
is   the difference         between the time                 of the acceleration     and the
retardation.

its point of rest.
                                          Observation        II.
     If                       body the difference of time em
           in the vibrations of                  a

     is

semi-vibrations will then be compensated        the gain which
they will   produce  in the retarded semi-vibrations, and vice
versa.
                                         Observation         III.
     But when             Several     causes         render the accelerated                     semi-vi
brations sensibly slower than the retarded,' then the whole

 VV E       have     been     to   visit     the    porcelain     manufactory         of
M.     Sureda, who makes              the     finest biscuit china      I have ever
seen.       He    does   not make use            of kaolin, however, but of            a
siliceous -magnesian stone called sea-froth or lithomarga,
found at the gates of Madrid f. We shall send you some
specimens which must astonish you.                             M. Sureda covers
his china with feldspars of Galic.ia, which                      are very elegant.
You may regard the above kind of stone                          as one of the best
for making chemical furnaces.                       When it comes out of the
quarry it is shaped          like   soap wedges.          The lightness of these
furnaces is extraordinary ; and they never melt, however
stronsr the fire may be raised.                  Besides magnesia, silex, and
some atoms of argil and lime, this stone contains a little
potash, which contributes riot a little to the beauty and fine
ness of the china.
     I have now to mention a fact perhaps as interesting as
the foregoing.           Don Mariano la Gasca, a student of Cava-
nilles, and a young botanist of great promise, has sent me a
quantity of lichen islandicus, which he discovered in the
mountains of Leon, where it grows in great abundance.
     I expected to have only found a more or less tinc
torial substance ; but 1 found that it was an excellent plant
for eating when it               was    cooked, very tender^ and              that it

Bois de Boulogne.
   Ope pound of dry lichen yields three pounds of boiled
herb very well tasted, which may be eaten with oil, beer, or
in various other wavs. We have already eaten       six times                      it
in our familv,            and all nay friends were
                                     highly pleased with
it. Its tissue  purely  membranous;
                          is            contains neither          it
wood nor thready substance this renders     very pleasant

kinds of mosses there may be several others equally nutritive,
and perhaps still better. Although very elastic after boiling,
there   nothing of an animal nature in the lichen, as its
          is
products are like those of sugar and this surprised mo moat

of all.  One pound of this lichen furnished         oi: eight                    al
pounds  of soup,   which  became jellied like meat broth.                                      It
is   a   little bitter, hut not more so than endive water.                              I    sea
soned      it    with     sweet          and bitter almonds,           citron bark, and
sugar;         and   I   produced         a    very pleasant     mess.           Its mucilage
is   gelatinous,         different from gum:
                         very                     the same,            if   is                I
think,      as that      of fruit.

           Case  of White Swelling     cured by  Vital Air,
     Sarah Copeling, aet. 24, servant to Mr. Harrison, No. 14,
 l-ittle Tpwer-street, had an extremely large Bcrophuloul
Jumour on the right qide of the neck ; and this disposition
 showed itself also in the knee of the same side, which was
 greatly swelled and enlarged, rendering her extremely lame.
'The tumour in the neck was         of six years duration, and the
white swelling jn the right knee had existed three months
Y'hen she commenced the inhalation of the vital air. A sa-
turine lotion    was   the only application     used  to the knee:
this plan was pursued during two months ; when her con
 stitution became so 'much invigorated, that the swellings in
her neck disappeared to the sight, being so much reduced
as no longer to be observed, or thought worthy of attention;
and the white swelling entirely gave way: and this benefit
has     now continued six months.        No medicine of any kind
was taken; therefore the constitutional change wa> effected
by the sole power of the vital air.
                     Observations   on this Case.
     1.  When Dr.   Beddoes    inhaled the vital air by way of ex
periment, he remarks.,
                            "   that his complexion from being
fallow became ruddy, and that he was diminished greatly
in size, being naturally disposed to obesity; and his appe
tite was rendered remarkably keen."
     2. This experiment, which was repeated for the space of
six weeks, proved the power of vital air in promoting the
action of the absorbents.
     3. He also remarks, " that he Felt in consequence so
much warmer than usual,, that he was obliged to lay aside         a
blanket."
    4. Now    as torpor is the character of scrophula, is not the
vital air indicated from this experiment by Dr. Beddoes, in
Bcrophula?
     3. The quantity inhaled daily was two quarts, mixed with
about fourteen of atmospheric.

  XII.    Observations     of M. BONEFOS, Assistant Physician of
     the   Infirmary      at   Perpignan,         upon Fumigations with             the
      Oxygenated Muriatic Acid *.
   4- OWARDS the commencement                     of last year,         a  person ac
  cused   of   a capital crime was conducted to the prison                    of Per
  pignan and shut up in a cell,                  the capacity       of which was
  about 60 or 65 cubic metres.                    This unfortunate prisoner
  was   afflicted    with    a  severe     dysentery.         When I was called
  in, his cell      exhaled    a    most infectious          smell    ;   the palliass
  upon which he lay, and the raes which covered him, were
  impregnated with fecal matter. The jailor opened the door
  with great repugnance, but would not enter.                       I immediately
  made a strong fumigation,               according to Guyton Morveau's
  process. Scarcely         was    the    vapour of the oxymuriatic acid
  gas liberated when the fetid smell was annihilated, although
  the fecal matters still existed            in this confined place.             I ap-
'proached the sick ma,n                n:id conversed         with him, experi
 encing no disagreeable               sensation : the jailor followed my
 example;        he entered,       and     every     necessary      attention      was
  paid to the       prisoner.       A fumigatory apparatus continued
  to furnish gaseous emanations during the time requisite to
  cleanse the cell.        A clergyman came to visit the prisoner
  some time afterwards, and spent three quarters of an hour
  with him, without being in              the least incommoded.              The -fu
  migation      was    repeated       the   same     day.     All    the prisoners,
  the  jailor,    the turnkeys,        and the gens d'armes, learnt, with
  surprise, a fact so speedily and so easily obtained.                            The
 jailor asked me what was necessary to renew these fumiga
  tions.     I  furnished      him with a sufficient quantity of the
  mixture of muriate of soda and oxide of manganese, pre-?
  pared in proper proportions,              and     an analogous dose          of sul
  phuric    acid.     He has     since established fumigatory vases in
  the  various'parts of the prison where               there were bad smells.
     A   few days before, I had cleared from infection a great
  part of the house of M. Durand, a very respectable merchant

mouldy and in                 a state    of fermentation, emitted                      a   most
agreeable smell ; the oxymuriatic acid gas destroyed  all thesq
putrid emanations,   allowed  us to  approach   the  cochineal
without fear, and we were able to save a part of this precious,
commodity.

tion    the healing art.
            in             The late M. Vogel, professor of
chemistry at Gottingen,     one of the first whose attention,
                                              is
was occupied in discovering the nature of this substance.
On directing his observations to distillation, he perceived
that human fat yielded                        a   liquid product which                 had all the
properties of an acid.
       The author of this memoir                         was desirous          of ascertaining
the difference which existed                            in the 'tat of animals whose
exercises  are violent, such                        as      the   wolf,      the   hare, &c.,       as
well     as that         of
                some carnivorous birds     but the difficulty of    ;
procuring     sufficient
                     a   quantity at one time  compelled him
to defer his labours to   future period. a
   His first experiments had for their object to examine
hoe's lard, per                   se,   and   combined             with      other substances.
Although this labour     still incomplete,
                                        is  may lead to some            it

And changes from          a  white    to  a  yellow colour, without,
however, acquiring         any   acidity.    When the contact with
the air is added to the      solar rays, the same phenomena take
place, and it always becomes acid.
    Caluric. — Fat melts at 32-34 of Reaumur (90-21 Fahr.),
At   this temperature it remains in fusion without undergoing
decomposition ; but when the temperature is pushed be
yond 80° (174° Fahr.) it begins to be decomposed,
    The author did not think        necessary    to describe the distil
lation   of hog's lard     : this operation has been already per
formed, and its products examined, by Messrs. Von Crell,
Guyton and Thcnard ; he only observes that fat, when well
washed, does not yield ammonia upon distillation, while that
which has not been washed yields very sensible tuices of it.
The water in which muscular substances have been washed,
the cellular tissue of which is not exactly separated, takes
away from it a notable quantity of gelatinous animal matter
which accompanies the membranes ; it is iliis animal gela
tinous-matter which produces the ammonia in distillation.
    Sulphur.-. — Fat mixed with half its weight of sulphur
sublimed and washed, forms what is vulgarly c.iilrJ sulphur
pomatum.
    This compound was examined four days after its prepara
tion, as well as a sinvlar mixture a little older, and no traces
whatever of sulphuric acid were discovered.                   By a slow
fusion in B. M. we separated, by decantation, a quantity of
fat  ; and on passing the rest through fine I,.;         .1. we obtained
the greatest     part of the fat employed      :  it had  a  gray colour,
a   bitter,   sharp, and very strong taste ;        it congealed much
more quickly than        conmion fat when cooled, anil it black-*
ened silver vessels.
    Thus    there is sulphur dissolved in this compound          : it will
even be found in solution,        every time it is employed in fric
tion.     The elevation of     the temperature facilitates this solu
tion.
    We know how rapiilly sulphur            penetrates through places
far remote from the spot where it WMS ma-le use of in the
shape of pomatum : this is not so surprising when we re
flect that the sulphur is in solution.            I am igno.ant, says
                                                               M. Vogel,

M. Vogel, if        sulphur, divided by any other vehicle, (thick
niucilage        or gelatine, for instance,) acts in- an analogous
planner.         1 suspect, however, that when it is employed in
friction, divided by              means        of one of   these bodies, its results
would be different from thos.e                     of sulphur dissolved in fat.
      If
       we raise the sulphurated fat to the boiling point, i:ni:
if itis hastily decanted and cooled, a part of the sulphur is
precipitated ; but           jf
                      it has been allowed to cool slowly, the
Sulphur then crystallizes in beautiful needles.
   When we distil in the open fire sulphurated fat in a
luted glass retort, and receive the products over mercury s
•we obtain a great. quantity of gas, which, being collected
and examined, appears to he a mixture                          of plenty of sulphu
rated  hydrogen gas, carbonated hydrogen gas, and a little-
carbonic acid gas.    We never found any sulphurous acid
gas, as several chemists have asserted.
    From        the   moment            that    the elastic fluids        eease to pass,
white thick           vapours are perceived, condensing                        with diffi
culty, and there is sublimed at the neck of the retort a yel
low matter, which was merely fat mixed with a little sul
phur : the liquor of the receiver looked milkj ; it yielded,
upon  cooling, small white crystals ; this was merely sul
phur in minute division.   The retort contained a brilliant
prismatic charcoal in abundance.

                      very        kept the whole for about

a quarter of an. hour at the same temperature    took care                :I
not to agitate the liquid too much, in order to avoid the
action of the air, which would have acidified the phos
phorus.
    When        the fat was        cold,    I      recovered   a   part   of   the phos
phorus which              was     not    dissolved.        This fat had          a   slight

                      Memoir upon Animal Fat.                         fS
    As the     heat of the B. M.         was not sufficient  to dissolve
the phosphorus         employed, I made other mixtures of fat
and phosphorus in different proportions, which I brought
to the boiling point : this method favoured its solubility.
After many trials,         I ascertained that one ounpe of fat, at a
slight    ebullition,      can dissolve five grains of phosphorus,
a part   of which is precipitated, upon cooling.
    This phosphorated fat was washed several times in boil
ing water : the washings were acid, blackened the nitrate of
silver, and formed a flaky precipitate with lime water : this
water had taken from it its acid property, but not that of
blackening the nitrate of silver : thus, one part of the phos
phorus remained in a true solution without acidifying.
    These two kinds of phosphorated fat, that which                  had
been prepared in B. M., and that prepared by ebullition,
 either washed or not, emitted no light in the dark at a tem
 perature of 10-15 (50-27 Fahr.), nor even by rubbing with
 the hand; but if the temperature was raised to 6O1 (MO*
 Fahr.), the luminous effects were a liitle visible. The phos
 phorated fat,      the    undissolved      phosphorus of which had
 been carefully separated,        did not shine in the ordinary tem
 perature.
     I distilled twelve grains of phosphorus with two ounces
 of fat : the matter soon assumed a charry appearance, much
 more speedily than common fat submitted to the same ope
 ration  ;  there was     liberated   at  the beginning,   phosphorated
 hydrogen gas, which took fire in the receiver ; and ive after
 wards obtained under a bell- glass, in -the mercurial appara
 tus, phosphorated hydrogen, gas and carbonated hydrogen
 gas.    The receiver contained fat which had been bleru'ed
 with phosphorus and phosphorated hydrogen gas.                     After
 cooling,     it took  fire  with  the   contact of the air, and  burned
 the fat rapidly.
     Whatever is the temperature, therefore, employed to dis
  solve phosphorus in fat, there is formed every time a
  greater or less quantity of phosphorous ,ICK!
                                                         — this inclines
  me to think that the same thing happens                in many other
  phosphorated compounds.

 shown, that the solution of phosphorus in one or other of
 these oils can never be considered as a regular medical ap
 plication ; that there is immediately formed a small quan
 tity of acid, and that this quantity increases through time.
    All the experiments hitherto mentioned were made with
the contact of the air, the result                          of which, always             was       an

    Idid not omit to repeat several experiments without the
contact of air, such as M. Boullay had announced in one of
his reports to the Pharmaceutical Society.

rus was dissolved             ;   and  I   remarked,   with M . Boullay, that
fat was       not acid, but that             itblackened the nitrate of silver.

above its level ; the      gas which remained in    the cylinder did
not inflame in the air, but took fire immediately on the ap
proach of    a  lighted candle.
    The gas waa thus entirely         decomposed, and the whole
quantity of phosphorus         was   decomposed.     I attribute tht
Cause    of this absorption not only to the    loss  of phosphorus,
which, without doubt, had diminished            the volume     of the
gas, but also to its temperature ; since it was recently libe
rated, and had passed through the hot fat, which would con
sequently dilate its volume a little.
    The fat which remained had all the characters           of phos
phorated fat ; it soon became acid in the air.
    The Acids. — As the sulphuric and muriatic acids are not
very interesting, the latter having even no action at all upon
fat, I directed my attention chiefly to the phenomena prefc
scnted by the nitric acid.
    This acid      has  become   a valuable agent in the hands of
the chemists.         To  the action  of this acid upon organized
bodies we are indebted for a great number of discoveries,
    It  is well    known how much facts      have   multiplied   since
we have been able to explain the changes which take place
upon animal and vegetable compounds.
     Berthollet has in some measure paved the way by his im
 portant labours upon animal substances ; and the experi
 ments of Messrs. Fourcroy and Vauquelin have left us no
 thing more        to  desire on that subject.     These gentlemen
have     considerably enlarged the sphere of our knowledge in
 this department, so difficult of comprehension, and so use
 ful in the science of medicine.
     M.   Fourcroy was the first who ascertained the action of
 the   nitric acid upon fat.      M. Alyon and several other che
 mists have since presented interesting results on the subject.
     I treated fat in the manner prescribed by Messrs. Four
 croy and Alyon for making the oxygenated pomatum.                The
 latter observes,      that it does not stand in need of washing,
 as it is not acid : I repeated the process prescribed by him
 with one ounce of acid at 33° to the pound of fat.; I em
  ployed afterwards nitric acid of an infi:rior strength, from
 SO* down to 21° l the oxygenated fat was always acid.
                                                               1 mada

        I      this experiment in a retort in the pneumatic ap
             made
    paratus, and I obtained azotic gas as the produce : this gas
    was not disengaged pure, as M. Alybn announced ; it was
    mixed   with nitrous gas and carbonic acid gas, as justly
    observed by M. Van Mons.
       Fat thus oxygenated, of a hardness equal to suet, melts at
    the temperature of 36° or 38° of Reaumur, (96° to 10O° of
    Fahr.)
       I boiled it with water, which acquired a citron yellow co
    lour from      had it,
                         bitter and sharp taste, reddened furnsole
                                   a
     paper, and constantly precipitated the acetate of lead and
    -nitrate of mercury. This water distilled in   retort, almost         a
     to dryness, yields   colourless white liquor which contains
                                       a
    a quantity of acetic acid;                 it   does not then precipitate the
    above metallic solutions.

    being decanted   and exposed to evaporation in       stove, an                a
    inliuity of very brilliant white needles crystallize in it.                                   I
    took these crystals at first for oxalic acid  but lime-water        ;
    was not in the least affected                  by   them   ;   besides,   they had no
    other    of       the properties of the oxalic acid             :    we shall see their
    nature       a    little further on.
        However often               we may wash oxygenated fat,
                                                       its yellow

    larly bleached. The fat remaining      also whiter     is                         ;    the    al

solves it for the most part, and this last liquor is still
acid.
    Since the acid adheres so intimately to the fat, I tried to
separate it from the latter by salifiable bases,, and I made use
of lime-water, which I boiled with oxygenated                     fat ; the fat
lost its alkalinity, and acquired a colour of a citron yellow.
This neutral liquor, which I regarded more as a combina
tion   of lime with      an acid, than fat, was abundantly                  preci
pitated by the acetate        of lead.
    Evaporated to the consistence of a syrup, it is discoloured
by the nitric and muriatic acids, which form in it a whitish
precipitate $ at the same time, when we pour the acid, a very
rancid odour is manifested.
    Barytes water acts upon oxygenated fat in a more effica
cious manner.          The orange yellow colour which the water
acquires from it is equally destroyed by the acids.                     I poured
 into it a quantity of sulphuric acid sufficient to carry off the
barytes;     I  boiled the whole,       and   I filtered   the    liquor while
 boiling.
    The filtered liqttor, which contained no barytes,                   was in a
great measure evaporated in a sand-bath ; small fine needles
 were Crystallized mixed with silky tufts, not precipitablc by
 lime water, insoluble in alcohol, and which were not sub
 limed in close vessels.
     When     fat is boiled with concentrated          nitric acid, and the
 ebullition is continued, adding water from time to time, a
white crystalline powder is formed upon cooling.
    This substance is rough to the touch, insoluble in alcohol,
much more soluble in boiling water than in cold water. By
 its combination with the bases, and by several other charac
 ters, I was convinced that it was mucous acid*.
     Fat thus oxygenated at the maximum is soft, of a brown
 colour,    sensibly soluble in water, and very soluble in alco
 hol.    Its washing      was    saturated     by potash ; from this re
 sulted a leafy salt, attracting           humidity from the air, and
    * Beef suet, although it decomposes  less strongly the niiric .iciJ, also yields
 mucous acid.
                                                                            which

   The precipitate formed by the acetate of lead in the wash
ing of oxygenated fat, is nothing else but the fat itself crtro-
bined with oxide of lead, and which carries with it a little
mucous acid      ;   the former floats above, when                  the precipitate
is decomposed by the sulphuric acid.
   Oxygenated fat being very soluble                a great in alcohol,
part of it may be precipitated by water. By the energetic
action of the concentrated nitric acid, upon fat, there is a
notable quantity of nitrate of ammonia formed, of which
we may be convinced by mixing                        potash or quicklime with
the washings.
   Oxygenated Muriatic Acid. — The action of this aeid upon
fat not having been yet described, I think it may be useful
to enter into some details.
    I   passed a great quantity              of oxymuriatic acid       gas into fat
kept in fusion in B.           M., the        gas, before arriving at        it,   pass
ing through     a    vessel containing             water.     The   fat absorbed      a
very great quantity of it.                   1   continued to pass     it   until the
bubbles no longer arosei
  After cooling, the fat was considerably augmented in
weight; its whiteness became dirty, and its consistence was
entirely changed     was soft, resembled
                          ;   it          an oily thick                              li

other, even at the temperature of 10" (50° Fahr.) in the                    :

    Having left    nearly two months in the air,

little more solidity, but never that of common                           fat, much
less that    of oxygenated         fat   :    its taste was rancid,      not sensi
bly acid, leaving behind                slightly hitter taste, which
                                         it   a

                         by
    obtained        by   M. DESGENETTES, from the Use     Fumiga            of
    tions    of   Oxymuriatic Acid.
-IVl. GUYTON and myself were directed to report to the so
ciety on the use of fumigations of oxymuriatic acid gas em
ployed by           M.Desgencttes according to the ordinary pro
cesses,      and    upon the results he obtained from it. These
fumigations seem not only to have had an influence upo*
the salubrity of the air, but also in the cure of diseases.
   The author of these observations remarked, at first, that
the military prisons of the capital regularly furnished    num                   a
ber    of   cases   of adynamic fevers to the hospitals, which fre
quently spread to the patients in the nearest beds, and also
to the nurses; he adds, that for nearly    year pa"it no such     a
infections have taken place. M. Desgenettes also observed
that gangrenes, being common                       among the wounded, were
also greatly checked               :   the specific smell of the gangrene was
not annihilated, but, according to him,                           it   was modified by
the fumigations.
   Another general observation made                          by   M.   Desgencttes was,
that for several years the scurvy had     been very frequent                               ;
that three persons, in particular, had been  affected with in                         it
a very violent manner; and, in short, one of them had been
shut up from the rest on account of the insupportable infec
tion spread         by
              torrents of sanious saliva. Nevertheless, by
means       of fumigations,
                      this specific smell was neutralized.
Tt seemed to be concentrated, as   were, round the patient.

patients without any bad effects,                    and they attended       them
regularly.
  M. Desgenettcs docs not confine himself to these general
remarks ; he renders the favourable effects of fumigations,
according to M. Morveau's method, much more manifest,
by giving monthly, for these last nine months, the respec
tive numbers of patients admitted into the military hospital,
with   the addition      of   those patients who had been there from
the first ; this formed a sum total, which may be easily com
pared with the number of those who died during the nine
months.         Upon turning over              the registers   it appears,     that
out of       3617 patients, 223 died ; that is to say,               a   sixteenth,
or 0-06.        This report of mortality              is one   of   the most ad
vantageous       that   could be expected in an hospital ; and it
is so much the more conclusive         in favour of mineral fumi
gations, according to M. Guyton's process, that the mili
tary hospital of the capital often contains serious diseases,
and    is,
        for the most part, filled with refractory conscripts,
jind veterans not in garrison, who never come into the hos^
pitals until they have suffered               a   great deal elsewhere.
   Such are the facts related            by   M. Desgenettes;       and they con
firm more       and more the advantages     of mineral fumigations,
already established           by
                               other numerous observations collected
in   the     work of M.       Guyton.     may be inferred that these
                                               It
fumigations not only act as preservatives against adynamic
fevers and scurvy, but also concur in the cure of the
same maladies,          by
                  destroying the baneful influence exercised
upon   sick persons           by
                       deleterious miasma.    The use of this
salutary process in hospitals ought to excite  lively interest.a
I shall here add some facts within my own knowledge, and
which  have shown, in 1he Hospital tie     Salpetriere*, that
                                                          la

  chronic diseases,     intermittent or continued fevers, rheuma
  tisms,   dropsies, &c., which require a particular treatment.
  Some of those patients were more or less affected ; and we
  may easily imagine the cries and confusion produced by the
 first trials of fumigation a year ago,when the lunatics were en
 veloped in clouds of vapours : but experience has shown that
  such fumigations      as were   then used retard the cure of lunatic
 patients.     At  that    time I  employed nitric fumigations, fol
 lowing the usual method of throwing successively small quan
 tities of nitrate of potash into a little sulphuric acid, put in a
 glass.     At other times I       caused to be carried into different
 parts of   the hall a mixture      of muriate of  soda  and oxide  of
 manganese in the usual proportions, pouring, by degrees,
 into it some drops of sulphuric acid, that slight vapours
 only might be formed.
     Such patients as exhale a fetid smell are confined at the
 end of the hall, and it is there where the ordinary fumiga
 tions are used.      But    I think I  have  ascertained the source
 of the evil by remarking, that, in general,          the lunatics at
 tacked with     adynamic     fevers, scurvy, or even scorbutic gan
grene,     who   were    brought to the infirmaries, came always
 from certain infected places, which I resolved to discover.
     The first   place   I  examined was a small room containing
fourteen beds, and in which were confined such lunatics as
arc of a very advanced age, or in a complete state of mad
ness or idiotism.        The most of them are constantly bed-rid,
and in such a state of stupor and imbecility that they can
scarcely indicate the object of their necessities. The infec
tion must arise from the insalubrity of the air in a place in
habited by such unfortunate persons, heated in winter by a
stove, and very small besides.           Whatever precautions were
at any time used, this place was always very unwholesome;
and it was there where adynamic fevers and scurvy were con
tinually cherished previous to the repeated use of fumiga
tions of oxymuriatic acid gas, which were repeated once or
twice a month in summer, and oftencr in winter, producing
little or no inconvenience on account of the state of stupor
and insensibility of lunatic patients.         I then mixed fifteen
decigrammes       of muriate    of  soda with  three decigrammes
                                                         "          of

oxide   of manganese, which       I distributed    in two crucible*
 placed at a certain distance from     each   other, and into each
of which we successively poured six decigrammes of sul
phuric acid.
    Another place of the hospital, where the infected slate of
the air required reiterated mineral fumigations, was where
the cells were situated for the confinement of certain dan
gerous or delirious melancholic patients.         Some of these are
confined in strait waistcoats, others are left to themselves,
as experience shows that a superfluous restraint only pro
longs the duration of lunacy.         Their rooms are commonly
very  small, their dimensions   not  being more than two metres
in length and breadth, and three metres in height : this
only forms a capacity of twelve cubic metres for each lunatic.
The air not circulating in these .close apartments, rendered
humid    by frequent washings,      we may easily conceive how
fetid emanations are accumulated in them, as well as from
the description of patients who.inhabit them, who from
negligence or a propensity collect around them every kind
of nastiness : it was in these unwholesome apartments that
the fumigations of the oxymuriatic acid gas were most fre
quently practised, by filling them successively with these
mineral vapours, and shutting the doorv and window. The
infectious   smell is always destroyed by this method in a
?ure  manner   l and I did not perceive any inconvenience to
arise to the lunatics who were lodged in them, having pre
viously removed the worst among them into            a neighbouring
cell until the vapours were dispelled.
    In making use of      these  fumigations, there is a variety
which ought      to be remarked.       Some of these apartments
are ill paved,  and the urine then remains more or less be
tween the crevices     of the pavement      ;   this causes   a very
disagreeable   smell of ammoniacal gas.        In this  case I made
use of fumigations with plain muriatic gas, by simply pour
ing sulphuric acid upon muriate of soda : this produces a
rapid.combination of muriatic acid gas with the ammoniacal
gas,   and forms,   without doubt,     a new chemical compound
which does not permit the old smell to continue. We must,
fcowever, take care to remove the patient for two or three
                                                              hours,

hours, on account of the action                  of the muriatic vapours upon
the nostrils and the lungs.
  Several things may concur to diminish                                  the number             of
adynamic fevers and scurvy in an hospital ; but every thing
                           of the most powerful means is
leads us to believe, that one
the use of mineral fumigations ; and that they act particu
larly by destroying the deleterious miasmata which commu
nicate infection.

the acetic acid, without the intervention of a mineral aciii,
is incapable of forming ether. M. Schultze, of Kiel, has
proved, by experiments, that this assertion is well founded.
M.  Lichtemberg and myself have repeated these experi
ments, and found them very exact 5 but it is necessary that
the acetic acid should be very pure, so that the acetates of
silver and barytes may have no re-action upon it. A mi
nimum of sulphurous acid is sufficient to form ether. On.

retort, and no gas    formed.
                           is    On mixing the acid and the
alcohol they are not sensibly heated.
I    found, also, that the acidity of the acetic acid   not                             is
always in direct proportion to its specific gravity. An acid,

XVI.      Observatiotis    upon the two Preparations                 of Acetls
    Ether.     By M. HENRY, Professor of Pharmacy in                         the
    Pharmaceutical      School of Paris*.
 .H.AVING been directed by the society to ascertain the dif
ference which exists between acetic ethers prepared imme
diately, or by the intermedium of the sulphuric acid, I have
now to communicate the experiments made with that
view.
    M.  Gehlen,     in a letter addressed to M. Guyton, lately
published    in the   Annales de Chimief, insists that, accord
ing to the assertion of Scheele, it is proved that the acetic
acid, without the intervention          of    a mineral acid, is not ca
pable of forming ether.
    The author docs not tell us what acetic acid he employed ;
he merely asserts the fact, recommends very pure acetic
acid to be used, and adds, that               "  a minimum         of sulphu
rous acid is sufficient to form ether."
    I know that in a great part of Germany they extract the
acetic acid from acetate of soda by the intervention of sul
phuric acid : in place of that pointed out by Pellt-tier,
acetate of copper is made use of.                It was the latter I em
ployed, it did not contain an atom of mineral acid.
   But, without entering upon the discussion of a point long
ago decided by constant facts, I return to the present object
of my inquiries.
   -We   are indebted to Pelletier for the process                of obtaining
acetic ether,   which     consists   in    making       a  mixture    of equal
parts of rectified alcohol and acetic acid, in re-cohobating
three times the produce of the distillation upon the residue,
and rectifying the ether over potash.
    I followed this process, with this difference, that I re-
cohobated the produce of the distillation six times.
    From a mixture of 50O grammes of rectified alcohol,                       at
36 degrees,     and    an equal quantity        of   acetic acid at     1 1 de
grees,   I obtained 495 grammes of ether                 at 24 degrees,     ini-

                                                                      miscible

              On the hvo Preparations   of Acetic Ether.        87
fniscible in water, of an agreeable smell, reddening strongly
the blue vegetable colours.       No particular gas was liberated
during the operation, merely atmospheric air displaced by
the ethereal gas.       I rectified this ether over pure alcohol
(concentrated by potash) : it did not redden any longer the
blue vegetable colours. ; it marked 25 degrees in the areome
ter, and weighed 420 grammes.
    As to the process by the intermedium of the sulphuric
acid, indicated by our fellow member Durosier, it consists
in introducing 500 grammes of the acetate of copper, in
powder,      into a tubulated retort, to which the apparatus of
Woulft"    is adapted.    A mixture is afterwards made of equal
parts (500 grammes of each) of rectified alcohol and sul
phuric acid, which is introduced, when it is cooled, by the
tubulure of the retort ; it is gradually heated, and 640
grammes of acetic ether are obtained, mixed with sulphu
rous acid in a small quantity, marking in the areometer
25 degrees and a half, reddening strongly the blue vegetable
colours,     forming a precipitate with water of barytes and
lime-water.       During the operation a small quantity of an
elastic fluid is liberated, which      I ascertained  was sulphu
rous acid gas.
    I rectified this ether with     50 grammes     of alcohol (pu
rified by potash) ; and in order to ascertain if any sulphuric
ether existed in this ether, I divided the produce of the rec
tification into portions of 50 grammes each.
    The first produce marked 31 degrees in the areometer;
the second, 28 degrees ; the third, 27-J- degrees ; the fourth,
26-J- degrees.      These different products marked 28 degrees,
 and weighed 535 grammes.
    In order to ascertain if it was easy, by dividing the pro
 ducts into portions, to ascertain the presence of sulphuric
 ether in acetic ether, I made a mixture of 50 grammes of
 the former at 56 degrees, the thermometer at 0, (32° Fahr.),
 and a mixture of 200 grammes of the second, at 25 degrees.
 The two ethers, thus mixed, yielded, after two days, 30        de
 grees.
    I  distilled about 70 grammes of ether ; it marked 39 de
 grees, and had a very decided smell of sulphuric ether;
                                  F4                        whence

 88             Society  of Arts and   Sciences at Utrecht.
 whence       I concluded, that the method I employed              was the
 only one for separating these two ethers.
     I afterwards submitted the acetic ethers to the following
 examination :
     1. I '"iih of them have an agreeable smell.
    2. Their specific weight does not differ more than four or
 five degrees.
    3. They boil at almost equal temperatures ; the former at
50° of Reaumur, (122° of Fahr.), the latter at 46° (114-8
Fahr.).
    4. Exposed to the air they slowly evaporate.
    5. Both of them are equally soluble in eight parts and a
half of water.
    6. The sulphuric acid has but very 'little action upon
these ethers : it colours them slightly : one part of ether
and one part of acid mixed very exactly, disengage some
heat, about 3O° (86° Fahr.).
    7. Nitric acid, at 46 degrees,         is strongly decomposed by
these    ethers   : there is a considerable liberation of nitrous
gas   : the residue is oxalic acid.
    It results from      these different facts,    that these two ethers
are nearly the same ; that they           only differ in some slender
shades,     which   do not change their intimate nature.
    Thus    the process     propostd by   M. Parmentier is preferable
to that      of M. Pelletier, in      so  far as it is less expensive,
shorter, and the product more abundant.                   But, in giving
the preference      to  this  last process,  I  am  far from   subscribing
to the assertion of M. Gehlen, who admits the necessity of
a mineral acid for the formation          of   acetic ether.

Would not permit him to accompany Mr. Salt.      The public
will be exceedingly gratified by much valuable information,
collected by his lordship during this long, laborious, and
laudable research.            A
                         young Abyssinian prince is in his
lordship's suite, who is a near relation of Negade Ra Maho
met, one of the principal officers of state, so often men
tioned by that celebrated traveller the Abyssinian Bruce, as
being his friend.   This young prince appears possessed of
great natural endowments,  and anxious to become acquainted
with the manners and customs of Great Britain.
  We          are happy once more to contradict the report             of   the
death of Mungo Park, who was said                  to have fallen a victird
in the interior of Africa. Accounts                were   received    of him
about the middle of the present month, which stated his
arrival at Tombuctoo, and that he is now on his return.       It
is to be feared that he will encounter great difficulties in his
journey,          as he has to tow his boatall the way back against
the stream.           The journal that is sent to Europe is dated
from Sansapang.
                          DESTRUCTION       OF YERMII*.
  The following methods are practised in Germany for                    free
ing granaries from mites or weevils :
   1. Cover completely the walls and rafters, above and below,
of the granaries which              are infested by weevils, with      quick
lime slaked in water in which trefoil,             wormwood,         and hys
sop have          been    boiled.     This composition ought     to be ap
plied    as   hot
               possible.
                     as
   2.    A
        very sagacious   fanner has succeeded in destroying
weevils by a very easy process. In the month of June,
when his granaries were all empty, he collected great quan
tities of the largest-sized ants in sacks, and then scattered
them about the places infested with the weevils. -The ants
immediately           fell upon and       devoured every one of them ;
nor     have any weevils since that time been           seen ou his pre
mises.
   3. Another method, not less efficacious, but which re
quires a great deal of care and attention in the application
of     it,the following :— Place

     of chafing-dishes filled with lighted
                                       pieces of wood.   Every
     aperturemust then be carefully closed, in order to prevent
    any fresh air from entering.  The carbonic acid gas, pro
    duced from the burning wood, proves fatal to the insects.
    Rats and mice, also, are so strongly affected by  that they      it,
    are seen running out of their holes, and dying in all direc
    tions.  The persons employed to manage this process must
    take great care of their own safety,  keeping  by
                                                    current of      a

    Another danger may arise from the premises taking firej
    but this also may be avoided              by
                                    proper caution,                  particularly
    ifthey are paved with brick or stone.
                            EDUCATION OF THE BLIND.
       Professor Haiiy, of Paris, has introduced into Prussia
    his plan for educating the blind, and an institution for the
    encouragement of this laudable object               is   in   great forward
    ness at Konigsberg.
                               VOYAGE TO ICELAND.
         M.    Leopold de Buch, member of the Academy of Sci
    ences at     Berlin, and the friend of baron Humboldt, has set
-   out on     voyage to Iceland at his own expense, where he
                a
    intends to pass the winter for the purpose of making phy
    sical and geognostic researches in that hitherto neglected
    Country.
              ANTISEPTIC PROPERTIES OP CHARCOAL.
       The crews of the two Russian ships which lately sailed
    round the world were extremely healthy. During the whole
    three years of their voyage only two men died of the crew of
    the Neva,       and the Naveshda did not lose        a    single man.        It
    is         known that their fresh water was preserved in
         already
    charred casks, but      not so generally known that they
                               it   is
    used the same precaution for preserving             their salted         provi
    sions.      The beef they carried out with      them          tasted as plea
    santly upon their return as   did three years before, when
                                         it
    first salted.

under the title of       "  Tableau general des plus hauls Mon-

   Dr. Hager, of Paris, has been appointed by the vice-
king of Italy, professor of the oriental languages ^ in the
university of Pavia, the first school of learning in Italy.
His appointment was accompauied with a flattering letter

   Dr. Bozzini, of Frankfort, has invented an instrument
which must be very interesting to the medical profession.
The object of this instrument, to which the name of light-
spreader   has been      given, is to afford an inspection of the
interior of wounds, or the various parts of the human body,
such as the oesophagus, the vagina, the uterus, &c. The
inventor is preparing for the press drawings and descrip
tions of this curious instrument,       which  has already attracted
considerable notice on the continent.
   M. Lcbrun,      first trumpeter in the king of Prussia's band
at Berlin,    having long reflected on the deleterious conse
quences arising from the oxides of copper being collected in
the inside of brass trumpets, and thus inhaled into the lungs
of the performer, has invented a method to avoid any bad
effects from     this circumstance.      He coats the inside of his
trumpets with a lac, which unites to smoothness tenuity l
and does no injury whatever to the sound of the instrument.
Nitric acid poured into        these trumpets does   not change the

   and has declared himself perfectly satisfied as to its superio

AT    has been long known that the human urine is So strangely
altered   in the disease called diabele.t,           that    in place of' being
in a small quantity and acrid, like that of a                person in health;
it becomes, on the contrary, saccharine and very.abundant.
 It is only about thirty years, however^ since the first ana
lyses were made of diabetic urine*                    Three causes retarded
this investigation : oil the one hand, the irtfrequency of the
disease ; oil the other, the uncertainty of the chemical ap
paratus formerly employed ; and, thirdly, the neglect Mitch
animal chemistry has suffered until withjn these very fe\y
years.
    It was not sooner than             1773 that the existence           of sugsf
in diabetic urine        was     demonstrated.           This discovery, for
which     we   are indebted to        Caulcy, was established in 1791
by Frauc'k.       It was,    indeed i hinted at by          Willis,    at the be*
gmning of       the    1/th century; and afterward?, irt 1775, by
Pool and Dobson.              M. Caulcy, however, having only di*
reeted his attention to the saccharine substance alonf t left
a great deal undone-              It was necessary to ascertain the
other principles of diabetic urine, and particularly those
which enter into common urine ; and this was accomplished
in   1803 by Messrs.        Nicholas     and Giu-ndeville          of Caen. It
results from their researches that the urine of diabetic pa
tients does not contain a sensible quantity of urea, or of uric
acid   ; that the most sensible reagents scarcely indicate traces
of phosphate      and sulphate ; that it is impossible to discover
a free   acid in it  ; and, in short, that nothing- is found except
sugar in great quantity, and more or less marine salt.
     In the present memoir we purpose not oulyitb confirm
the results we have cited, but in particular we shall com

  5d, The very peculiar nature of the saccharine substance
we found in that urine.
      3d, The different       transformations       which        it underwent
before being brought            back to its natural appearance                and
consistency.
                                PART FIRST.
Mtdicui       Qbservations     i/pnn the Case in which we analysed
                             the Diabetic Urine.
      It resulted from    these observations:
      1st,   That    the saccharine   diabttes may last several years,
and even as long as          the digestive facujties continue, and are
able to administer        to the excessive        losses    which take place
through the urine.
   2d, That this disease is not incurable in any of its stages;
not even when an altered digestion seems no longer to fur
nish matters        of secretion and the animal oeconomy is                   ex
hausted.
      3d, That the seat      of this affection    seems to be in the kid
neys and not in the intestinal canal.
      In fact, the appetite and thirst of diabetic patients                    are
not     perverted ;     they appear    merely       to     be    in proportion
to the want          of organical repair,     as    well    as    the    digestive
faculties ; in the second  place,           the
                                       alimentary                   substance*
undergo the same operation in the stomach of a diabetic pa
tient as in that of a healthy person ; and what proves that
the digestion is not altered, but merely increased, in diabetes
is,   the quantity     of food taken, the rapidity with which                it   is
digested, the great         proportion of matter which   absorbed   is
from that food, and the small quantity of faices to which                       it
is reduced   in short, we find no saccharine liquid, or any
               :
liquid which has undergone any alteration in its composi
tion, all the way from the organs of digestion to tho.se of
the urinary secretion.
     4th, That the cause of saccharine diabetes appears to bt
a    heightened and perverted action of the kidneys.
      That in consequence of this action            the saccharine matter
of urine  produced, and to this cause we may ascribe all
              is
the symptoms of this malady.
               8                             ath, That

   ilh, That     the excessive       losses  which   take"  place  in this
disease seem     to ascertain,      in some     circumstances,     a very
considerable absorption at the surface' of the body in dia*
betes.
   6th, That the new           relations determined by saccharine
diabetes between      the   aliments and the secretions in general,
and between each of their species in particular, are analogous
to those    which    are determined by an excessive          evacuation,
of whatever kind it may         be.
   7th, That the treatment prescribed by hollo, and after
wards employed with so much success by our countrymeil
Messrs. Nicholas and Gucndeville,              and which consists in a
fegimen purely animal, lias the same degree of efficacy in
diabetes as Jesuits' bark has in intermittent fevers.
   8th, Finally, that the saccharine diabetes produces no"
bther change in the state of our organs than a development
of the digestive and urinary apparatus ; both of which ard
highly active during this disease, the one in preparing and
the other ill discharging the alimentary substances.

Analysis of the Vrim evacuated by a Diabetic Patient, ftoni
   the 13th Day of his Admission into the Hotel-Dim until
   he was carried into tlie Infirmary of the School of Mcdi*
   cine of Paris.
   The   above urine came from the patient in an uncommonly
large quarititv,    and exhaled a smell by no means            disagreea
ble.
   It  was   limpid, yellowish,        specifically heavier than watef*
and scarcely    reddened the tincture of turnsole ; slightly sac-
charine* it had at the same time something                of  the taste  of
sea salt.
   Left   to itself at a  temperature     of 15°  (59°Fahr.), it  became
turbid in five or six days; bubbles of carbonic acid were libe
rated from it if it w as ever so little shaken ; the urinous smell
it had at first was dispelled ; and it contracted a smell analo-*
gous to that of newly made wine : it yielded alcohol upon
being distilled, and became strongly acidified on exposure

to the air; it therefore presented, in a weak                      degree^     all thtf
characters of a spirituous fermentation.
   When distilled in         a retort,    or evaporated in a capsule, the
phaenomena       were the Same ;         it became turbid, thickened by
little and little, and       was reduced       to a syrup sometimes equi
valent to a seventeenth, sometimes a twentieth,                             but never
less than a thirtieth        of its own weight.               We extracted in
this manner from the urine we treated, nearly thirty pounds
of this syrup, which upon cooling always became one mass,
composed of a multitude of small grains without consist
ency. These soft granulated crystals being hardly sweet, it
,was natural to think that the substance or- which they were
formed was    not homogeneous, and contained only a very
small  quantity of the saccharine principle.   In order to
ascertain  it,
             the following experiments were made                        :
  We took 1OO parts of this substance and distilled    iri                    it       a
retort, the neck of which was inserted into                   a    receiver which
was continually kept at       low temperature.
                                 a                             .    We obtained
plenty of water,  little oil, and no ammonia
                      a                                        ;   a   great quan
tity of gases    a   little fetid, and abundance             of charcoal easily
incinerated,     yielding, upon complete incineration,                      two parts
and   half of sea salt and one half part of phosphate of lime.
      a
   From this result may he drawn the three following con
sequences :-^lst, That this substance contains no animal
matter, since when           calcined
                                   yields no volatile alkali
                                          it                                           t
2d, That   contains very little saline matter, because when
          it
reduced to ashes    only presents
                        it              residue equal to some
                                                   a
one hundredth parts   of Us weight             :   3d, That       it   is   formed    of
vegetable principles alone, because                it   gives all the products
of vegetables upon being distilled.
   Presuming that the sugar was one of these principles, and
forming no kind of conjecture upon the nature of those
with which     was supposed to be mixed, we resolved to
                 it
employ fermentation to destroy the former, and to keep the
latter principles unaltered, in such  manner, that a                           by    fil
tration and evaporation we ought to have obtained them
very pure. We mixed in       large flask 100 grammes of the
                                     a
substance to be analysed, 25 grammes of ferment, and 50O
                                                                            grammes

                     Memoir         on the Saccharine Diabetes.                101
grammes          of water       ;   we adapted    to the neck    of this flask *
tube fixed under a flask full              of water ;    the temperature being
then raised to         18 degrees,       the experiment       was left to itself.
Some hours after the contact took place between these sub
stancesa motion was evinced in some parts of the liquor,
which   soon became general : plenty of solid flakes, which
gave birth  to a great number of gaseous bubbles, were raised
to a considerable height ; these bubbles rapidly passed into
the vessels fnll of water, but the flakes fell back to -the bot
tom of the flask, and, giving birth to new bubbles, they
again ascended to be once more precipitated. This pheno
menon, which took place for three days, announced a very
active fermentation,  and, consequently, the presence of a
great quantity of saccharine matter: in fact, more than thir
teen pints of pure carbonic acid gas were liberated ; the li
quor was very alcoholic, and contained nearly 48 parts of
alcohol at 40 degrees ; evaporated to dryness, only 23 parts
of extract were obtained, formed of three parts of sea sail
and twenty parts         of a viscous brown matter.
  We know that            100 grammes of sugar produce 12 gram
mes     of   a   similar residue, 56 of alcohol, and 36 of carbonic
acid.        Thus        drawn from diabetic urine yielded
                     the substance
by fermentation the same products, and almost m as threat
quantity, as pure and finely crystallized sugar; and if we
add, that it acts like sugar with the nitric acid, alcobol, and
the other reagents, we must regard these two substances as
bc"«.5g in some measure preciselv the same.
  We ought, however,                  to recollect that it is scarcely sweet,
at least     much less so than sugar.               It   may   he thence con
cluded,       1st,   That,      as has been long-suspected,       there are   dif
ferent species or varieties of sugar, the differences being so
striking as now to render certain what before was only pro
bable.   But as the taste only is not a certain criterion of the
saccharine principle, it becomes necessary to examine                           if,
among the substances which have hitherto been confounded
with sugar on account of their taste, there arc not some                        of
them which differ essentially from that substance.
  For this       reason we were led to examine manna.          Our first
care was to.         mix   it   with ferment and water at the tempera-
                                          G   3                               turc

ture   of  18°  (64°  Fahr.),   and   to remark attentively all th«
phaenomena produced by this mixture.              Fermentation soon
began: it was brisk at fir*l, but it soon decreased ; and in
two days it ended.           The liquor     had  nevertheless  a very
Strong vinous smell       ; but far from being alcoholic,     it was,
on ihe contrary, very saccharine, and deposited upon eva
poration, in the form of crystals, almost all the matter em-*
ployed, deprived of the fermenting faculty.
    Although convinced by these results that manna contained
only a very small quantity of sugar, we ought nevertheless
to compare it in all its properties with this substance, in
order to place the fact beyond a doubt, and thus to discover
all the characters peculiar to the particular principle of which
 it appeared almost entirely formed; we therefore tried it$
action on spirit of wine, which did not attack the saccha
rine principle, and upon the nitric acid, which did notcon*
vert any portion of that principle into mucous acid.
    The former of these reagents, at the temperature of flO"
 (1403 Fahr.), dissolved so great a quantity or manna, that,
upon cooling,       the  liquor  was a mass composed of a crowd
of crystalline     heaps,   every   crystal in each heap, springing
from a common centre.           The second reagent produced, after
a long ebullition,      so great  a   deposit of mucous acid, that
it was almost half the weight of the manna employed.
    Here,theretore, there are two characters which are striking
ly different ; sugar properly so called, and the particular prin~
ciple of manna.
    New     researches   will doubtless    present many other diffe
rences more or less prominent ; hut those above related being
sufficient to occasion these bodies to be regarded as very di
stinct from each other, we did not think it necessary               to
enter more deeply into the subject.
    It  follows   from hence, that it would be always easy to
recognize and separate manna, or rather the peculiar prin
ciple of manna, whatever may be the substances with which
it is mixed.      It is only necessary to treat with warm alcohol
the matter which contains this peculiar principle of manna,
and it will be almost entirely precipitated upon cooling.          In
truth,    there  are other    vegetable   substances   which  possess

this principle           remarkable degree ; but these sub
                           even   in   a
stances always hold some acid in their composition, from
which they may be freed by combining it with an alkaline
or earthy base, or a metallic oxide, according to the nature
of   the acid ; and consequently this mode                        of separation may
be generally employed.
   It is in this manner that we may ascertain if the honey*
like substance observed upon the leaves of certain trees, and
particularly on those of the linden tree, is in reality a kind
of manna ; and if the saccharine principle which exists in
asparagus is of the same description ; it having been lately
discovered by Messrs. Vauquelin and Kobiquet, that in aspa
ragus the saccharine substance is mixed with a principle en
tirely peculiar*.
Analysis         of   the    Urine evacuated           Iij   the Patient       from     the
     Time he was brought to the Infirmary                          of    the   School    of
     Medicine until he went out cured.
   During the whole time the patient was in the Hotel-Dieu
he could not be subjected to any particular regimen.     He
lived as he pleased his disease therefore remained station
                             ;
ary, and his urine, at all times 'very abundant, was never
changed in its natuiv.     was then resolved to carry him to

most continually watched                    by   M. Dupuytren         and his pupils,
it   became easier to make him do whatever he was desired.
     Afterfew days all kinds of vegetables were refused, and
             a
animal food only was given him.     The weights of what he
ate, and of the liquids he drank to quench     most dreadful         a
thirst, were ascertained.
   For the first two or three days no change was remarked
in his urine   but in five or six days

 presumed that the disease began-to yield : having afterwards
 observed this animal matter to become daily more abundant,

 surprised at my prediction ; this surprise, however, ceased
 when I informed him what had taken plac? in the parent's
 urine.
    From       this period the patient beeame better and better.

                           Fat and     the  Metals.
AT    has been     ascertained      that fat acts more or less upon a
great    number    of  the   metals.      Copper, for instance, gives a
green colour to fat, when the air also is allowed to act upon
it.     The solution of the oxide of copper in fat is a fact
proved by daily experience.
    As mercury, however, is the metal which excites most
interest in the pharmaceutic art in its combinations with
fat,   I  shall restrict myself particularly to discussing             the  ef
fects    of these combinations.
    Several apothecaries have endeavoured                   to improve the
quality     of   mercurial     ointments,       and     particularly    of Uie
double ointment.          M. Vean-Delaunay proposed rancid oil,
and    M.    Fourcroy has shown that oxygenated fat is most
proper for killing mercury.
    Of late, several chemists have imagined that the mercury
pf the double mercurial ointment is not oxidated, but that
it exists in    the metallic state.
                                                                       I know

       I know of         no experiment which supports this idea.              The
   following        were my own         experiments on the subject       :
      I  triturated equal quantities of mercury and tat in a mor
  tar, the weight of which I had previously ascertained ex
  actly ; when the mercury was entirely absorbed, I weighed
  the mortar with the ointment, and I found no increase : this
  made me suspect, that if the mercury was oxidated, it was
  not by the oxygen of the atmosphere, but by means of the
  fat.
      Being desirous of ascertaining the state of the mercury,
  I  introduced some newly prepared ointment into a glass cy
  linder hermetically sealed at one of its extremities ; I plunged
 it horizontally*, for three hours, into boiling water. After
 it cooled there were two very distinct layers formed ; the
 upper one was perfectly white like fat, and I separated the
 under layer by cutting the cylinder with a file.                   Then, upon
 slightly mixing the mercury                  with  boiling water, there was
 collected three drachms and eight grains of mercury quite
 liquid.       The remainder of             the mtrcury, which obstinately
 retained      a   little fat, was treated with a ley of caustic potash.
 The soap which resulted from it being collected, was redis-
 eolved in rectified alcohol ; and by this method I obtained
 the whole         of the mercury employed.
     I   also     separated      fat from mercury by        boiling the double
 ointment with water ; the fat floated above, and it was slightly
 Coloured        in consequence of a little of the mercury which
 strongly adhered to it.                 I obtained at the bottom of the
vessel      metallic mercury mixed with a little fat.                  The least
 agitation brought the globules together.
     I  also treated the ointment directly by the                muriatic acid.
Wishing         to ascertain      if the  muriatic acid could take the oxy
gen from oxidated mercury, and if it passed to the state
of oxymuriatic acid, I made the experiment in close vessels
with the chemical pneumatic apparatus, but I had no libe
ration of oxymuriatic acid gas ; besides, it is difficult to be
lieve that the oxide of mercury at the minimum, containing

lo little oxygen, yields                   any part    of it to   the muriatic acid,
and makes it pass to the state of oxymuriatic acid.
  I made the comparison with different ointments, which
had been prepared three months, eight months, and several
years; in the latter compounds I found a little oxidat d
mercury,            but the greatest         part     was always in the     metallic
state.
     I   tritur?ted mercury with Venice turpentine ; and it
         also
was absorbed with great facility. To ascertain if the- mer
cury obsorbed the oxygen from the air, or if it                        got any oxy
gen from the turpentine, I dissolved the mass                          in alcohol at
40°; all the turpentine was dissolved, and the                        mercury was
precipitated in small globules ; the alcoholic                        solution was
afterwards evaporated ; I then obtained the turpentine with
all its properties.
   It results, therefore, that in the ointments above men
tioned the mercury is not in the state of an oxide, as gene
rally supposed, but that it is in the metallic slate and in
very       minute division,            particularly   in newly prepared oint
ment.           I   of opinion
                    am                        that mercury is in a similar state
in       severalmercurial compounds more or less in use, as in
the        go-mercurial plaster, ethiops saccharatus, ethiops alka-

     may be objected that the colour of the ointment and of
     It
the above preparations speaks very much for th^ oxidation
of the mercury but let glittering antimony, bismuth, or
                           ;
any other metal susceptible of pulverization                        be reduced     to   a
fine powder,             and   it   will   be seen that these substances are            of
a    blackish gray when in minute division.
     It                                     of fat upon the

                               shall confine
                                myself       particularly to
the nitrate of mercury, from which   compound results very

much used            in   pharmacy.
 I        prepared       the citrine mercurial ointment according to the
process described in Baume's Elements of Pharmacy,        dis                 by

 ro8                   Memoir            upon      Animal Fat,
 asserting that it arises from the absorption of the oxygen of
 the atmosphere, I was anxiqus to ascertain if this wa> cor*
 rect.
    After having poured the ointment, while yet liquid, into
 squares of paper, I placed one part of it under a bell-glass
 filled with air qver mercury              :   at the end    of   24 hours no ab
 sorption had taken place            ;    yet the surface was 'uncommonly
 white.
    I   placed another part of it under the receiver of an air-,
pump,      and I suddenly made a vacuum, which I kept up for
some hours, givine from time to time a stroke of the piston,
which produced at first some bubbles of air. The ointment
extracted from the vacuum was perfectly yellow, and re
mained always su, without the least change.
   I think, therefore, that this white crust is owing to the
disengagement of the gases, whether azotic or nitrous, which
takes place from every part of the interior towards the sur
face        they augment the volume of the ointment.
        ; and                                              The
latter cools by degrees, and does not allow the gases to escape
entirely ; one part of the gas remains, and forms an infinity
of small white bubbles           at the exterior part.
   In support of what I          have here advanced               it may be added,
that when the ointment is left to cool in the vessel in which
it hadbeen melted, and particularly when it is heated a little
more, the quantity         of calofic given             is sufficient to drive      off
all the gas, and the ointment remains constantly                           yellow,
without experiencing any further alterations.
  In order to examine this compound, arid to appreciate the
chemical changes which might have taken place, I boik'dj
an ointment whiph had been two years prepared, for half
an hour with water.             It   became very clotted ; the water was
interposed in such a manner that it was difficult to separate
the whole quantity from it.   The water had acquired a, yel
lowish colour from          it,
                          and    slightly bitter taste;

Ings of old ointment, and scarcely contained any traces of
mercury, indicated by a hydrosulphuret»
    According to these data it would be natural to think that
the acid nitrate of mercury had undergone a change, and
one would Ihink that it had passed to the state of a yellow
nitrate or nitrous turbith,            which is little soluble in water.
    I   kept ointment a long time in fusion, but I could not
separate the nitrous turbith from it ; the latter, therefore, is
bot merely disseminated in the ointment, but must be inti
mately united with and dissolved in it.                   I convinced myself
of the possibility of the solution of turbith in oxygenated
fat, by heating these two matters together.                     I decanted the
liquid clear ; it perfectly imitated the citrine ointment, and
contained a very great quantity of mercury.
    As to the        use   of this production,          the effects     of which,
some physicians allege, are analogous to pomatum simply
oxygenated by the nitric acid, I do not allow myself to give
 any opinion on the subject ; it is probable, however) that a
 substance which           holds mercury in true combination will
 produce different effects from one which does not contain
 any at all.
     In place of the acid nitrate employed above,                 I  took neutral
 nitrate at the minimum.
     When reduced to fine powder, I projected it upon heated
 fat 1 bubbles were immediately produced, aud the white pow
 der of the nitrate was soon converted into yellow powder.
     The fat acquired a solid consistency ; it contained mercury
 in-solution.
     The neutral nitrate is therefore decomposed by hogs' larcL
 It is not that the mercury here yields its oxygen because it
 Is already in it at the minimum ; hut it is the nitric acid
 which abandons in part the oxidated mercury and acts upon
 the fat where it is decomposed ; from which results the yel
 low nitrate of mercury, which contains littic nitric acid*.
     I examined        several    other metallic salts with          fat,^ such    as

.1 HIS memoir has for its object to ascertain                         if,   as   M.   Proust
            azote forms any part of the acetic acid.
has asserted,
  The author, after having considered what        at present                is
known on the composition of ammonia and the vegetable^
acids, was much surprised to find in M. Proust's memoir
that this chemist had found ammonia and prussic acid in
the composition of acetates. The author of the present me
moir, notwithstanding the exactitude and sagacity of the
chemist of Madrid, was anxious to ascertain the existence
of azote in      the concentrated acid from his OWQ experiments,
                                  by the love of truth and
and he was directed to the research
the importance of the fact.
   Before giving the processes employed     M. Tromsdorff            by
to attain the object he proposed to himself, we shall give
asummary of the objections which presented themselves to
M. Proust's ttteory.
  If, says M. Tromsdorff,                     by
                              the distillation of acetates
ammonia       is   formed,      it   is   evident that azote                 is   contained
therein   :   But where could this principle come from                            ?    Could
it   be from the alkaline base            ?      But that       is   not the case      ; for,
according to M. Proust, the ammonia has also been ex
tracted from the acetate of lead.  In this case can only be                it
furnished      by
             the acetic acid    or  must be said that azote
                                          ;           it
is   only hydrogen modified.
     The author afterwards examines      among the vegetable
                                                           If
acids azote    met with as frequently as
                 is                         the animal acids    in                             }
because,     that was the case, the classification of must
              if                                                                      it
fall to be changed.  In order to repeat the experiments of
M.     Proust,     it   appeared      essential            to the author to employ
only the purest substances.
  Thus, in order to obtain the acetic acid in the greatest
degree of purity possible, he decomposed the acetate of pst-
ash    by
        the sulphuric acid    he afterwards saturated lliis acid
                                      ;

    i 12                Memoir upon    tlie Acellc Acid*
   bason the saline solution which resulted from it.                 The salt
   obtained,     which     he closed up    in a  flask shut with    a  ground
   stopper, was of       a very fine white colour.
        He  used    the same    precautions in the preparations df the
  acetates    of potash and lead.
       He took eight dunces of         each     of  these   salts, which    h^
  introduced       separately   into strong glass retorts; the retorts
  were placed       upon an    open fire in a furnace; he adapted to
  bach a bell-glass,       from   which    a glass    tube   issued opening
  into a bell-glass proper for receiving the gases.
       The products were always (as all the world knbws) an
 ethereal acidulated fluid mixed with oil.              The alkali and the
 tarbon remained in the retort, and in the decomposition of
 the acetate of lead nothing of this salt remained except ox
 idated lead.
       Thus, by the pfedisposhlg affinity of the alkalis for car
 bonic acid, the former determined the decomposition of the
 acetic acid, in order to afford room for the             formation of the
 carbonic      acid.     The oxide of lead, on          the   contrary, not
 having so rrtuch affinity for carbonic             acid, abandoned the
 acetic acid in its greatest purity.
      The author asks if the metallic base abandons oxygen to
 burn charcoal, or if the power of attraction is less powerful
 between      an oxide and an acid       than between an acid and an
 alkali.
      He   has   made a great number        of experiments in order         to
answer this question.
      The gases examined exhaled no artimoitiacal smell               ;  their
smell was only empyreumatic and penetrating.                    The liquids
had the same smell, and all the chemical reagents did not
ascertain any ammonia there.
      The   residues    which, according        to  M. Proust,      contain
some prussiate, were          only pure alkaline carbonate or pure
oxide     of lead.
      M.  Proust,     on examining the residue of the acetate of
potash, says that it was a residue formed partly of prussiate
and partly of carbonate of potash.             M. Tromsdorff expected
to find these twa Salts ; but upon breaking the retort lie only
                                                                       round

found a homogeneous charcoal, which neither yielded him
ammonia nor prussic acid, and which had not the smell
of any of these substances. Yet we know well how easy it
is to recognise the smell of the latter acid wherever it exists
in  a state of liberty.
   M.   Proust adds, that the residue        of  the acetate of potash
was so saturated       with prussic acid,     that  it had a bitterness
as  if the alkali    had been directly combined with this acid ;
whence     M. Tromsdorff concludes         that the above author had
made use    of common vinegar.
   In order to ascertain the products resulting from the de
composition of the acetic acid, M. Tromsdorff passed the
vapours through a tube made red hot l this operation gave-
Km nothing but carbonic acid gas, carbonated hydrogen
gas, and a small quantity of empyreumatic liquid, without
ammonia      and    without    prussic acid; these       substances     no
longer exist in the residues.
   M. Tromsdorff afterwards attentively examined the ethe
real acidulous fluids mixed with oil.          H£ distilled them over
carbonate of potash, and obtained an ether which appeared
to be true acetic ether in every respect.
   The   results  of this memoir are :
   1st,  That    the    presence of azote in      acetic   acid is by no
means demonstrated.
   2d, That the pure acetates, when distilled, yield neither
ammonia nor prussic acid.
   3d, That the pure acetic acid is changed            a little in its na
ture by passing through red hot tubes.
   4th, That in       an iron   tube  it is completely decomposed
into carbonic acid gas and carbonated hydrogen gas.
   5th, That it is demonstrated that the constituent parts of
acetic acid are,     oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen.
   6th, That_the ethereal fluid is, by its properties in gene
ral, simHar to the other ethers ; the author regards it as a
medium between alcohol and ether.              And as the acetic acid
partly  changes    it  into ether,  and  the  latter,  when treated by
the nitric acid, is transformed into oxalic acid, the transU
tion   of the  acetic acid into oxalic acid is thus demonstrated,

   Letter from JAMES SMITHSON, Esq. F. R. S., to the
   Eight Honourable Sir JOSEPH BANKS, K. 5. P. R. S.*
      MY DEAR SIR,
1 BEG    leave to acquaint you         with    a discovery which I have
lately made,    as it adds a new, and perhaps it may be thought
an   interesting species, to the ores            of  lead.      ,1 have found
minium native in the earth.
   It  is disseminated        in small quantity in the substance             of
a compact carbonate         of zinc.
   Its appearance in general is that of a matter in a pulveru
lent state, but in places it shows to a lens a flaky and cry
stalline texture.
   Its colour is like that of       a  factitious minium,           a vivid red
with a cast of yellow.
   Gently   heated at the blowpipe it assumes a darker colour,
but on cooling it returns to its original red. At a stronger
heat it melts to litharge. On the charcoal it reduces to lead^
   In dilute white acid of nitre it becomes of a coffee colour.
On   the  addition'bf    a little sugar, this brow«            calx dissolves,
and produces     a colourless solution.
   By   putting it into marine acid with a little leaf gold,                the
gold is soon entirely dissolved.
   When it is inclosed in a small bottle with marine acid,
and a little bit   of paper tingfd by turnsole                is fixed to the
cork,   the paper  in  a   short time entirely loses its blue colour,
and becomes white.           A strip of common blue paper, whose
colouring    matter    is   indigo, placed in the same situation,
undergoes the same change.

XXIII.          Analytical Essay             on Asparagus.             By M. ROEI-
             QUET junior,             Apothecary at Vate de Grace.
                                  [Concluded      from p. 38.]
AFTER what has been stated, we                             cannot conclude,         with
M. Antoine, that the acid obtained                         from asparagus       by   the
process pointed out        malic acid. The difference
                                   is                      very                is
remarkable.     The latter forms with barytes, strontian, and
lime, salts  little soluble; while those of the former are very
                  a
insoluble.  We may be convinced of this by taking equal
proportions of these two acids, supposed to be of the same
degree of concentration, and afterwards diluted with    great                  a
quantity of water.   If we pour into these two liquors, drop
by   drop,      a    solution     of lime for example,           a   precipitate shows
itself with          the acid obtained from asparagus                 ;  but the malic
acid does not give any trace of one, provided always that
the liquors be sufficiently diluted.  The same thing takes
place with barytes or strontian.     A character still more
marked       that of decomposing the sulphate of iron,
                is
the acetates of iron and of copper, which the malic acid
does not. Besides, as have formerly recalled to the reader's
                                  I                                                        '

the precipitate formed by the other acid in the acetate                                 of
lead      refuses      altogether to dissolve itself therein, whatever
quantity be employed.                    The malic acid,       besides,        does not
decompose earthy acetates.
   The malate of magnesia is so very deliquescent that it
has been proposed by M. Chenevix as the means of sepa
rating alumeu from magnesia, by treating those two earths
with malic           acid   dissolving them in alcohol; and since
                             and
the acid of       asparagus, when saturated with an alkali, preci
pitates        abundantly the muriate of magnesia,      as   have        if,       I
said, the solutions are concentrated, we may infer that this
salt   not soluble in spirit of wine.
     Itis is
         equally impossible to confound this acid with                                  vi
negar, since      decomposes almost all the earthy and me
                       it

     Its property of not crystallizing                 prevented     me from com
paring         it   with other Vegetable acids, and           I     could not, with
any better           appearance         of probability,    regard   it   as    a   mineral
acid, since when submitted to the action of heat                              it   became
charred.        I therefore naturally led to believe

with earthy   bases, and from this examination resulted, as
we shall see, the discovery of its nature.

                         lime water, and after filtering and

the same time     slight ammoniacal odour.

to the    phosphate of lead.           It is thus demonstrated, that if
this acid had presented, in its principle, differences from
phosphoric acid, it must have happened from its holding in
solution an animal matter, and which I believe to be the
same with that which this matter contains in the green fe
culence:     at Ic.ist,   I dissolved a portion ot the latter in pure
phosphoric     acid,    I  evaporated it so as to burn the animal
substance, and there was developed an odour very similar to
that which the phosphoric acid of asparagus yields.
    In was in that portion of the extract that was insoluble in
alcohol    that  I ought to       have   found,  according to  M. An-
toine, this animal matter, which he has recognised for ge
latine. Distilled water, as I have shown, entirely redissolved
this extractive substance; and although it had been washed
repeatedly with alcohol and dissolved in water, it reddened
very sensibly turnsole paper.
    I believed it possible that the precipitate formed by infu
sion of galls was occasioned by an animal substance held in
solution    by means of this free acid ; consequently I poured
into the liquor ammonia till it was saturated.             There was a
very abundant flaky precipitate, which I separated by the
filter and washed very carefully.            The solution, united with
the washings, did not give any more precipitate with gall-
nut ; and the acetate of lead, as well as the oxygenated mu
riatic acid, did not produce any change.
    T burnt a part of the precipitate formed by ammonia to
have some notion of its nature ; but in place of presenting
the characters of an animal or vegeto-animal matter, as I
suspected it to be, it bnmt without swelling, and left for
 residue a grayish powder, which I ascertained to be a calca
reous salt. This experiment showed me, that if the liquor
had ceased to precipitate by gall-nut, &c. this would have
depended      merely on the degree of concentration.           I there
fore evaporated it ; and after having reduced it to three-
fourths of its volume, I still obtained precipitates by the
acetate of lead, the oxygenated muriatic acid, and gall-nut.
    I continued the evaporation till I obtained a dry extract :
it was of a dark brown colour, had an agreeable taste, a
little saltish, and slightly attracted the humidity of the at-

Biosphere.   I calcined a part of it ; it swelled considerably^
and the smell that was disengaged rather announced a vege
table substance than a product of an animal nature.         The
incinerated charcoal left a little lime. Thus certain reagents
denoted the presence of an animal matter ; others appeared
to show the opposite.     To obtain a more conclusive result,
I redissolved this extract. I treated it with tincture of galls,
and after washing             and   drying the precipitate, I submitted it
to distillation to       see   if   it yielded ammonia.    Some was dis
engaged, but very small in quantity ; so that, although we
cannot deny that this principle, which is soluble in water,
has many characters                exclusively       belonging to animal mat
ters ;     it is, however, fair          to say, that it has some properties
which appear very different, and which could not agree with
the admission of animal gelatine.
   It only remains to me to speak of a salt which is found
in the decoction and in the juice of asparagus.  To obtain
it,   we ought to evaporate                  both to the consistence                  of thick
syrups.        At   the end        of   some days     a    salt   is   deposited, which
,when washed and redissolved                    inwater, presents the follow
ing properties:      crystallizes
                         it                     in little rhomboids more or

volume,       is    easily    incinerated,        and      leaves      very        little   resi

  Vftin that   I  have tried to produce a similar salt with the ace
  tous acid.       I am therefore obliged to wait till I shall have
  ohtained a greater quantity of the salt which this juice con
  tains, before I can pronounce definitively on the nature of
  this acid.
     I   must further observe, that the presence of ammonia
  does   not authorise us to think that we cannot obtain this
 triple salt till after having allowed a commencement of al
 teration in the juice of asparagus ; for I have had it on eva
 porating decoctions and juices recently prepared, but always
 in small quantities.
     To recapitulate what I have had the honour of laying be
 fore you, I shal! detail the principal substances which have
 been     furnished     me by the     juice of   asparagus.      The green
 feculent substance is itself composed of three              others; the
 first insoluble in alcohol, and which approaches nearer to
 the nature of animal matter than any that is contained in the
 vegetable.        The two others are soluble; but one of them is
 deposited on cooling.           This is what I call vegetable wax.
 The latter is only obtained by evaporation, and appears to
 hold a middle nature between volatile oils and resins.
     We find in        the filtered  juice,   1st, Albumen, which co
 agulates     on the first ebullition:       2d, Phosphate of potash,
 of which we separate the acid in precipitating it by the ace
tate of lead : 3d, The same acid combined with lime, and
 held in solution by a portion of free acetous acid : 4th, Foli
 ated earth (de la tcrrefoli&e)        and phosphate    of potash in very
 great abundance : 5th, The vegeto-animal substance which
 is found in the aqueous solution : 6th, An extractive matter
which      we    obtain after having precipitated by gall-nuts that
portion of      the extract    which is insoluble in alcohol : 7th, A
triple salt    of lime and ammonia, of which the acid is yet
unknown to me : 8th, and lastly, A colouring principle sus
ceptible of becoming red by acids and yellow by alkalis*.
     The results which I have obtained are different, as you
observe, in several points from those announced by M. An-
toine ; but      I  beg you to remark that we have          not followed

     Trees.  By THOMAS ANDREW KNIGHT, Esq. F.R.S,
     In a Latter to the Right Honourable Sir JOSEPH BANKS,
     K.B.P.R.S*
       MY DEAR SIR,
JL HAVE endeavoured                to prove, in several              memoirs      f   which
you have done          me the        honour        to lay before the Hoyal So
ciety, that the fluid by which the various parts (that are an
nually added to trees, and herbaceous plants whose organiza
tion is similar to that o( tree.*,) arc generated, has previously
circulated through their leaves J either in the same or pre
ceding season, and subsequently descended through their
bark; and aticr having repeated every experiment that oc
curred to me, from which I suspected an unfavourable res
suit, I am not in possession of a single fact which is not
perfectly consistent with the theory I have advanced.
     There    is,   however, one circumstance stated                        by   Hales and
Du Hamel which               strongly to militate against my
                                 appears

               ;

Du Hamel to speak less decisively in favour of        than he                    it

knowledge to be perfectly correct) with the statements and
opinions I have on former occasions communicated to you.
  Both Hales and Du Hamel have proved, that when two
circular incisions through the bark, round the stem of a
tree, are made at a small distance from each other, and
,when the bark between these incisions is wholly taken away,
that portion of the stem which is below the incisions through
the bark continues to live, and in some degree to increase
in size, though much more slowly than the parts above the
incisions.    They have also observed that a small elevated
riilije (bourvelet) is formed round the lower lip of the wound
in the bark, which makes some slight advances to meet the
bark and wood projected, in much larger quantity, from the
opposite or upper lip of the wound.
    I    have endeavoured,         in a former memoir*, to explain the
cause why some              portion of growth takes place below inci
sions through the bark, by supposing that a small part of
the true sap, descending from the leaves, escapes downwards
through       porous substance of the alburnum.
                the                                 Several
facts stated by Hales  seem favourable to this supposition ;
and the existence of a power in the alburnum to carry the
sap in different directions, is proved in the growth of in
verted cuttings            of different          species     of    trees   f-     But   I   have
derived so many advantages, both                           as a   gardener and farmer,
(particularly in the managementof fruit- and forest trees,)
from the experiments which have been the subject of my
former memoirs, that I am confident much public benefit
might be derived from an intimate acquaintance with the
use and office of the various organs of plants ; and thence
feel anxious to adduce facts to prove that the conclusions I
 have drawn are not inconsistent with the facts stated by my
 great predecessors.

 obvious to be controverted,) that the matter which enters

 1 33                       Oil     the inverted       Aciian
existed        previously in their cotyledons ; and               as   the   radicles
increase only in length by parts successively added to their
apices, or points most distant from their cotyledons, it fol
lows of necessity that the first motion of the true sap, at this
period, is downwards.    And as no alburnous tubes exist in
the radicles of germinating seeds during the earlier periods
of their growth, the sap in its descent must either pass
through the bark or the medulla.    But the medulla dots not
apparently contain any  vessels  calculated to carry the de
scending sap, whilst the cortical vessels are during this pe
riod much distended and full                   of moisture      ; and as the me
dulla certainly does not carry any fluid in stems or branches
of more than one year old, it can scarcely be suspected that
h, at any period, conveys the whole current of the descend
ing sap.
   As the leaves grow.,                 and   enter on their office, cortical
vessels,       in
            every respect apparently similar to those which
descended  from the cotyledons, are found to descend from
the bases of the leaves ; and there appears no reason, with
which      I   am acquainted,        that both do not carry
                                        to suspect
a similar fluid, and that the course of this fluid   in the              is,
first instance, always towards the roots.
     The ascendingsap, on the contrary, rises wholly through
the alburnum   and central vessels    for the destruction of
                                                   ;                               a
portion of the bark,      circle round the tree, does not im

leaves and branches        ;  but the alburnous vessels appear, from
the experiments      I     have related     former paper*, and from
                                              in   a

inches from each other through the bark of one of the poles

             of the   alburnous Vessels         of Trees.
On each stool,  I destroyed the bark between the incisions,
and thus cut  off the communication between the leaves and
the lower parts of the stem and roots, through the bark.
Much growth, as usual, took place above the space from
which the bark had been taken off, and very little below it.
   Examining the state of the experiment in the succeeding
winier, I found it had not succeeded according to my hopes;
for a portion of the alburnum, in almost every instance, was
lifeless, and almost dry, to a considerable distance below the
Space from which the bark had been removed.         In one in
stance the whole of it was, however, perfectly alive ; and in
this I found the specific gravity of the wood above the de
corticated space to be 1114, and below it 1111 ; and the
wood of the unmutilated pole at the same distance from the
ground to be 1112, each being weighed as soon as it was
detached from the root.
   Had the true sap in this instance wholly stagnated above
the decorticated space, the specific gravity of the wood there
ought to have been, according to the result of former expe
riments*, comparatively much greater: but                        I   do not wish
to draw any conclusion from a single experiment ; and in
deed I see very considerable difficulty in obtaining any very
satisfactory or decisive facts from any experiments on plants

                                  during the autumn and

   My principal object was, to prove that   fluid descends a
from the leaves and stem to form the tuberous roots of this
plant;   and that this fluid      will, in part,        escape       down the al-

  in view.
      Every gardener knows that early varieties of the potatoe
 never afford either blossoms or seeds ; and I attributed this
 peculiarity to privation of nutriment, owing to the tubers
 being formed preternatural ly early, and thence drawing off
 that po.rtion of the true sap, which in the ordinary course of
 nature is employed in the formation and nutrition of blos
 soms and seeds.
      I therefore    planted, in the last spring,      some cuttings    of a
 very     early   variety of   the  potatoe, which had never           been
 known       to blossom, in garden pots, having heaped the mould
 as   high    as I could above the level of the pot,            and planted
 the    portion of the root nearly at the top of it.             When the
 plants had grown a few            inches    high, they were secured to
 strong sticks, which had been fixed erect in the pots for that
 purpose, and the mould was then washed away from the
 base    of their     stems  by a strong current of water. Each
 plant was now suspended in air, and had no communica
 tion with the soil in the pots except by its fibrous roots ;
 and as these are perfectly distinct organs from the runners
 which generate and feed the tuberous roots, I could readily
 prevent the formation of them.              Efforts were soon made by
every plant to generate runners and tuberous roots ; but these
were destroyed as soon as they became perceptible.                  An in
creased       luxuriance    of growth now         became   visible in every
 plant, numerous blossoms were emitted, and every blossom
 afforded     fruit.
     Conceiving, however, that           a  small part only of the true
sap would be expended            in the production of blossoms and
seeds,     I    was anxious     to discover what       use  nature would
make of that which remained            ;  and   I therefore took effectual
means to prevent the formation             of tubers on any part of the
plants, except        the extremities of the lateral branches, those
being the points most distant from the earth in which the
tubers are naturally deposited.            After an ineffective struggle
of   a  few weeks, the plants became perfectly obedient to my
wishes, and furmed their tubers precisely in the places I had
               them.     Many of   the joints of    the plants during the
                                                               experiment

                  of the alturnous   Vessels   of Trees.              1 25
 experiment became enlarged and turgid ; and                I   am much
 inclined to believe, that if I had totally prevented         the forma
 tion    of regular tubers,  these  joints would have acquired an
 organization capable      of retaining life, and of affording plants
 in    the succeeding spring.
      I had another variety of the potatoe, which grew with
 great luxuriance, and afforded many lateral branches; and
just at that period, when I had ascertained the first com
 mencing formation of the tubers beneath the soil, I nearly
 detached many of these lateral branches from the principal
 stems, letting them remain suspended by such a portion
 only of alburnous and cortical        fibres and vessels as were    suf
 ficient to preserve life.     In this position I conceived, that if
 their leaves and stems contained any unemployed true sap,
 it could not readily find its way           to the tuberous roots, its
 passage being obstructed by the rupture of the vessels, and
 by gravitation ; and I had soon the pleasure to see, that, in
 stead    of returning down    the principal     stem into the ground,
 it remained and formed small        tubers at the base    of  the leaves
  of the depending branches.
      The preceding facts are, I think, sufficient to prove that
  the fluid, from    which the tuberous root of the potatoe, when
 growing beneath the soil, derives its component matter,
 exists previously either in the stems or leaves ; and that it
 subsequently descends into the earth ; and as the cortical
 vessels, during every period of the growth of the tuber, are
  filled with the true sap of the plant, and as these vessels ex
  tend into the runners, which carry nutriment to the tuber,
  and in other instances evidently convey the true sap down
  wards, there appears lillle reason to doubt that through these
  vessels the tuber is naturally fed.
      To ascertain, therefore, whether      the tubers would continue
  to be fed when the passage       of the true sap down the cortical
  vessels was interrupted,     I removed a portion of bark of the
  width of five lines, and extending round, the stems of se
  veral plants   of the potatoe, close to the surface of the ground,
  soon after that period when the tubers were first formed.
  The plants continued some time in health, and during that
  period the tubers      continued    to grow,     deriving their nutri
                                                                    ment,

12d                           On the inverted Action

of the alburnous               vessels.  The tubers, however,                    by no
means attained             their natural size,        partly owing to the de
clining health of the plant, and partly to the stagnation of
a portion of the true sap above the decorticated space.
   The fluid contained in the leaf has not, however, been
proved, in any of the preceding experiments, to pass down
wards through the decorticated space, and to be subsequently
discharged into the bark below it ; but I have proved with
amputated branches of different species of trees that the
water which their leaves absorb, when immersed in that
fluid, will         be carried downwards by the alburnum, and con
veyed into a portion             of bark below the decorticated              space     ;
and that the insulated bark               will   be preserved    alive and moist
during several days*; and if the moisture absorbed by a leaf
can be thus transferred, it appears extremely probable that
the true sap will pass through the same channel. This power
in the alburnum to carry fluids in different directions pro
bably ans vers very important purposes in hot climates, where
the dews are abundant and the soil very dry ; for the mois
ture the dews afford may thus be conveyed to the extremities
of the roots: and Hales has proved that the leaves absorb
most when placed in humid air ; and that the sap descends,
cither through the bark or alburnum, during the night.
   If the inverted action of the alburnous vessels in the de
corticated space be admitted, it is not difficult to explain the
cause why some              degree   of growth
                                   takes place below such
decorticated spaces on the stems of trees ; and why a small
portion of bark and wood is generated on the lower lip of
the wound.             A
                  considerable portion of the descending true
sap certainly stagnates above the wound, and of that which
escapes into the bark below

and occasions         degree of growth to take place.

whole of this will stagnate on the lower lip of the wound,
where     I conceive it generates the small portion of wood and
bark,     which Hales and Du Hamel have described.
    I
    should scarcely have thought an account of the preceding
experiments worth sending to you, but that many of the
conclusions I have drawn in former memoirs appear, at first
view, almost incompatible with the facts stated by Hales and
Du Hamcl, and that I had one fact to communicate relative
to the effects  produced by the stagnation of the descending
sap of resinous trees, which appeared to lead to important
consequences.     I have in my possession a piece of a fir tree
from which   a portion of bark, extending round its whole
stem, had been taken off several years before the tree was
felled; and of this portion of wood one part grew above,
and the other below, the decorticated space.    Conceiving
that, according to the theory I am endeavouring to support,
the wood above    the decorticated space ought to be much
heavier than that below            it,
                             owing to the stagnation of the
descending sap,     ascertained
                         I       the specific gravity of both
kinds, taking       a    wedge    of   each as nearly   of   the same form as
I could obtain, and found the difference greatly more than
                            I
I had anticipated, the specific gravity of the wood above the
decorticated space being 0*590, and of that below only 0-491;
and having steeped pieces of each, which weighed      hundred     a
grains, during twelve hours in water,     found the latter had

absorbed       69 grains,    and the former only 51.
    The      increased   solidity of the wood above the decorticated
space,  in this instance, must,    conceive, have arisen from

of the ground, about the end of May or beginning of June,

be felled.   For much of the resinous matter contained in
the roots of these       probably carried up

 matter to the roots would probably be prevented * : the tim*
 her I have, however, very little doubt would be much im
proved by standing a second year, and being then felled in,
the autumn ; but some loss would be sustained owing to
the slow growth of the trees in the second summer.    The
alburnum of other trees might probably be rendered more
solid and durable by the same process -. but the descending
sap of these, being of a more fluid consistence than that of
the resinous tribe, would                escape       through        the    decorticated
space        into the roots in much larger quantity.
      It
     may be suspected that the increased solidity of the wood
in the fir-tree I have described was confined to the part
adjacent to the decorticated space; but it has been long
known to gardeners, that taking off a portion of bark round
the branch of a fruit-tree occasions the production of much
blossom on every part of that branch in the succeeding sea-
ion. The blossom in this case probably owes its existence
to a stagnation of the true sap extending to the extremities
of the branch above the decorticated space; and it may
therefore be expected that the alburnous matter of the trunk
and branches           of a resinous     tree   v\   ill   be rendered       more solid
 by a    similar operation.
 I      send you two specimens           of   the fir wood         I   have described,
the one having been, taken off above, and the other below
the decorticated space. The bark of the latter kind scarcely
exceeded one-tenth of line in thickness; the cause of which

vertical, from its point             of rest      by an arc      of    about 80°; it only
remained in vibration                 four seconds           and a      half; instead of
V/hich, when it was free on its pivots,                           it vibrated        a   minute
and a half.
     To avoid this inconvenience of                        the best       known          escape
ments,      I    have used in the new watch an escapement                                    nearly
similar in its principle to that with a detent, which is the
invention of M. le Hoy, and described in' the History or the
Academy for the year 1748*. The balance wheel r (PI. I.
fig. 7, and PI. III.), whose teeth are very wide apart, and very
slight, and consequently .whose strength is very small, its
power consisting in the length of the lever on which it acts ;
the balance wheel, I say, by means of the pallet p, adapted to
the circumference of the balance (Plate III. fig. 1, 2, and 3.)
restores    to    it,   every second          vibration,         the   motion which                it
loses;     and     its action        is   suspended        in these vibrations                by   an
obstacle foreign to this regulator, that   to say,               is             by   a    sort     of

 cH, draws out the ami e H of the anchor from the circum
ference of the wheel, "and makes D H enter; and when the
pallet p has arrived at F, then, the wheel being tree, the
radius Fr (fig. ].) restores to the balance its lost motion,
and pushes the pallet       p until      it is stopped by the arm      D of
 the detent,   &c., as in fig. 2.
    By this construction, with the exception of the very small
arc employed for the disengagement of the detent, and the
pulsion of the balance wheel, the vibrations of the balance
are absolutely free, and disengaged from all friction on the
part   of this wheel,   stayed, as     I   have said, on an obstacle ab
solutely foreign to the regulator ; and as the disengagement
of   the detent, and the restoration of motion by the wheel,
are executed about the middle of the arcs of vibration, where
the regulator has arrived at its greatest velocity, the very
 slight obstacle which this detent causes, &c. becomes yet
much smaller; the obstacles of friction, of cohesion, like
those    of gravity,   are proportional, as has been said, to thu
time during     which   the body surmounts them.
    I shall add to this description, that to hinder the detent
from getting out      of its  place by great shocks,         I  have placed
in the circumference         of   the balance, near each pin         which
removes the detent, a portion of a circle i A, At (fig. 1,2,
and 3, Plate III.), which the correspondent arm of this de
tent, nevertheless, can never touch, except in cases of the
most violent shocks.
    To find out the    degree    of freedom        preserved   to the regu
lator by my escapement, I made an experiment similar to
 that which I made with Graham's escapement. I took away
from my balance the pallet p, by which the balance wheel
restores the motion,       leaving only the detent. Having then
removed this regulator from the point of rest, about 90°, it
vibrated seven minutes nearly ; at the end of this time it
would     even  yet describe      in its vibrations       a  sensible arc,
although not sufficiently great to disengage               the detent.     I
conclude from this, that the influence of friction is almost
nothing in my regulator           ;   for the detent, although very
slight,   has nevertheless    a  small mass, and in the preceding
experiment the regulator could not move it in each vi
bration without employing a considerable part of the lost

                 Le Roy's Memoir                on the best Method
 force; whence we may legitimately infer, that what is At
 stroyed by friction is almost nothing: now the obstacle
 arising from my detent must be reputtd of no value, con
 sisting in a. mass always the-same, whilst the friction varies
 Continually.
    I   made,   the same trial with a seconds                 pendulum         having
 in anchor       escapement.             The whole motion of                 the   pen
 dulum ceased in about thirty minutes, whence I believe                                   I
 can conclude, considering what has been said of the resist
 ance   of   the detent, and      of     the motion which remaius to the
 balance after seven minutes,                   that   this balance in the new
watch has almost as much regulating power as this pendulum.
   I have said that my pallet was situated near the circum
ference of the balance. I placed it thus, in order that it
might be drawn by a point in its circumference of percus
sion, which point is where the wheel in its action makes no
effort on the pivots, and where the balance only receives the
circular motion*.
    Moreover, although the escapement of the new watch,
and that which M. le Roy presented to the Academy in
1 748, are founded on the same principle, they differ never
theless essentially.  In the first, the effect of the detent
operates by means of a small spring, which brings it back
into the teeth of the wheel : in this there is nothing of that
kind, as we have seen. Various trials have proved to me the
inconveniences        of the spring escapements.                     These springs
are either strong or weak            :   in     the first case,   it is   to be feared
that the detent would                    by shocks ; in the se
                               be disengaged
cond, you give to the regulator a considerable obstacle to
overcome in each vibration, which obstacle being the same
for the smallest as it is for the largest arcs, must be disad
vantageous.        Besides,     if
                           this detent, that is moved' by so
                                                      ; or if this
feeble a spring, meets with ever so slight a difficulty
spring loses its strength, it does not enter sufficiently quick

jewels either to the pivot-holes or to the balance of his watch.   Solly (p. •_•i•<,

feared much that this progression was not prwortional to
that of the degrees marked      the thermometer  by that, for               ;

of ascent in the thermometer,       would not lose six for

proved to me that my fears were unfounded     that when the         ;
regulator was free,           as    it       the progression

134             Le Roy's Memoir        on the best Method
    After being well assured of the fact I have just described,
it appeared necessary to examine a second, not less impor
tant to clear up, and to know whether metals would follow
the same progression as fluids in their extension or contrac
tion by heat and cold ; which required very nice experi
ments.       To make        them   with   some  success,   I nailed in. a
cabinet against      a   thick stone wall, at four feet distance from
each other, in       a    vertical line, two potences of copper, the
upper     one    of which carried        an index of thin hard steel
about four feet in length, which descended almost vertically:
I  then took three rods, one of copper, one of iron, and one
of  steel, of nearly equal size, and four feet in length.           I had
made to each of these rods, as well as to a tube of glass of
exactly the same length, to serve as a standard, a sheath,
made sufficiently thick of cloth : these rods and this tube
were adjusted firmly, without being able to turn, by their
lower extremity, and by a pivot adapted to their upper
extremity, they caused the index to move whose path was
marked on a limb.
    All being equal in the arrangement of the three rods and
the tube, I began my experiments, and I presently saw that,
to have any thing exact on this subject, it was necessary that
the rods should remain a long time exposed to the degree of
heat and cold in which we would make these experiments ;
particularly when from a considerable degree of heat, as 20
or 30 degrees * for example, I wished to remove my rods to
a degree of cold approaching that of ice. The reason is
known : by the experiments of Boerhaave, and those of
Newton, bodies attract heat in proportion to their specific
gravities.      Now when you would remove a body whose de
gree of cold corresponds to 0 of the thermometer, for ex
ample, to the term 3O degrees of this same instrument, by
placing it in an air that is of this degree, it is clc-ar that by
iu attraction it will presently have acquired the quantity of
caloric that will give it the degree of heat 30. But it will
not be the same         if you then remove this body to an air where
the    thermometer       is Of, to make it acquire this degree of cold;

 for then, its attraction being much stronger than that which
 the ambient air opposes to tfie quitting of the particles of
.caloric, it cools with so much the more difficulty.                I have
 found, indeed, that after having heated our rods and replaced
the, n again in the temperature 0, whence they had been
 ta^en. it required sometimes almost twelve hours to reduce
 them to the length they were before ; that is to say, for the
overplus of caloric totally to abandon the interior.                  After
 having     found   this  effect,  and   paid  the greatest  attention    in
 my experiments, I happened at last to find in their results
 the   exactness    which    1  had vainly sought for before      ;   and  f
 found that the glass and metals in their contractions and
 expansions followed precisely (as well as the augmentations
 and losses    of elasticity of springs) the proportion of the de
 grees described by the spirit-of-wine thermometer.
    These methods of proving the various contractions and
 dilatations of metals appear to me very exact : for, 1st, the
 cabinet where the instrument was placed being defended
 from the external air, no considerable change could happen
 to the wall (which was hung with tapestrv, and to which
 our potences were fixed) between one experiment and the
 other : 2dly, when it does happen (and in effect it is some
 times seen very evidently that the wall of which                   I  have
 spoken is dilated      by heat as much as the steel very nearly),
 then, I say, this effect is announced to us by the spirit-of-
 wine thermometer on the one part, and by the tube of glass
 on the other, which was very little dilatable; and which
 tube may, besides,      be kept in the same temperature.
    The     sheath3   with   which    our rods were covered enabled
 them     to be removed      from    one   place to another; that is to
 sav,   from   a stove,   or from     a  cool place in the cabinet of
 trial, and to adjust them on the instrument before they had
 undergone any alteration in their dimensions and in their
 degree of cold or heat, which would not appear practicable
 otherwise.       Bung well     assured   of these facts, I turned my
  attention to compensating         the effects of heat and cold in
 my machine.
     The first idea that occurred to me,             as  to many others,
  was, to apply to the regulating spring            a   metallic ihermo-
                                    1  4                             meter,

  136         Le Roy's Memoir       on the best Method
 meter, which would shorten or lengthen it by different tem
 peratures, as has been practised in the seconds pendulum.
 I  found presently the insufficiency of this method.           Having
 in my machine two regulating springs of about               18  inches
 each, to produce the desired effect, the shortening or length
 ening would be proportional to this length.             By the com
 putation   which  I made,    four   lines  passed  over  in the com
 pensation pyrometer would barely have sufficed ; now three
 feet of copper combined with three feet of steel hardly gives
 a sixth of a line of difference in their lengthening for 30 de
 grees  of ascent in the liquor    of  the thermometer.       We    see,
 therefore, that  I  had   not the power of obtaining         an exact
 compensation, unless by multiplying the effect by very large
 levers, and a great number of metallic bars; but all this
 brings in a play of the parts, and a want of solidity in the
 pieces of the regulator, absolutely incompatible with the
 desired exactness.
    A   second consideration determined me against making
use of these expedients in my machine, and in general all
those that alter the length of the regulating spring ; which
is, as I have explained, that the isochronism of the vibra
 tions absolutely depends on a certain length of the spiral
springs : now every method which renders this length varia
ble, not even excepting that of Mr. Harrison, although
very ingenious, is on this account inadmissible.
    Here, I am sensible, an objection may be made to me which
I  shall make myself: as a spring loses its elastic force by heat,
it  may be suspected     that the place in its length where all its
vibrations   are isochronous cannot be the same in different
degiees of heat and cold.          The following are the experi
ments which dispelled my doubts on this subject : — After
having found by experiment, in a temperate place, the
length of a spring where all its vibrations, long and short,
were isochronous, I removed the machine to a cold five de
grees below    freezing*;    the watch      experienced    an advance
proportional to the cold, (for the sake of greater simplicity I
had not applied any thermometer to it :) then I made it go
six hours, the great spring being almost down ; and during
                       •
                         About 204  of Fahrenheit.
                                                                    six

                     of measuring Time at Sea.                        137
six other hours the machine being wound to (he top, which
produced a difference of one-half in the extent of the
arcs.    I    found, then, that the regulating spring had pre
served   all the isochronism     of its vibrations, the machine
having       advanced precisely the same quantity in the first six
hours as in the six last.           Not contented with this trial,       I
removed the machine into a stove where the thermometer
constantly stood at about 35 or 40 degrees* : it then retarded
proportionally to this degree of heat.                I
                                             repeated the above
trial, which again gave me the same result ; whence it fol
lows, that the different degrees of heat do not sensibly change
the lawsof isochronism in springs.
   I
   concluded from this experiment, that whatever expedient
we may use to render the vibrations of the balance isochro
nous, the inconvenience remarked above       in the compensa
tions which are made by the shortening or lengthening of
 the spiral spring, does nevertheless lake place. For let it be
 by means of a compensation curb formed at the parts of the
escapement, or applied to the spiral spring, &c., that the
isochronism is produced, or by other similar methods ; it
will be perceived that these curbs, &c. are always according
 to the relations which exist in the times of vibrations of dif
ferent extent of this spring, supposed to be free ; and these
relations can never change without the conditions of these
curbs varying at the same time. Thus all the reasons which
have induced me to render the length of the spiral invaria
ble, must also apply, in whatever construction it may be,
where we aspire to give the greatest degree of accuracy to a
watch.
   It follows again, from what           that nothing can be
                                          precedes,
more opposite to the regularity of    marine watch than to

                                       shortening or length
ening the spiral   therefore, for my own part,
                      ;                            took good  I
care not to make use of       my watch. For this purpose

have placed two screws, GZ, GZ, (Plate III. fig.6.) perfectly
equal, at the bottom of the balance arbor so that we may, ;
 by turning them with the hand, make them approach or
recede equally from this arbor. These screws   their mass,    by

  gency of the case, and which we may make to describe a
  large space, permit us to regulate the machine to the greatest
  nicety.
      If the effects of heat and colrl were less durable, the incon
 venience      .  have just    explained might he neglected; but as
  the machine is in a state of trial during more than six months
  together, it is clear th.U as the vibrations of different extent
 of    the regulator have not then the requisite isochronism,          the
 causes which         may make the magnrude of these vibrations
 Tary, would alter the regularity of the clock considerably.
 Convinced of the principle I have just established, to com
 pensate      the effects   of different   temperatures   in my machine,
 I  took    a method altogether new.
      I  adapted to the balance several small bars          of copper and
 steel, disposed in such a         manner,     that, by their lengthening
 or shortening in heat and cold, they make to approach, or
 recede from its centre, two considerable parts of its mass,
 each placed at the extremity of a lever, and diametrically op
 posite. By the computation which 1 had made, it sufficed
 that ihe total mass of the balance should approach or rrctde
 from      the centre by about        the thirteenth of a line, to com
 pensate a variation in heat, which would produce one               of  15
 seconds per hour in the rate of the watch.
     One inconvenience          of  the   preceding method made        me
 abandon this presently ; the play of the levers, and 1he .small
 solidity of the balance, produced errors greater than those
which I wished to compensate : this made me have recourse
to a third method,          which completely succeeded.
     It   consists in applying to the balance two small thermo
meters      tttll,   Sec.  (Plate  III.  fig. 6.), each made of a tube
of   bent glass, open at       O, fig.  7-   These thermometers, com
posed      of mercury     and   spirit of wine,      would each form an
exact parallelogram,         if the-upper    side which carries the ball,
in which       is   contained the spirit of wine as well as in this
side, were not         a little inclined.       Both these thermometers
are firmly adjusted and placed on opposite sides of the arbor
of the regulator, so that the axes of their tubes and that of
the balance are in the same plane that cuts the balls through
the middle.
    It   is easy to conceive how this construction           produces the
                                                                 required

                     of measuring      Time at Sea.                    139
required compensation.          The thermometers making part of
the regulator,     when     the spirit of wine, by its dilatation*
pushes a part of the mercury contained in the outer branch               tl
(fig. 7.) towards that to, which         is near the axis    of motion, a
portion of the mercury, forming part of the mass of the regu
lator, passes then from its circumference towards its centre.
At temperate, for example, the mercury occupies the parts
tkkt of the tube; whilst, in extreme cold, when Reau
mur's    thermometer is at        15   degrees    below freezing*, the
branch to is empty, and that corresponding, it, is full of
mercury.       Now as the mass of a balance resists in the ratio
of the square of its distance from the centre, there arises
evidently from this a compensation ; the retardation arising
from losses of elasticity in springs, and from the dilatation,
 of the balance by great heat, being compensated by the loss
of  mass in the circumference of the regulator, and vice versa,
 in the  passage to cold     : this effect is so much the more cer
 tain, as there is no play to fear here; besides, the dilatation
 of spirit of wine by heat, and its condensation by cold, are
 constant effects, as we have found by the thermometers of
 this liquor, which at the end of thirty years had lost nothing
 of their exactness.
    The following is the computation of            these thermometers,
 to which    I have given the form we see them            of, in order that
 the balls might be turned towards the centre              of  the balance,
 and also to diminish       the resistance      that the air gives to the
 motion    if it was near the circumference.
                  Calculation   for   the Thermometers.
    iSuppose the weight of the balance to be tliree ounces, or
  1728 grains, experience proves that for 30 degrees of heat a
  marine watch where this effect is not compensated loses 15"
  per hour, or -i-J-^tli part.    It is therefore necessary, that by
  the diminution     of  its mass    the balance should         produce an
 equivalent acceleration: now 1728, the number of grains of
  which three ounces are composed, divided by 240, is equal
  to seven grains ; and as the accelerations are only as the
  square roots   of  the   diminutions      of the mass, it is necessary
  to take away about 14 grains         of  the mercury, placed towards
                      * Or 14 below zero of Fahrenheit's,
                                                                        the

 the centre of percussion of the balance, to produce the de
 sired compensation : this is what is effVcted by a ball of
 spirit of wine of about live lines and a half in diameter,
 which size may be varied according to the greater or less
force of the liquor.        Whence it is evident that we may di
 minish or increase the effect        at pleasure  to arrive at the pre
cise term    of   the compensation       :  1st, by augmenting; or di
minishing     the size   of the ball   : 2dly, by placing the exterior
branch further from, or nearer to, the centre of the balance ;
Sdly, by using spirits of wine more or less rectified.
    These thermometers, having a very small mass, produce
their compensation at the same instant that the springs are
dilated or contracted: this is what cannot happen in all kinds
of thermometers composed of metallic bars, which to be
solid must be made very strong with regard to the blade of
the regulating spring.
    I  use two thermometers          instead    of one, which     at first
would     appear    to suffice;  without this, in      the different de
grees   of heat and cold,     the regulator would       not preserve its
equality of weight in all points of its circumference; which
is an important thing, as I have explained, to prevent the
effect  of shocks     and various motions.                 •
    Before we terminate this article let us remove some diffi
culties that may be thrown in our way.
    It may   at first be feared that     the two liquids     would   mix
by violent shocks ; it is easy to be assured of the contrary
by taking a similar thermometer, turning it upside down,
and shaking it.
    Perhaps it may also be apprehended that the spirit of wine
would be compressed, more or less, according to the weight
of the atmosphere, because I leave the inner branch open,
in order that all the parts of the mercury and spirit of wine
may tend with more force towards the ball : I will not deny
that this will happen, but in so small a quantity that it must
absolutely be neglected. By Mr. Canton's experiments the
whole weight of the aSmosphere only compresses the spirit
of wine the -nrz&Wir^ Part , therefore the variations of these
weights, which hardly amount to -^th, would only form in,
34 hours the variation of four millionth and a half             of 5' or
            4                                                      300",

300",     which the compensation produces ; that is to say,
about the 600dlh part of a second in 24 hours.
   Lastly, it may be asked why, instead of making my ther
mometers of one liquor only, I have used mercury and spirit
of wine.       It is well known that spirit of wine, being more
than eighteen times lighter than mercury, it would have
made my thermometers too large for my regulator, which
would have augmented the resistance of the air, &c.
   With regard to mercury, exclusive of its having the in
conveniences which I have just remarked in spirits of wine
alone, its dilatation would not have been sufficient.                        Be
sides, it would have been imprudent to have used too great
a mass that was fluid and moveable, whose inertia in any
shock would have broken the tubes, &c. *

 Of   the methods used in the new watch to make                  all Us parts
   remain the same, after having             been subjected    to the greatest
    differences in temperature.
   The     effects  of   heat and cold       which I have just examined
in  the preceding article, are not,           in my opinion, those which
would be most opposed to the                regularity of a marine watch ;
there is another, which I was unable to correct until after
a great number of useless trials. The following is what made
it known to me:
   Being assured of tfic regularity of my machine in the same
temperature, I was willing to try if it would preserve this
same accuracy in great degrees of heat, such as those that
are felt between          the tropics    : for this purpose, by means of
a stove, I kept for near a day, in a small room, a degree of
heat where the thermometer stood between 35 and 40 de
grees   :  my compensation being a little too strong, instead
of losing,     as others would, my watch gained, as I had fore
seen,     some seconds : the advancement was easy to correct
by the methods pointed out in the preceding article ; but
this I did not wait for : having then removed my machine
into the mean temperature where it was before, it gamed
                                                                       t

new advancement, less considerable than the preceding, and
the same with a third, 8cc. : other watches, instead of' gain
ing, on the contrary would lose by the preceding operation,
which sometimes also does not produce any effect.
  By reflecting on these subjects, I conceived that there hap
pened here some effect similar to those observed in the ela-
terometer   it might very well be, that the springs, or the
             :
regulating springs (for 1 made this trial by different methods),
experienced some change of figure by heat, which would
augment or diminish their strength ; whence I concluded
that it would be necessary to take particular care that thest
springs move very freely, and that they do not receive                                 the
smallest constraint in their application to the balance.
      With this view I      made the pieces d d (Plate            III. fig.      G.) ca
pable of receiving all the requisite situations, that the spring
might be attached without experiencing the least constraint.
By their first motion they could move backwards or forwards
in their groove to receive the springs ; we might then raise
or lower them at pleasure by turning them on the screws dd
(Plate III.), by which they are affixed to the frame: lastly,
the part where the spring is attached turns itself on a pivot,
in order that this spring might be applied without changing
its figure in any respect.  When all these precautions arc
taken, we fix all the parts by their screws.      By means of
these pieces we diminish this effect greatly, if we do not to
                                                                   it it,

sively heating and cooling the machine until                            no longer
exists. Without these precautions       only      it   is         by   chance that
we can produce         a   good marine watch.

agitations of all the parts of the machine, especially those of
the regulator, the situation, the form, and the texture of
these parts may be changed : whence ar.se errors so much
the more important, because, instead of being transitory, as
others are, they would only cease when we had applied the
remedy      to the changes ,i*.tlu-y    happen.
    The methods which          appeared      to me proper to prevent
these inconveniences        are, 1st, to render all the parts of the
watch     as solid and as unalterable as they can be made : 2dly,
to suspend the machine in such a way that it may receive
little motion from shocks : 3dly, to diminish the effect of
this motion as much as it can be done : lastly, to arrange
things in such a manner, that this motion when received
may not be preserved, but may cease, ou the contrary, at
soon as possible. To fulfil these different conditions, I took
care not to give my spiral springs             too great a magnitude or
mass     with   regard   to their strength.         M. Daniel Bernoulli
recommends in his Mtmoire to make ihem very large; but,
having applied some of them to my watch, I presently per
 ceived    that agitations a little considerable made them move
 and vibrate not only according to their length, but even in
 their wu'th; whence I concluded that there was a mean
 term to be chosen in the size of these springs.            After some
 experience, I fell upon that point of magnitude in the spring
 where all the vibrations are exactly isochronous* without
 being affected by considerable shocks.
     Nothing could appear more opposite to that solidity, w hich
 is so necessary in the parts of the regulator, than the harpsi
 chord wire by which it is suspended.              Although its strength
 be such as to sustain a weight fourteen times greater than
 the balance without breaking, nevertheless it was much to
 be feared that it would not withstand violent shocks            (which
 happened, in effect, before I had taken the precautions which
 I  am going to mention), or at least that it would lengthen.
 To prevent this inconvenience, I atlached the upper extre
 mity of this wire to a spring x,x (fig. 7. Plate I.), sufficiently
  strong to keep the wire and the balance suspended, and ele
 vate   it to   a  fixed point above, against which this spring
  presses, and is slopped ; by this means it is no longer the
                          * See Article 11. 0f Part IL
                                                                     wire

  144             Le Roy's Memoir           on the best    Method
  wire which sustains the balance in              great shocks.       Then, the
  suspension spring, which could only raise a weight a little
  greater than the balance, gives way* and the extremity of
  the lower pivot of the balance touches and rubs during the
  moment       of  the   shock on       a   plate, as is done in common
  watches when they are laid down.*
     An essential thing to determine was the magnitude of the
 vibrations.       I acknowledge that the true place where we
  might    find this with most success                would     be  a sea-port.
 M. Bernoulli        recommends that they should be very small                         ;
 but  I  feared then that shocks would have had a considerable
 effect   on them.        I have therefore made the balance describe
 an arc    of about      100 degrees       in the long vibrations — that is
 to say, when the watch is just wound up— which is reduced
 to 90 after the watch has been going 24 hours.                         In other
 respects    I have followed the principles             of M. Bernoulli,        ibid.
 who requires that       a  considerable motion          of the balance should
 produce little change in the figure             of  the spring.
    After having put the regulator,              "by   the proper disposition
 of its parts,    as much as possible out           of the power of shocks,
 to fulfil our views entirely, it is necessary to find some me
 thod of rendering these motions as small as they can be;
 the least abrupt, and of* as short duration as possible : this
is what I have done by the suspension which I have given
to the new watch.
    The motions which it may receive                 can only be either ho
rizontal, vertical, or in a direction                compounded of these
two.      To compensate          the    first, which would particularly
affect the spiral springs,         I have suspended          and rendered         my
watch moveable on two axes               A, A    (fig. 1. Plate   IV.)   adapted
to a frame or strong parallelogram              of copper    AB, A B, which
itself,   as   well   as  the watch, turns on two other axes B B,
fixed to the box, which contains the whole machine*.                              By
this means the watch forms a kind of pendulum, at the bot
tom   of which       are placed the spiral springs.             When, there
fore, they receive       a  shock,     we see at     first sight that it is the

thoud (Ectaircissemens, p. :tf,.) attributes the contrivance to Cardan: but I
have ieen an old work on Mechanics, of much earlier date than anything of
Cardan's, where this suspension       was proposed for a carriage to convey
wounded soldiew from the field of battle, or irora one' place to another.

                                   and that the lower part
of the pendulum, or the watch, remains almost fixed at that
moment; this pendulum then                              redescends          by   an        inclined
plane to the vertical, whence                     it   was removed              by   the    shock,
and that        gentle motion, progressive and slow, which
                  by   a
can neither afreet nor derange that of the spiral springs.
  These motions, although rendered more gentle and infi
nitely less prejudicial,              nevertheless           cannot be otherwise than
contrary to the accuracy of the watch,     they were of long         if

more considerable disadvantage. These oscillationswould in

that the points of suspension would be worn; that the watch
would be found, in great number of instances, in situations
                                 a
very remote from the vertical (which   the most advantageous  is
situation, being the one in which    was regulated); and that

would   be considerably augmented.        have prevented this  I
inconvenience, 1st,                  by
                         gentle friction springs acting near
the points of suspension on planes or large surfaces, which,
with   sufficient resistance to diminish considerably the oscil

latory motion, are very little subject to wear, and neverthe
less permit the watch to move on these axes          2dly,                       :             by   a

               of t he native Cinnabars of Japan, &c.               147
   The    transverse   fracture is scaly, the longitudinal       one la-
mellated.
   The fragments        are irregularly angular and opake.         Pyri-
tous points are partly scattered over them, or rather they
adhere to a quartzy matrix.            The mineral is tender ;^its
powder is of a scarlet colour; its specific gravity is 7'710.
   A. 1000 grains were sublimed in a retort furnished with
a globular receiver,      in which   a little   water was put. The
produce sublimed was exactly .similar           to artificial cinnabar.
The water of      the receiver, rendered      turbid by some parts    of
sulphur, contained sulphuretted hydrogen              gas and sulphu
rous acid in small quantity.            The residue in the retort,
weighing 38 grains, being digested with muriatic acid, the
latter took up the iron coming         from the pyrites and left the
quartzy matrix.
   B. a.    104 grains   of mineral, which according to the above
experiment contained 100 grains of cinnabar, were heated
with 500 grains of muriatic acid, which disengaged from it
sulphuretted hydrogen gas.            10O grains of nitric acid were
successively added, which produced, with lively efferves
cence, the decomposition of the cinnabar, and the complete
solution of the metallic parts.
    b. The sulphur remaining, of a grayish yellow, had a
viscous consistence; it weighed 11 -8 grains.              When burnt
it left a blackish residue of 1-5 grains, which deducted from
the preceding weight determines the quantity               of sulphur  at
 10-3 grains.
    c. The solution of cinnabar in nitro-muriatic acid was
mixed with muriate of barytes. The precipitate, after hav
 ing been made red hot, presented 30 grains of sulphate
 of barytes, which correspond with 4-2 grains of sulphur.
Besides    these 14-5 grains    of sulphur,    we may count a quarter
of  a  grain of loss by the sulphuretted hydrogen gas ; whence
it results that 100 parts of pure cinnabar contain 14-/5 of
sulphur.
    C. 1040 grains of cinnabar, which contain, according to
the above experiment, 1000 grains of pure cinnabar, were
distilled with half the weight of iron filings j the produce

                                  II.
              Cinnabar   of Newmarktel, in Carniola.
    This ore is distinguished by its beauty from every othrr
in Europe.      The mineral is of a lively cochineal red. It is
found in considerable masses, enveloped with a blackish gray
chalk, traversed with veins of calcareous spar of a milky
white.     Its specific gravity is 8- 1 60.
    A. 100 grains were heated to ebullition with 500 grains
of muriatic acid ; 100 grains of nitric acid were afterwards
successively added.       After perfect solution there remained
 10-20 grains of yellow sulphur, which burned without leav
ing any residue. Muriate of barytes produced in the so
lution 27 grains of sulphate of barytes, which correspond
to 3-80 of sulphur. If the loss of the sulphur, which formed
the sulphuretted hydrogen gas, amounts to a quarter of a
grain, the quantity of sulphur in 100 parts of cinnabar
ought to be 14-25 grains.
    B. 500 grains of cinnabar mixed with half        as  much iron,
filings,  and distilled,  yielded 485 grains of mercury.
     100 parts of the cinnabar analysed, therefore, contain     :

              Hepatic Sutphuret     of Mercury of Idria.
    A.   1000 grains   of cinnabar, distilled with half  that quan
tity of iron filings, yielded 81 8 grains of pure mercury. The
sulphuret of iron remaining was mixed with a black dust.
    JB. 1 00 grains were treated with the nitric and muriatic
                                                              acids,

                   of  the native Cinnabars  of Japan, ts*c.        149
    Acids, and precisely the same phenomena were observed as
    in the preceding analysis of the cinnabar of Japan. Upon
    the combustion of the sulphur a black residue remained,
    consisting of three grains of charcoal, which left upon in
    cineration one grain of reddish ashes.        The quantity of sul
    phur obtained was 13-75.
       C. a. 1000 grains of hepatic sulphuret were distilled in
   the chemico-pneumatic apparatus : 34 cubic inches of sul
   phuretted hydrogen gas passed over, without mentioning a
   part which was dissolved by the water of the receiver.          256
   grains of pure cinnabar were sublimed, and the neck of the
   retort was coated with a mixture of humid ethiops and me
   tallic globules, from which 317 grains of mercury were me
   chanically separated.
       b. The     residue  in  the retort was  of a charcoal black  ; it
   weighed 39 grains.          When incinerated it left 16 grains of a
   grayish powder, which ascertains the charcoal consumed to
   be 23 grains.
       c. This earthy residue, treated by the muriatic acid, left
   G£   grains   of silex.
       d. The muriatic solution, of a greenish yellow, was hy-
•'
   persaturated by ammonia, which produced a brownish pre
   cipitate   : the liquor was of a clear blue.
       e. The precipitate, treated by potash, left two grains of
   oxide of iron. The same alkaline liquor furnished 5-J- grains
   of alumine by       the muriate  of ammonia.
      f.  Into this ammoniacal liquid, after having hypersatu-
   rated   it with muriatic acid, a plate of zinc was dipped, which
   separated from it 0-20 of copper.

   Those who are of opinion, with Messrs. Kirwan and Sage,
that the mercury in this cinnabar is only partly combined
with the sulphur, will see by this analysis that the two sub
stances are in round numbers, as 1 and 6 ; and if there was
any mercury not combined, the          nitric acid would attack it.
The   idea entertained that this ore contained oxidated mer
cury besides cinnabar, may have arisen from the appearance
of part of the mercury when distilling. But it arises entirely
from the charcoal, which decomposes a part of the cinnabar,
whether it takes from it its necessary quantity of oxygen, or
forms at a high temperature carburetted sulphur.             A distil
lation of artificial cinnabar with lamp-black absolutely pre
sents the same phacnomena.                x
   Whether      the  mercury in the cinnabar is entirely exempt
from oxygen, is a problem which is not yet resolved.
   There is some appearance that the mercury exists in it in
so very   low  a degree of oxidation, that it    has hitherto escaped
observation.      In the examination     of this subject it must not
be lost sight of,    that the mercury in cinnabar (analogous
with some other metals oxidated at the minimum) resists the
nitric acid ; that in the making of cinnabar the passage of
 the ethiops to the state of cinnabar is always accompanied
by an inflammation,      and each inflammation seems to be an
oxidation.

moir  proceed to detail the object of their experiments, and
their method of investigation.
  We know that light, oh passing from one transparent
medium into another of        different density or chemical na
                                          a

nomy            by
           the name of refraction.      Newton proved that this
change  of  direction was owing    to an attraction which bodies
exercise upon the element of light, and which acting only
at very          small distances completely resembles the chemical
affinities,        The principal idea of the authors of the memoir
was to employ the physical fact of the deviation of light in
different gases, in order to study its connection with their
chemical nature they conceived the idea of applying this
                            ;
subtle element to the aerifor,m  substances, nearly as the che
mists apply their reagents to liquids  an ingenious idea, and;
which became very fertile in their hands.
     The first and most interesting of the aeriform substances
by is,
      without doubt, that which envelops the terrestrial globe
         the name         of atmosphere,          and preserves heat and life at its
surface.             It   was also the first aeriform substance         examined
by       the authors.            Two    general       processes   present     themselves
in studying              of the common air the one (astro

                                    physical, and completely
analogous to that in use for determining the refracting power

  of solids   and     liquids;   they are disposed     in the form     of
  prisms, i.   e.  they are terminated        by surfaces oblique from
  each other;     and upon looking         through   them, we observe
  •he deviation experienced by the rays of light, occasioned
  by their entrance and exit under a certain obliquity.
     But how can we make a prism of air ? In the same man
  ner as a liquid prism,      by inclosing    air in any cavity, termi
  nated, at the points where the light enters and departs, by
  transparent plates of glass, the respective inclination of
  which,   as well as the       refracting angle, is well known.       If
  the apparatus     is so constructed that what is called a vacuum
 in physics     may     be made     and maintained     round the glass
  plates in which the air is contained, the atmospheric air may
  then be considered as a prism ; because, the essential condi
 tions being the difference of the mediums which               the light
 ought to traverse, and the obliquity of incidence,            these are
 obtained   if   the   hollow prism   is left empty ; or if it be filled
 with   an aeriform       substance different from the ambient air ;
 or, lastly, with common air, but of a different density.
     Newton induced Hawksby to pursue some experiments of
 this kind; but Hawksby's prism having only a very small
 refracting angle, and the means of observation of the visual
 angles being at that time very much below the degree of
 precision which may be obtained at present, these pursuits
 were left unfinished ; and they could not have fallen into
better hands.
     At the suggestion of M. de la Place, the Institute charged
 the authors of the present memoir with the further develop
 ment of the above pursuits ; and in detailing their results
 they do becoming homage to the illustrious authors of the
 Static Chemistry and the Mecanique Celeste: " The sub
ject of all our researches," they say, " was indicated in the
 above works, and the conversation and advice of their au
 thors furnished         us  with   the means     of making our      re»
 searches."
     Borda had undertaken the same researches with instru
 ments, to the perfection of which he had greatly contributed ;
 lie died, however, before having terminated his labours, and
 we    have only recovered       some    slight traces  of them.    But
                                                                     bis

        and on the refractive- Powers     of different Gases.      153
his instruments       and  his method still exist, and the authors
of  the   memoir      availed themselves  of them    ; adding thereto
such improvements as were suggested           by their own guuiui
and the progress of science.
   They employed        the  same   prism as that of Borda.       It is .
a brass tube, terminated by two planes of glass carefully
luted to the tube, oblique to its axis, and making between
them an angle of 143° 7' 28" (sexagesimal degrees), deter
mined by processes which ascertained it within a few se
conds.     This tube is sustained by a support with a stop
cock, by means of which the vacuum is made in its interior
by an air-pump. It is furnished with a barometer commu
nicating with the interior, and actiug the part of a proof to
ascertain the degree of vacuum made in it.               In the results
an account was kept of a very small error in the parallelisms
in the two surfaces of each of the glasses at the ends of the
tube  ;  an error which      was discovered    by observations, and
which only     rose to 16-6"    : this quantity is constantly added
to the angles observed ; it is but a very trifling portion of
the total deviation, which rises to 362-6".
   In order   to determine this deviation the       following  process
was resorted to     : — The apparatus, being     placed on the top   of
the Palace   of the Senate (formerly the Luxembourg), imme
diately  behind   it was placed a repeating circle, the lower eye
glass of which was constantly pointed to the thunder-rod of
the observatory, 1400 metres distant.           The lower eye-glass
was directed upon the same object, but traversing the prism;
and the visual ray was affected with all the deviation due to
the refraction.       The angular quantity of it was very exactly
observed ;   then, after havmg half turned the prism upon
its vertical axis (being on a horizontal plane), which this
turning had doubled, it was again observed, and was found
so great, that the bent ray paised from one extremity to the
other of the facade        of  the observatory.     This whole angle
was observed     a great   number    of times, in order to take     ad
vantage of the characteristic property of the repeating circle;
and thus a perfect exactitude was obtained.                An account
was always kept         of the variations of the barometer      and  of
the hygrometer during the operations.                           y     ,


         and on the refractive Powers        of different  Gases.    153
gramme.        The mercury was weighed with great precaution,
in order to compare its weight with that of water ; and set
ting out with that of the air, a relation upon which several
useful results rest, and particularly the measure of heights by
the barometer, the metal was introduced into a matrass with
a straight beak, and from        which all air was carefully expelled
by the ebullition of the mercury, and by afterwards putting
it under the receiver of the air-pump. The same precautions
were taken with the water ; all the corrections were made in
respect to the temperature and the density           of  the atmospheric
air,  as  well as   for the dilatation   of the vessels ; and there was
found for the      final relation of the weight of the mercury and
of the air, i.    e. for the constant coefficient       to employ in the
calculations of the measurement of heights by the barometer
expressed in metres, the number 18332, at the freezing point
 and at the pressure of 0-76 of a metre.
    We know that this          same coefficient may be obtained by
 a very different method,         i. e. by comparing the barometric
heights    observed       in the open   air in stations differently ele
vated, with the real differences of height of the same stations
determined by levelling or by trigonometrical measures.               De
 Lues, Schuckburgh,           Tremblcy, and other men of science,
 have proceeded       in this manner    ;  but no person has followed
 up this part of the research, or fathomed the different ele
 ments of it with more sagacity than M. Ramond, whose
 conclusions we shall shortlv state.
    The coefficient indicated by M. Ramond              as the most con
 venient to apply to observations made in the open air is =
 1 8336, and differs only by four unities of the fifth order of
 decimals, from that which the authors concluded from their
 experiments in close vessels ; an agreement which forms a
 presumption very favourable to the exactitude of this funda
 mental determination.           M. Ramond has also shown that
 this coefficient,      introduced   into the formula of        M.  de la
 Place, would give the heights of mountains in a manner so
 nearly corresponding, that the uncertainty which remains is
 within the limits of those errors of which the minutest and
  most accurate observations are susceptible.

  be ascertained, in some measure, from their        purity; but the
  authors did not content themselves       with this, and the gases
 were always submitted to chemical analysis.            Messrs. The-
 nard, and Berthollet junior, assisted their friends in this part
 of their labour; and their names inspire confidence. It be
 came    still necessary    that these  gases,   although produced
 very pure, should be introduced         with all their purity into
 the prism of the experiment.        The authors succeeded in this
 essential requisite by a particular disposition of the cocks of
 communication,       difficult to be understood without the as-
 •istance   of drawings.
    "  Knowing,"       they say,
                                    " the specific weights of our
 gases, and the refractions exercised by them upon the light,
 we concluded, by calculation, their refractive power com-'
 pared  with that of the atmospheric air.
    "  What we mean here by the term refractive power, is
not only the deviation produced upon the luminous ray, nor
is it the angle measured by this deviation.          If the function
of the distance which expresses the action of bodies upon
the light was of the same form for all bodies, and did not
differ relatively to each of them but by the produce of their
density, and of a constant coefficient dependent on their na
ture, the quantity, which we call the refractive power of a
body, would be proportional to the intensity of its attractive
force for the light ; but in every case it is the sum of all the
actions exercised by the body multiplied by the clement of
space and by the density.         These rigorously    exact    notions
are conformable       with the principles given by Newton and
by the author of the Mtcanique Celeste: it appeared neces
sary to recall them to observation, because it is only by at
taching precise ideas to principles that we can employ them,
and follow with certainly the consequences which may be
deduced    from them."
   By applying these principles to their experiments the au
thors of the memoir have established the refractive power of
various aeriform fluids.       Oxygen of all these fluids, and in
deed   of all natural bodies yet observed, refracts         the  least,
and hydrogen      refracts the   most, — it refracts 6-J- times more
than common air.
                                                              Newton

        end on the refractive Powers    of different Gases.    157
    Newton discovered in the refracting power of the dia
mond what suggested to him that it was combustible ; and
M. de la Place announced, in a printed memoir, the great
refractive power of hydrogen.        The refracting power of the
other gases is    intermediate   between   those of hydrogen and
oxygen.      That of the muriatic acid gas was tried, not
withstanding the great difficulties attending its manipula
tion, and it was found to surpass that of the atmospheric
air.
    But it is the study of the refracting power of this latter
fluid, and of its modifications on account of its density, that
ought particularly to occupy philosophers, since the rays of
light never reach us, except more or less turned from the
right line by this influence.      We might vary at pleasure the
density of the common air inclosed in the apparatus; that
is to say, produce a given difference between this medium
and the external air, on leaving the one and the other iden
tical in their nature, and only changing the element of den
 sity.   When we have brought the density of the interior
 and exterior air to the term of equality, there will remain
 no more refrangent cause than the error in the parallelism
 of the two surfaces of each glass;     and it is thus the absolute
 quantity of this correction was determined,         which  did not
 reach 17 seconds of a degree.        This series  of observations
 made upon the atmospheric air and upon the other gases,
 taken at different densities, and always marking the state of
 the barometer, thermometer, and hygrometer, afforded the
 authors   of the memoir    a conviction of this important prin
 ciple in  the theory  of refractions, namely, that from the most
 perfect vacuum to the ordinary degree of pressure of the at
 mosphere, the refraction of the light in any given gas is al
 ways proportional to its density, without this rule having
 any occasion for the slightest modification.
    The authors propose to examine, by future experiments,
 the influence of a temperature more or less elevated, and of
 the condensation    of the air beyond the ordinary atmospheri
 cal limits upon the refractive power     of this fluid.
     It did not appear to them that the state    of the hygrometer
                                                                had

 had any appreciable influence upon the refractive power when
 the sky is clear, and the air transparent.              They propose to
 themselves further experiments upon this subject, and upon
 the refracting power of vapours            •
                                              and as these experiments
 require high temperatures, they are obliged to wait for                     the
 great heats in summer.
    In order    to reduce    the gases to the same pressure and the
 same temperature        in the calculation of the results, the au
 thors made use of the law laid down by Guy-Lussac, namely,
that by equal increases of heat there is the same law for all
the gases, and that the dilatation of each is equal to 0*00375
of its volume for each degree of the centigrade thermometer.
This number        was determined by 25 experiments,               which did
not sensibly differ from one another, and were made with
tubes perfectly'dry, and of exact calibres.               " This result,"
the authors say,       "  as given by Guy-Lussac, is one of the
most useful in physics ; it serves at the same time chemists,
and even astronomers, to reduce their observations.                        It is
probable that by adding the specific gravities of the gases
and their refractive powers, as given in this memoir, an
exact and complete knowledge will be obtained of all the
physical properties of aeriform fluids."
    We reserve for a future number the consequences deduced
by the authors of the memoir from their experiments, and
the development        of  the relations in which these results may
be interesting to chemistry.

and even in places where they could not subsist at present,
has struck every one with astonishment, and has given rise
to  a  number of hypotheses in order to account for them :
but it would have been highly proper if as much activity
had been shown in determining the conditions and the na
ture of the problem, as there has been in resolving it ; and
perhaps this very negligence in fixing the bases, and even
the terms of the question, has been one of the causes why
the most     of  these solutions    have   been  so  unfortunate.    It
must be admitted, at least,           that we have been rather too
late   in occupying      ourselves   with questions which ought to
have been answered        before trying    our strength in resolving
the problem.
    Are   the elephants    of  the present  day  of the same species  ?
Supposing that there are several species, are the fossil ele
phants of different countries indiscriminately of all these
different species ? or rather,-Are they divided into different
countries, according to their species ? or are they of species
which are now lost ?
    It is evident that we can say nothing demonstrable upon
the problem, before resolving all the preliminary questions ;
and we are      as yet hardly in possession of the elements ne
cessary    for the  solution of some of them.
    The osteologies of the elephant hitherto published are so
little detailed, that we cannot as yet say of several of them if
they belong to the osteology of any of our living elephants ;
and of the innumerable quantity of fossil ossifications so
much talked       of by authors, we have scarcely obtained passa
ble drawings of two or three.              Daubenton, who had an
African skeleton before his eyes, perceived none of the enor
mous -differences of its grinders from those of a fossil ske
leton; and he confounds a fossil thigh of the animal of the
Ohio with that of the elephant. The comparisons made by
Tentzelius, by Pallas, and so many others, of fossil bones
with fresh ones, were never expressed, except in general
terms    ; and were never       accompanied     with exact  drawings,
rigorous     measurements, nor those         abundant details which
Such important       inquiries pecessarily require.

 elephant renders things visible which it is extremely difficult
 to distmguish in those of men or animals.
    But in    the first place, according            to my usual        method,     t
shall describe        those     places    where fossil       ossifications     have
been found of that species which forms the principal subject
of my present researches.
    To describe every place where they                  have been      discovered
would be an endless task             j suffice   it to Say, that every coun
try, and even- aerai.has furnished fossil bones.
    Traces of them are discovered in the writings of the dn-
tients.     Theophraatus speaks of them in a work no longer
in existence, of which Fliriy              has given us his testimony           :—
"  Theophrasius autor est, et ebur fossile candido et nicrrd
colore inveniri, et oSsa e terra nasci> iuveriirique lapides
osseos;" Lib. xxxvi. cap. 18.
    It is probable that the bones             of  elephants     have been often
taken for human ones             ;  and this may       have given rise to the
pretended       discoveries      of   the   tombs of giants spoken of in
antiquity.
   Of this number the bones discovered                        in digging     a well
at Tegeft      certainly were, although taken for the bones or"
Orestes * ; and also those seen at Caprea, according to Sue
tonius,    and regarded as the bones              of heroes or giants f.
   As   to the     stories     of  bodies    still larger, sucVas that of a
skeleton 46 cubits in length thrown out of the ground during
an earthquake at Crete,             and regarded       as   that of Entellus or
Otus    J;  or that     of another, of 60 cubits, dug up             near    Tingis
in Mauritania, when Sertorius commanded there,                         and   which
was taken for the skeleton              of Ant«us§       ). these accounts ard
certainly exaggerated,           or else they      have for their origin th«
skeletons of whale*.               Strabo, who relates the latter story
on the authority of Gabinius, does not hesitate to regard it
as fabulous.

of anatomy,              middle age : even at that period
                     lasted    to the
mention is made               of giants,
                           and the descriptions of their
bones are sometimes so exaggerated that they make them
ten times larger than those of the largest elephants.
  As more correct ideas have now dissipated these chimeras,
one would think that the elephants whose bones were dis
covered had been buried by human beings. Thus, so far as
these discoveries are confined to               Italy, and those countries
frequented by the Macedonians,                  the Carthaginians,               and the
Romans,    they may be reasonably accounted for by reflect
ing on the  prodigious number of elephants possessed by these
people.
   We know that               the     first Europeans     who         had
                                                                    elephants
were Alexander            and       his Macedonians       after the defeat of
Porus * ; and on that occasion some excellent notions were
furnished by Aristotle on the subject of these animals ; after
the death      of Alexander, Antigonus                      the greatest
                                                       possessed
number      of elephants f.             The Selencides maintained them
always, particularly after Seleucus Nicator received fifty of
them from Sandro-Cottus in exchange for a whole canton
on the banks of the Indus J. Pyrrhas was the first who
brought them into Italy in the year of Rome 472 § ; and as
he disembarked at Tarentum the Romans gave these ani
mals, which were then unknown to them, the name                                   of Lu-
canian bulls. They were in very small numbers, and Pyrrhus
had taken them from Demetrius.    Curias Dentatos captured
four of those from Pyrrhus, and brought them to Rome to
grace his triumph. These were the first that were seen by
the Romans       ;    btit they soon became            quite common.       Me-
tellus,    having conquered the Carthaginians                 in Siciry, in the
year of Rome 502, conducted their elephants to Rome upon
rafts, to the number of 120 according to Seneca, and 14*
according to Pliny   these were all massacred in the Circus.

his triumph for Africa.            Germanicus exhibited some which
danced ludicrously ; and under- Nero, at the games which
he gave in honour of his mother, they were exhibited dancing
upon a ropej ana .performing a number of feats of activity*

they were elephants born at Rome                 ;  and they must have con

   Columella asserts the same fact still more positively :—
" India perhibetur molibus ferarilm mirabilis : pares tamen in.

   If our naturalists had paid attention to these two passages^
they would not have credited so long the impossibility of
domesticating the elephant, and they would have perhaps
tried a little sooner the experiments which have succeeded
so well when made by M. Corse on that animal*
   Thus, though Italy presents a great quantity of fossil
bones, they were for a long time attributed to such indivi
dual animals as had been brought there by mankind ; some
of them only, however, may be attributed to this cause.

was said to have been dug, positively asserts that                                      it   could
not have been more than 30 feet high.
   Kircher mentions three other giant skeletons found Si                                     in

     The   state    of oppression under which modern Greece                                        has

accounts of the fossils   contains; but that country, also,
                                   it
has had its animal giants.
     In   1691 there was found, about six leagues                                from Thessa-
lonica,  some bones which admitted the arm of        man into                      a

15 pounds.   Three other teeth weighed from two to three
pounds each.   The humerus was two feet eight inches in
circumference.

 there is a jaw from the island of Cerigo deposited in the ca

     Although      we scarcely ever    heard   of France having    pos
 sessed    any     elephants at any period, yet fossil skeletons
 of   these animals are not less numerous there than in any
 other country.
     It is now pictty clear that the giant skeleton, said to have
been found in 1456, in the reign of Charles VII., near Va
 lence, was that       of  an   elephant.    It is also probable that
 the bones      dug up near Valence,       under Louis XL, were of
 the same description.         They were said to belong to an ani
mal    J8  feet   long.
     It was also in Dauphine that the skeleton was discovered
which of all others has given rise to most controversy. The
numerous pamphlets which were published on the subject
throw little light on it.
     From what we can judge at this distance of time, it appears
thai; in 1013 some large bones were found in a sand-pit near
the castle of Chaumont.
     A surgeon of Beaurepaire, named Mazurier, exhibited
these     bones at Paris for money l and in order to excite
greater curiosity, he distributed a small pamphlet, where he
asserted that they were found in a sepulchre 30 feet long,
upon which was inscribed
                                    " Teutobockus rex." We know
that this was the name of the king of the Cimbri, who fought
against Marius.          But Mazurier was accused of forging this
inscription     ;  and  he  does not seem to have justified himself
from the imposture,
     As for the bones he exhibited, they consisted         of  the fol
lowing pieces :
     1. Two pieces of      the lower  jaw, one weighing six pounds,
containing two grinders and the cavities for two others ; and
a larger, weighing twelve pounds, with one whole and three
broken teeth.         Each tooth had four roots, and was       as large
as the foot     of a bull ;  and they were petrified, and   of the co
lour of gun flint.

   5. A head of a humerus, as large as a man's head.
   6. A femur, five feet long, and three feet round at the
top ; the trochanters were wanting.     The neck had neither
the length nor the obliquity of a human femur.
 , J. A tibia,  nearly four feet long, and more than two feet
round at the bottom.
   8. An astragal, different from that of domestic animals.
   9. Lastly, a calcaneum, which had facettes below for the
scaphoid and the cuboid, but the posterior apophysis or tu
berosity of it was not so strong as that of a man.
  This posterior extremity was certainly that of an elephant;
there is no other large animal, the astragal of which resem
bles that of a man so much as to be mistaken for the hu
man astragal ; but the teeth cannot be those of an elephant:
that animal never has so many, nor have they any roots. It
appears, therefore, probable that elephant and rhinoceros
bones    were     buried
                    promiscuously            together in the place
where the above bones were found.

tions    of   these     become more reasonable.

elephant's jaw has been  described by M. de la Tourette  in
the ninth volume of Savans Etrangeres de I'Academie des

the Rhone, and 80 feet above the level of that river, in a
gravelly soil mixed with flint.

and five feet deep, in a volcanic mass*.

a remark on this position,       which   he carefully examined.

 found       in very good preservation : but even these stone*
 have never yet been found     in the matrix in which they had
 been formed.          It    is easy to explain why             the Europeans are
not permitted          to penetrate           of the country
                                           into the interior
belonging to the king of Candy, where the high mountain*
are from which the rivers flow that furnish the precious
gems; but even if access were permitted, still great difficul
ties stand in the way              of any       researches.      These difficulties
principally        arise     from        the great strength           of vegetation
through all the island. The mountains are every where co
vered with thipk woods, which it is almost impossible to
penetrate,    NO crevices or breaks whatever are any where
to be seen,   which may direct the mineralogist in his re
searches.   Nevertheless, it may not be altogether impossible
to discover  some naked crevices, which, when well exa
mined, may lead to the discovery of the gems in their ma
trices. The Candians themselves, however, will never sub
mit     to the risks and trouble experienced by those who                        work
mines of precious stones or metals, and they content them
selves with raking them up at great expense in the beds of
currents, after the rainy season.

         SIR,
 X have carefully perused the folio treatise on the Theory of
 Music, he by Mr. William Havvkes, published in 1805 by
  Clementi and Co. of Cheapside, which you obligingly sent
 me a few days ago ; which, though it may prove a useful
 work to theoretical musicians, contains little of novelty,
  except iu engraved examples, but what is to be found in
  an   anonymous pamphlet, price 1 s. (perhaps from the pen
  of the same author), entitled A Treatise on the Theory and
  Practical System of Music, published by Cawthorne in 1 798.
 The object of both of these works is,                to recommend a tem
  perament of the diatonic scale on                  keyed   instruments,    as
  organs,         harpsichords, piano- fortes, &c, in which each
  ascending fifth is flattened by one-Jifth of a comma as the
  instrument is tuned, except that the fifth above b £ and the
                                                                         fifth

                                                                  why
  these  anomalies    in the system  are introduced  I am at a loss to
 guess, especially as * G is thereby made -f c the worse by it.
     It is to be lamented by those       who study the philosophy
 of musical sounds, that among the various ways in which
 musical intervals can be expressed, no one mode ha.s yet
 been generally adopted by the writers on this subject,         parti
 cularly by those who treat on the temperament,          or deviation
 from truth and nature, which is necessary tor adapting th.ex
 harmonic intervals to our imperfect instruments and com
 mon notation       of music, wherein only     12 intervals of sound
 are admitted in an octave;       and this occasions the necessity
 to the student, on the appearance of every new scheme of
 temperament, for reducing the intervals resulting therefrom
 to some one standard or measure, before he can. compare or
judge of its merits and defects. Among the several ways of
expressing these intervals, none is so general, or convenient,
 as the logarithms of their corresponding ratios ; and, in order
to save the readers of Mr. Hawkes's Treatise, and of your
Magazine, a repetition of the trouble which I took in 1798,
as also     to compare      this with the Stanhope temperament,

    The       established         practice of musicians in reading the mu
 sical notes upwards, makes                it more convenient , in co npuiing'
and using tables like the above, to     follow the Sa-ne order |
which     the reason that the title of 1he table is at bottom
              if.
instead of the top \ and it is to be read, and its intervals Beck
oned, upwards. It is necessary here to remark, respecting the-
4th and 3th columns entitled the Diatonic System, that thit
term has too frequently been restricted by authors to th*
ratios set against the notes C, D, £, F, G, A, B and c, re*
spectivelyl while others, who were writing on a tempera
ment of the scale, have introduced ratios answering to * C ',
b   E,    *   F,     *   O,   said    b   B   i    these in      the   above      table   consti
tute the chromatic octave, example No. 4, in Mr, Hawkea's
treatise.  But the student must not be surprised, on looking
into different authors who treat on the scale of music, to
find the finger-key    tC bearing a ratio of -{-£, or even -fa ;
b E £, or §3-; * F   ; * G        ff                f
                             ; and * A $, or -ft., instead of
those in the above table, and yet to find the same denomi
nated diatonic intervals                  ;       because,    on consulting          Maxwell'*
Essay         on Tune,        a   work     of great merit, printed in Scotland,
(which was advertised                     in 1 794, and a few copies vended in
London, with a spurious title-page                                and date,)        will find

that 56 notes or intervals, at the least, are                               required in each
octave of the diatonic system to render modulation into each
of the twelve finger -"keys, major  and minor, practicable with
out false intervals,  or such as a good ear would pronounce to
be out of tune.      Indeed, the diatonic system, when limited
to the seven notes, C, D, E, F, G, A, and B, has but little
of the perfection in practice, which is usually ascribed to it ;
for, except in sounding the notes E, F, G, and A, with their
fundamental note C, if the base note moves into D,E,F,G>
8cc.,        be found that the harmonics marked in the piece
         it will

JM.R. Bonnycastle              has for several years been well           known    to
the public, as the writer of various useful elementary works
on mathematical topics and one of those treatises in par
                                   ;
ticular, we mean that on astronomy, displays so much
chasteness and propriety of style, as to rank its author
among the most elegant scientific writers of the present
times but we conceive noue of his publications will tend
        :
                                                                                  ti

  so  fully to establish his reputation as a mathematician, and
  to exhibit his dexterity in analytical investigations, as the
  work now before us.         Convinced as we are that the higher
  parts of the doctrine of trigonometry are admirable instru
  ments in many philosophical researches, and especially in
  those which relate to physical astronomy, we trust we shall
  be benefiting many of our readers by introducing            this va
  luable performance to their notice.
  •
     The work is preceded by an introduction          of twenty-eight
  pages,   containing   a judicious, though concise, history of the
  principal writings relative to trigonometry.             The loga
 rithmic anil algebraic rules for all the cases of plane trian
 gles, whether right or oblique, and a great variety of practi
  cal examples, several of which are wrought out at length,
  occupy about seventy pages.          These are succeeded by the
  doctrine of spherical trigonometry, and its application to
  astronomical problems, comprised in two hundred pages.
  The distribution of this      part of  the subject is as   follows   :
  General properties     of spherical triangles ; on the ambiguous
 cases    of spherical triangles ; the affections and other pro
 perties of right-angled spherical triangles ; solutions              of
  the six cases    of right-angled     spherical triangles, by -con
 struction, by calculation, and instrumentally ; a similar di
 vision with respect to the six cases of quadrantal triangles ;
 and,   a similar one relative to the six cases of oblique-angled
 spherical triangles ; logarithmic and analytic solutions of
 all the cases    of right-angled,     quadrantal, and oblique-an
 gled spherical triangles ; miscellaneous problems for exer
 cise; application to the solution of astronomical problems;
 tables   of right ascension, &c. useful in      the preceding solu
 tions ;    and,   miscellaneous astronomical       problems.     This
 part of the work cannot fail to be of the highest utility ; for
 in  the exhibition of the general rules of spherical trigono
metry, the author has struck into the happy medium be
 tween the fatiguing prolixity of most writers on this branch
 of the subject, and that abstracted analytical process by
 which Euler, Gua, Lagrange, and others, have deduced all
the practical theorems         from one fundamental       formula  l  a
.process   which, though it     is so conducted as to be both gra-

  tifying and serviceable to the advanced mathematician, is not
  in our opinion perfectly calculated for the initiation of a stu
  dent, at least in the present state of other branches of ma
  thematics in this country.           Besides this, there is a very im
  portant advantage        in exhibiting the algebraic formulae as Mr.
  Bonnycastle has done, together with the logarithmic rules ;
  because by properly attending to the signs (-f and — ) of
  the various expressions for the sines, tangents, &c., of arcs
  or of angles, and particularly by adopting those formulae
  which furnish results in cosines, or cotangents, or the tan
  gents of half arcs, or tangents of 45°+ half arcs, or angles,
  every ambiguity which would otherwise arise on the resolu
  tion of spherical triangles may be kept clear of, except
  those which appertain to the two cases that are necessarily
  ambiguous : even in these two cases the student may pro
  ceed without difficulty by attending properly to this author's
  observations at pp. 77i 78, 79. Had he, indeed, inserted in
 his work, Bertrand's table, given by Lacroix, to which he
 refers in a note at p. 79, a table which, though it com
 prises all the possible varieties of these two cases, does not
 £11 a page, there would have been little or nothing wanted to
 render this part of his treatise complete.
     After    the doctrine    of spherical trigonometry, Mr. Bonny-
 castle treats     of the mutations of the signs of trigonometrical
 quantities      ; and then presents, in fifty-four pages, a most
 copious       and   interesting collection of trigonometrical for
mulae,      relating to what is usually termed the arithmetic of
 sines and cosines, the values of sines, cosines, &c. in terms
of circular arcs, &c., and vice versa, exponential quantities,
 logarithmic       series, the series for logarithmic   sines, tangents,
 see-in its,   &c.     This part of   the work alone is sufficient     to
stamp its value, did not every other part bear evident trace*
of the same hand.
     The demonstrations of the principal            theorems in plane
and spherical trigonometry,           made use of in the earlier part
of the volume, succeed the trigonometrical formulas ; and
these are followed by demonstrations of the leading theorems
in   the stereographic projection        of the sphere, — some miscel
laneous problems relative to spherical areas,           —solutions    of-
                                                                      all

sines and tangents of arcs and angles, — the solutions of
quadratic and cubic equations by tables of sines and tan
gents, — and rules for the admeasurement of altitudes by the
barometer and thermometer.
   Such are the principal topics discussed in the volume be
fore us : our mathematical readers will at once see their va
lue and importance.    We could have wished that some of
these had been treated more at large ; especially the different
kinds of projection, and the application of the fluxions of
trigonometrical quantities to astronomical and other pro
blems ; and we should also have been gratified to see the de
monstrations accompanying their respective rules, instead of
being separated from them, — and to find no theorem, whe
ther simple or complex, but what was demonstrated. We
are, however, aware that all this could not be comprehend
ed in a single volume ; and we therefore hope the present
edition will experience the encouragement it so richly de
serves, that Mr. Bonnycastle may be enabled in a future
edition to extend the utility of his performance, by making
the additions we now suggest.     Taking the work, however,
as it   is,
         we think            by
                        far the best on trigonometry that has
                        it
yet been published in the English language      and we are
                                                        ;
conscious, that in recommending this treatise to general fa
vour, we are equally discharging an act of justice to the
author, and of service to the public.

      On  the 13th the right honourable        Sir 'Joseph Banks, Bart,
   president, in the chair, the     reading of the lecture on mus
   cular motion was resumed.          Mr. Peirson     entered into a long
   and rather amusing detail      of  the relative heat and pulsations
   of animals in different latitudes, with a view to ascertain
   their effects on the muscles.        In this country, he observed,
  horses pulsate 36 times in a minute, cows 48, and men 72 ;
   in Lapland    and the northern provinces       of Russia, men pul
  sate only from 45 to 50 times in a        minute.       From these ob
  servations on pulsation, however, no positive conclusion
  relative to its effects on muscular power could be drawn. It
  appeared,    indeed, that all excess        either   of  heat  or cold is
  immediately followed by       a  sensible diminution of this pow
  er ; and a fellow of this society is so affected by swimming
  in water only 10 minutes, that it occasions such a prostration
 of muscular power, as cannot be completely re-established
 in 24 hours after. Mr. P. made numerous experiments on
 the muscles of frogs, in all of which he found the muscular
 irritability completely    destroyed     by plunging them in water
 at the temperature     of 96°: electricity, after such immersions,
 sometimes gave slight symptoms of excitability, but no hu
 man effort could ever again restore the muscular fibre to
 its proper tone and vigour.         Cold produced precisely similar
effects on the muscular       fibre, by instantly destroying its ir
ritability. Here Mr P. observed that great care was necessary
in applying warm water to the surface of bodies recently
immersed in water in cases of suspended respiration, as the
heat might be equally as bad as the cold,             with   regard to its
effects on the muscular       fibre, which he considered in some
degree the organ of life.         Blood,    he alleged,    was    essential
to life only as a necessary      stimulus to muscular irritability;
and the abstraction      of blood occasioned death, not from de
stroying the continuity of that fluid, but from the want of
its great stimulating powers to the muscles. The effects of
laurel water and the vegetable poisons were next examined.
A small quantity of laurel water was thrown into the sto
mach of a frog : it occasioned instant death, and on exa
mining the stomach, it was found               that the muscular mo
tion of this most important organ              was   totally    destroyed.
                                                                      The.

The            irritability, or rather sensibility, of the sto
        excessive
mach, indeed, accounts     for the instantaneous and fatal effects
of poison,         as a blow on that organ immediately destroys
life, whilst       the heart can support a wound for some days.
All    vegetable poisons, it appears, act by destroying the
irritability'* of the muscles, or the power of the muscular
fibre. The word power he defined to be the appellation of
an indefinable quality inherent in muscles, as magnetism in
steel or electricity in the torpedo.  This definition is per
haps worthy the attention of the northern professors who
have said so much about the term power.
   Nov. 20. The president in the chair. — The reading of
the Bakerian Lecture, " On some chemical effects of Elec
tricity," by H. Davy, Esq. commenced. The preliminary
«xperiments related chiefly to the production of fixed alkali
in water by means of a powerful Galvanic battery, having
the positive and negative wires inserted in different ino-xi-
dizable vessels containing distilled water. From these ex
periments           obvious, but very important, fact resulted ;
                 a very
namely, that even distilled water is never chemically pure,
but that it still retains frequently both vegetable and animal
matter combined or dissolved in                it,
                                    and always nitrogen gas
or some salt.     Hence, after reapeated experiments, ho
found that electricity did not generate fixed alkali, as sup
posed      by   I'acchiani, but only evolved it.   " Water," observed
Mr. D.,          " when chemically pure        state which at present

     Nov. 13. Sir H. C. Englefield, bart. vice-president, in
  the chair.— *A letter was read from -             .       Boydell, Esq.,
  on the antient use of the word burgh or borough, and tha
  modern signification of this term, which has been applied
  to a castle or fortified town.          The real meaning of this       ap
  pellation    was   illustrated by     a  reference to, and local       de-i
  scriptions of, several places now bearing this particular             ter-,
 mination, as Peterborough, Harborough, Loughboroligh,                  &c.
 Jt   was   alleged    that the word burgh, signifying borough,
  castle,  or declivity of a rock, was derived from the Saxon )
 but when applied, as it often was, to designate low marshy
 tracts with slight elevations, it had its origin from a Gaelic
 word, signifying a flat country on the banks of rivers or
 estuaries.    Instead, however,      of having    recourse  to the Gaelic
 for  the significations     of names     used in countries where that
 language was certainly never known, it is much more ra-i
 tional to conclude that the term signifying the banks of
 rivers, &c., is from the Anglo-Saxon burn or bourn, whence,
 probably, the names E.istbouru, VVoburn, Sherbourne, Red-
burn, 80..        The term bury is evidently of the same origin
 as  burg, although not noticed by this writer, whose letter
was so controversial, declamatory, and dogmatical, that it
was     sometimes        very   difficult    to  comprehend      his   real
meaning,
     Nov. 20. Craven Orde, Esq., vice-president, in the chair,
.— Several     letters were read froin J. H. Thornton, esq. and
others, relative to some barrows or tumuli which were opened
last October in Gloucestershire.             Drawings of these barrows
were exhibited ; they occupied an extent of land from 40
to 55 yards long, and from 1 9 to 30 yards broad each, and
contained several kistraens which presented nothing singular,
                                                                    except

except that    of their being of an oval figure, and composed of
calcareous stones, some of which were 14 feet long, and
would weigh about five tons. In one of these kistraens eight
skeletons were found, the bones of which were sufficiently per
fect and entire, but were deranged inthe act of opening. Others
of the kistraens contained one, two, four and six skeletons,
in  general   all of them well preserved ; and a jaw-bone con
taining   all  the teeth white and perfect, was submitted to
the inspection of the society. In one of the most distin
guished kistraens sonic things, resembling the beads worn by
the savages in the South-sea Islands, were found in a posi
tion as if they had been suspended round the neck of some
of the bodies. From this circumstance, as well us the oval
figure of the kistraens, it was conjectured that these tumuli
must have been erected prior to the invasion of Britain by
the Romans, and at a period when the people were in a
state almost totally savage.

   At   the meeting      of  the Institute,     on the 7th   of July last,
M. Cuvier,       the perpetual     secretary,    read the  following ana*
lysis   of  the labours      of  the   class   of physical and mathe
matical    sciences,     from   the 20th    of July 1805 to the first
of July iboii.
   The productions of nature have such an intimate con
nection with the climates which produce them, and are so
essentially modified by the variety of climate, that no branch
of natural history can make any solid progress without a
correct acquaintance with geography : thus the latter science
ought to be cultivated as assiduously by naturalists as by
astronomers.        We know well how much we are indebted
to naturalist      travellers ; and     M. Olivier has given us new
 proofs of their utility in       a topography of Persia with which
 he has presented us.
   He    describes    the   chains   of mountains,      the course of the
rivers, and he explains the nature of the productions by
that of the climate.         The almost absolute aridity prevents
any   more    than   a  twentieth    of this vast empire from being
 cultivated.      Whole provinces       have not a single tree      which

to the countries which remain to be discovered.
     There       is    another kind       of conjectural geography, which
endeavours            to determine       the antient state of countries                      by
what we observe in them at present.
  M. Olivier with this view has examined what truth
there was   in the communication said to have formerly
existed between the Black Sea and the Caspian.    He thinks
that   was in fact formed on the north of the Caucasus,
      it
and that    was the heaps of earth formed
                it                             the waters of            by
the Couban,         the Volga, and the Don which interrupted it.
     As    the    Caspian has not since then received from the
rivers which            fall into   it    enough of water to allow for its
evaporation,           it   has always     lowered its level, and  at prei-       is
sent 60 feet lower than the Euxine.
     It   was in this manner that     separated itself from the
                                                    it
great     lake Aral, and left uncovered those immense plains
of   salt sand which surround                  it   to the north and the east.

testimonies of this antient extent of the Caspian Sea and of
its communications with the Euxine and with the Aral, and
has collected them into an elaborate           memoir,     which he ha«
presented    to this class    and    to that of history      and  antieut
literature.
    The antients attributed the separation of the two former,
and the great diminution of the Euxine itself, to the rup
ture of the Bosphorus, which they supposed had caused the
deluge of Deucalion; the Euxine being thrown                         with
violence by this aperture over the Archipelago and Greece.
 Some of them even thought that at this aera the Mediterra
nean, suddenly augmented by the same cause, had broken
 through the Pillars of Hercules, and formed the streights
 which unitelt to the great ocean.
    But M.Olivier        thinks     that  if the Euxine had     ever been
 higher than at present, it would have naturally found art
 outlet by the plain of Nicea, and the other valleys which
 lead to the Propontis         and the Archipelago ; that, at all
 events, the strait channel      of   the Bosphorus could        not have
 furnished enough of water to inundate the high mountaini
 of Greece, which are more elevated than any on the shores
 of the Euxine, and far less could it have produced a sensi
 ble effect upon the immense expanse of the Mediterranean:
     He is of opinion, therefore, that the stories of the an
 tients in this respect, have their foundation neither in ob
  servation nor in tradition, but merely in conjectures which;
  the physical situation of the places entirely reverses.
     It is not  less true that the part       of the Bosphorus nearest
  the Euxine   sea   presents   traces   of volcanic revolutions,      but
  the rest  of its extent   is a natural valley    : it is the same with.
  the Hellespont.
     Some other researches tend also to show the utility of the
  alliance between the sciences and erudition.
     M.   Monges, upon the occasion of two mill-stones being
  dug up near Abbeville, collected together all the passages in
  the antients relative to the stones of which they made their
  mill-stones.     It results,  that they were almost always made
  of poroub basaltic     stones   :  those dug up at Abbeville being
                                                                     made

    M. Desmarets having examined the vestments interred in
an old tomb at the abbey of St. Germain-de-Pres, disco
vered that almost all the processes           at present   employed in
 weaving our different stuffs were known so far back as the
 tenth century : from this he takes occasion to explain in a
new manner the passages in Pliny upon the weaving                of the
antients.
   The position, the nature,       and the boundaries of a country
being   once  clearly   ascertained,   it then belongs to descriptive
natural history to make known its productions ; and the re

ence have been very      productive. —The        botanical  department

   The Flora of New Holland, by M. de la Blllardiere, and
the magnificent Description du Jardin dc la Malmaison, by
M. Ventenat, have arrived at their loth number each. The
Flora d'Ovare      et de Benin, by     M.   de Beauvois, is at its 5th
number.      A   fifth volume has appeared of the Botaniste
 Cultivateur,   of M. Dumont-Courset : and M. de Lamarck
has given, in conjunction with M. Decandolle, a third aud
greatly enlarged edition of the Flora Franfaise.
   M.   dc la Billardiere    has made us more particularly ac
quainted   with   six  new  genera of New Holland.
   The three first arc ranged naturally among the myrtles,
& very numerous family in New Holland, and from which
medicine and the arts       may derive an advantageous use, on
account of the aromatic oils furnished by the trees and shrubs
belonging to them.
   The first genus, named pileanthus, is very remarkable for
an envelope of one entire piece which incloses every flower;
the petals  of the latter   are five in number       ; and the calyx is
divided into     ten equal stripes;       the   fruit contains  several
feeds.
   The   second     has  received    the name     of calolhamnus, on
account   of  the elegance     of the flowers,      the numerous sta
                                                                  mina

       of which    are supported on a large filament divided          into
two at each extremity, while the two other filaments are
barren? the fruit is quite similar to the metrosideros.
   The third is named calytri.r, and is known by its tubu-
lous calyx above the germ, and divided into five parts, each
terminated by a long bristle.            The capsule only contains
one grain.
   The fourth     has received the name of cephalotus, and be
longs  to  the  rosaceous   tribe : the species named JoUlc ularia,
is perhaps still more remarkable than the saracenia and the
nepenthes, by the form of some of the leaves, which repre
sent very distinctly a purse full of shoots, surmounted by
an opercutum edged by crotchets directed towards its inte
rior.
   The fifth, named actinotus, has all the appearances of *
plant of the family of the cor y ml ifera, although in reality
it belongs to that of the umbellifera.             The two stigmata are
Dwelled   out  towards   the   top,   and  are    surmounted   in the in
ternal side by a bristle, which gives them the appearance of
the antennae of insects, as in the lagoecia: it has only one
seed.
   The sixth, named protanthern, belongs to the numerous
family of the labiatai.       The calyx is formed of two entire
divisions ; the largest    of which inclines towards the other,
and covers it as soon      as  the corolla has fallen,      A   thready-
like appendage issues from below each of the ahthcras. The
fruit is the same as that of the prasium genus; but it It
very remarkable in this family, that the embryo or corculum,
is inclosed in a fleshy and thick albumen, while in the other
I'diata hitherto observed, it is uncovered.

     At the meeting of the above society, on the 5th of April

 double refraction of the rays of light by means of gypsum.
 M. Haiiy,     and still more recently M. Brisson, had observed
 this property, but not with sufficient accuracy : in general,
 the surfaces were not parallel to each other; the angle they
 formed,     and   the direction     taken by the images, were not
  carefully determined.
     M. Bucholz communicated            the results  of his researches
 upon the seeds of lycopodiurn.          His experiments present the
 following results :
     1.  These seeds contain        a sixteenth part   of  a fat oil of a
 brownish yellow, and soluble in alcohol.              2. A portion of
 real sugar.     3. A viscous extract of a brownish yellow, and
 an insipid taste.       4. The residue, after being treated with
 alcohol and water, may be regarded            as  a  peculiar product
 of the   vegetable   kingdom.       5. The yellowish aspect of       the,
 seed in this latter state indicates the union of a species            of
.pigment with       the   first principle of the seed, or at least a
 very intimate union of the constituent parts of this seed.

 seed occasions its lively combustion,         and its constant sepa

      XXXII.      Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
           PROGRESS OP VACCINATION             IN FRANCE.
 JL HE central vaccine committee           of Paris on the   1 2th of
July  last made their report upon the exertions made in France
for  the propagation     of vaccine inoculation, during the last
twelve months.       The number of individuals vaccinated iu
42 departments       during that period amounts to 125,992,,
which gives a total of nearly 400,000 for all France ; and by
supposing, as in the former year, the number of births at
1,088,157, it follows that a third at least of the infants born
last year in France have been vaccinated.
   Numerous tests have been tried in order to ascertain the
preservative  effect  of vaccination ; and whether inoculation
for the small-pox     was resorted    to, or an intimate and habi
tual commerce between small-pox and vaccine patients, and
the latter also subjected to the influence of variolous epi
demics, and even when all these three kinds of proofs were
united together, the small -pox never had any effect upon
those who had gone regularly through the vaccine infection.
The most important        result of the report of the committee'
is the certainty of    the progressive diminution of mortality
wherever vaccination       was introduced,      and the increase   of
mortality in those places where vaccination was neglected.
   New and fortunate experiments have been made upon the
manner of simplifying still more the insertion of the matter,
and also the best means of preserving the infectious sub
stance.
   The central committee        have not confined themselves       to
the human     species   alone in their inquiries.      They endea
voured to ascertain if vaccination introduced among sheep
would preserve them from the scab. They found, however,
that it is more advisable to inoculate these animals with
scabby matter than to vaccinate them, although            the latter
process was often completely successful.
   The report concludes with        the names    of those who have
distinguished   themselves     by  iheir zeal in promoting vacci

 Mount Athos. Cronstadt has also a very good school for
 the Walachians, with three professors.
    Austria. — A school of philosophy has been established
 at Bruix in the circle of Saatz in Bohemia.                Besides the
 university     of Prague,    the   kingdom     of  Bohemia   has seven
 other schools of philosophy and theology, the chairs of which
are filled by ecclesiastics.
    The Austrian government is more and more                   persuaded
that it is not so much necessary to punish crimes             as   to pre
vent their commission by removing the causes of the evil.
    As crimes have been more frequent in the Bannat and in
the countries of Transylvania inhabited by the Walachians,
seminaries of education, and schools of theology and phi
losophy, are established in these districts.

  recapitulation, &a -
A propose, in this fourth part, to clear up                           some   article*
that     I   could not give with            sufficient extent in the pre*
ceding without removing               one    object from another, which
when brought together mutually render each other more in*
telligible.
   One of those         which      most requires to be explained is the
motive force.
  This part of my watch, perhaps, may to some persons'
appear neglected : it has no fusee ; nor have I used the me
thods which Messrs. Leibnitz*, Hookf, HuygensJ, Sully §t
Harrison     and others, have applied to render the magnitude
              ||,
of the vibrations, and the force which maintains them, con
stant.       According     to this method, the watch has, we
                                                           knowi
two motive forces       ;   of which one that only moves the last,

being successively stopped^ or put at liberty means of any       by
detent, becomes foreign   to the regulator.
I      answer, that         by
                             supposing these methods to possess
any advantage,         nothing would prevent their application to
my chronometer;           they     are   known          to men   of    science    and

  Ig4               Le key's Memoir        on the best    Method
  artists, and the public have been in possession of them for
  a long time.
     I might have copied the able gentlemen just now cited/
  if I had thought them necessary, or even favourable for my
  machine; but various experiments,                  and  the   following     rea
  sons, have prevented me from making use of them.
      1st, This method renders the machine more complicated,
  and of more difficult execution; it requires, besides the com
  mon constructions, a detent, a spring, a wheel, or a fly, &c.
  whose adjustments are difficult.               There are also few work
 men capable of executing these in such a way as to be cer
 tain.      They augment, says ]VL le Roy, the friction ; and the
 risks of stopping are greater in proportion to the number of
 pieces.       But    if  there    are found so many inconveniences             in
 remontoirs*         applied to clocks        whose size is arbitrary, and
 besides     are made to remain in a temperature that varies very
 little, on land, and in cities where we find workmen to re
 pair them; what may not be objected against this- practice
 in works whose size             is confined, destined besides to receive
 continual motions,            to be removed into all climates, to ex
 perience the extremes of different temperatures, and to be al
ways either at sea, or in places destitute of skilful workmen ?
     With regard to the fusee, I only think it useful in watches
where the vibrations of the regulator are not isochronous,
 and where it is necessary that the balance, when stopped,
should be put in motion by the motive force.                          I think it
would       be superfluous           and even    disadvantageous in mine,
-where      the very powerful regulator makes its vibrations iso
chronous       :   in  effect, it does not remedy the losses of elas
ticity of the         main     spring, nor the clogging of the wheel-
work : besides, when the vibrations of my balance aTe so
nearly equal in duration that they are isochronous, the fusee
    * It is usual in clocks to place a wheel underneath the barrel round which
fhe cord is wound       that sustains the weight.   This barrel has the liberty of
turning in a contrary direction to its usual motion in the clock. To the bar
rel is attached a rachet and click, which prevents it from turning the way it is
drawn by the weight, and of course the weight can therefore only descend by
the motion of the whole train of wheels that give action to the clock.        This
contrivance is called a remontoir by the French artist*.     Sea Alexander, TraiU

Would not become the less useless if we wound up                        the rna*
chine at the same hour; which it would be easy to confine
eurselves to, There would not even be a difference at all
Sensible     in   the arcs   of vibrations,    if    we wound it up every
twelve hours        ; and in the twenty-four          hours the difference in
the arcs actually amounts to but one-sixth.   This fusee*                             '
whose inutility in my watch appears to me evident, would
besides be disadvantageous: it would complicate the ma
chine,      and render it more
                           subject to stop, by the breaking
of the chain ; the watch could not go when winding up (ait
indispensable thing in a watch where two seconds is a con
siderable object) without having recourse to complicated
methods,               part defective, especially in the pre*
                  the greater
lent case, where nothing can be too simple for sailors.
  The omission of the fusee gives likewise to my watch A
very essential property, which it would have been deprived
of by the methods of Messrs. Leibnitz, Sully, Harrison*

lished and thoroughly hard : three days afterwards this plats
was worn at the place of the pivot; the arc of vibration was
considerably diminished ; the freedom of the balance, con
sequently, very much altered; and the accuracy of the ma
chine destroyed.               I
                     substituted for the steel plate a polished
agate, and the same effect again took place.  Lastly, to see
whether when the weight of the balance was diminished ofi
the agate the wear would not cease, I replaced the suspen
sion wire,         I    its upper extremity to a lever, and I
                       attached
put weight
        a     on  the other  arm of this lever* so that the ba
lance, exceeding the weight a little, rested very gently on
the plate of steel or the agate.   Notwithstanding this pre
caution, the freedom was again very much altered by this
slight friction ; the plate and the agate both wore, although
much less than before; whence arose the inconveniences
above mentioned.                   It

sary in these kinds of works that the regulator should be
suspended by a harpsichord wire, as the foliot was formerly
by two threads of hemp or silk.
    In      the first attempts             which       I   made    with this machine,
nearly twelve years ago*, instead of using a harpsichord
wire to suspend       used   it,
                              piece of thin narrow spring.

watch         of this suspension spring,               spiraland   to   omit   the
spring  but : soon perceived that to approach isochronism
                   I
nearly,  woulditbe necessary that this regulating and sus
pending spring should be very long; this would render the
machine very unwieldy in ship. At last    arrived at the iso

  renienccs.    It was at first difficult to be" assured that the spring
 was sufficiently straight, and that the balance was attached in.
  such a manner, that its weight acted in a line along the middle
  of the breadth of the spring throughout its whole length :
  without    this, hdweveri it produced a very disadvantageous
 friction, and a difficulty in each vibration.             Moreover, the
 weight of the balance was not sufficient \o stretch this spring
 perfectly ; it was hardly possible for it not to be bent a little
 in some part of its length        : these curvatures     diminishing by
 shocks and heat, or augmenting by cold, there arose irre
 gularities difficult to prevent. Lastly, the distance at which
 the elastic   force acted, being only equal to half the width of
 the spring, the least differences which might happen in the
 situation of this spring, whether by the small play of the
 balance in its holes, or by other causes, could not but have
 some influence on the manner in which it acted ; this does
 not happen in the spiral spring, which acts always at a con
 siderable distance from the axis of the balance.
    All  these inconveniences are prevented         by the harpsichord
wire   : it is so small that     it  can have but little influence on
the vibrations     ; it may be made much shorter            ;  it is exactly
stretched, and without curvature throughout its whole length ;
and being round, we may be certain, at first slight,                 that all
 its parts agree with the axis of the balance.
    To this it     may also    be added,    that, by the operation         of
drawing the wire, we are assured that the substance of which
it is composed is homogeneous and pliant, such as it ought
to be for this suspension.
    I have    said it is necessary     for the wire    to be fine   :  expe
rience has proved to me that without this it would require
to be very long,      which would render the machine cumber
some.      Having    taken to suspend      a balance     a thicker     harp-,
sichord wire, of about four inches long, I remarked that the
motion of the regulator lost with the greatest readiness until
it  was   reduced     to describe only four or five           degrees,   anil
then it remained        as long a time in motion as if it had been
either very long     or  very small ; whence I concluded that the
motion is not lost so readily in a large arc, that because the
parts touched they formed an obstacle in some degree insur-

 one against the other ; whence it is evident, that, a suspension
 spring being necessarily much more extensive in its width
 than a wire in its size, it can but be very long, and conse

them to have any foundation        would be necessary for this

     The friction on the pivots of the rollers which contain the
"balance of the new watch       almost nothing
                                        is        for the follow      ;

                :                                                                             a
 little play in their holes; whence          happens that, when

these rollers describe          a     very small arc, their pivots only rest
pn the edges of their holes without rubbing.       To receive
the full advantage of this, and to have besides more free
dom,    aless resistance on the part ol" the air, &c.,   have                        I
only   rendered       the arcs      of vibration          as great         as   the effect   of
shocks appeared to me requisite to be prevented. Each                                        vi

Wast advantageous.            I       could not have increased                  the number

         On the compensation          for  the effects  of heat and cold.
     According to           the   Gazette du Commerce,           and   the report
 signed Ludlam,            sent to the Academy,        to remedy the irregu
 larities produced          in   marine    watches   by heat and cold, Mr,
 Harrison uses a bar composed of two thin pieces of brass* and
 steel, two inches in length, riveted together in several places,
fixed at       one end,      and having at the otlitr two pins across,
 through which passes the balance spring.                 If   this bar remains
 straight in temperate heat (as brass receives more impression
from heat than steel), the side where the brass is becomes
 convex by heat,          and the steel side     becomes    so by    cold.   Thus
  the pins,       one  after another,      fx  the parts     of   the spring ac
 cording        to  the different degrees of heat, and lengthen or
 shorten      it;   w hence follows the compensation for the effects
 of heat and cold.
      If I   had     known this ingenious method before                 I thought-
 of my thermometers, probably I should not                         have hesitated
  to have made use of it in my machine.
      I  considered some time whether                I should not give it the
  preference.         I even made some attempts with thistview. I
  shall speak       of  them presently J but, after having thought of
  them seriously, and after having put aside, aa much as I
  could, that prejudice which we have in favour of our own
  productions, my thermometers appeared to me preferable'.
  The following are the reasons which induced me to judge
  so   :
      The first, which would have prevented me from making
  use of it without some considerable change, was, that by
  Mr. Harrison's method the regulating spring does not re-

  express   copper ; but in   Mr- Harrison's pamphlet it is   trass ; we have there

main always of the same length, which I have proved, Arti
cle III. Part V. to be absolutely necessary : likewise, when
I endeavoured to compensate the effect of heat and cold by
pieces   of brass and   steel, riveted together as              Mr. Harrison's,
I   endeavoured not to change the length of the spiral, but to
make    a considerable part of the circumference approach or
recede by this means         from the centre of the balance.                  For
this purpose I used a balance (fig. 4 and 5. Plate I.) com-r
posed of two semicircles, eich formed of a piece of brass
and steel, united as in Mr. Harrison's thermometer piece.
   The effect sufficiently answered my intentions : 1 even
observed, by means of the index i, which was moved by
similar pieces II (fig. 2. and 3. of the same plate), that by
heat a,nd cold the motion of these pieces would follow very
exactly the motion of the thermometer : there resulted from,
this a compensation for heat and cold, whose effect might be
increased or diminished at pleasure by putting a greater or
jess mass at the extremities of these semicircles ; but by this
construction the balance does not appear to me to have suf
ficient solidity : besides, in the different degrees of heat and
cold, it would be difficult for it to preserve its equality of
.weight in all points of the circumference.    Lastly, having
exposed   the machine, provided  with this regulator, to a heat
of    35 degrees   * of the thermometer,                 after having replaced
it in    a   common
                 temperature,               I   saw that it would advance
about six seconds in 24 hours      this appeared to me a con

   I  think it ought not       to exceed much the size    of a varia

   This watch in itself     is of a sufficiently small size; but it
Appeared      to me, that to  give greater security to all the parts,
to put them more out of the way of rust, of excess of heat
of short duration, and other accidents which may happen in
a ship,     it would require a case; and it would be right that
all the parts of suspension, as well as the watch, should be
shut up in a strong box with a lock.           Besides, to diminish,
the effect of shocks, it would be necessary, as I have ex
plained Article VIII. Part III., that it should be stopped in.
its motions      by  the cushions, which can hardly be adapted
but to the sides     of such  a box.

    After having explained the principles which have directed
me in the different parts of my work, being the fruit of
twenty years researches and labour, I shall attempt to show
that by means of it we shall have the best measure of time

    The following is the way       I prove it:
    It is evident by the first part,that this measure of time must
 consist in the most advantageous application of the balance
»nd its spiral spring to the clock ; that is to say, in a watch
perfected as much as possible. To prove, therefore, that we
 are arrived at the best measure of time at sea, it is necessary
 to show that we have used the best methods to perfect the

     I think it  proper to add a word or two here on pocket
 watches, which may accompany the marine watch ; they can
 never be so perfect, on account of their small size, which
 would not permit all the resources to be used which we have
 applied in our watch for the diminution of friction, &c.                      I
 believe, nevertheless, we may          render    them more exact: 1st,
 By giving     to the vibrations     of the balance     a more perfect iso-
 chronism, by the method explained (Article III. Part IT.*):
 2dly, By compensating the effects of heat and cold by an
 expedient similar to that which Mr. Harrison has made use
 of in his time-keeper f: 3dly, By applying a dead escapement
 where the friction is much less than in the cylinder, &c.
 I do   not here propose the detent escapement, because a watch
 appears to me too small for us to apply this mechanism
 easily to it. That of M. Sully, where the wheel is perpen
 dicular to the plates, being perfected, appears to me the
 most proper to procure this diminution of friction.                    I have
 finished several watches in this way : for this purpose I have

      THE following is the opinion given of this watch by the
  French Academy of Sciences at their public sitting the 5th
  of April 1709:
      "  The Academy has adjudged the prize to the memoir
  which has for its device Labor improbus omnia vincit, and to
  the watch that accompanies this memoir.                     The author of
  both of them is M. Le Roy, clock-maker to his majesty.
 The rate of M. Le Roy's watch, observed at sea in several
 voyages (one of which was from the coast of France fo New
 foundland, and from Newfoundland                 to  Cadiz)    has appeared
 In   general sufficiently regular to merit this reward for the
 author, the principal intention of which is to encourage him
 to new researches ; for the Academy must not dissemble,
 that in one of the observations which have been made on this
 watch,      it  appeared,    even while on land,        to gain rather sud
 denly 11 or 12 seconds per day : from which it appears that
 the desired degree of perfection has not yet been obtained."

  J.  HE fossil elephants        of Belgium      have been long      known.
In     the   16th century Garopius Becanus             combated the pre
judices     which    attributed   to giants   the  large fossil bones for
merly found in the neighbourhood of Antwerp; and he men
 tions the bones of two elephants dug up near Vilvorde, in a
 canal which the inhabitants of Brussels dug from that city
to Rupelmondc, to avoid the trouble attending the convey
ances by the canals        of Malincs.
     John Lauerentzcn, in his edition of                the Museum Regis
Danice      of Jacobaeus, parti.       .* 1. no. 73, relates the history
of a skeleton which Otho Sperling saw dug up at Bruges
in 1643, the thigh of which is preserved in the above cabinet.
It   is four feet long,      and weighs 24 pounds.

 tertation     "   Upon the Revolutions pf the Surface of the
 Globe," published at Haarlem in 1787, says that he pos
 sesses an elephant's tooth found in Brabant.                    He adds, that
 a very large fossil head of this kind was dragged out of a
 river two leagues from Louvain by some fishermen.
    The pretended bull's horn, so long suspended from one
 of the pillars of the cathedral of Strasburg, is merely a fossil
tusk which had been formerly dragged out of the same river.
    In general, the whole banks of the Rhine swarm with
 these bones.
    In   the canton        of Basle, in Swisserland, they also abound.
    The landgrave of Hesse Darmstadt's cabinet has a lower
jaw of great size, found near Worms.
    There is a particular dissertation of Charles Gotlob Steding
 upon the fossil ivory in the environs of Spires.                     It repre
 sents a jaw of thirteen distinct lamina;, weighing three
 pounds and         a  half, and      was    found four feet deep,        near a
 fragment of a tusk of four pounds weight.
    Merk mentions a cranium found near Manheim,                          a  plate
 of which exists          ; but   I cannot procure a sight of it.             Its
two jaws weighed 200 pounds.
    M. Hammer possesses a tooth dug up in an island of the
 Rhine opposite Manheim, and a fragment brought out of
 the Rhine near that city.                 M. Gmelin, ah apothecary at
Tubingen,         has a lower        jaw found in the Rhine           also near
Manheim.
    Germany is certainly the country where the largest quan
tities of fossil bones have been discovered ; not, perhaps, be
 cause it contains more than any other country, but because
there is not       in the whole empire any district which does not
 contain some learned man capable of collecting and publish
ing whatever is remarkable.
    Every body knows the history of the elephant discovered
at Tonna, in the country of Gotha, in \696, and which,
has been described            by Tentzelius and Hoyer *.

  160       Memoir upon living and fossil Elephants:
     A  second skeleton was dug- tip in     1 799 about 50 feet fro'rri
  the place where the former had been found        :  M.  Baron Zach^
 upon this occasion, gave a circumstantial          description of the
  toil, to which we shall resort in order to give the details of
  the discovery.
     There are two places called Tonna (Graeffen Tonfia and
 fiurg Tonna), both      situated  in the valley of Unstrut, below
 Langensal2a,     and to the right     of Salza and UnstrUt.       All
 this valley, like most of the low valleys in Thurineia, is
 filled by horizontal layers of a tender calcareous sandstone^
 which     contains bones, deers' horns, impressions of various
 leaves which are thought to proceed         from the aquatic plants
 and trees   of the country, and shells which apparently belong
 to the helix slagnalis, and other fresh-water shells.           This
sandstone in some places resolves into a marly sand, which
has been employed for this century past in manuring land*
It is partly obtained by subterranebus and irregular trenches l
those of the commune of Burg Tonna are 4O; 90^ and 6O
feet below the surface.
     The workmen find, from time to time, elephants' bonei
and teeth, and the bones of the rhinoce-ros, animals of the
stag kind, and that of the tortoise.
     These depdts of sandstone are mixed alternately with
others of clay^ where these bones are also found, although
more rarely.
     The two skeletons of      1696 and 1799 were       found 50 feet
deep.
     Of  the former   there  was   collected   a femur weighing 32
pounds l    and the head   of the other femur    as large as a man's
head, and weighing nine pounds; a humerus four feet longj
two spans and a half broad ; vertebrae, ribs ; the head with
four grinders weighing twelve pounds each, and two tusks
eight feet long : but a great number of these pieces were
broken.
    We shall not detain our       readers by giving an account      of
the disputes occasioned by this discovery.           The medical in
habitants of the country, when consulted by the duke of
Gotha, unanimously declared that these bones were lusus
naturae,    and supported their opinion    a  by several pamphlets :
                                                                  but

but Tentzel, the librarian to this prince, thought differently;
he compared each bone, taken separately, with its analogous
bone in the elephant   of that period, such as it was in the
description  of Allen Moulin, and by some remarks of Ari
stotle, Pliny, and Ray; and showed the resemblance.      He
went further, and proved, by the regularity of the stratum
under which this skeleton was found, that it could not be
said that it was interred by human hands ; but that it must
have been brought there by some general cause, such as the
deluge has been represented.
  The second skeleton, that             of 1 799, was in a compressed
and crooked position        :   it occupied a length of 20 feet ; the
hind   feet were near the        tusks.   The latter were 10 feet long*
They   were tender, but entire ; their cavity easily admitted a
man's arm. A part only of the lower jaw of the head was
preserved, and the two largest grinders. The greater part of
the other bones and the ribs were broken as they were
detached from the soil ; but larger or smaller portions of all
the bones were found.     The rellulous parts of them were
filled with crystals of spar.
    The corona of one of the grinders was nine inches long,
by three broad ; its height was six or eight inches ; an entire
tibia was two feet four inches, and six or eight inches in
diameter : a head of a femur was six inches in diameter.
   At a small distance, and in similar strata, stags' horns
were found,      or what is called the fossil elk ; and at Bcell-
stadt, a neighbouring      village, some rhinoceros' teeth were
found.
    The valley of Unstrut             has    furnished       fossil elephants in
several other places       of   it,
                           particularly                 a   tusk, weighing    IS    I
pounds,              long, near Vera.
             and 10 feet
  Another place, not less celebrated than Tonna for th«
number of fossil elephants, and bones of other strange ani
mals which       it   has furnished,        is   the little town     of Canstadt*
 in the kingdom          of Wirtemberg, upon the Neckar.                            The

    philosopkico-pyrotechnicus, 8ec. Francfort 1705.
     I   am indebted to the friendship of M. Atitenricth, pro
    fessor of anatomy at Tubingen, and of M. Yaegery keeper
    of   the cabinet     of natural history    at Stutgard,        for    a   still more
    circumstantial account of the above discovery.
       These two gentlemen have still the bones before their
    eyes they know the place where they were found
          ;                                          and they             ;
    are in possession of the proces-verbaux which were drawn
    «p at the time of the discovery.
      The spot    on the east of the Neckar,
                    is                                        about       a   thousand
    paces beyond the town           nf Canstadt, on        the     side   of    the vil
    lage  of Feldbach.  Riesel says that there are the remains of.
    an antient wall there, eight feet thick, and eighty round                         it,
    which seems to have been the inclosure of fort or temple  a                       ;
    and, in fact, some more remains of the same description are
    to be seen.    Spleiss concluded that these bones were those
    of such animals    as were sacrificed    but they were, for the
                                                ;
    most part,      by
                   far  too deep for this supposition    besides, they
                                                                  :

    that can be concluded from their abundance within this in
    closure   is,
                that they have been once before dug up in great
    quantities in that neighbourhood, collected together  some                 by
    curious people, and again covered  over,              i

    ings of five of the latter, which appear to me to be fresh
    water shells.    This clay fills the various cavities of the cal
    careous  hillocks in regular rows, and these hillocks are in
    terspersed with larger ones of      reddish marl.

   These marly hillocks sometimes present us with petrified
plants and beds of coal, and their summit is covered with
old marine petrifactions, such as ammonites, belemnitcs, &c.
   It was a common soldier who first remarked some large
bones above the ground       in April 1700.     The reigning duke
continued digging     for them   for  six  months, and such bones
as were most entire were carefully preserved.         The remains,
being a prodigious quantity, (for, according to Reisel, there
were more than sixty tusks,) were sent to the laboratory to
be employed as fossil ivory.
   The   bones   themselves    were   without any order, for the
most part all broken ; some few of them were as if they had
been rolled about.     There were whole cart loads of horse
teeth, and there were not bones in proportion to the tenth
part of these teeth. The elephants' bones seem to have been
uppermost, and the others buried lower.            In general, they
were never found deeper than twenty feet.           A  part of them
were entangled in a kind of rock formed of clay, sand, flint,
and ochre, agglutinated together ; and the workmen were
obliged to have recourse to gunpowder in order to separate
them.
   The elephant bones still in the royal cabinet at Stutgard
consist of the following pieces ; viz. part of an upper jaw
with two parallel grinders ; two upper fore teeth almost en
tire, and fragments of two others : the enamel on the used
part of the teeth was, as in almost all fossil teeth, slender
and"  thin ; four upper back teeth ; two lower teeth ; a very
crooked tusk of five feet and a half long, and another four
feet and a half, measured on the convex side ; fragments of
several other tusks ; pieces    of vertebrae and ribs ; four shoul
der blades, and pieces of some others ; a piece of a hamerus',
three cubitus; six nameless bones of the right side, and
seven of the left, for the most part incomplete; four heads
of femurs   ; three femurs without       the heads ; a rotula ;  two
tibias.    There is also, at an apothecary's in the same city,
a lower   jaw and a portion of a tibia.
   These bones are accompanied in the cabinet with plenty
ef bones of the rhinoceros,         the hysena, and animals of

the horse      kind,   the stag,    the ox, the hare, and     small car
nivorous animals.          Some very large epiphyses of vertebrae
might incline us to think they were of the cetaceous class
of animals. There are also some fragments, of human bones,
to which     I shall recur.      Unfortunately,    the different depths
at which      each bone      was found were not accurately enough
ascertained     ;  neither were the bones       which   were    found in
the entrenchment          mentioned by Reisel, sufficiently        distin
guished from those found out of their limits.
    Canstadt is not the only place in the vale of the Neckar
where similar discoveries have been made.
   Near    the village    of Berg, above Canstadt, there is a sin
gular mass        of calcareous earth which consists of nothing
else than incrustations of aquatic plants : I have often vi
sited this place myself,       and I learn from    M.  Autenrieih     that
he found       a fossil skeleton      of  a horse  there.    In   1745    a
tusk of fifty pounds weight was dug up in the same place ;
and M. Jceger found a lower jaw four years ago.
    About eighteen months ago there was found, very near the
walls of Stutgard,        upon digging a cave, a considerable part
of  a large elephant's skeleton,         two large tusks and a smaller
one, in reddish and blucish clay.
   The narrow valley of the Kocher, near Halle, in Suabia,
furnished some tusks in 1494 and 1605; the latter discovery,
which     is still   suspended     in the church     of Halle, weighs
500 pounds.         An inscription below it informs        us that there
were    a great     many very large       bones found near it.      A fire
having destroyed one third of this city in 1728, upon dig
ging the new foundations plenty of fossil ivory was found,
and in particular a tusk seven feet and a half long.                     A
grinder, from the same place, is represented in the Museum
 Closteriannm , fig. S.
    All the valleys of the great rivers in Germany have fur
nished fossil bones,       as well  as the places we have    mentioned.
 In  the valleys of    the Danube, and through all        Hungary, they
particularly abound.

 1722 at    Tide, in    the valley   of the Ocker, between Wolfen-

drawing of    a jaw-bone    found   at the same place.
    In 1742 there was an entire skeleton discovered by Dr.
Kcenig, at Osterode, at the foot of the Ilartz, and at the
same place    where  a  shoulder-blade and       a radivis of a rhino
ceros had been dug up in 1773.
    In the valleys of the Elbe, besides the entire skeletons of
the vale  of Unstruth, mentioned above, we find the nume
rous collections of bones at Esperstxdt, in the county of
Mansfeld, between Halle in Saxony, and Querfurt, and in
the vales of the Sa!a.      It is very remarkable that some part
of them was found in a quarry of hard stone, as if the ani
mal had fallen into some crevice.
    Some fossil bones have been also lately found at Dessau,
upon the Elbe, and at Potzdam, at the confluence of the
Havel and the Spree.
    As far as concerns the valleys of the Oder, we may con
sult the Silesia suliterranea of Volkman, who speaks of a
humerus suspended in the church of Trebnitz, a femur in
the cathedral of Breslau, and of a pretended giant dug up at
Liegnitz on digging     the foundations     of the church, the bones
of. which were distributed       through the different churches of
 the country.
    The banks of the Vistula in Prussia and Poland, although
 much less examined than those of the rivers of Germany,
 also furnish us with fossil bones,       which have given rise,     as
 in other countries,   to stories    of giants. The banks of the
 Dniester also supply great quantities of these phenomena ;
 and in 1 729 great quantities were found near Kaminiek.

XXXV. Memoir            upon a Process employed in the ci-devant
    Mafonnais of       France, to avert Shou,ei-s      of  Hail, and to
    dissipate Storms.      By M. LESCHEVIN, chief Commissary
   for Gunpowder and Saltpetre at Dijon*.
IT    is more than five-and-twenty years since the considera
tion of the mischief produced hy storms accompanied with
hail,' induced several philosophers and friends of huma
nity    to   ascertain the method of averting this destructive
plague.       The celebrated coadjutor of Buflbn, M. Guenaut
de   Montbeillard, thinking that hail        is only formed after vio
lent claps of thunder, suggested, in          1776, the establishment
of a   great  multiplicity of conductors, which, by drawing off
the electric fluid, would       prevent the explosion of thunder
bolts, and the consequent formation of hail.               His memoir,
in the form of a letter to M. Guyton Morveau, was read by
the latter to the academy of Dijon, and will be found at
length in the Journal de Physique, tom. xxi. p. 146.
M. Montbeillard, in support of his opinion upon the causes
of hail, brings forward      the observations      of the first-rate na
tural philosophers, and suggests the most scientific andoeco-
nomical method of executing his projects.
    This circumstance induced M. Guyton              de Morveau,         who
never     allows any opportunity to escape         of being useful,        to
investigate the theory of the production of this meteor. He
seconded the philanthrophic views of his fellow-countryman
by developing this theory in an excellent memoir, published
in the Journal de Physique for January 1777, p. 60, by the
title of, " Letter of M.de Morveau to M. de Montbeillard
upon the influence of the electrical fluid in the formation, of
hail."
    Some years afterwards, M. Buissart, of the academy of
Arras, without knowing any thing of M. Montbeillard's
work, read a memoir to that society on the various advan
tages    that might be derived from a multiplicity of electrical
conductors or thunder-rods.             This memoir will also be
found in the above journal, vol. xxi. p. 140.

    Although     these various works had called the attention            of
the public administration        and  of the affluent landholders to
this important subject ; and although, since the first publi
cation of the ideas of Messrs. Montbeillard, Guyton de Mor-
veau, and Buissart, innumerable disasters caused by hail in
various parts of France had demonstrated the extreme utility
of the measures proposed, or of any other more efficacious
or simple which might be suggested ; yet not a single land
owner, that we know of, has to this day put in practice any
method to avert this plague.
    In   an interesting    memoir,    presented    to the Academy        of
Dijon,      an 11,  by   M. Denize, member of the            learned   So
ciety    of Ma£on,    and   containing inquiries      upon the means
of dispersing storms aud preventing hail, we find a curious
account of the custom, established in several places, of
firing off powder-boxes on the approach of storms, in order
to prevent the production of hail.           This account, however,
was not accompanied with any detail upon the process,
nor even with the name of those places where it is prac
tised;     and the schemes       proposed by     M. Denize        appeared
to the academy        to   be accompanied      with    too    much diffi
culty in their execution : his memoir, in which all the phae-
nomena analogous to his subject are presented with much
clearness, and explained according to the principles of sound
 philosophy, excited much interest, but did not meet with
that degree of attention it seems to deserve.
    I   learned   accidentally,   some time ago, that the process
 indicated by M.      Denize is in use in most of the communes
 of the ci-devant Maconnais, and that            a part   of   the  mining
 powder which I send into this district of the department of
 Saone and Loire, is employed for the purpose of dissipating
 storms and preventing hail.          The desire of ascertaining such
 an interesting     fact induced me to profit by my connections
 with that department, in order to procure circumstantial de
 tails upon this process, and its analogy with the principles
 established in the memoir of M. Denize; and the conclu
 sions he draws induced me to revise his memoir, and to exa
 mine the various methods he suggests           to check a hail storm
 in  its  birth.
                                    O  3                      M. Denize,

 814                Process to avert Showers          of Hail,
     M. Denizc, after having examined the history of antiquity                 j
 to ascertain if the anticnts knew any thing on the subject,
 concludes, if they did, that they have left us nothing instruc
 tive on the subject.           Among      the moderns he finds no other
 practice resorteii to than that of ringing the church bells;
 and he observes, with great reason, that this method of avert
 ing   a storm may be regarded as purely superstitious, and as
 affording no physical preventive whatever.
     The author then proceeds to an examination of the pro
 cess resorted       to  of exploding gunpowder; a process, as he
 says, only adopted within tltese few years, and the adoption,
 of which he ascriBes to two causes : " On the one hand, tha
 suppression of the ringing of bells since the revolution ; on
 the other hand, some observations which lead us to think
 that the commotions excited              in the air by considerable dis
 charges      of artillery    are sufficient     to prevent hail ; storm*
 being far less frequent, or at least very moderate, in the
 track of camps or armies*."
    The investigations I procured to be made taught me, that
 so far from       the suppression of bell-ringing haying had any
influence in encouraging the gunpowder process, the latter
has been in use for upwards of five-and -thirty years in one
of the communes of ,thc ci-devant Ma^onnais, as I shall
afterwards demonstrate.               I shall    add    to  the  observations
which       appear    to  M. Denize to be        the   second cause of the
adoption of the above method, a               fact which convinced me of
the influence exercised upon dense clouds by strong and reite
rated explosions.           I was led personally to make this remark
at Grenoble, where there is a school               of artillery established.
    The fiky      was pure      and   serene,    when about nine o'clock
in the morning numerous clouds began to extend over all
the valley in which Grenoble is situated, and covered the
mountains by which             it is bounded.        The instant the dis
charges      of  the   field-pieces    commenced,         between nine and
ten o'clock, the clouds opened away before us, and the sky
resumed its serenity.            They did not again collect until the
exercise of the guns was finished.

  Nest follows in           the above      memoir the indication   of   the
only preservative against hail, suggested by naturalists, being
the establishment of a multiplicity of thunder rods.
   Before entering into the detail of the new methods he
submits to the judgment of the learned, M. Denize pro
ceeds to lay before them the results of his own observations
upon the formation of hail.  It will not be out of place to
follow him in this branch of his subject.
   I think we may thus state the principles upon which the
author's opinion is founded :
   The elements \vhich enter into the composition of storms
are, the atmospheric air, water, electricity, and caloric.
  Water dilated by caloric             is formed into vapours, and be
comes   specifically lighter than the atmospheric air; it
ascends, and carries with it a quantity of electricity propor
tioned to the capacity it has just acquired.
  If    the air in which these vapours are suspended is of a
temperature lower  than  theirs, they condense, by the disen
gagement of their caloric, into clouds inure or less thick.
   Under this new form, their dimensions being diminished,
they contain a superabundant quantity of electricity, which
they may get rid of by communication either with others or
with the earth by means of conductors ; but alter a time they
will   be less electrified,     if,   bytraversing some streams of air
abounding         in   caloric, they resume their former state of dila
tation.
  It   from the contact of clouds variously electrified that
       is
storms are produced, the electric fluid darting successively
from one cloud to another in order to obtain an equilibrium.
   As the author explains the formation of drops of rain
during storms, and afterwards drops of hail, in        manner a
peculiar to himself, that   to say,
                                  is            by
                                        referring their forma
tion to the concussion  occasioned, in the atmosphere of the
clouds      by   claps of thunder,     I   shall quote his own words on
the subject
  "
                 :
     As soon as the thunder begins to explode in the heart
of the storm, the explosion shakes every part of the sur
rounding air, at the same time that   suddenly riitiiini*l,c>
                                                 it

2 10                  Process to avert Showers       of Hail,
its density. This concussion occasions violent vibrations in
the smaller molecules of the air; consequently it detaches
from them the heaviest    humid particles, and forces them
mutually to approach each other.  They unite in virtue of
their attraction, and they are immediately precipitated in
drops      of rain,   the size   of which   is proportioned to the quan
tity of particles of water which             have    been   united to them
during their fall.
     "It is generally at this moment that the formation of
hail takes place."
  The theory of the author for explaining the phenomena
that successively take place during a storm, is precisely the
same with      the theory ascribed to the same phenomena by
M.     Guytoti de Morveau in his above-mentioned memoir.
     The following, according         to M. Denize, are the characters
according to which we may              judge when it is time to put in
practice the preservative processes :
     "From the moment that the thick and obscure clouds
begin to accumulate, if we perceive that violent and impe
tuous winds tend to compress them the one against the
other, and to condense them strongly, and as soon as we
hear the thunder roaring in the middle of these clouds, and
when they appear isolated in the air, and not communi
cating with the earth by means of any mists or undulations,
it is then that the danger threatens, and we cannot too spee
dily establish                    and energetic conductors
                      the most powerful
between these clouds and the surface of the earth."
   I think we may class under three divisions the methods
recommended by the author for dispersing storms : and it
seems to me that, although he has followed no order in the
indication of these methods, they may be reduced to the fol
lowing three propositions :
  1 . Excite in the air strong commotions                capable   of shaking,
if   we may use the expression, the particles of waier adhering
to   it,so as to produce an abundant rain.
   We may attain this object                by
                                   the sound of great bells,
the reiterated noise of guns or drums, &c.;      the detona   by
tion of the fulminating powder, and     the explosion, in the
                                                    by
                                                                       middle

                    and to dissipate Storms.                217
middle of the clouds, of rockets directed     towards the place
where the clouds are thickest.
    2. Establish energetic conductors between the clouds and
the earth, either by fires lighted from distance to distance,
and kept burning by supplies of dry substances, or by the
disengagement of humid vapours, or the combustion of re
sinous matters.
    3. Draw off the electric fluid, which is in superabundance
in the clouds, by a multiplicity of thunder-rods.        As the
storms in our country are accompanied by the east and
south-east winds, it would be proper to establish in every
canton, on those sides of their horizon, these conductors,
which might     be placed  both on elevated places and on high
trees  : this consideration would lead to the multiplication or
large trees in the above quarters, and immense advantages
would consequently result in respect of the increase of fire
wood.
    Such   is the succinct    analysis of this memoir,    which
evinces that its author is a philosopher familiarised in the
explanation of the grand phenomena of nature : it belongs
 to learned men and enlightened ministers to decide how far
 the means proposed are practicable in the country, and com
 patible with the security of the inhabitants and the princi
 ples of a good government. To the hopes held out in this
 memoir, that one of our greatest earthly plagues ma}' be suc
 cessfully averted, the unhappy reflection is added of the
 dreadful accidents that may arise from the inconsiderate
 employment of most of the preservatives recommended by
 M. Denize.      However    that may be, it seemed to me to be
 interesting to lay the above analysis before my readers pre
 vious to giving the details of the process employed in the ci-
 devant Maconnais for preventing storms.
    It was at Vaurenard this process originated, 35 years ago.
 The marquis de Chevriers, a naval officer, retired upon his
 estate at Vaurenard,    having often witnessed the ravages oc
 casioned by hail, and recollecting to have seen the explosion
 of guns resorted to at sea in order to disperse stormy clouds,
 resolved to combat this plague by an analogous method.
                                                             Fur

  618         Process to avert Showers    of Hail, &c.
  For this  purpose he made use     of boxes of gunpowder, which
  he caused   to be fired  off from the heights on the approach
  of a storm 5 and his attempts had the happiest effects: he
  continued until the period of his death, which happened at
  the commencement of the revolution, to preserve his lands
 from the ravages of the hail-storms, while the neighbouring
 villages frequently experienced their baneful effects.           He
 consumed annually        about 200 or 300 pounds of mining
 powder, which was furnished to him from the magazine at
 Mag on.
     The inhabitants of     the communes where the marquis de
 Chevricrs's estates were situated, convinced, by the experi
 ence of a great number of years, of the excellence of this
 practice, continued to employ it. Their example was imi
 tated by the surrounding communes ; and the practice gain
 ing ground, it   is at this moment in use in the communes         of
 Vaurenard,     Iger,   Aze, llomamiche,       Julnat,  Le Torrins,
 Touilly, Fleury, Saint Sorlin, Le Viviers, Les Boutteaux,
 and many others. The largeness of the powder-boxes, their
 charge, and the number of times they fire them off, vary
 according to circumstances and the position of the places.
 In  the commune      of Fleury they make use of a mortar which
carries   a  pound of powder at a time ; and it is generally
upon the     heights, and before the clouds have had time to
accumulate, that they make the explosions, which they con
tinue until the stormy clouds are entirely dissipated. Ac
cording to the account given me by the keeper of the maga
zine at Macon, the annual consumption of mining, powder
for this purpose is from 400 to 500 kilogrammes.
    The extension of thjs process for      these   some  years past,
and the success with which it has         been constantly accom
panied, makes it desirable that it should be more generally
known wherever hail-storms extend their ravages.              It be
longs to the learned societies to propagate, by premiums and
experiments, a practice by no means so costly as to produce
inconvenience, and which from its simplicity of execution
is open to every country inhabitant.

XXXVI.        On Canal Track -Boats.           By ROBERTSON BIT-
           CHANAN, Esq- Civil Engineer,             Glasgow.
       DEAR     SI.,
 WHEN       lately   in Ireland I made a short excursion on the
Grand Canal, which joins the Liffy with the Shannon.                   I
was much pleased          with   the arrangements and punctuality
observed    with    regard   to the canal packets, or track -boats.
The accommodation on board            and at the hotels tor the use
of  the passengers     does very great credit to those under whose
care the whole is conducted.
   The construction of       the vessels,   both with regard to their
general plan and the mechanical contrivances connected with
them, seems to me to merit the attention of those who take
an interest in what relates to the improvement            of our inland
navigation.       I am   therefore   induced    to lay before you the
following details t
   The general appearance of         the vessels is like that   of those
on our canals, but the number of passengers and the length
of the voyage require additional accommodation ; an idea
of which may         be formed by inspecting       the  accompanying
sketches, although not accurately drawn to a scale.
   Fig. 1. (Plate V.) is a sketch of the plan of the vessel.
   A, the principal cabin.
   B,  the second cabin.
   C, a board which is occasionally raised up to prevent
the water from the sluices from filling the vessel; an acci
dent which      I am informed      once occasioned the sinking of
one   of these vessels and the loss       of many lives, and which
probably gave rise to this improvement.
   Fig. 2. is a stern view.
   DD,    are pieces    of  plnte iron  which     are let down, when
necessary,    to retard   the vessel's  motion,     and  are frequently
pf great use in entering the locks.
   E,  the cab-bouse        or cooking-place, tne smoke-pipe of
which seems well contrived to prevent the bad effects of the
wind.

trivance is applied to the cabin stove, and                  I  should think
might, with equal advantage, be applied to dwelling-houses
in situations where eddy winds are apt to occasion smoke.
    But what attracted most of my attention was the manner
in which the track-rope is attached to the vessels ; and which,
I am    informed,      has prevented     many dangerous accidents, to
which they        were    formerly    liable.   There is a contrivance
by which it may be instantaneously disengaged by a kind of
trigger, a plan and profile of which are sketched in figures
4. and 5.
    I,  represents     the end  of the track-rope.                ,
    K,   a pin firmly connected with the frame, which is boited
to the deck above the cabin.
    KL,     a  lever, the end   K of which     preponderates,       and is so
formed      as to  allow the loop on the end of the track-rope I,
to remain on the pin K, while the horses are pulling pro
perly forward ; but should any accident occur, and endanger
 their being dragged into the water, all that is necessary is
for a person to put his foot on the end L of the lever; which
end    being thus depressed makes the end K to rise, and
along with it the loop of the track -rope is raised, which,
getting to the top of the pin K, is instantly disengaged.
    These contrivances (figs. 4. and 5.) are placed one on
each side of the roof, at HH, so as to leave the roof of the
cabin quite free and safe for the use of the passengers ; and
here seats are placed, where they may enjoy the air, and the
beautiful scenery which so often presents itself in the pro
gress    of  the voyage.
                                I  remain, dear sir, yours, &c.

                  known by the Katne       of Turquoise.                  S21
upake gems ; others, on account of their blue or green co
lour, have ranged them among the ores of copper.
    "  The turquoises,"         says   M. Chaptal*,         "   are merely
bones coloured by the oxides of copper.                The colour of the
turquoise     often   passes    to  green,   which    depends on the al
teration of the metallic oxide : the turquoise of Lower Lan-
guedoc gives out        a fetid smell on the action of (ire, and is
decomposed by the acids ; the turquoise of Persia gives out
no smell, and is not attacked by the acids. Sage supposes
that in the latter the osseous part is agatised."
    Plenty of turquoises are found in Persia, and none in
Turkey,     as the   name    would     incline   us to believe    :  they are
                               f
dug out of two mines ; the one is called the Old Rock,
three days' journey from Meched, to the north-east, near
Nichabourg;        the other is five days'       journey from Meched,
and is called the New Rock.               The turquoises of the latter
mine are     of a bad blue inclining to white ; and they are sold
at a very low price. Since the end of last century, however,
 the king of Persia has prohibited all digging at the Old Rock
except on his own account ; because the Persian goldsmiths
 work only with the file, and do not understand the art of
 enamelling upon gold, and therefore they make use of the
 turquoises of this mine for decorating sabres, poniards,
 and other pieces of workmanship, in place of enamelling
 them.      They shape the turquoises into flowers and other
 figures, and then insert them into enchasements.
     I shall add some       other details extracted         from different
 works, and for which            I am indebted to the politeness of
 M. Haiiy,      the celebrated     mineralogist.
     Turkis (Turquoise) , Reuss, p. 511, part ii. vol. iii.             " The
 turquoise has been always regarded as the tooth of an un
 known animal, the sky-blue colour of which arises from
 the oxide      of copper,    and according to some from the oxide
 of iron   :  this has caused      it to be classed      in  the calcareous
 as well as in the     coppery order      of bodies,     as an   animal pe

S22                   Analysis of     the Sutstance
schqft in Boehmen," vol. ii. p. 112 and 119, thinks that
the turquoise is a product of art : he relates that a tooth,
found in the environs of Lissa, in Bohemia, having been
exposed to a violent fire under the muffle of an assay fur
nace, was converted into turquoise : he strongly recommends
the precaution of increasing the fire gradually, so as to avoid
causing the tooth to fly off in splinters.
     Bruckman                    history of every thing
                  has given a complete
which has been written upon turquoises from the days of
Pliny to those of Lommer : he names Mount Caucasus,
about four days' journey from the Caspian Sea, as the native
place of turquoises, where there exists, according to Char-
din,          of them. They are also found in Persia,
       a quarry
Egypt, Arabia, and in the province of Samarcand.
  Dombey brought some of them from Peru ; a few con
tained native silver.
     The turquoise of the western world is found in France
at    Simore in Lower Languedoc, in Bohemia, Silesia, and
Hungary.
  Demetrius Agaphi, who visited the place where the tur
quoises are found near Chorossan, in the neighbourhood
of the town of Pischpure,       relates,     in the fifth volume of the
Nordiscfien Beytreege 1793, p. 26 1, that turquoise is found
in a stone as a matrix, in fragments and small pieces, and
that it ought to be regarded as a particular mineral, which
lies in the same beds as the opal, the chrysoprase, and the
resin-formed quartz.
   M. Bruckman, in Crell's Journal de Chimie 1799, vol. ii.
pages 185 to 189, according to the account of its situation
in the mine     at Chorossan,     according to the analysis of
                                and
Lowit/, thinks that the turquoise is not a purification of
the parts of animals, but a particular mineral.
  Lowitz produced from          it,     by
                                    means of analysis,   ;rood     a
deal of argil,  little copper and iron
                  a                      but he found no lime
                                              ;
nor phosphoric acid *.
  According to Meder,        the oriental       turquoise   is   found in
 *
 I    fcnow not whether the substance analysed by M. Lowitz ought to be
considered as turquoise, or rather as
                                    a particular mineral.Jam inclined to
think was the latter, as always found, in the turquoises examined, both
       it               I                               I

                                                             a   primitive

                    knoum by the Name          of Turquoise.               223
a  primitive argillaceous schistus of a blucish gray or grayish
black colour, which excludes all idea of petrifaction                :  in the
same place graphic schistus and quartz are found                     :  in the
argillaceous schistus the turquoise is disseminated through
itl it is the same with it in the quartz and graphic schistus.
    In order to remove every idea of the turquoise being re
garded as a malachite or green copper (kupfergrun) , Meder
has given the         following character of it:
    Its colour      is the grayish green      of the celadon apple: whea
the turquoise begins to soften in the acids, it is decomposed,
and    assumes        a  mountain green colour : when entirely de
composed it is of a yellowish greenish white, and even straw
coloured.
    It  is generally met with           disseminated in small scattered
fragments, and rarely in a large mass; it is dull interiorly;
its fracture is compact, the fragments indeterminate, with
sharp edges, opake when it - is decomposed, and more or
less translucid         at the    edges ; it becomes      softer and softer
according        to   the  degrees      of decomposition, and latterly
becomes      brittle*:      its specific gravity, according to Kirwan,
is from 2-500 to 2-908.
    The turquoise in the mass is sometimes mixed with earthy
oxidulated copper (ziegelerz) of a brick red.
    M.    Meder thinks,        according to all these characters, that
the turquoise ought to be placed between the opal and the
 apple-green chrysoprase, with which it seems to agree the
 most.
     Lastly, the celebrated Cuvier, in the Journal de Physique,
tome lii. p. 263, thinks that the turquoises which are found
 near Simore in Languedoc, and near Trevoux, are cupre
 ous teeth of an animal which resembles that found at the
 river Ohio, or the mammoth of the English and the Ame
 ricans, the carnivorous elephant.
     M. de Reaumur is the only person who                    has given any
 details   upon      the mines      of turquoise,    and the nature      of the
 substances       found in them.      .
    * The turquoises arc not all of an equal hardness : this may be attribut.nl
 U, the difference   of the osseous substances which serve as their b.i?e. The
 degree of petrifaction of these bguei ought also to have an influence upon
 their hardness.
                                                                           His

   824                   Analysis of     the Substance
     His memoir is printed among the proceedings of the
  Royal Academy of Sciences for the year 1715.                   We may
  therefore consult his observations for every thing that re
 lates to the position      of   the mines and     the  extraction of the
  turquoises.
 ^   As to the experiments made by M. Reaumur with the
 view of depriving them of their colour, although not alto
 gether conclusive, yet it will be useful to mention them
 here,   as they are     connected with the means         I resorted to  in
 order to ascertain the nature of the turquoise.            I shall there
 fore present       my readers with that part of           M. Reaumur's
 memoir.
     "  The colouring matter," he says, " which fills the cel
 lules of the turquoise, and which tinges the whole stone, is
 certainly a distinct substance. But is it a simple mineral
 substance like cobalt, or the substance of which azure and
sapphire are formed, and which give such a fine blue colour
to china and earthen-ware;              or is it a metallic substance?"
This is     a question which I have not been able to resolve to
my     own    satisfaction.
     " I supposed at first that our turquoises derived their co
lour from copper, this metal yielding a blue and a green co
lour; but       I  saw   that we might discharge the colour from
them     as   we   do from coral     : of all the solvents I tried, di
stilled vinegar succeeded best with me.              If a thickish piece
of turquoise is      steeped   for  au hour   or two  in this vinegar, its
corners become white,           and in two or three days all the sur
face   of   the stone, and even        almost all its interior,   assumes
the same colour.
    "   The vinegar,      besides taking     away the colour, also dis
solves the stone,       which     is always covered      with a kind of
white cream        composed of the particles which had been de
tached from it.         Citron juice also dissolves these kind of
stones, but it only weakens their colour ; and that part
which     is below the sort of cream above mentioned is blue
when the stone has been steeped in this juice.
    " As    to aqua-fortis and aqua-regia they are not proper          for
extracting      the   colour   from our turquoises : they dissolve
vtry speedily the whole substance of the stone ; but they
                                                                   supply

                 known by the Name        of Turquoise.             225
supply us with a method of distinguishing the turquoises of
Persia from those of Europe. Aqua-fortis docs not act upon
the Persian ones ; whence it follows, that these two kinds
of  stones,   although similar in appearance, are nevertheless
of a very different nature: it would be wrong, however, to
draw an inference disadvantageous            to our turquoises from
this circumstance,      or to think them more hrittle.
   "  Aqua-regia, also, acts differently upon these two sorts
of stones.     It entirely dissolves the European, and reduces
the Persian to    a kind of paste whiter than the stone itself
was, but which, however, is not deprived of all the blue
aolour.
   "   In general, these stones have a singular fault; their
colour changes through time, without any solvent : their
blue colour imperceptibly assumes shades approaching to
green; and they latterly become entirely green; while the
colour of all the other precious stones is unalterable. VViim
the turquoise has become green, it is no longer of any va
lue; for it is not yet the fashion to esteem this stone when
it becomes green."
            Chemical Examination         of  the Turquoise.
   Physical Characters. — Specific gravity,           3- 127-   Colour,

than glass;      very  difficult   to pound; its powder is of a

   Chemical Characters. — Exposed to the blowpipe it loses
its colour and becomes          of  a grayish white, but does not
melt.     Heated in   a  platina   crucible   it assumes the same co
lour, but becomes friable and is easily reduced into powder.
   In this experiment it loses six per cent, of its weight. The
nitric and muriatic acids        dissolve turquoise emiiely.       The
solution    made    by the muriatic     acid is yellow ; that by the
nitric acid is colourless.
   The nitric solution presented the following phienomena:
   1. With lime water, a white flaky precipitate.
   2.  With ammonia in          excess   the    precipitate was of the
same colour, but more abundant.             The liquid     above it ac
quired no blueish tint.

    We      see  that these preliminary experiments already give
an    approximate knowledge of the constituent parts of tur
 quoise, but they are not sufficient to lead us to a regular
 classification of it    ;   for which reason, out of a large quantity
 of turquoises,     I made choice of such as were highest coloured
 and hardest, and       I   submitted them to the following experi
 ments    :
    A.    100 parts   of turquoise       reduced into powder were in
 troduced into      a  small retort, and 300 parts of nitric acid at
 36° were poured upon them.               In a short time a slight effer
 vescence took place, which continued until the solution was
 completed.        The gas was collected by the hydrargyro-pneu-
 matic apparatus, and it presented all the properties of car
 bonic acid gas.
    B. This nitric solution         is white, and    of  a  syrupy consist
 ence ; it was evaporated to dryness, and the matter remain
 ing was afterwards made red hot in a platina crucible.
     C. Calcination        scarcely   changed   its colour.
    This    substance was again dissolved in very dikitc nitric acid,
 for the purpose of separating from it the iron which niisilit
 have    existed in it in the state of an oxide ; but the whole
 was entirely dissolved; which evidently shows that the iron
 was neither in the state of           a red  oxide nor    as a nitrate, but
 rather in the state of        a phosphate.
     D. Ammonia in            excess    was  poured    into   the  liquor C,
 which      gave   an abundant white          precipitate.      After being
Washed       and dried, this precipitate was treated          with a strong
  solution of potash, which dissolved a             certain quantity of it.
 The liquor       was afterwards        separated   from the portion not
  dissolved, and muriate of ammonia was added, which se
  parated a white matter from it that presented all the pro
  perties   of alumine. This substance, after calcination, weighed
  a part and a half.
                                                                      E.The

                    known by the Name        of Turquoise.             22?
    E. The portion dissolved by           the potash  was also calcined,
 and weighed       82 parts.
    F. Being     desirous    of knowing     if the liquor in the experi
ment     D contained anv lime in solution, we poured carbo
nate    of ammonia into it ; a precipitate was obtained \v|iich,
when dried        and slightly healed, was found to be caruoiwtc
of lime    ; its weight \vas eight parts.
    G.   The liquor floating above was afterwards evaporated,
but no precipitatewas formed; which led us to conclude iliat
it contained no magnesia.
    II.  Being persuaded that the precipitate E contained phos
phates, it was treated with the sulphuric acid.                  The sub
stance was afterwards          washed   ;  and the washings being col
lected, prussiate of potash was poured into them, which
formed a precipitate of a deep blue, the weight of which,
after calcination, was one part and a half: it was red oxide
of iron.      (Cure must be taken to heat the liquor, in order
to separate the precipitate entirely.)
    The liquor floating above held in solution acid phosphate
of lime    ; this was ascertained by obtaining phosphorus from
it by the help of charcoal.
    I. this oxide of iron was again made red hot with a. little
pure potash.        The    matter assumed      a deep green   colour ; the
cooled mass was afterwards dissolved in water, which as
sumed the same colour.             A little muriatic aeid was added,
and it then became of a fine rose colour.              This experiment
was repeated upon several turquoises, and the phenomenon
always took place ; which evidently proves the presence of
a very small quantity of manganese.
    K. Wishing to ascertain if turquoises contained any phos
phate of magnesia, as the experiments of Messrs. Fourcroy
and Vauquclin upon bones might lead us to think, I treated
this substance       in the manner pointed out by these chemists
(Annales de C/tlmie, torn, xlvii.*), and the result was, that
100 parts of turquoise contained two parts of phosphate of
magnesia.

      Although       I   obtained similar      products on examining se
  veral turquoises, yet we cannot decide if they are identical.
  The turquoises that I made use of, were exactly similar to
  those in the cabinet of the Museum of Natural Elistory; and
  M. Haiiy, whom 1 consulted, could not say that they were
  true Persian ones.             M. Guytou     thinks      that  there  is a  dif
  ference     between       the Persian and European turquoises.                In
  his lectures on mineralogy at the Polytechnic School he has
  for some      years maintained that the former contains silex.
  It  is possible    they may contain this substance               accidentally;
-but    I  never found any in those          I examined.        I  do not think
  that this difference ought to hinder mineralogists from clas
  sifying turquoise. M. Guyton himself has already placed it
  among the fossil bones : this celebrated chemist has also
  made some comparative experiments : he saw that fossil
  bones assumed in the fire a colour analogous to that of tur
 quoise; that digested in water containing potash they be
  came blue, and that this blue varied in shade and passed to
 a greenish or deep blue ; and lastly,               that bones      exposed    to
 the air became white.
     Messrs. Fourcroy and Vauquelin have also observed that

 colour appeared          to them to be owing           to the presence      of  a

    Thus    there    exists no doubt upon the substance which
colours the turquoise. If it was necessary to add to the facts
already given, I would say, that having sent M. Vauquelin
the same turquoises I had analysed, he found no particle of
copper in them ; lastly, I ascertained that, by pouring into
a solution      of muriate of lime phosphate of soda and some
drops of muriate of iron at the maximum, a phosphate of
lime and iron was obtained of a greenisrfblue colour: again,
by decomposing the phosphate of soda by the muriate of
iron at the maximum, we may obtain a phosphate of iron
which is not white, as some chemists have said, but of a
blueish green colour.
    The above reflections may not be very important ; but                      I
offer them with the view of showing the possibility of imi
tating the colour of the turquoise, and as showing at the
same     time that iron, in several circumstances,                    may yield
colours similar to those produced by copper.

  W HF.N-      different bodies move with the same velocity, it is
universally agreed that the forces which they can exert
against any obstacle opposed to them are in proportion to
 the quantities of matter contained in the bodies respectively.
But, when equal bodies move with unequal velocities, the
 estimation of their forces            has been a subject        of dispute be
 tween     different classes      of philosophers.            Leibnitz and his
 followers have maintained that the forces of bodies are as
 the masses multiplied into the squares of their velocities (a
 multiple to which I shall, for conciseness, give the name of
 impetus), while those who are considered as Newtonians
 conceive that the forces are in the simple ratio of the velo
 cities, and consequently         as the momentum         or quantitas motus,

a name     given by Newton to the multiple of the velocity of
a body simply t.^ken into its quantity           of matter.
   It cannot     be expected    that   at this time any new experi
ment should       be  thought of   by  which    the controversy can be
decided, since the most simple experiments that have already
been appealed to by either party have received different inr
terpretations from their opponents,            although ihe facts were
admitted.
   My object in        the present   lecture is to consider which of
these opinions respecting the force exerted by moving bodies
is most conformable to the usual meaning of that word, and
to show that the         explanation given by Newton of the third
law   of   motion is in no respect favourable to those who in
their view    of this question    have been called Newtonians.
   If bodies    were made to act upon each other under the cir
cumstances which I am about to describe, the leading phae-
nomena would occur, which afford the grounds of reasoning
on either side.
   Let   a  ball of clay or of any other soft and wholly inelastic-
substance be suspended at rest, but free to move in any di
rection    with    the slightest   impulse   ;   and   let there be two
pegs, similar and equal         in every respect, inserted slightly
into  its opposite sides.      Let  there be also two other bodies,
A  and   B, of any magnitude, which are to each other in the
proportion      of 2 to 1, suspended in such a position, that
,when perfectly at rest they shall be in contact with the ex
tremities of the opposite pegs without pressing against them.
Now if these bodies were made to swing with motions so
adapted that in falling from heights in the proportion of 1
to 4, they mi^ht strike at the same instant against the pegs
opposite to them, the ball of clay would not be moved from
its place to cither side ; nevertheless The peg, impelled by
the smaller body B, which has the double velocity, would
be found to have penetrated         twice  as   far as  the peg impelled
by A.
   It is unnecessary        to make the      experiment precisely as
here stated,     since the results     are admitted as facts by both
 parties; but upon these facts they reason differently.
                                                                    One

                                                                    231
                     Oa the Force   of Percussion.
    One. side observing that the ball      of clay remains unmoved,
considers the proof indisputable, that the action of the body A
is equal to that of B, and that their forces are properly mea
sured by their momenta, which are equal, because their ve
locities are in the simple inverse ratio of the bodies. Their
opponents think it equally proved by the unequal depths to
which the pegs have penetrated, that the causes of these
effects are unequal, as they find to be the case in their esti
mation of the forces by the squares of the velocities.
    One party is satislied that equal momenta can resist equal
pressures during the same time; the other party attend to
tite spaces through which the same moving force is exerted,
and finding them in the proportion of 2 to 1, and convinced
that the    w   uiua of  a body in motion       is justly estimated by
its magnitude and the square        of its  velocity jointly.
    The former conception of a quantity dependent on the
continuance of a given vis matrix for a certain time may
 have its use, when correctly applied, in certain         philosophical
considerations; but the latter idea of a quantity resulting
 from the same force exerted through a determinate space is
 of greater practical utility, as it occurs daily in the usual
 occupations of men ; since any quantity of work performed
 is always appreciated by the extent of effect resulting from
 their exertions; for it is well known that the raising any
 great weight 40 feet would        require four times as much la
 bour   as   would be requisite to raise an equal weight to the
 height of 10 feet, and that in its slow descent the former
 would produce four times the effect of the latter in conti
 nuing the motion of any kind of machine.                  Moreover, if
 the weights so raised were suffered to fall freely through the
 heights that have been ascended by means of four and of
 one minute's labour, the velocities acquired would be in the
 ratio of-2 to 1, and the squares of the velocities in propor
 tion to the quantities of labour from which they originated,
 or as 4 to 1 ; and if the forces acquired by their descent were
 employed in driving piles, their more sudden               effects pro
 duced would be found to be in that same ratio.
    This   species  of force has been, first by Bernoulli     and after-
                                  P  4                             wards

   wards by Smeaton, very aptly denominated mechanic force;
   and when by force of percussion is meant the quantity of
   mechanic force possessed by a body in motion, to be esti
   mated by its quantity of mechanic effect, I 'apprehend it can
  not be controverted that it is in proportion to the magnitude
  of  the body and to the square of its velocity jointly.
      But of this quantity of force Newton no where treats, and
  lias accordingly given no definition of it.       If, after defining
  what he meant by the quantilai, arcelcratrix, and quantitas
  matrix, he had had occasion to convey an equally distinct
  idea of the quantltas mechanlca resulting from the continued
  action of any force, he might, not improbably, have pro
  ceeded conformably to the definition given by Smeaton, and
  have added,
           quantitas mechanica est mensura proportionalis spatio
  per quod data vis motrix exercetur ;
  or, if speaking with reference to the accumulated energy
  communicated to a body in motion,
           proportionalis quadrato velocitatis quara in dato cor-
 pore generat.
     But, if we attend to the words        of his preface to the first
 edition    of his Principia,     he evidently had no need    of such
 a  definition   :
     "  Nos    autem   non artibus sed philosophiae consulentes,
 deque potentiis non manualibus sed naturalibus scribentes,"
 &c.
     And again, nearly to the same effect in the Scholium,
 which follows the laws of motion : " CzEterum mechani-
 cam tractare non est hujus instituti."
     In the third law of motion he has, on the contrary, been
 supposed    to speak   of this force from an ambiguity in the sig
 nification   of   the words actio and reactio.       By these, how
ever,   Newton certainly      meant a mere vis motrix or pressure,
as he   himself explains them : " Quicquid premit vel trahit
alterum, tantundem ab eo prcmitur vel trahitur.               Si qtiis
lapidem digito premit, prcmitur et hujus digitus a lapide,"
&c. The same meaning is equally evident from his demon
stration    of  the third corollary to the laws,    in which he    as
                                                                 serts

                     On the Force    of Percussion.             233
 serts  that the quant it as   mollis of two or more bodies    esti
 mated in any given direction         is not altered by their action
 upon each other.       The demonstration begins thus :
     " Etenim actio eique contraria reactio aequales sunt per
 legem tertian), ideoque per legem secundam aequales in mo-
 tibus efficient mutationes versus contrarias partes." Now, if
 he had considered the third law as implying equality of more
 than mere moving forces, them could have been no occasion
to refer to the second law, with a view thence to deduce the
equality of momenta produced.
    Some authors, however, have interpreted the third law
differently,   and    accordingly have expressed a difficulty in
comprehending the simple illustration given by Newton.
When they say that action is equal to reaction, they mean
not only that the instantaneous intensity of the moving
forces, or pressures opposed to each other, aie necessarily
 equal, but conceive also a species of accumulated force re
siding in a moving body, which is capable of resistimr pres
sure during a time that is proportional to iu momentum or
quantitas motus.
    If it be of any real utility to give the name of force to
this complex idea of vis matrix extended through time, as
well as that of momentum to its effects when unresisted, it
would be requisite to distinguish this force always by some
such appellation as momenta}, force ; for it is to be appre
hended that for want of this distinction many writers them
selves, and it is certain that many readers of disquisition*
on this subject, have confounded and compared together
vis motrix, momentum, and vis mechanica : quantities that
are all of them totally dissimilar, and bear no more compari
son to each other, than lines to surfaces, or surfaces to solids.
    Iu practical mechanics, however, it is at least very rarely
that the momentum of bodies is in any degree an object of
consideration    ; the  strength of machinery being in every case
to be adapted      to the quantitas motrix,     and the extent and
value   of the effect to be produced depending upon the quan-
litas  mechanica     of  the force applied, or, in other words,   to
the space through which a given vis motrix is exerted.

of time to reconsider them in this place. So also, on the

for counteracting the usual resistances, and perpetual motion
would be easily effected.           But since the impetus remains
unaltered, it is evident that the utmost which the body B
could effect in return would be the reproduction of A's ve
locity, and restitution of its entire mechanic force neither
increased nor diminished, excepting by the necessary im
perfection of machinery.           The possibility of perpetual mo
tion is consequently inconsistent with those principles which
measure the quantity        of force by the quantity of its extended
effect, or by the      square of the velocity which it can produce.
    In estimating       the utmost effect which one body can pro
duce upon another at rest, the same result is obtained by
employing impetus as ascensional force, according to Huyr
gens    ;  for if the body   A  were allowed to ascend to the height
due to its       velocity,  and  if by any simple mechanical con
 trivance of a lever or otherwise the body B were to be raised
by the descent of A, it is well known that the heights of
ascent would be reciprocally as the bodies; and consequently
 thai the square of the velocity to be acquired by free descent
of B would be in that ratio, and the quantity of mechanic
force would be preserved         as before  unaltered.
     It   may be   of  use also to consider another application     of
 the same energy, and to show more generally that the same
quantity of total efleci would be the consequence not only
of direct action of bodies upon each other, but also of their
 indirect action through the medium of any mechanical ad
 vantage or disadvantage ; although the time of action might
 by that means be increased or decreased in any desired pro
 portion.       For instance, if the body supposed to be in mo
 tion were to act by means of a lever upon a spring placed at
 a certain distance from the. centre of motion, the :retarding
 force opposed to it would be inversely as the distance of the
 body from the centre ; and since the space through which
 the body would move to lose its whole velocity would be
 reciprocally as the retarding force, the angular motion of
 the lever and       space  through which      the spring must bend,
 Vould      be the   same at whatever     ppint of the lever the body
 acted.      And    conversely, the reaction ol'the spring upon any
                                                                 other

$36                 OH the Force   of Percussion,
other body     IS, would in all positions communicate to it the
same velocity.
     It  may be remarked, however, that the times in which
these total effects are produced may be varied      at pleasure  in
proportion to the distances at which the bodies are placed
from the centre of motion ; and it should not pass unob
served, that, although the intensity      of any vis motrix is in
creased     by being placed  at what  is called a mechanical ad
vantage, yet, on the contrary, any quantity of mechanic
force is not liable to either increase or diminution by any
such variation in the mode of its application.
     Since we can, by means of any mechanic force consisting
of a vis motrix exerted through a given space, give motion
to   a  body for the purpose of employing its impetus for the
production of any sudden effect, or can, on the contrary,
occasion a moving body to ascend, and thus resolve its im
petus into a moving force ready to exert itself through a de
terminate space     of descent, and capable of producing pre
cisely the same quantity     of mechanic effect as before, the
force depending on impetus may justly be said to be of the
same kind as any other mechanic force, and they may be
strictly compared as to quantity.
     In this manner we may even compare the force       of a body
in motion to the same kind         of force contained in   a given
quantity of gunpowder, and may say that we have the           same
quantity of mechanic force at command, whether we             have
 1  lb. of powder, which by its expansion could give to one
ton weight a velocity sufficient to raise it through 40 feet,
or the weight actually raised to that height and ready to be
let down gradually,     or the same weight possessing its ori
 ginal velocity to be employed in any sudden exertion.
     By making use of the same measure as in the former
 cases, a distinct expression is likewise obtained for the quan
 tity   of mechanic force given  to a steam-engine by any quan
 tity of coals ; and we are enabled to make a comparison of
 its effect with the quantity of work that one or more horse's
 may have performed in a day, each being expressed by the
 •pace through which a given moving force is exerted.            In

 tainty always prevails, in consequence of the unequal powers
of animals of the same species, and varying vigour of the
same animal.          The information which I have received in,
reply to inquiries respecting the weights raised in one hour
by horses in different situations, has varied as far as from
6 to    15  tons to the height of 100 feet.           But although the
rate at which       mechanic force is generated may vary, any
quantity of work executed is the same in whatever time it
may have been performed.
     In short, whether we arc considering the sources of ex
tended exertion or of accumulated energy, whether we com
pare the accumulated forces themselves              by their gradual or
by    their  sudden   effects,  the idea   of mechanic       force in prac
tice is always the same, and is proportional to the space
through which any moving force is exerted or overcome, or
to the square of the velocity of           a body in which such force
 is accumulated.
XXXIX.         History of Astronomy for the Year                1805.    By
                        JEROME DE LALANDE*.
 ON the morning of the 20th of October 1 805, M. Bouvard
 discovered a comet upon the paws of Ursa Major : it was
 small, had no tail, and was almost round, and so faint that
 it   was   scarcely discernible with a night-glass which mag
 nified five or six times. At 4h 19' in the morning it had
  1 66° 3 1' of right ascension, which I call equafude, and 33°
 30' of northern declination.         The    same   night it was disco
 vered by     M.  Pons, at Marseilles.       We know from        the public
journals that M. Huth saw it also at Frankfort on the
 Oder.      Messrs. Bouvard and Arrago observed it with the
 great equatorial, made this year by M. Bcllet for the ob
 servatory    ; and they    followed it   as long as the bad state of
 the weather      would    permit.    M. Thulis observed it at Mar
 seilles   go  late as   the 6th of November.           Messrs. Biot and

                                                                     Arrago

  Arrago ascertained      its elements    as follows  : — Node,   IP  15*
  6'; inclination, 11° 53'; perihelion, 4' 28° 45'; distance,
  O-3762 : passage, 18th November lh 8' 6" mean time; mo
  tion direct.    This is the 95th comet according to the cata
  logue in my astronomy, which I have continued in the va
  rious volumes of the Connoismnce da. Temps.
     The 96th comet        was discovered     by  M. Pons, on the    9th
  of November, in Andromeda: he was not certain of it until
  the 10th.     Upon that day M. Thulis found it at 16° 38' of
 eqnatude, and at 40° 43' of northern declination ; and h«
 continued observing it till the 8th of December.                His ex
 cellency M. Champagny, minister of the interior, has given
 M. Pous a present of 30O francs in consideration of the four
 comets    he has discovered.
     On  the  I4th of November M. Bouvard            also perceived   it,
 and on the 16th he determined its position.                It  was very
 small, and very difficult to see, notwithstanding          its nucleus.
 As soon    as  M. Burckhard     had    received   three  observations,
 he sent    me the elements        of its orbits on the same day.
 Those who know the difficulty of this problem will be asto
 nished at the readiness of this able astronomer : but thii
 was only the first essay.       Messrs. Legendre, Bouvard, and
Biot, afterwards     calculated   it : they found the node 8s 10"
 3tf; inclination, 15° 34'; perihelion, 3° 19' 26"; distance,
O-8Q16: passage, 3 1st of December, at8h; motion direct.
 On the 22d of November M. Huth also discovered it at
Frankfort    on the Oder.       As it approached the earth it be
 came more beautiful:         on the 5th of December it was seen
with   the naked eye     in Pisces.     M.   de Flaguergues observed
it on  the 7th at Viviers ; but it rapidly advanced towards the
south, and the bad weather prevented it from being seen any
more.      It was seen at Greenwich, however, on the 9th of
December;       and by  Dr. Herschel      at Slough.
    The most important thing in the history of astronomy is
the publication of the fourth volume of the Me'caniqite Ce
teste of M. de Laplace, which treats of satellites, comets,
refraction, of the inequalities of Jupiter, Saturn, and the
moon, and which on every subject contains the greatest ef
forts of theory and the last degree of perfection.           M. de La
                                                                  place

           History of Astronomy for           tlie Year  1 605.        239
place  there gives some       new results      upon the masses of the
planets ; and he has latterly confirmed them by the calcula
tion of an old Chinese observation on the obliquity of the
ecliptic, made     1 100 years before the vulgar aera, which gives
23" 54', while       he finds 52' by     his theory,      (torn. iii. 1. vi.
ch. lfi) ; another observation, 100 years before our cera, gives
23° 45', while it is 44' by the theory : this confirms the mass
of Venus made use of by M. de Laplace, and the diminu
tion of the obliquity of the ecliptic of 52" per annum, al
though several observations have -seemed to give only 36".
    We   have received a book        (196 pacces in 8vo.) containing
the exposition of      the operations made in Lapland for the de
termination of an arc of the meridian in              1 802,  by Messrs.
Osverbom, Svanberg, Holmquist, and Palander. They made
xisc of the new decimal measures ; a procedure which I think
the duty    of all those who interest themselves         in the progress
of truth.
    The result (p.     197) is, that the degree,     of which    the mid
dle passes at 66° 20', is 1 1 1477-4 metres,         or 57196-2 toises;
but to make this reduction they have supposed the metre to
be 443-2959 lines, as the commissioners of weights and
                                          ,
measures have made it in France              and for thai purpose they
took the metre         at the freezing point, and the toise at the
 13° of  the   thermometer of 80°.          It seems t« me most na
tural to take them        both at the mean temperature, which is
9^°.    By   a mean     between    the observations of several years,
it is the zero      of   my  new    thermometer: for this we must
subtract 0-064 lines from the metre, and add 0-046 lines to
the toisc, according to the experiments made by M. Lavoi
sier, and in which I took        a part  in 1782 ; and we may make
this proportion : 863-954 : 448-360 : : 854 lines are to the
metre; and thus it is found to be 443-435 lines in place of
296.     It is to tliis value that I shall change all the mea
sures in my astronomy,          as  I announced to the Institute on
the 2Sth    of October.      Thereby I find that we must subtract
 15i  metres from the       number above given, and that the do-
gree is 57200.
    The   degree    of  1736 having     been     measured   at 15°,   there
must be added to it three toises ; that of IS'02, having been
                                                                measured

  240          History of Astronomy for      the Year 1805.
  Pleasured at 3", but reduced to zero, we must take from, it
  eight toises : this augments the difference by eight toises.
 The former, in place of 574 T9, becomes 574S2; and the
 second reduced to 1 1 1462 metres, makes 57200 toises : thus
 there are 222 toises too much.         As this  agrees  with the other
 degrees measured, and with the oblateness          given by the pen
 dulum and the moon's parallax, we cannot refrain from
 adopting the new result, although it is difficult to compre
 hend ihow our academicians in 1736 carhe to commit so great
 an error.      The Swedes thought that the sector of nine feet
 was more liable to be deranged, and less certain, than the re
 peating circle which they made use of.
    M.    de Zach has examined the         work  of the Swedes: he
 compared the angles, and the reductions : he finds the re
 duction imperfect ; but the work is not less important or
 beneficial.
    In order to clear up the enormous differences between the
measurement of the French and that of the Swedes, I observe
 four things.
     1 . The sector was not reversed     :  this was too difficult.
    2. The wire was suspended         by a stud upon    a thickish cy
linder    ;  and there might be   friction.
    It   was   not then known how important it was that the
optic    axis  of the telescope should be parallel to the plane ;
two lines of difference in the position of the plasses make-
six minutes upon a radius of nine feet, and this difference
may thence arise ; there may result from this upon the di
stance to the zenith      an error so much       the greater, as pro
bably the glass was directed to the stars by their transits to
the meridian, and not by a meridian wire.
    4. I remember extremely well that Maupertuis told mc
that he was anxious to recommence the measurement.
    We     have also seen in the London Transactions that Mudge
has measured       three degrees in England.       He found 111 169
metres at 52°; this agrees with the French measurements :
but he found for the north part 164 metres less than for the
south part, and he ought to have found 23 metres more ;
which announces irregularities in the interior structure of
the earth and in the attractions of mountains,             and   which
                                                                makes

            History of Astronomy        for  the Year 1605.      241
makes us wish for other measurements of degrees of longi
tude which are not affected by these irregularities. — Phil.
Trans.    1804.
   M.   de Zach     has   continued    the  measurement   of his de
grees  of  the longitude and latitude of Capel, at Gotha; he
hopes   next  year to finish 4° of longitude.
   M. de Zach has been making observations at Hieres, Aix,
and Avignon, for thc'se 1 7 years past : he has. found 897
toiscs for the height of Mount Ventoux.               He expects to
finish in Provence the celestial arc between the mountain
Saint Victoire, and the pillar of Cette in Languedoc, for-
the degree of longitude measured in 1739, and upon which
there had been always some doubt entertained.
   He    observed    at the    Isle of Planier,   the most southern
point in France. General Roy had formed some doubt upon
the longitude of Porquerolle : M. de Zach determined it.
   In the month of March there appeared a large spot with
two nuclei upon the sun, which F observed at 9° to the north
of the solar equator : this differs little from the beautiful
spots which     I made     use   of in determining the rotation of
the sun in the memoirs         of the academy for 1 776, and which
were from     11  to 12  degrees.     This seems to confirm the dis
covery I   then made,      proving that there are in the sun some
points where great spots are formed in preference to others :
perhaps these spots are mountains, which attract and retain
the scoriae   of this immense furnace. The- parallel, which is
9° to the   south of the equator, abounds most in large spots.
   These spots with two nuclei, which have appeared at dif
ferent epochs (Mem. 1776 Sc 1/78), seem to me to over
turn the system of volcanoes proposed by Herschel.
   The beautiful spot of the month of March had its middle
at 104- degrees   of declination. That of which I calculated the
appearance     (Mem.    1 776,   p. 496) had from 11° to 14°; but a
spot  of a minute occupies        near 4°: thus the mountain which,
 I suppose, served it for the foundation or obstacle to arrest
and to fix it by, may rather, by taking it at a different point,
draw it to 2° or 3° further in one appearance than in the
 other.

   M.    de Flaugergues again saw this beautiful spot      in  the surl
in  the month     of April,  and this return gave him the rotation
of  the sun 25 days 10h 6', as     1 have found by many observa
tions.    (Aslronomie, art. 3276.)
   M. Piazzi,      the celebrated astronomer of Palermo,         writes
me, that he has observed the principal stars in the two sea
sons of the year, when the difference of the situation of the
earth in its orbit ought to produce a difference upon the si
tuation of the stars.       People have been disputing for these
two centuries upon this effect of the movement of the earth,
which has been called the annual parallax. M. Piazzi found
it in three months Vb" for Aldebaran, 3" for Procynn, 4"
for Sirius, from which it follows that the stars are not di
stant, as was thought, more than seven millions of mil
lions of leagues ; but he proposes to continue and verify
 these important observations.
    One of the most important works of 1805 is that of
M. Legendre, entitled " New Methods for the Determina
tion of the Orbit      of  the  Comets,  — Finnin Didot ;" where
lie has quoted the methods of Lambert, and Inslgnores Or-
litte in the memoirs of Berlin for 1771 ; and he gives a new
method for determining an orbit by three observations; and
he has applied it to the comets of 1 769 and 1 781 . He makes
use   of  a method he calls that of moindres     carrSs, which also
served him to determine the 45th degree          of latitude,   and he
concluded from it that the length of the arcs of the meri
dian is less proper than that of the pendulum for the deter
mination of an universal measure.
    M. Gauss, already known as one           of our  greatest geome
tricians, is occupied in computing the attractions of Jupiter
upon the three new planets ; but as there will be several
hundreds     of equations,     he proposes    to give only the me
thods with which         our calculators  will easily determine the
 quantities of   these equations.

 These are observed diameters, but which appear too great

  for distance ; diameter 587 leagues : Olbers, 4'5"; diameter
  760 leagues: Harding, 3-l"; diameter 515 leagues.
      In the Bibliothcquu   Britanntque of the month of August
  there is an cphemeris    of   the three planets up to the month
  of May     1806.
     The astronomical      medal    founded by Lalande,      which   is
  adjudged every year towards the spring equinox, has been
 decreed by the Institute      to M. Harding for the discovery of
 his planet.
     The prize which M.Bode        had been charged to give for the
 best memoir on astronomy, lias been raised to 6OO francs.
     M.   Laplace read at the Institute a memoir upon the ca
  pillary tubes, in which he gives the analytical calculation of
 their attraction perfectly conformable to experiments. There
 is an extract of it in the Journal dc Physique for January
  1806.     I read one myself upon levelling, where I explained
 the table of the level made use of in going from the north
 to ihe south, and that which must be employed when we
 level from     the east to the west, on account     of  the figure of
the earth ; a consideration which has hitherto escaped all the
authors who have written         of levelling.
     The fifth volume of the Institute, which appeared on the
 14th of January, contains fourteen memoirs on astronomy.
I have there given researches upon the motions of Mercury,
Mars, and Venus; some calculations of occultations of the
stars, and a description of the zodiac of Strasbourg. M. De-
lambrc there treats of the stereographic projection, and of the
astrolabe of Senezius, which M. Gail had stated to the class.
There is also a memoir of M. Messier upon the transit of
Mercury; observations of M. Ferrers in .America; on the
oscillation     of Mars, by M. Due la Cbapelle ; and a notice
of the grand tables of logarithms which M. de Prony has
caused     to be calculated ; and some remark:- upon the history
of   the trigonometric tables.       M. Cassini there gives the de
scription of his compass.
    Th» London Transactions         for 1803 contain   a  memoir of
M. HiTfchel upou        the transit  of Mercury, where     he has not

  perceived      any ring; and another upon the causes                 which
  make the mirrors of a telescope change their form.
      In the Transactions for          1804 he speaks   of  the double stars
  which for 25 years seem              to have experienced some varia
  tions,   particularly      in  respect to the angles of distance with
  the ecliptic, which makes him think trjat they turn but so
  slowly that it is difficult to affirm it. He has seen one part
  conceal the other in one of these double stars.
     M.   Delambre's tables of the sun, and              M.   Burg's    tables
  of   the moon,        have    been   finished and presented.       M.JDe-
 lambrc     l^as   revised the tables     of the moon in such a manner
  that all    '.he  equations are additive ; which will save time,
  and diminish the risk of making errors.                 These tables are
 about to appear.
     The new         table  of refractions of M. de Laplace, which
 appears with         the tables    of the sun, gives six-tenths of the
 second at 45°           more than that of Bradley; but M. de La
 place informs astronomers that discordances have been often
 found between           the two solstices, from       having    placed    the
 thermometer          within an observatory, instead of placing it
 outside, but out of sunshine.
     The observations of the two solstices and the two equi
 noxes, made by M. Delambre, with a repeating circle, du
 ring several days, have confirmed the epochs of the obli
 quity of the ecliptic, which he uses in his new tables.
     Epoch for 1800, 9s 10° 23' 32- 6", less by two 2" than in
 his former tables.          Mean obliquity, 23° 27' 57" ; greater by
 4" than in the tables of my third edition, which have been
 hitherto made use of.
    M. Delambre has finished the printing of the first votume
of the great work on the meridian, in 750 pages : it is en
titled Base du Systcme Milrlque Decimal; or, Mesure de
CArc du Meridlen.                 It contains all the triangles formed
from Dunkirk to Barcelona.                    The second volume will
contain      the    bases,    the    azimuths,    the latitudes,    and   the
calculations of        the triangles.       Perhaps there  will be a third
volume afterwards added.

vard, have been finished, and they arc about lii be printed.

   We   have received the Memoirs         of Berlin for 1802,   which

 tuted   for that    of right ascension, that      we might      have   a
 simple name, and one not indicating a thing never seen.
     M.   Poczobitt   and  M. Treschka, astronomers in          the uni
 versity of Vilna, have sent us a great number of observa
 tions of the new planets, made in 1803 and 1S04 with ex
 cellent instruments.
     M.   Scarpelini   has sent from Rome observations made            in
 the observatory of the duke of Sermonata (Gactani) upon
 the eclipses of the sun and moon, and the transits of Mer
 cury over the sun.
     Pope Pius VII. Chiaramonte, whose stay at Paris gave us
 so. much pleasure, has given me orders to procure a circle,
 a clock, and an achromatic telescope for the observatory of the
Roman college ; which Messrs. Calendrielli and Conti have
rendered interesting, and which cardinal Litta, prefect of
the studies of the Roman college, specially protects.
    The astronomers of Florence           have requested    me to send
them    a  chronometer    of Berthoud.
    M.   Ciccolini,   astronomer of Bologna,         has   published    a
memoir upon the eclipse of the sun of the           1 1th of February,
 J804 ; which it was thought would have been             total in Italy.
But that was not, nor could it be the case, according to
the diameters of the sun and the moon in my tables ; but the
observation has succeeded, as ill in Italy as in France.
    M. Ciccolini has made an useful addition to the reflecting
circle.     He has made the back part of this instrument a
quadrant, the radius of which is the diameter of the instru
ment itself; and with a plummet and the telescope of the
circle, he is thus able to ascertain, in half a minute of time,
the altitude of a star within half a degree, and at the same
time the degree to which the vernier of the telescope must
be placed to observe with.         In this manner we avoid the
disagreeable     method of trial in observations of altitudes,
always! complained of by the most skilful astronomers and
navigators.      By this method     also we can give a greater mag
nifying    power to the telescope than is usual; which will be
extrcintly advantageous      in  these sorts   of observations.
    M. Lenoir    has also   made at    Paris a stand, with which        a
                                                                  single

single observer        is enabled    to make use      of  the  repeating

   M.   Augustus Pictet, of Geneva, has given a method of
observing meridian transits, by means of the sextants which
are used in the navy.         It is sufficient to fix due west a mark
which will     be at 90° exactly from all the points in the meri
dian.
   M. Julian     Ortez Canelas, son-in-law         of  the late  Tofino,
and director    of the observatory of Spain,       has sent us the ob
servations made in the isle of Leon from 1798 to 1801.
   M. Tiscar has sent us observations of eclipses, and accu
rate calculations,      from which to deduce the longitudes.
   M.   de Ferrers,      a Spanish officer, travelling in America,
has sent us an observation        of  the eclipse of  the 26th   of June,
1 805,    which was not visible in Europe.             He settles New
York     in latitude 40° 4-2', and 5h 6° o" west of Paris. The
beginning happened at 6h 50' 10" apparent time.                From this
I concluded the conjunction at llh 24' 42" at Paris, and the
error   of the tables — 46" ; but as it includes the supposi
tion of the latitude of the moon, it may be something less.
M. de Ferrers adds the positions of New York and Albany,
and several other observations.
    We     have   received    from    Portugal the Ephemerides of
Coimbra for 1805 ; they are similar to those of 1 804, which
we mentioned last year.           The author has banished the signs
and the seconds      :  every thing is expressed in degrees, minutes,
and hundredths ; the time is in hours, minutes, and hun
dredth- ; and all the calculations are for mean noon.                 The
article Planets contains all the longitudes, heliocentric and
geocentric latitudes ; their right ascensions, their declina
tions, their transits, and their parallax.         Instead of configu
rations of the satellites, we find for the times              of eclipses
their situation relative to the centre of Jupiter expressed by-
two rectangular co-ordinates, one of which has for its axis
the line of the belts. The distances of the moon from the
Fun and the stars are only given for noon and midnight ;
but at the end of the calendar we sec, as in the preceding vo
lume, subsidiary tables, intended to enable mariners to dis
pense with the tables of logarithms in the most ordinary cal-

culations.      The first volume crmtains         tables proper for calcu
lating without logarithms the horary angles, the azimuths,
and the semi-diurnal arcs ; the distances of the moon from
the stars, to reduce the apparent distances to the true, and
to find the longitude of a ship ; formulae for the calculation
 of eclipses, in which are employed the right ascensions and
 the declinations of the two stars ; and lastly, tables of Mars,
by    M. Monteiro,        and    which give the perturbations in ten
 equations.
     The volume of       1 805    also presents several subsidiary tables,
 serving to calculate, without logarithms, the right ascension
 and   the declination of a star whose longitude and latitude
 are  known, and that according to two different methods :
 we there find a table of the horary angles of the stars when
 they have 8° of altitude, which has been constructed to find,
 among the eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter, any one which
 we cannot expect to be able to see ; a table of the distances
 of  the centre    of Jupiter from       the centre    of the section  of the
 cone of shadow through which the four satellites pass ; tables
 of latitude for these same satellites ; the abscissa of the sha
 dow, i.    e. the path     of  the satellite  in the shadow during the
 semi-duration of        the eclipse.     These tables serve ts compute
 the position of        the satellites with regard to the centre of
 Jupiter, such as we          see   them every six days of each month
 in the Ephemerides           ;  they also serve to ascertain whether
 the satellite   is visible at the time       of immersion or emersion.
 For    the   general    tables,     which the author had given in the
  preceding volume         for   the   aberration, he has in this volume
  substituted others which are all similar to those of M. De-
  Jambrc, with this exception, that the quantities, in place of
  being in seconds, are in minutes and decimals : some of these
  tables are founded upon very ingenious plans                of calculation,
  and the author has         skilfully avoided      the necessity   of having
  recourse to the       tables of logarithms      :   this calculation is not
  always so short      as that     by the known methods ; but we there
  find for the problems given in 1804, the advantage of not
   having occasion for any other ephemerides ; for the pro
  blems which that for 1805 contains, this advantage is much
  diminished, since we may refer to the volume for 1804,
                                                                          The

             History of Aslronomy       for  tlie Year 1805.        249
The author       has omitted the formula: upon which these tables
 have been constructed.          In order   to appreciate  their exact
 ness   they must be decomposed, which is sometimes long
 and difficult enough when they are founded upon formula
,simply approximative.
    M. Canelas has sent us from Spain the Almanack               Nom-
tika for 1807.         That for 1608 is calculating.
    The Academy of Sciences in Norway, to which council
lor Hammer bequeathed 80,000 francs, with a library and a
cabinet of natural history, have not forgotten to devote a
 part of these resources to the service of astronomy.            I have
already had       occasion to remark that astronomy was culti
vated    in   these   terrible climates, where Messrs. Pihl, VVib
senior and junior, and         M. Aubert,     have made many useful
 observations.
    M.   Goldbach,       having arrived at Moscow on the 1st          of
 April,   fixed upon the spot for the observatory in the Botanic
 Garden.        He expects a three-foot circle, made by Berge,
 the  successor     of Ramsden ; and a five-foot transit instru
 ment from Carey.           The senator Mouravieff, curator of the
 university      of Moscow, favours this establishment, which
 cannot fail to procure us some excellent observations.
    M . Goldbach has determined the latitude of the univer
 sity to be 55° 44' 32".         The observatory will be one minute
 more northerly : thus the latitude marked in the Connois-
 sance de Temps        55° 45' 45", nearly approaches that which
 we shall have to use.
     On the 28th of November the grand pensionary of Hol
 land named M. Fokker astronomer to the republic.                  This
 leads me to hope that          an observatory and instruments      will
 be procured       in  that  country,  where astronomical      observa
 tions have been so long wanted           for the use   of their navy.
  I have already spoken       of  the zeal  of M. Fokker in the His
 tory of Astronomy for 1801. (Bibl. p. 856.)
     The emperor, in passing through Turin, promised general
 Menou to grant 60,000 francs for the use of the observa
  tory ; and the academy will send from France a practical
  astronomer, in order to show theorists the method          of making
                                                          observations.

    At Milan the emperor gave 8000 livres as a pension to
 M. Oriani, the most celebrated geometrician and astronomer
 in Italy.
    At Lyons     the   municipality, whom       I had solicited to re
 pair the observatory where I made my first observation in
 J 748, have come to the resolution of doing so; and M. Clerc
 has given them the designs.

    M. Biot    has published Elements       of Physical Astronomy,
for the Use of Schools.        As they     are quite different    from
my Abridgment         of Astronomy,      they do not prevent mine
from being still useful to beginners.
    T have given a third edition of my Astronomy          for the La

in my estimation will be extremely useful for many persons.

     M. Benzenberg has published a book in German, where
 we find his experiments upon the fall of bodies, Versuche
 titer das Gesetz des Falls : I spoke of this last year. He
 found a deviation of 12 millimetres and a half for 86 me
 tres; but the extremes differ by six millimetres, on account
 of the    great difficulty of the observations.
     M.   Benzenberg has also sent      us some  curious observations
 upon      the  shooting stars ; he observed    500  of them in one
 night   :   he shows how      they may be made useful in deter
 mining longitudes.          Having so concerted with M. Brandes,
 who was 25 leagues distant from him, he found the distance
 of these meteors to be from 5 to 60 leagues.
     M. Adrian Dnqucsnoy has published the first two volumes
 of Asiatic Researches, or Memoirs of the Society established
 in 1784 at Calcutta in Bengal ; translated by A. Labaume,
 with notes of Messrs. Langles, Delambre, Cuvier, Lamarck,
  and Olivier. There are seven volumes of this collection pub

     M. Lanulin,    naval engineer,      has published a work enti
 tled   " Theory of the Organization of Worlds," in which
 he explains the motion of projection of planets by the rota
 tion of the sun, supposing them to have been hurled from
the sun by volcanoes ; but we have shown him that this is
 impossible, and that they fall back into the sun.               M. Si-

the    National   Institute   of France   ; Dentu    1806,   318 pages,

works and some sentimental dramas,             occupies himself with
collecting the objections of the ignorant, and the difficulties
of    those who do not understand astronomy : M. Mercier
would have required less time to comprehend the science
than to write this book.
    The Astronomical and Geographical Journal, published

    This-journal,    as  well as that of M. Zach, which we have

J.N the last report              (see Philosophical Magazine, vol. xxv.
p.    346,)     there     were    132 patients under cure; 117 of whom
have been cured, 5 relieved, and 10 remain on the books :
these       are chiefly old persons, who have been afflicted                     with
ulcerated legs for many years, and for whom little more is
to be done by the art of surgery than to keep the parts clean,
which might be accomplished with more convenience to the
patients in other institutions ; and the letters which these
 persons have occupied for so many years, and are still likely
to keep, might be given to such patients whose cases admit
of cure or relief, by which act the utility of the institution
 would be extended.

       It was     observed       in the last report, that in many cases of
   ulcers situated on the legs, more pain had been experienced
   than was usual in similar cases, and that the cures were con
   siderably protracted : much good has evidently been derived
   in these cases by the free administration of preparations of
   steel,    nitric acid,       and the bitter vegetable       infusions.
      A   case   of hernia, which took            place  in consequence of an
   opening in        the mesentery that existed, through which a part
   of  the small intestines protruded,              became      strangulated, and
   produced death.
      Mrs. Davis,          aet.  31, on the 21st of May last, when              she
  was very warm, drank about a pint and a half of new lablff
  beer, then in a state of fermentation ; soon after which she
  became very uneasy, complained of being much swelled,
   and was occasionally sick.                 She was immediately removed
  to her apartments in Snow-hill, and visited by Mr. Skin
  ner,    who      found       her vomiting large quantities of bilious
  matter, accompanied with violent pain in the umbilical re
  gion ; a quick but not hard pulse. The saline mixture was

  abdomen.
      22d,     No relief, or         ease, had been        obtained during the
  night    :   an    enema       was  administered, which was returned
  ,without effect : the medicine was also rejected from the sto
  mach as soon as taken.

  and the saline mixture taken occasionally.
      24th, No mitigation of symptoms ; the enema was re
  peated without effect ; every thing was rejected from the

  bath : pil. ex opii gr. \- quilibet hora             :   the enema nicotianae
  was administered.
      25th, No relief had been                obtained   :   the matter now vo
  mited was of         a  greenish hue     ;  the pulse was      quick, but low    ;
  the pain more violent ; a little water was the only thing that
  remained on the stomach even for a short time : the enema
'
  nicotianae      was     repeated.      I   was requested to see her this
  evening for the first time,            when the pain was rather abated,
                                                                              and

and there was a moist skin over the whole body.      The   opiate
was continued,    and the saline mixture was repealed in small
doses at short intervals.
    20th, Every unfavourable symptom had increased; the
pulse was quick and small, attended with a dry skin : an
enema was given, which returned with a small quantity of
thin   feculent  matter,  extremely   offensive,  and   perfectly
green.
    27th, The pulse was quicker and weaker than on the pre-
cediim day, but the pain had nearly subsided.
    28th, The pain had considerably increased, but she ap
peared to be sinking fast, and died at 1 1 o'clock at night.
    On examining the body after death, the thoracic viscera
were perfectly healthy and natural.
    In the abdomen the small intestines were distended with
flatus, and much discoloured ; the jejunum and ileum were
in some parts in a gangrenous state, and theircoats so tender
as to give way to the slightest pressure ; an opening    was ob
served in the mesentery, through which many feet in length
of the small intestines had protruded ; the distension of which,
added to the subsequent inflammation       of the mesentery, in
 all probability produced the stricture on the intestinal canal.
This malformation, from all appearance, must have existed
from the first formation of the parts, as there was not the
least trace of laceration or accidental injury.       The other
 viscera were all natural and healthy.

    Mrs.          , tet. 35, had  been   the mother    of  several
 children, and had always enjoyed good health, attended di
 vine service on Sunday, the 12th of October last, and ap
 peared quite well after her return home ; but in the even
 ing  she was seized with pain in the abdomen, attended      with
 sickness, hiccup,   and vomiting   : on going to bed she com
 plained of a small swelling in the right groin, but which was
 not mentioned to the professional gentleman who was called
 in.   The symptoms continued to increase during         the  two

subject to hernia, which                 question was answered in the ne
gative    .
   In the afternoon of the 1 5th I was requested to see her,
and found   her then labouring under symptoms of strangu
lated hernia, situated under poupart's ligament, on the right
side, between the femoral vessels and the ilium, not larger
than     a    moderate-sized walnut.                 From the smallness of the
tumour,            and the pain being particularly referred                to the um
bilicus     region of the stomach, she could scarcely be
              and
convinced that the disease arose in consequence thereof. All
attempts to reduce               the hernia were unsuccessful ; encinas
had    been         repeated    frequently during               the   preceding night
without having obtained                  the desired effect ; every thing was
rejected           from the stomach            as   soon   as    taken.    It   appeared
from     the length        of time strangulation had existed, from                    the
remedies  which had been employed, and from the present
alarming symptoms, that the operation ought to be imme
diately performed.  From the earnest entreaties of herself
and husband            I   was induced      it for two hours,
                                               to postpone
giving in the mean time one of the following pills every half
hour,    calom. gr. viii. opi. gr. iv.
             IJ.                        pil. iv. These weref.
immediately rejected    the stomach by and the operation    ;
would have been performed but for the interference of an
other surgeon, who sent me word " that he had reduced the
hernia    part, was going to nive some medicines, and had
              in
no doubt of complete success."    By his improper and very
reprehensible conduct the patient was taken from under my
care and placed in the hands of one who promised      cure                       a
on much easier terms than myself: but the event proved the
fallacy of his pretensions,               as the patient died on the morn
ing of the 17th, leaving             a     young family and     disconsolate
                                                                       a
husband to lament the loss of                  a    parent and wife no more.
  It   was asserted            by
                                the surgeon that he had succeeded
completely           in reducing the hernia in his second attempt                      ;
but on examining the part after death he acknowledged his
                  " that was not, nor never had been, re

 in all probability      the patient would have recovered ; and it is
 only    in  the  repeated fruitless attempts at reduction, and the

XLI.       Thirty-third      Communication      from Dr. Thornton,
                     relative to Pneumatic Medicine.
             Suspended     Animation restored      by Vital Air.
JVIr.      B          ,  a tradesman      in Duke-street,   Manchester-
 square, from causes which I need not enter into, resolved
upon self-destruction.            He deliberately retired to a garret in
 his house, and wrote down his causes of distraction, which
 he   left upon the table. He sent the maid-servant down
 stairs, and leaped, as he thought, into eternity.
    It being the top of the house, and Sunday, the rest of
the family at church,            his wife, child, and servant below
stairs, no one heard his struggles, and he was full twenty
minutes       before    the wife     entered   the apartment, saw her
husband        suspended, and        to  all appearance dead.    He was
cut down, and every assistance sent for in the neighbour
hood.        When I arrived, all pulsation had ceased, and ani
mation appeared fled.            In all  cases  of apparent death, time
presses,      and   the urgency of the case demands all possible
expedition.         The   grand question is, what is first to be done,
and by what means ? Then it may be right to premise, that
I consider       hanging and drowning as the same effect, but
only produced by a different cause.               Both may be thus de
fined,     "  A stop put to the actions of life in the body, with
out any irreparable injury to any vital organ ; but it is requi
site to put the animated machinery into action in a given
time, or the power of action will be irrecoverably lost."

238     Thirty-third Communication from .Dr. Thornton
trary, considered suspension and drowning as extremely
different ; for hanging, they represent as destroying by
inducing apoplexy.         This also is the common, and a very
natural opinion ; but I shall here prove it to be erroneous.
The following experiment was long since made by professor
Monro, at Edinburgh.            A dog was suspended by the neck
with a cord ; in a few minutes he ceased to struggle.                The
same experiment, exactly,         was   tried upon another dog, but
an opening was previously made in the wind-pipe below the
cord, so as to admit of air being forced into his lungs.                In
this state he was kept alive three quarters of an hour, when
the cord was shifted below the opening into the wind-pipe,
so as to intercept the ingress of air into the lungs, and the
animal died in a few minutes.            Upon examining the head,
there was found no rupture        of vessels in  the brain.     To  prove
this point more clearly,        I  shall relate  a still  more   decided
experiment by the veterinary professor, Mr. Coleman.                  The
 carotids, or arteries, which carry blood to the head, may be
 secured    without soon materially destroying the animal func
tions. This operation was first done, and then the animal was
 hanged, and he died in a few minutes.                 Upon the brain
being examined, there was found a less congestion of Hood
 than usual,      and  therefore    no apoplexy.      In apoplexy      the
 irritability continues     several   hours, whilst in drowning or
 hanging,     the animal functions      are abolished in a few mi
 nutes.     In apoplexy, respiration together with the action
 of the heart and arteries go on, and the pulse often vibrates
more     forcibly than in health.           In hanging or drowning
 respiration    is  suppressed,     and   the  pulse obliterated.       In
 apoplexy there is the stertor apoplectkus very distinct;           — this
 is not to be discovered      in hanging     : and, lastly, after reco
 very from apoplexy , the subject is generally paralytic                  ;
 whereas no such event follows recovery from suspension                   :
 and where death ensues,         the   appearances    in the brain, in
 the two     instances, are entirely toto coelo      different.    I press
 this distinction forward, as the proximate cause being ascer
 tained leads to the right mode of treatment. This proximate
 cause  I  have sufficiently proved      to be,   in both hanging     and
  drowning,     a stoppage   of air to   the lungs, 4>y which the ve
                                                                     nous

                  relative to Pneumatic Medicine.                       259
 nous blood ceases to imbibe oxygen, and hence the heart,
 unstimulated by oxygen, ceases to contract, the arteries to
 vibrate ; and hence the whole machine, although sound and
entire in every part, yet on a sudden, like a clock whose
 pendulum is stopped, remains entirely at rest.
    In the watch, if we move but the pendulum, the wheels
 are immediately put into motion, the clock again correctly
 marks its hours and minutes             as before :   so likewise   in the
 animal machine,        if the blood can but be influenced by oxy
gen,   the  heart  recovers      its action, the brain its energy, and
the nerves their sensibility ; such is the wonderful harmo
 nious consent of parts       !
    From this privation        of oxygen in drowning and suspen
 sion, we can     now explain why the blood grows dark, the
lips and countenance livid, and why the body quickly loses
 its animal heat. That the motion of the heart depends upon
 the air thrown into the lungs, was established by the illus
 trious Hook,    a century ago, before the Royal Society.               He
laid open the thorax of a dog, cut away the ribs and dia
 phragm, and removing the pericardium, he kept the animal
 alive above an hour by means of a pair of bellows.                 It was
 observed, that as often        as  he left oft"  blowing,  and the   lungs
were collapsed, the dog fell into convulsive motions, and
 revived again upon renewing the blast, and the heart began
afresh to beat.      John Hunter        repeated the same experiment,
 and hence concludes,         as    with still-born children, in sus
 pended    animation, the first thing is to force air into the
lungs to restore the heart's action.             For this purpose, John
 Hunter invented a pair of bellows of such a construction,
 that by one action fresh air is thrown into the lungs, and by
another it is pumped out again, to imitate artificial breath
ing. This invention may be seen at Savigny's.                 But in this
case no such instrument could be procured ; I therefore re
quested   a common          pair of bellows, and by inserting the
nozzle up one nostril,         while the mouth and opposite nostril
were closed    by   at forcible pressure, the lungs were expanded
 with common air.
    We   are  now come to the next process.                The heart or

aromatic vinegar, &c. are recommended by John Hunter ;
but. these are not always at hand. I requested the servant,
at the time she brought the bellows,                      to bring some mustard,
and boiling water.            As soon
                                   lungs were dilated, some
                                               as the
mustard was put up the nostril and into the mouth, and a
cloth dipped in boiling water, that is water scalding hot,
was put over the region of the heart and thorax.
  This had a double effect : it stimulated                         theheart by ex-.
citing the nerves, and by imparting heat                          gave it more sus
ceptibility to be acted upon.
                                                "
                                   Some years ago," says Dr.
Gardiner,      " the
                  heart and part of the large vessels of a turtle
were removed, with a view to examine the structure of
these parts, and the circulation of the blood of that animal.
Having wiped off the blood and other moisture, the heart
was wrapped up in a handkerchief; but engagements     in
the way    of my profession obliged                      me to postponemy cu
riosity till about six or seven                    hours after it was cut out.
When I examined               it,

pricking   with
           it            a   large needle,          it palpitated several times.
The palpitations          were      renewed         as often as the needle was
pushed     into its substance, until                 it   became         cold, when    it
seemed to be insensible to every stimulus.                         But after warm
ingit   again in the water,   recovered its irritability, and
                                          it
repeated its palpitations on the application of the needle.
Though no movement could be excited in                    any              it   by
stimulus       when       cold,      yet    it      moved       several    times after
being placed        in   the warm water."                This     proves the neces
sity of heat for maintaining                    the full powers of the               con

recommended by John Hunter. But this     often as unat            is
tainable as his bellows.

.nance     became     distorted, and     the    struggles    of convulsive
 nature ensued.
    The     legs   were   next rubbed with         mustard,    as  also  the
 thighs and      arms ; he was      also  continually blown upon by
 the bellows, raised upon the bed.               In order to oxygenate
 the air the more, and stimulate the olfactory nerves, six
 quarts    of vinegar,      in fine    sprays    from   a hearth-broom,
 were    dispersed     over the apartment.         The   acid principle   of
 the vinegar is      the   product    of oxygen,      the   reader  already
 knows.        In order    to   keep   up the nice sympathy which
exists betwixt the lungs, heart, and stomach, a cordial of
 very weak brandy and water was forced into the stomach,
 sweetened with sugar.
    In time of health, cordials,          as  they are called, on being
received into       the.  stomach,      presently    manifest their en
 livening effects ;     even,  long before they can be supposed to
enter the lacteals and pass to the heart, their stimulus is dif
fused to the most remote part of the system. The rationale
of this      appears to be as follows : Alcohol has a high af
 finity for oxygen, and by combustion it has been discover
ed, that sixteen ounces         of the former, being burnt, produce
eighteen      ounces   of water, which we know to be composed
of hydrogen         and oxygen. From this rapid combustion
 much caloric or heat is extracted.               In order to give a di
 stinct idea of the exact quantity, one pound weight of hy
drogen melted        295 pounds of ice, whereas            in similar cir
cumstances a pound of wax candles only melted                           133
pounds.         Not only a great degree of animal heat, therefore,
 arises   from the union         of hydrogen       and  oxygen, but the
nerves which supply the heart and stomach, the par vagum,
are therefore stimulated, and act by sympathy, as snuff
cumulating        the olfactory nerves produces sneezing, or
spasm of the abdominal muscles ; and it is also found that
the blood by possessing hydrogen becomes more attractive
of    the   oxygen.      Dr. Withering, writing           to  Dr. Beddues,

made.        The late ingenious Mr. Spalding, who dici so
much in improving             and   using the diving-bell, and had
 practised    with the greatest success for many years, was a
                                    R 3                                 man

  262     Thirty-third Communication from Dr. Thornton
  man of nice observation, and had he not fallen a sacrifice
  to the negligence of drunken attendants, would have him
  self informed    you of the circumstance.        He particularly
  informed me, that when he had eaten animal food, or
  drunk fermented liquors, he consumed tlie air in the bell
faster than when he lived upon vegetable food and drank
 only water. Many repeated trials had so convinced him
  of this, that he constantly abstained from the former diet
  whilst engaged in diving."
     John Hunter recommends " the conveyance of some
 stimulating substance into the stomach, to rouse this seat of
 universal sympathy.        This operation should be performed
 with all possible expedition, for fear of inducing sickness."
     What this stimulating      substance  should be, he has not
 informed     his readers.    The   mode    of conveyance is by
 means of a spoon, pressing down the tongue, the patient
 being partly elevated.      Among the class of internal stimu
 lants are hartshorn, rum, brandy, and usquebaugh, which
 are powerful stimulants.      But here it should be remembered,
 that the cessation of the actions of parts predispose        them
to be affected by lesser stimuli, and thrown into inordinate
action by any strong stimulus.            Thus, in a frost-bitten
limb, the actions have ceased but the power remains.
Heat only is wanting to call this power into action. But
this   must be gradually applied, or the highest inflamma
tion will ensue, ending in mortification..         So with those
starved    nearly to death by hunger.        Thus may the salu
tary efforts of nature be overpowered by the officiousness
of art, a circumstance we may have frequent occasion to
observe with regret.       Thus,  if  our stimulants   are too po
tent, they may prove destructive, by soon exhausting the
living fibre. We must recollect here, that irritability is
 accumulated, and therefore weak brandy and water is to
be preferred     as the stimulant, as was employed in this
instance.
    I now ordered more blankets to be added        to the former
covering.
    When respiration ceases in      a drowned   or suspended per
son, the power of generating         heat is suspended,, and the,
                                                              body

                    relative to Pneumatic Medicine.                          803
body loses gradually its natural heat, until it be reduced to
the temperature of the surrounding medium.        During this
period, if we attempt to raise the heat to the natural stand
ard by warm pans of coals passed over the bed-clothes, or
heated bottles or bricks applied to the legs and feet, we
are not only        disappointed      in our expectations, but do an
actual    injury.     Thus if   a   snake be taken from his autumnal
hiding-place, and exposed to the sun's rays, or in a warm
room, he quickly shows signs of returning life, and even
increased powers, but he will die from the experiment ;
whereas      another, gradually     stimulated by heat,             according
to his state, will      be restored to full animation.
                                                  Thus by
an ill-judged artificial and continued heat, many destroy
the patient they had wished to save.   But the lungs being
supplied with air, the blood receives the oxygen gas (oxy
gen and caloric in its latent state) which is diffused, to be
decomposed, through innumerable arteries and veins, from
the centre to the extremities.  Thus is the animal heat re
stored,      and communicated throughout the system, and
with more certainty than from any other mode. The most
efficacious method therefore of imparting heat     to excite      is,
the generating causes,              by
                             renewing respiration, and                        by
placing      the    patient betwixt blankets,       which     it   escapes    as
it   becomes       generated, flannel being        a   bad    conductor       of
heat.       To produce    a   quicker evolution        of animal heat,        an
eighteen-gallon cask of oxygen gas was procured, and the
air was taken out of the barrel means of     by
                                           common bel    a
lows,                          of the patient.
          and forced into the lungs
     Eachtime of this process there was an evident im
provement for the better. Our patient became less con
vulsed, and the countenance visibly lost more and more of
that ghastly lividness which was the most alarming sym
ptom.   All the attendants noticed, each time, these very                          ,
salutary changes.

astronomers is, that            of ascertaining the               longitude of places
 by    the transit         of the earth's shadow when the moon                                is
eclipsed. The shadow of the earth coming                                        in   contact
with many known spots,    the observation     if                             be made          in
different    places         at   the      same      time, the     longitude of each
place could        by
                 this .means be ascertained with great preci
sion, provided the spots to be made choice of be sufficiently
represented  and recognised    but there being no faithful

delineation of the moon, and the edges of those spots which
are known being undefined, the observations made have
not been so useful as could be wished    for this purpose,    :                               it
isbelieved, Mr. Russell's labours will be found very useful,
and will very much add to the certainty and precision of
the observations on lunar eclipses; as the chief design
of his planisphere, representing the moon in    state of                        a
opposition to the sun,    directed to (his end, aod which he

   These engravings, it is expected, will not onlv prove of
great utility to the astronomer, but lead to very important

gentleman : — with all that refined taste apd elevated elo

periments and discoveries of Mr. Knight ; of his researches

   experiments proving that all vegetables radicatfe by gravita
  tion only, and not by any instinctive energy, were also no
   ticed ; that new and superior species of apples may be pro
   duced from seed         ;  that impregnating the pollen was found
  to be an advantageous substiture for grafting ; that the author
  has produced a new and highly valuable species                   of pears by
  this means ; and, finally, that in the course               of his numerous
  experiments he had produced and cultivated a new species
  of vines, which bear grapes superior in flavour to any others
  hitherto known, and capable               of arriving   at perfection,    even
  in the most adverse seasons,                in our climate. These, and
  many     other discoveries,           which the learned and eloquent
  President most ably enumerated, with equal elegance anrl
  precision, were the reasons which induced the council of
  the society to award the Copleyan medal to Mr. Knight,
  whose successful labours in this branch of natural history
  have at least equalled, if not surpassed,                those of any other
  philosopher, in developing the osconomy                 of vegetation, and
  the laws of vegetable life.
      We   have to regret that in          ihis slight sketch we       are un
 able to convey any adequate idea of the elegance, spirit,
 and philosophical acumen of this admirable discourse, which
 far excelled        those     of his    predecessor,     the late sir     Johfi
  Pringle, bart.         It  is hoped that      the  Right Hon. President's
 sense    of public utility will overcome every other secondary
 consideration in this case, and that (contrary to his former
 practice) he will suffer his discourse, which is so important
 to agriculture,        to be laid before      the public,    and not confine
 ft to a few fellows         of  the society,     who, from their habits of
 life, however conscious they may                 be  of its merits, are yet
 incapable      of facilitating     the practical application       of the dis
 coveries    and principles which           it unfolds.
la the latter, he shows that many species of apple*, oner highly esteemed!
are now become      extinct ; and that several others have degenerated both in
size aod quality, especially that kind denominated pippins, which in l6-,9
were represented as the largest apples then cultivated, but which at present
do not exceed the dimensions of the wild crab. The scion he considers at
possessing  all the diseased luices of the parent stock, and therefore subject to
decay in a similar manner.

   Dec.   18. The right hon. C. F. Greville, vice-president, in
she   chair.-—  The reading of Mr. Davy's Bakerean lecture
was concluded.        The author took a view of the influence of
electricity  in  the  mineral  kingdom, its action on carburet of
iron (plumbago), and various other mineral bodies hitherto
not sufficiently known or examined : and also its importance
as tending in a great degree to elucidate     many phenomena in
geology,    which    are irreconcilable with received hypotheses.
Mr. Davy likewise mentioned how the application of elec
tricity might    be found extremely advantageous        in the prepay
ration   of acids for economical purposes,        Sec.  &c. In this
interesting lecture, the author particularly noticed the im
portant discoveries of Mr. Peel, and of Pacchiani, relative.
to the formation of alkali and acid, by the electric influence,
and which hive assisted him in exploring a new and untrod
den region    of chemical science, that " holds up        a quarry to
the busy    mind" of future philosophers.
   A paper on " The Precession of the Equinoxes," by Mr.
Robertson, Savilian professor of geometry in the university.
of Oxford, was also read ; in which the author proposed
some new methods of ascertaining, with greater accuracy'
than has been hitherto done, the calculations         of compound
rotatory motion.       The paper contained     seven   mathematical
tables,  of  a nature not to be read.

 one  of which     was a rowel or spur,     which  projected  a little
 more than the others.        The  learned  antiquary supposed this
 ring to have been used as a chaplet or rosario in the days
 of the catholic religion in this country, and that each point
 was to indicate a prayer, as a help to the memory, or to
 those  who could not read.         These chaplets or rosarios are,
however, always divided by tens, and at the end of every
ten Ave Marias, the devotionist says a Pater Noster ; in
 this manner he proceeds till he has said a hundred and fifty
Ave Marias and fifteen Pater Nbslers, which completes the
 number of his prayers, and is what is called " saying his
 rosario."      The rosario is also divided into thirds, at the end
 of which      the  supplicant makes the sign of the cross, and
then continues.        The fact, however, that the points on this
ring are not divisable by tens, militates somewhat against
the opinion of its being a rosario or chaplet.

   This   respectable   society has published its thirteenth year's
report, by which       we are happy to learn that it continues     in
a prosperous state.
   The   papers this year    have   not been numerous, but some
of them have been of considerable importance. In April
(1805), Mr. Clennell read an essay on the expediency of
disclosing the processes of. manufactures, a subject which
                                                                was

was afterwards discussed at some meetings of the society *.—
In May, an essay was read on the nature of style, and the cause9
of its diversity, by Mr. W. Turner, jun. — In August, Mr. G.
Gray gave an account of some experiments on the root of
the crocus vernus,      as a substitute for wheat flour, and pre
sented some specimens        of bread made from that substance.
-—In September, Mr. Turner read a sketch of the history
of the society from its first establishment to the end of its
twelfth year, which was ordered to be printed, as an intro
duction     to a new catalogue      now preparing of the books,
philosophical apparatus, and other property belonging to
the society. — At the November meeting was read a memoir,
by Dr. Fenwick, on the life, character, and professional
merits of the late Dr. Clarke, a worthy and zealous asso
 ciate of this useful body. — In Dec. Mr. Turner read an
 outline of the lectures on optics and astronomy proposed to
 be delivered in the early part of 1806, in the new institu
tion, established under the patronage of the society. At the
 January meeting he communicated several improvements in
 arts, manufactures, and agriculture, with which he had
 been favoured by an ingenious correspondent : and in Feb.
 a  letter inclosing a copy    of the preliminary discourse deli
 vered to the society     of antiquaries   at  Perth, by their presi

     This club, which was instituted in 1793 for encouraging
 the ceconomic feeding of animals of the best kinds for the
 London markets, at their late meetings, during the show of
 fat cattle, have determined on a material alteration of their
  premiums for oxen or steers, in consequence of the Here

  so large a portion    of  the six prizes    annually given for the
  best oxen of different weights. 8cc. without distinction of
  breeds, as probably to discourage other valuable breeds : for
  the ensuing year six prizes, of 20 guineas each, are offered

  the offices of secretary and treasurer to the club, Mr. John
 JF'arey, and Mr. Paul Giblett, were elected thereto.              Thirty-
 one new members were balloted for and admitted.                     Lord
 William Russell presided, and will continue to do so while
 his noble brother remains in his government              of Ireland.

     M.de Beauvois having followed           some mushrooms through
 all their developments, perceived that they changed their
 form in such a manner, that some botanists have placed
 them in different genera, according to the age at which they
 observed them : thus the rizomorphus of Porsoon is only-
 the second age of the mushroom, which becomes a true
 lulet mushroom       in   the   third  ;  the dem atrium      bombianum
 of   the same author becomes         at the end     of some time his
Tnesanlericu    argenlea ; then it thickens, assumes cells which
 make it resemble a morell, and also finishes by becoming a
 true bolet mushroom.         But this plant has need of a little
light to enable it thus to run through all its stages.
    The researches on the natural history of animals                 have
been less numerous than those on botany, but they have not-
been devoid     of interest.
    M.   de Beauvois has begun to publish          the   insects  he col
lected in America      and   on the coast      of Africa.     Two num
bers    of them  have already appeared.
    M.   Cuvier has continued       the two     great   branches   of  re
searches    in which   he has     been    occupied    these   some   years
past, upon animals without vertebrae, and upon the fossil
ossifications of quadrupeds.

tolide, the snail,    the Linnea, and the planorbus. The two
former were very litile known even externally ; and the
author has rectified the false ideas of naturalists concern
ing them.
    In the second hranch he has treated of the fossil bones of
the bear, the rhinoceros, and the elephant.
    Two sorts of bears hitherto unknown have been buried
along with tigers, hyenas, and other carnivorous animals in
a great number of caverns in the mountains of Hungary and
Germany.
    Bones    of  the rhinoceros and elephant     are found in abun
dance in every part of the globe. The author has collected
the names of several hundred places of both continent*
where the fossil bones have been ibund.           (See Philosophical

    M.  Fourcroy     has given a new edition        of his Chemical
 Philosophy ; the shortest, most methodical, and most fre
quently used eleirjentary book in the science.              The two
 principal agents in chemistry, — affinity, which unites the
molecula of bodies, and fire, which separates them, — have
been this year the subject        of new   and important researches.
    We know that        ice is lighter than water,     since it floats
 upon it : on the other hand, warm water is generally lighter
 than cold : But does this liquid always condense in propor
 tion  as it cools, in order suddenly to dilate itself at the iu-
•tant of   its freezing   ?
     We   may doubt this ; and in fact it is not the case       : it is
 tome degrees above the freezing point that water is at its
 maximum of density.            M. le Febvre-Gineau has directly
 proved it these some years past by means of the thermome
 ter and the hydrostatic         balance ; and count    Rumford    has
 suggested    an experiment which makes the fact very evident.
     A thermometer has its bulb placed directly under a tube
 suspended     by a strip of linen, and the whole is placed in
 water ready to freeze. The surface of this water, opposite
 to the opening of the tube, is touched with a body heated
 only to three or four degrees ; the molecules of water heated
 by this contact descend into the tube and act upon the ther-

mometer.               Thus this water, being       a little warmer,          is alsd
heavier.
  This experiment                 rests upon count Rumford's         own theory,
regarding the manner in which                  heat is propagated      in the li
quids.   He thinks that the latter do not conduct it as all the
other solid hodies do ; the rnetals, for instance ; and that the
contact       of       a   warm body only heats the mass of a liquid in
proportion         as the heated     molecules at first elevate themselves
in virtue of               the lightness they acquire,   and    allow      the cold
molecules to occupy their place and be heated in their turn.
   He        has recently given us upon            this doctrine          an experi
ment more delicate and still                  more precise than all the pre
ceding.   A portion of water, heated to 80°, was only sepa
rated from a thermometer placed above it by a layer of cold
water of some lines in thickness : not one of the heated
molecules was able to descend, and the thermometer did not
rise one degree.
   The same chemist has made                     some experiments upon a
question          in        physics  which   nearly concerns the doctrine
of affinity,               or rather'tlie adherence of the molecules of a
liquid with each other.   The follow ing is the manner in
which he renders it palpable.    He places oil upon water,
and drops  into the oil some  very small grains of tin, Of
some very small drops of mercury : these small bodies pass
through the oil quickly enough ; but when they come to the
water, they stop on the surface of                 it,
                                       although much hea-t
vier than the water.   The adherence of the water here forms
something equivalent to   kind of pellicle which supports
                                        a
them   but
         ;    we accumulate them, their mass acquires
                       if                                                          a
weight which surmounts  that adherence, they tear this pel
licle,   and       are precipitated.         The   appearance        of   a   similar
pellicle     is   also formed at the lower surface        ;    for   if    we place
water over mercury, and then drop some globules of the lat
ter into the water, they also stop at the bottom of the water
without mixing with the rest of the mercury, until they have
been enlarged and become heavy enough.         M. Rnmford
adds to these experiments the striking remark, that without
this     adherence the least wind would                  carry off the water
                                                                               from

  away the     dust; that     there   would be dreadful inundations
  every minute ; that the banks of rivers and shores of the sea
  would be uninhabitable, and navigation impossible.
       As to chemical affinities, properly so called, M. Ber-
  thollet   seems    to have    made    that subject his peculiar do
  main, and has imposed new laws upon these affinities, of
  which we have often had occasion to give an account. His
  first memoirs upon this subject have been announced in our
  reports of An 8 and An 9, and his great work Statique Cke-
  mique, where he has consigned all his theory, in that ofAn 1 1 .
      We know that his principal idea consists in not consider
  ing affinity, as was formerly the case, to be an absolute
  power ; nor combinations as always uniform in the propor
  tions of their elements.
      He shows, on     the contrary,    that many circumstances, fo-
'
  reign to the chemical nature        of  the substances placed in con
  tact, — such    as their more or less cohesion, pressure, tempe
   rature,  and,  above  all, their relative quantity, — influence their
  combinations,       both as to the species Aid as to the propor
  tion of the elements        which enter into it.
      There is indeed very seldom any entire separation ; but
   when we prace three substances in contact, for instance,
  there is produced     a mixture,     the one    with  the two others,
   according to the power of the affinities of the latter ; and
   when four substances are put together, if there is a preci
   pitate formed, it must be referred to the indissolubility of
   the combination,      and not to a calculation rigorously appre
  ciable in the sums of the affinities taken two and two.
       We   may easily conceive that such new views, applicable
   as they are to phenomena          so complicated, will     be suscep
   tible for  a long time    of ulterior developments.

             ACADEMY     Of USEFUL SCIENCES AT ERFURT.
       In the sitting of the above academy of the 6th of January
   last, Dr. Thielow, dissector in the anatomical theatre, read
   a memoir upon the oesophagus            of  a man accompanied    with
   •a crop like that   of  a  bird.    He found this anomalous con-

formation in       a   subject of 52 years of age, on the left side of
the lower part        of   the neck.     The base or lower part of this
sac,    which     was     shaped    like a pear, was below the left cla
vicle   ;   and the upper part,          which was wrinkled (effilee),
had     an   aperture      furnished    with    a kind of valve, which
was near the commencement of the gullet.                      Its contexture
had more       density     than the oesophagus.          From the aperture
to the extremity the length             of this crop  was two inches and
a quarter      in   a   relaxed state ; its greatest      diameter was an
inch and three quarters            ; the aperture    was    three-eighths     of
an inch.
    The size of this crop         was considerably increased          by infla
tion.      It might contain about a pound of water ;                and when
filled, the water could not be evacuated without                      a strong
pressure     of "the hand.
    The    meat and drink        taken by this man passed at first into
this sac, and remained there for more than two hours before
passing into the stomach.
     M. Thielow         has   developed     in this memoir the reasons
why this sac may be*considered                as a crop.      He  has given a
description and a draw ing of it in the second edition of his
work upon anatomy and pathologv, published last Easter

of kiting his majesty's hand       on occasion    of his return from
a  voyage   round the world, executed         with the sole object of
 carrying to all the possessions     of  the crown    of Spain situ
ated beyond the seas, and to those of several other nations,
the inestimable gift of vaccine inoculation.         His majesty has
inquired,   with the liveliest interest, into all that materially
related to the expedition,    and learned, with the utmost sa
tisfaction, that its result has exceeded the most sanguine ex
pectations that were entertained at the time of the enterprise.
   This undertaking had been committed to the diligence of
several   members    of the faculty     and    subordinate   persons,
carrying   with them twenty-two           children   who had never
undergone the small-pox, selected for the preservation of
the precious fluid, by transmitting it successively from one
to another during the course of the voyage.             The expedi
tion set sail from Corunna,         under the direction of Balmis,
on the 30th of November        J 803.    It made the first stoppage
at the Canary Islands,      the second      at  Porto-Rico,  and the
third at the Characas. On leaving that province, by the port
of La Guayra, it was divided into two branches : one part
sailing to South America, under the charge of the subdi-
rector don Francis Salvani; the other, with the director
Balmis on board, steering for the Havannah, and thence for
Yucatan. There a subdivision took place: the professor
Francis Pastor proceeding from the port of Sisal to that of
Villa Harmosa, in the province of Tobasca, for the purpose
of propagating vaccination in the district of Ciudad Real of
Chiapa, and on to Goatemala, making a circuit of four
hundred leagues, through a long and rough road,
                                                          comprising
Oaxaca; while the rest of the expedition, which arrived
without accident at Vera-Cruz, traversed not only the vice-
royalty of New Spain, but also the interior provinces •
whence it was to return to Mexico, which was the point of
reunion.
   This precious  preservative against the ravages of the small
pox has already been extended through the whole of North:
America, to the coasts of Sonora and Sina!oa,'and even to

the king and to posterity.
     This being accomplished, it               was     the next care       of   the di
rector to carry this part of the expedition from America to
Asia, crowned with the most brilliant success, and, with                             it,
the comfort of humanity. Some difficulties having been sur
mounted, he embarked in the port o't' Acapulco for the Phi
lippine islands, that being the point at which,   attainable,        if
it was originally           intended that        the    undertaking        should be
terminated.
   The bounty of Divine Providence having vouchsafed to
second the great and pious designs  of the king, Balmis hap
pily performed the voyage in little more than two months,
carrying with him, from New Spain, twenty-six children,
destined to be vaccinated in succession as before    and, as               ;
many      of them were infants, they                   were    committed         to the
care of   the matron         of    the   Foundling Hospital         at   La Corunna,
who,     in   this   as   well     as the   former voyages, conducted her
self in   amanner to merit approbation.       The expedition
having arrived at the Philippines, and propagated the specific
in the islands subject to his catholic majesty, Balmis, hav
ing concluded his philanthropic commission, concerted with
the captain-general the means of extending the beneficence
of  the king and the glory of his august name to the re-
motest confines of Asia.
   In point of fact, the cow-pox has been disseminated
through the vast archipelago of the Visayan islands, whose,
chiefs, accustomed to wage perpetual                    war with us, have laid
dowr their arms, admiring                   the generosity     of   an enemy who
conferred upon them the blessings of health and life at the
time when they were labouring under the ravages of an epi
demic small-pox.  The principal persons of the Portuguese
colonies, and of the Chinese empire, manifested themselves
no less beholden when Balmis reached Macao and Canton                                ;
in   both which           places    he accomplished           the introduction       of
fresh virus in all its activity,               by
                                  the means already related                          ;

tions of matter in the ships of their East India company,
which lost their efficacy on the passage, and arrived inert.
    After having       propagated the vaccine at Canton as far as was
possible     and  the   political circumstances of the empire would
permit, and having confided the further dissemination of it
to    the   physicians of the English factory at the above-men
tioned port, Balmis returned to Macao, and embarked in a
Portuguese vessel for Lisbon, where he arrived on the 15th
of August.         In the way he stopped at St. Helena, in which,
as   in other places, by dint of exhortation and perseverance,
he prevailed upon the English to adopt the astonishing anti
dote, which they had undervalued for the space of more than
eight years, though it was a discovery of their nation, and
though it was sent to them by Jenner himself.
    Of    that branch     of   the expedition    which was destined   for
 Peru, it is ascertained         that it was shipw recked in one of the
mouths of the River de la Magdalena; hut having derived
 immediate succour from the natives, from the magistrates ad
jacent, and from the governor of Carthagena, the subdirector,
 the three members of the faculty who accompanied hini^ and
 the children,       were    saved,   with the fluid in good preserva
 tion, which they extended in that port and its province
 with activity and success.              Thence it was carried to the
 isthmus of Panama, and persons properly provided with all
 necessaries     undertook        the long and painful navigation of
  the River de laMagdalena; separating, when they reached
 the interior,      to discharge their commission       in the towns   of
 TenerjflV,     Mompox, Ocana, Socorro, San Gil y Medellin,
 in   the valley   of Cucuta, and in the cities of Pamplona, Gi-
  ron, Tunja, Velez, and other places in the neighbourhood/
  until they met at Santa Fe ; leaving every where suitable
  instructions for the members of the faculty, and, in the
  more considerable towns, regulations conformable to those
  rules which the director had prescribed for the preservation
  of   the virus,    which     the viceroy affirms to have been com
  municated       to  Jijty   thousand persons without one unfavour
  able result.      Towards ihe close of March 1805, they pre
  pared to continue         their journey in separate     tracks, for the

promptitude over the remaining districts of the viceroyalty,
situated in the road of Popayan, Cucnf a, and Quito, as far
as   Lima. In the August following they reached Guayaquil.
     The result of this expedition has been, not merely to spread
the vaccine among             all people, whether friends or enemies,
among Moors, among Visayans,                and among Chinese, but

director and his coadjutors, appointed to carry these blessings
to Peru, will shortly return by way of Buenos-Ayres, after
having accomplished their journey through that viceroyalty,
the viceroyalty of Lima, and the districts of Chili and Chara-
cas ; and that they will bring with them such collections and
observations     as  they have been able to acquire, according to
the instructions given by the director, without losing sight
of the philanthropic commission which they received from
his majesty in the plenitude        of his   zeal   for the welfare    of
the human race.
                 EXTRAORDINARY        PHENOMENON.
   The most singularly formed individual in the world, pe-
haps, exists at this moment at Void, a town in the second
division of the department of the Meuse. The writer of this
article vouches for the truth       of it :  the facts are supported
by the    testimony of       respectable    medical    gentlemen, the
mayor of the town, and personal examination of this ex
traordinary man.
   This unfortunate being enjoys good health, although de
prived of the ordinary means of voiding his excrements. He
has lived more than half a century, notwithstanding                   his
mouth performs by turns the labours of mastication and
dejection.      Being thus deprived in a manner of all the parts
of the body from the chest downwards, he constantly sits in
a small cart, which is drawn by children through the streets,
and he subsists by begging.
   His name       is Claud   Rouget,   a native and       inhabitant    of
Void,    and he     is 59 years  of age. In his youth he expe
rienced   a  gradual    and long continued compression.             This
compression was felt from the xiphoid chrtilage and over
the w hole extent of the lower belly, so that the pylorus, all
the viscera of that region, such as the intestines, the liver,
the spleen, the kidneys, the bladder, the glands of the pan
creas and    of the mesentery, and all the secretory        organs, ex
perienced    such an alteration, that they are as       if totally anni
hilated.    The abdomen      is glued to the spine     of the back ; all
                                                                      the

the lower extremities are atrophous ; the anus is obliterated
and quite close.
  This unfortunate individual only prolongs his existence
by means of the glands of the stomach, which pump up a
alight portion        of chyle, diluted by the salivarygastric         and
juices. In half a quarter of an hour after having taken food,
 he voids it by the mouth, in the state of a thick emulsion,
with as much and even more ease than by the ordinary me
thod.     The bile, this animal             soap and        the glands       of the
lower belly, not concurring to the extraction of the nutritive
parts of his food, the voiding of it is thus facilitated, and
obliges him to eat frequently.
   This simple account of it may excite surprise and curi
osity ; but we presume that such of our readers as are de-
Toted  to the study of nature will make some observations
on the subject. — Magazin Encyclopedique, 1806, tome i.

                     ART OF MEMORF,
   Germany. — A new branch of science is begun to be stu
died in Germany.  It is the science called by the antients
mncmonica, or the art            of memory.          We find in Herodotus,
that it   was carefully taught and practised         in blgypt, whence it
was transplanted into Greece.               This historian attributes the
invention of it to Simonides ; but this opinion is refuted in
a dissertation published by M. Morgenstern,       of Dorpat,
upon mncmonica.     He there asserts, that this science is
more intimately connected with the Egyptian hieroglyphics
than is generally thought, and that this connection may
help to explain them. However the case may be, this sin
gular art, so long neglected, has reappeared in Germany
with some eclat. M. Aretin, who may be accounted the
restorer of      has recently had M. Kaestner,

 XLV.     Discovery   of a new Vegetable Principle in Asparagus
   (Asparagus sativus of Linnceus).            By M. VAUGUELIN*.
 \Jn examining      the products     of the.vegetah!e       kingdom more
attentively than was formerly the custom, modern chemists
have distinguished a great number of products unknown to
the antients; but for a long time no immediate principle has
been found in any vegetable         so singular and interesting         as
that which we are about to mention.
    Last summer M. Robiquet,           a young        chemist who joins
to a solidity  of reasoning      the greatest       accuracy in making
experiments, by desire      of  M.   Parmentier submitted the juice
of asparagus to the chemical analysis, of which he has given
the results in the 4nnales de Chlmle^.
    During a journey I lately took to the country, having left
in my laboratory a certain quantity of the juice of asparagus
concentrated by evaporation, I observed in it a great variety
of crystals, two of which varieties appeared to belong to new
substances : as they had a diiferent form, transparency, and
taste, it was easy to separate them.
    The one of   these species, perfectly white and transparent
when it had crystallized several times, has a fresh'taste, a
little nauseous, exciting the secretion of the saliva : it is
hard, brittle, and has      a regular form.
    The other  species, although equally white, is not so trans
parent nor so hard, nor is it crystallized in the same form ;
on the contrary, it is without consistency, crystallized in
fine needles, having a perceptible saccharine taste, and ana
logous to that of manna.
    M. Robiquet, on making the experiments above men
tioned, had perceived the former of these substances ; but
he thought it was an ammoniacal salt ; because at that time,
having only obtained a very small quantity and imperfectly
purified, it retained, to all appearance, among its flakes some
traces of a salt with a base of ammonia, with which the juice
of  asparagus  abounds ; and this circumstance deceived him.

290              New     Vegetable      Principle in Asparagus.
  Since that period M. Robiquet and myself jointly sub
mitted this substance to new experiments, the principal of
which are subjoined. The form which it assumes in its
crystallization, according to M. Haiiy, to whom we sent a
certain quantity, springs from a straight rhomboidal prism,
the grand angle of the base of which is about 130 degrees.
   This substance is soluble in water in a middling degree,
and its solution        no sign of acidity or alkalinity : the
                             gives
infusion of galls, the acetate of lead, the oxalate of ammo
nia, the muriate of barytes, and the hydrosulphuret of pot
ash, cause no change in the solution of this substance                                     ; and
it is not soluble in alcohol.
   These experiments indicating that the substance in ques
tion is not a salt with an earthy base, we triturated a certain
quantity of it with caustic potash and a little water, to see
if ammonia was disengaged                       from it ; but we discovered no
sensible traces : the potash,                 as we thought, rendered it more
soluble in water.
  Seeing, therefore, that it contained neither an earth nor
any ammonia, we endeavoured to ascertain the existence of
the alkalis in           it,   and    for this purpose we burned     great             a
qaantity      of   it   in   a   platina crucible    swelled considerably,
                                                          ;   it
at first exhaling pungent vapours,                            which        affected    the eyes
and nostrils like            the smoke        of wood
                                                  furnished plenty ot
                                                              ;   it
charcoal which had no taste,          and which upon incineration
left but     a   very imperceptible trace of earth, which   certainly             is
foreign to it.
   Towards the end      the decomposition of this substance,
                                  of
the smell which     liberated from
                             is           little analogous to
                                                          it      is   a
that of animal matters, and      likewise little ammoniacal.
                                            it   is                    a

   It is not      a neutral salt, since it contains neither an earth
nor an alkali      ;    but      as   it furnishes,         by means     of fire, the
same      products     as the vegetables,             we are obliged to regard it
as an immediate principle                   of   asparagus.
  It   is probable that it is composed, like the vegetable pro
ducts,    of hydrogen, oxygen,                 in particular pro
                                                 and carbon,
portions : it is not less probable that there is also a small
quantity of azote in it ; this seems at least to be indicated by
the smell which is disengaged from it by heat, and by the
ammonia which it forms with the nitric acid.
  Although        we obtained a sufficiently large quantity                    of this
substance, we could not submit it to                       a great   number   of expe
riments, because the greatest part of it was wasted in the la
boratory ; and the small quantity we gave M. Haiiy to deter
mine the form          of it only          remained    :    we purpose   continuing
our researches         as   soon
                         the asparagus season returns, but
                                      as
we thought it our duty to give an account of our progress
hitherto.
  We shall         ascertain whether or no this singular sub
                  also
stance exists in other vegetables.
  As          saccharine matter which we also found in the
         to the
juice of asparagus, we had not enough of it toi recognise
what kind of sugar it was ; m the mean time we are of opi
nion that it is manna.
  It may        be concluded from the above experiments,   that,
besides      principles discovered in asparagus by M. Robi-
           the
quet, there exists a principle crystallizable like the salts,

other saccharine principle, which seems to have an analogy
with manna.

second part     of their work                  by a very ingenious                 and   just   ob
servation.      "   The action of bodies upon light," they                                      say,
" is not exercised           in a sensible manner except at very short
distances   :   the intensity       of this action is necessarily con
nected with the nature                 of        the particles           of    the bodies, and
with their arrangement                 ;       that is to say, with their most in
timate properties : so that the philosopher who observes the
refractive powers of substances in order to compare them
with each other, acts exactly like the chemist who presents
one and the same base successively to all the acids, or one
and the same acid to all the alkalis, in order to determine
their respective powers and their degrees of saturation.    Id
our experiments the substance we present to all the bodies
is light, and we compute the action which they exercise
upon it by their refractive power ; that is to say, by the in
crease   of effect which the action of their particles                                   tends to
impress on them.
  " There is here particular advantage, which is not to be

it is the almost inconceivable intensity of the action of
bodies upon light, an intensity which sometimes goes the
length of impressing upon      in an infinitely small instant

  The diversity of the velocities impressed upon light by
the various retracting bodies presents  very extensive scale,  a
upon intermediate points of which all these may find place                               a

     The authors of        the memoir,     having ascertained by their
  experiments the powerful           action of hydrogen upon light,
  naturally infer from this, that it is the presence of this prin
  ciple in water, in gums, oils, and other inflammable sub
  stances,     which gives them that great refractive power which
  Newton has so well observed.            This refracting influence of
  hydrogen      is  eminently conspicuous in ammonia, which is
  composed of hydrogen and azote ; the refractive power                 of
  this gas being double that of the air, and surpassing that            of
  water.
     The    great velocity, and the extreme tenuity       of the mole
 cules    of light, give it a particular advantage in this mode of
 research, where it is employed as a re -agent, the greater or
 less degree     of condensation of    the constituent principles of a
 body having        little influence   upon its refractive power in
 comparison with that produced by the affinity of these same
 principles with light, excepting certain extraordinary            cases
 in which the condensations are very considerable. In              every
 case, by multiplying the refractive power of each principle
 by the ponderous quantity which enters into the combina
 tion, the sum of these products gives the refractive power
 of  the compound.
    In a simple mixture, without intimate combination among
the component parts, the refractive power observed In the                  .
 compound is exactly equal to that which the calculation
gives according to the proportion          of the constituent    princi
ples   ;  thus the refraction    of the common air     is exactly equal
to what ought to be produced by a mixture of 0-21 of oxy
gen in volume with 0'787 of azote and 0-003 of carbonic
acid.      By calculating the refraction according to the rela
tive quantity of these        principles,  we obtain it   as  exactly as
by direct observation.
    This law holds in combinations in which condensation is
not very strong : for instance, in ammoniacal gas, in which
the constituent principles, the azote and the hydrogen, are
reduced to one-half of their total volume by the effect of
condensation,       the refraction observed    is exactly what agrees
with     a mixture    of 0-805 of azote (in weight),
                                                   "      and  of 0-195

of hydrogen.     Thus supposing that the composition of am
monia was unknown, but that barely the nature of its prin
ciples was known, their relative proportion might be disco
vered by the proof of their refractive power as well as by
chemical analysis.
   And in water composed of hydrogen and oxygen, in which
there is a strong, intimate, and very dense combination re
latively to its component parts, the same law still holds,
with some slight difference only, which may arise either
from the uncertainty even of the experiment which Newton
himself  made to determine the refractive power        of water    at
a lime when the necessary instruments were much less per
fect than they are at present, or rather from the influence
of the state of condensation of the molecules of the liquid
compared with the state of gaseous dilatation.        Thus the re
fractive power of water, calculated according to the propor
tions given by Humboldt and Gay-Lussac in their excellent
memoir    upon eudiometry, is = 1-50, that of the atmo
spheric air heing 1 . But according to Newton, and by em
ploying for the mean refraction that of yellow light, it would
be = 1 '73 ; stronger than the preceding by about one-eighth
of the total value. Far from being astonished at this dif
ference, we ought to be surprised that it is not more con
siderable, when we reflect upon the enormous condensation
experienced by oxygen and hydrogen thus combined.
   After having    proved the exactitude    of this new  process  of
analysis by a comparison of its results with those already
obtained by the ordinary chemical analysis, it became inter
esting to endeavour to apply it to the solution of the grand
aenigma   of the composition      of the muriatic acid.    The   au
thors therefore    proved, not without great difficulties in the
manipulation,    its refractive power in the state of gas. They
found it a little more considerable than that of azote      ; which
proves  that  the  above  acid   is not a compound    of azote and
oxygen, since the presence of the latter principle would di
minish instead of augmenting the refraction of the former.
Nor is it  an oxide   of hydrogen     less oxygenated than in wa
ter, as has been supposed      from some late Galvanic experi

Tbents   ;  for its refraction is much weaker than that of this
liquid.
    The proof of      the refracting power    of the carbonic acid gas
was douhly interesting,        as a confirmation     of the analysis of
Lavoisier,     as well as because carbon enters       into  the compo
sition of    a great number of transparent bodies, and consti
tutes, according to modern experiments, almost the whole
body of the diamond, the refractive power of which has been
remarked by Newton; a result which might be compared
with that obtained from experiments upon carbonic acid gas.
    Here an anomaly presents itself. The refractive power
of the carbonic acid gas is a little less than that of the atmo
spheric air, and a little greater than that of oxygen.            If we
admit as the most probable chemical constitution of this
gas that which results from the analysis of Lavoisier, we
shall ascertain that it is composed of 0-76 in weight of oxy
gen and of 0'24 of carbon.           It results from this that the re
fractive power of carbon is = 1-44 ; that is to say, less than
that of water. Every other proportion, into which less ox
ygen entered,      would give to carbon a refractive power still
weaker.
    If this  result gave rise to doubts upon the proportion ad
mitted     above,     between the two components of carbonic
acid, we might verify it by this simple method — by exa
mining if the refractive power of certain liquid or solid sub
stances into which carbon enters in a known proportion,
with other component parts, of which               the relative propor
tion and      the   individual   refractive power have been deter
mined    ;  by examining,      we say, whether the refractive power
of   these   really agrees with the results of the calculations
founded upon the analysis of Lavoisier, which are presumed
to be exact.
   We    have as yet, unfortunately,        but a very small number
of accurate analyses of those substances into which carbon
enters in a remarkable quantity.           These analyses have been
made     by Lavoisier, Berthollet,        Fourcroy, and Vauquelin.
We     have also the observations        of Newton upon the refrac
tive powers     of compounds.

  Thus, according to Lavoisier, oil of olives is composed
of 0-21 of hydrogen (in weight), and 0-79 of carbon. Bat
on combining according to these relations the refractive
force of hydrogen as it results from the observations of the
authors of the memoir, and that of carbon, as concluded
from the trial made on carbonic acid, we find the refractive
force of the oil of olives to be = 250, that of the air being 1.
But Newton's observations give                  2-73 for the refractive power
of oil of olives. The difference                between       calculation and ob
servation         therefore, scarcely one-ninth of the total value
                 is,                                                                ;

proportions,  the refractive power  of  alcohol    found upon          is
calculation to be = 1-94,              that of the air being 1.             But    the
experiments of Newton give = 2-23 for alcohol.    The dif
ference  one-eighth of the total amount but the difference
            is                                                ;
of the results may be explained                     by
                                      condensation of the

change from the gaseous to the liquid state.    In the last
place, the chemical analysis of gum given     Messrs. Four-       by
croy and Vauquelin admits of trying the refractive analysis
of the same solid as verification of this new process. Ac
                              a
cording to these chemists, gum    composed of 0-6538 of
                                                   is
oxygen, O'l 154 of hydrogen, and 0-2308 of carbon.  From
this the refractive power of gum deduced from calculation
would be =          r63 according to Newton
                          ;                       = 1-89. The it   is
difference       of about one-seventh  again, in   is
                                                 some  measure,
favourable to the explanation given.
   The want of an exact analysis of other substances into
which carbon enters, does not allow us to push the parallel
of the two methods any further.                         But we may
                                                  say that in.
these  very substances the refractive powers observed place
them in the order indicated                  by
                                  the combined influence of
their elements. Thus the refraction     strongest where hy
                                                         is
                                                                                drogen

        and on the refractive Powers     of different Gases.     SQ7
drogen predominates, weakest where carbon prevails, and
still weaker where oxygen abounds. Thus ether refracts
more than alcohol ; and the essence of turpentine more than
the fixed oils  :  carburetted hydrogen refracts less than pure
hydrogen, and so much the less as the proportion of car
bon is increased in it. These views, which by themselves
furnish but a very slight induction, assume some importance
when they agree with the results obtained by a rigorous cal
culation.
    But the diamond here presents a very great exception.
The experiments of Newton give as its refractive power
= 3-2119, that of the air being 1 ; this amount is almost
double   of that just now    assigned to carbon.    Condensation to
the solid state will not explain so great a difference      ;  for in
gum, for instance, which is also a solid, we do not         see that
this circumstance has an influence equally disproportioned :
wax, which is equally solid, ought to refract much more
than oil of turpentine, for it contains also more carbon ; ne
vertheless it refracts much less, and far less, for a stronger
reason, than the diamond.
    " What    ought we to conclude," say the authors,
                                                              " from
the detail we have given       ?  Is not the- diamond a pure car
bonate ? and does not its great refractive power display the
presence   of hydrogen, the most energetic of all other bodies
in   the power   of refraction?"
    It would be necessary, according to the experiments of
Newton, that      the diamond should contain more than a third
of its weight of hydrogen, in order to explain, by                 the
presence of this ingredient, its great refractive power.             If
 we want to reduce this number          proportionally to the small
 differences remarked between the calculation and the theory,
 we should carry it to one-fourth, but we cannot descend
 lower   without     being  in opposition     to  all the other re
 sults.
    The authors, on this occasion,       request the first class of
 the Institute to repeat, by a direct experiment, the analysis
 of the diamond with all the precaution which should attend
 their suspicions     of the   presence  of hydrogen.     Wc know
                                                                  that

      In the mean time              they invite chemists to continue their
scrupulous researches into the composition of bodies. " On
our part," they add, " we shall neglect nothing in order
to multiply our observations upon solid bodies, liquids,
and aeriform fluids             ;    we may still owe some
                                    and perhaps
useful result to the happy analogy unfolded to us by Newton.
These researches seem already sufficiency advanced to pre

   The authors remark that the results they have obtained
are very          favourable to the system of the emission of light,
and appear            to be contrary to that of the undulations of
light.        "   In fact," they say,        " in
                                    the first system one should
conceive that the refracting powers of compounds ought to
depend on those of their principles.        The combination of
the attractive powers should take place proportionally to the
masses    and the little influence of condensation only proves
            ;
the prodigious relative distance of the particles of light, as
well as their extreme tenuity relative to the molecules of
bodies and to the distances which separate them; circum
stances       which        are already indicated     by   many other pheno
mena. But           if.   we supposed   with Huyghens         and the partisans
of his doctrine, that light  produced   is              by
                                          the vibrations of                        a
very elastic substance, without transmission   of substance,

pounds with their component parts      the condensation or

the dilatation of the mediums ought necessarily to have                            a
very complicated influence upon the progress, the direction,
and     the   velocity of the numerous waves which are propa
gated   :   and what would not this influence be in the passage
from the gaseous to the liquid state, when the constituent
principles are collected under  volume two or three thou

sand    times less than their primitive volume? in the same
manner      as takes place, for instance, in the composition of
water."
    The well-known phenomena of (he prismatic dispersion
of light, a dispersion which varies in general with the re
fractive powers of the mediums, are also connected with the
chemical composition of bodies, and seem to indicate that
their molecules have an action a little unequal over that of
light:    this same      inequality may arise from a method of
analysis analogous to that now developed, but still more
subtle ; and by observing the dispersion which takes place
in liquids, from it       we might infer what would take place             in
the component gases if their smallncss of density permitted
its effect to be appreciable.           Thus we should have, for in
stance, the dispersive power of the atmospheric air accord
ing to that of the oxygen and the azote observed in the li
quid composed of these two gases.
    The labours of which        we have     now given an account are
as applicable to astronomy as they are to chemistry.                    The
refractive force of the atmospheric air, which is given by
 these experiments, is one of the most delicate elements of
the theory of refractions.          It is capable of being determined
in two ways ; by a great number of celestial observations,
and by the direct and terrestrial method employed by our
authors.       M.   Delambre,     to whom      astronomy is so much
indebted, has just published on this subject new researches
for his solar tables according to the formulae of M. de La
place ; and the coefficient he has deduced from the compa
 rison of more than 500 observations is that which has been
 employed in the Mecaniqne Celeste.               But it happens, by a
very remarkable coincidence,            and   well   calculated to merit
 confidence, that one single terrestrial observation of our au
 thors is sufficient to give the coefficient of M. Delambre                  :
 not one of them differs from it in any sensible measure ; and
 the mean result deduced from their aggregate would not pro
 duce   a  difference   of one-eighth of a second upon        the position
 of  the stars   observed at 45° of altitude *.

the reduction of observations.         Thus the tables of refraction
published by      the  Board   of Longitude   in France, and which
are founded       upon this law, upon the coefficient of M. De-
lambre, and upon the beautiful analysis of M. de Laplace,
may be regarded as being as perfect as astronomers can ever
require.
    Lastly, the coefficient of      the  barometer,    as well  as  the
exact relation     of the specific gravities of the air and mercury,
is a determination of some utility to astronomers, since upon
that depends the height of the atmosphere (being supposed
homogeneous), a height which is one of the elements              of the
 theory of refractions.
    " We     iare of opinion," the authors conclude,        "  that we
may still deduce from our researches one other important
truth : but it is requisite that we should recall the general
 results found by naturalists and chemists upon the nature
 and constitution of the atmosphere.
    " Mr.    Cavendish is the first who endeavoured to establish
 that the proportions of the two elements of the atmospheric
 air were constant, in spite of the distance of places and the
difference of temperatures.          The observations since made
 by M. de Many in Spain, M. Berthollet in Egypt and in
 France, Mr. Davy in England, and by Beddoes on the air
 brought from the coast of Guinea, have confirmed this grand
 result.    But one of the finest experiments made on this sub
ject is that of Gay-Lussac, who, having been elevated alone
 in a balloon to the height of 6900 metres, the greatest ever
 attained by any person, brought some atmospheric air from
 these regions.       This air, being analysed on his return, com
 paratively with that on the surface of the earth, gave the
 same    principles in the same proportions : this proves that
 the chemical constitution of the atmosphere at these great
.heights is the same as at the surface of the earth. This re
 sult has been since confirmed by the experiments made by
 Messrs. Humboldt and Gay-Lussac on eudiometry.                    The
 air of the surface of the earth, analysed at different days, at
 various hours and temperatures, presented no change in its
 composition: it always contained 0-21 of oxygen in volume,
                                                                 0-787

had occasion to verify this grand law of nature in a journey
we made to the Alps last year.      The atmospheric air, ana
lysed in places the most distant from each other, in deep val- i
leys and on high mountains, on the banks of the lake of Ge
neva and at Neufchatel, in the glacieresof Chamouny, at Col
de Baume, in the Valais, upon the great St. Bernard, at                         Turin,
and at Grenoble,          always presented to us the same compo
sition.          But since we have found that the refractive power
of the air corresponds to that of                    the constituent        principles
which compose                it,   and that   it   may be deduced         from them
exactly,         it   also   results from this fact,          that this refractive
power       is   the same over all the world at equal densities                 ;   and
thus the tables of refraction, calculated                     by   the geometricians
and the astronomers of Europe, may extend, without modi
fication, to all the countries in the world, provided that the
refractive power of the air       not changed by the effects of
                                              is

     Mr. Peak mentions, still more recently, some bones found
 in Salisbury Plain, near Bristol, and in the Isle of Dogs*.
 Dom Calmet, in his Dictionary of the Bible, speaks of a
 giant found in the neighbourhood of Salisbury, near the
 famous Stonehenge.
     Pennant procured two grinders and a tusk from Flint
 shire. They were extracted, by some miners, from under
 a lead mine       1 18  feet deep,    in  a bed  of  gravel ; and among
 the upper layers there was one of calcareous stone 10 or 12
 feet thick : a stag's horn was found along with them.                      I
 suspect much that this position has not been well described ;
 it is, perhaps, the only one of its kind.
    Ireland has furnished elephant bones in its southern parts.
There were four fine jaw-bones dug up in 1713 at Magher-
ry, eight miles from Beltarbet, in digging the foundations
of   a mill t-
    Scandinavia,      although extremely unfit to breed living ele
phants, contains plenty of fossil ones.
    M. Ouensel, superintendant of the cabinet of natural his
tory of the Academy of Sciences at Stockholm, has had the
goodness to send me the drawing of a large lower jaw in the
above cabinet: it was found in a hillock of sand, near the
river   Jic, in   Ostrobothnia.
    J. J.  Doebeln has already described             some    gigantic bones
dug up, in 1733, at Falkenberg,              in the province    of Halland.
To judge of them from the drawings, they must be a first
rib, a metacarpal bone, and a nondescript bone of an ele
phant.
    The giants' bones dug up in Norway, spoken of by Pon-
toppidan in his Natural History of Norway, must be no
thing else than elephants' bones.
    Thomas Bartholin speaks of an elephant's jaw-bone which
was sent from Iceland to Resenius, and given by the latter
to the cabinet of the university of Copenhagen.                   It was pe
trified into silex.
    Sloane had some in his cabinet altered in the same man
ner; but he has not informed us of the cause of it.

 a tooth found in Iceland of a prodigious size.
    Of all the countries in the world, the vast empire of Russia
contains    the   greatest    quantities of fossil bones, particu
larly in those provinces where we might least expect to find
them, the frozen regions of Siberia.
    Russia   in Europe       contains     great   quantities   in  several
places;   an immense quantity was found              in   1775 at   Swija-
towski,    17  wersts from Petersburg.
   There is in the Petersburg cabinet           a tusk from the neigh
bourhood of Archangel, in the valley of the Dwina.                   Cor-
neille lc Brun mentions some tusks found near the surface
of the ground     at Vorones upon the Tanais.            There is an im
mense    collection of them,       as  well as  of the bones    of various
other animals, upon the banks of the Tanais, near the town
of Kostyusk.
   M.   Pallas, in his recent travels through the southern pro
vinces of Russia, mentions several place.; between the Tanais
and the   Wolga    ;  particularly the environs       of Pensa, and two
other places nearer the Wolga.
   As to Asiatic Russia properly so called, the testimony of
travellers and naturalists agrees in representing that region as
swarming with fossil elephants.
   This phenomenon          is so general there, that the inhabitants
have   invented a fable to explain it ; ar.d they tell us that
these bones and tusks belong to a subterraneous animal living
in the manner of the mole, but ncttr being permitted to see
the light of day. They have named this animal mammont,
or mammouth according to some, from the word mamma,
which signifies earth in some Tartar idioms                ; according to
others, from the Arabian          word Ithemoth,        employed in the
book of Job for a large unknown animal, or mehemoth, an
epithet which the Arabs arc accustomed to add to the name
of elephant (Jilil) when it is        very large.
   They describe      the  tusks    found    in Russia by the appella
tion of mammont horns [mammonlo vafiast) : these tusks arc
so numerous and so well preserved,            particularly iu the south

portant, that the czars formerly reserved the monopoly                    of it
to themselves.
    It was the profit they produced              which perhaps excited the
searching       for them,     and    which     occasioned  the discovery of
so many of these bones in that vast country; adding to
these circumstances, that the immense rivers                 which run into
the Frozen Sea, and which are prodigiously swelled at the
time of a thaw, and carry away large portions of their
banks ; and thus every year immense quantities of bones
are discovered,        besides    those which        are found   in digging

    We ought not          to believe       that these animals have been
simply led from India by the rivers of the neighbouring
mountains, because this would still take place at the present
day,    as  lately observed by a respectable author*.
    M.   Pallas informs us that there is not in all Asiatic Rus
sia, from the Don or the Tanais to the extremity of the pro
montory of the Tchutchis, any brook or river upon the banks
or beds of which elephants' bones, and those of other ani
mals foreign t0 the climate,              have not been found.
    But   the higher regions,           and the    primitive and schistous
chains of mountains, want them,                   as well as marine petrifi-
pations, while the lower declivities and the vast sandy plains
furnish them wherever they are intersected by brooks or
rivers, which proves that they would be found in abundance
in   the rest    of their extent       also  if  dug for.
    There is but very few elephants' bones in such places a»
 are low and marshy : thus the river Ob, which flows some
 times through low and marshy forests, only contains them
 fn such places
                       " ubi adjacentes colles arenosi praeruptam
 ripam efficiunt."         Strahlenberg made the same observation,
 several years ago upon the manner in which these bones arc
 brought to light in consequence of inundations.
     They are found in every latitude, and it is from the north
 that the best ivory comes, because it has been less exposed
 to the action of the elements.

abundance, excludes every idea of expeditions conducted by
men        is,
       that in some places these bones are mixed with an
innumerable quantity of bones                     of other     savage animals large
and small.
     What        is   still more remarkable is, that they are often found
in   beds filled         with marine bodies, such as shells, &c. The
above      is    an extract     of the details of M. Pallas.
   One particularity not less striking than any other related
to us      by
        this great naturalist is, that in some places elephants'
bones have been found having still some fragments of flesh
attached  to them. The general opinion of the people of Si
beria      is,
          that mammonts have been dug up covered with skin
and flesh, and still bleeding: this an exaggeration; but
                                                    is                                   it
arises from the circumstance of the flesh being sometimes
found preserved            by
                     the frost.
   Isbrand-Ides speaks of      head the flesh of which was pu
                                      a

near Vilhorci, in 1771, with all the flesh, skin, and hair
belonging to it. We are indebted to M. Pallas for        cir                     a
cumstantial description of this phaenomenon; and the head
and feet of   are still preserved at Petersburgb, These facts

  To these general remarks we shall subjoin    cursory view           a
of   the principal places         in Russia where fossil              bones have been
discovered.
     We     have       already mentioned          those       found     in   the beds   of
the Wolga         ;  we may add those between the Wolga and the
Swiaga,          and those along the banks of the Kama, where they
are mixed with marine shells              ;   those      of   the riverIrguis, and
the bones given    M. Macquart to the
                            by                                  Council of Mines,

mur, brought from Casan by            the astronomer  Delille, and
described   by Daubenton *.
   M.   Pallas gives a long list of bones, tusks, and elephants*
and rhinoceros' teeth sent from the government of Casan to
Petersburgh in 1776 and 1779, and which also come from
the banks of the Swiaga.
   The French journals recently contained an account of a
complete skeleton found in the territory of Struchow, in the
government of Casan.
   The   beds  of the  Ob  are full of them. The people of Sa-
inoieda bring great quantities of them 'continually for sale at
Beresova : they collect them in the immense naked plains
•which   extend   to the Frozen Sea, and which are also filled
with shells.     There is an immense heap of bones at         Kut-
schewaskoi, upon the Ob.
   The Irtisch, one of      the principal branches   of  the Ob,  is
perhaps the river which has afforded the most ; as well as its
tributary rivers, the Tobol, the Toura, and the Isette.        The
two latter, which descend from the eastern range of the
Oural mountains, often afford          these bones mixed  with ma
rine productions.
   Strahlenberg speaks of an entire head, of four feet and a
half long, brought from Tumen upon the Toura. The Tom,
another tributary of the Ob, has furnished plenty of them,
as  well as the  Keta.
   An entire skeleton has been found upon the banks of the
former, between Tomsk and Kafnetsko, by Messerschmidt.
   Fossil bones have been found upon the Alei, and even at
the foot of these mountains so rich in mines, from which
several branches of the Ob derive their source.           M. Pallas
asserts  that there was a grinder taken from a mine in the
famous mountain of the Serpents, and found along with
some antient marine productions.
   The   beds  of  the Jenissca    has furnished them at all times
near Krasnojark,     whence   M. Pallas received a grinder. They
are to be found even so far north as the 70th degree of north
latitude, below Selakino, that is to say, very near the Frozen

Sea.       The        above naturalist         also    names     the Angara,      other
wise called the Great Tombuska,   among the rivers where
they have been dug up. Messerschmidt and Pallas mention
the Chatanga also, a river which falls into the Frozen Sea
between the Jenissea and the Lena. Isbrand-Ides and Jean
Bernhard Muller mention Jakutsk, upon the Lena ; and the
Academy of Petersburg!! is in possession of a rhinoceros'
cranium         found      not far from the mouth                  of this river, with
almost the whole skeleton.
  The Vilhoui, which falls into          the Lena, and upon the
banks      of   which this whole rhinoceros was found, is certainly
not devoid            of elephants'      bones-.
   Upon adding to all these places the shores of the Kolyma
and the  Anadir, spoken of by Pallas, we shall find that there
is not a spot in Siberia which does not contain elephants'
bones. But what will appear, without doubt, still more ex
traordinary than all we have related, is, that of all places in
the world, certain islands in the Frozen Sea, to the north
of Siberia, contain the                  greatest       quantity   of elephants' and
other bones.
   The island which is nearest to the continent is 36 leagues
long.
       " The whole island," says the editor of Billing's Voy
age, "with the exception of three or four small rocky moun
tains, is a mixture              of     sand   and ice ; so that when            a    thaw
melts a part of the shore, abundance                        of   teeth    and bones      of
the mammont are found.
     " All      the    island,"    he adds,        " according      to the expression
of the engineer, is formed of the bones of this extraordinary
animal, of horns and craniums of the buffalo, or of an ani
mal resembling             it,    and    some      rhinoceros' horns."           This,   is
certainly  very exaggerated description,
                a                                                  but   it   proves how
very abundant these bones are.
     Another island,             five leagues         further off than the former,
and       12 leagues      long, has also plenty of teeth and bones;
but    a   third,      at 25 leagues to the northward,showed none of
them.
     It   may be that the south                of Asia furnishes         these bones    in
as great abundance as the north.

 tain fossil elephanvs' bones are, the sea of Aral and the
 shores of the Jaxartcs.         Daubcnton mentions a petrified
 fragment of a grinder from the shores of this lake ; and
 Pallas asserts that the people of the country bring to market
 ivory from the neighbourhood of this river.
    In general it may be remarked, what is very singular,
that none of these bones are dug up in such climates as we
 know to   be inhabited by elephants at the present time,        while
 they are so common      in latitudes where they could not exist
 at present.
    Have none    of them    been ever buried in the latter places     ?
 Has   heat decomposed      them   ?  or, when they have been dis
covered, have they been neglected, from being ascribed to
the animals of the country, and nothing extraordinary ob
served about them ?        Naturalists who intend visiting the
torrid zone, have a very important subject of inquiry before
them.
    It would seem, at least, that fossil bones have been seen
in Barbary, where there        are no elephants     of any kind at the
present day.
    Without mentioning        the giant's tooth seen by saint An
thony    upon  the shores  of  Utica, and which was as large as a
hundred of the human teeth of the present day, the skele
ton of the giant dug up by some Spanish slaves near Tunis,
in 1559, must have been that of an elephant, more particu
larly as a second skeleton was dug up at the same place in
 1 630, which   was certainly that    of an elephant,    as was ascer
tained by Peyresc *.
    In order to complete the history of fossil elephants, it is
necessary to inquire if they are to be found in America, a
country where no living ones have been discovered since it
was known to the Europeans, and where these animals
surely could not have been destroyed by the weak and small
population    which    occupied that continent         previous to its
discovery by the Europeans.
    Buffon has already advanced the doctrine of the existence
of these bones in South America, and, as he asserts, in that
                      * Gastcndi'  Life of Peyresc.
                                                                  part

part  of it alone. We know, also, that he imagined as the
cause of their extinction in that continent, the impossibility,
from the place where they lived, of their passing the isthmus
of Panama when the gradual increase of cold weather forced
them towards the south, as if the whole of Mexico was not
still warm enough for them to live in.
   To conclude ; the facts upon which Buffon rested his hy
pothesis are not entirely accurate. The bones which were
discovered in America in his time were not those of the ele
phant;       they belonged to another animal which we have now
distinguished by the name of mastodonta, and which is also
known by the name of the animal of the Ohio.
  But there              are certainly proofs      of the existence of real           ele
phants' bones in America at this moment : several recent
authors testify this. Mr. Rembrandt Peale, in his Historical
Disquisition on the Mammoth, says that jaw-bones have
been  found in Kentucky completely similar to those of Si
beria, but in small number, in a state of decomposition,
and unaccompanied with other bones ; whence he concludes
that the extirpation of the elephant in this continent was
long previous to that of the mastodonta or animal of the
Ohio, or that its             carcase was brought             there      by some cata
strophe.
   I find a true elephant's jaw, very well represented,                               in a
plate of the work of J. Drayton upon Carolina.
   Catcsby speaks             of   some    real fossil elephant teeth              in this
country.
                     "
              In a part of Carolina called Stono were dug up
three or four teeth of a large animal, which all the negroes,
who were natives of Africa, declared to be elephants' grind
ers    ;         I
           thought so myself also, having seen some similar
           and
ones which had been brought from Africa*."
   Mr. Barton, who pointed out this                    passage to me, remarks,
with truth, that it ought not to be inferred that these teeth
were precisely similar to those from Africa, but merely ele
phants' teeth in general : I should here say, teeth composed
of laminx. In fact, we cannot suppose that Catesby and his

   negroes   were fit to distinguish the. species of this genus at a
   period when no naturalist had as yet distinguished them.
       Mr. Barton adds, that he has himself seen some teeth of
   the European fossil elephant found, in 1795, at some di
   stance to the north of the place spoken of by Catesby, at a
  place called Biggin-swamps,             near the source of the west
  branch    of Cooper river.         They were eight feet deep, mixed
  promiscuously       with   bones    of the great mastodonta.
      The same gentleman saw a grinder of this description pro
  cured from a branch of the river Susqueanna, with a portion
  of a tusk six feet long and 31 inches round, which would
  have been at least       ten feet long if it had been entire; and,
  what is remarkable, the Delaware savages call this branch
   Chemung, or Horn river.
      It was according to these facts that Mr. Barton wrote to
  M. Lacepede. " The skeletons or bones of some large ani
  mals, more or less allied to the family of elephants, have
  also been discovered in different parts of North America.
  Among      these  I recognise the grinders          of a species which,
  if not  the same as the elephant         of Asia, must have been (as
  to the form of its grinders at least) more nearly allied to that
  species than is the mammoth*."                 Mr. Barton here means
  the mastodonta.
      I have   spme    pieces  of fossil   bones     From    America in my
 own possession. I am indebted for them to the friendship
 with which I am honoured by M. Humboldt. During all
 his travels, he neglected no opportunity of collecting fossil
'carcases, with the view of furthering my researches ; and
 he sent me, upon his return, two pieces of real elephants'
 bones, the one from North and the other from South Ame»
 rica.
     The first consists of        separate laminae      of grinders, and is
 consequently unequivocal.              They    are "very     large, and en
 tirely similar to those of Siberia by the straightness and the
 small degree of festooning in the lamina of the enamel, as
 well as by the small dilatation of ,their middle.                  This spe«
 cimen came from Mexico.

   The other     piece is a point      of a tusk of calcined ivory, but
completely      recognisable    :   it  comes from the province of
Quito, in Peru.        This tusk was less compressed than the
tusk of the mastodonta is at present, and I have every reason
to believe that it belonged to an elephant.
    I shall carefully deposit in the museum these two precious
pieces, which prove that the true elephants of antiquity,
with grinder     teeth  composed of thin laminae, have also left
their carcases to the north and south of the isthmus of Pa
nama.
    That we may neglect no information               on the subject, we
have to    mention    the  stories    told  us by   the Spaniards of the
giants' bones found in Mexico and Peru.                   We may find
extracts   of  these  fables, accompanied          with new  and detailed
accounts, in the        "  Gigantologie Espagnole," by Torrubia
the Franciscan.
    What hinders us from applying all these details to the
elephant is, that they may owe their origin to the bones of
two mastodontes, which are much more common in Ame
rica than those        of the elephant;         and no person who     has
 transmitted     these   details   has    taken the trouble     of giving
drawings,     or has said any thing that might lead us to di
stinguish    the species.        It is true, however, that their pre
tended giants are now completely extirpated.
    This enumeration of the places where the fossil bones of
 elephants have been found, is the result of an investigation
 which our anatomical labours, properly               so called, have not
 permitted us to render so complete as we could have de
 sired.    It is probable that our enumeration would have been
 much more voluminous if we could have spared time to go
 over more carefully the works             of naturalists and tra%'ellers,
 or the philosophical journals.            It is,- however, already suffi
 cient to give an idea of the prodigious quantity of these
 bones which the earth contains, and of what may be yet
 discovered if such researches are continued, and if they were
 oftener directed by men of science,

 XLVIII.        Description of an Autocratic Cock, useful tit

    Esq.
                              To  Mr. Tilloch.
XJ.aving frequently            observed   the great inconvenience at
tending the application of ball-cocks to the supply-pipes of
large reservoirs, liquor-backs, &c. (arising from their be
ginning to close the aperture of the cock long before the
backs, &c. are full) ; and having had a case of this kind
immediately under my own direction, I was induced to turn
my attention to the construction of an apparatus to remove
this objection.
    The reservoir, or back, being about 60 feet above the level
of the Thames, from whence it was supplied, it was there
fore necessary to have a large conduit-pipe in order to fill
it during    the short period       which   the water continues       on,  at
such heights, at neap tides ; and it was also indispensable
that the cock should remain fully open during the whole
time, and 3hut suddenly when the back was full ; which
could not be accomplished by the modes now in use : for
in cases where large cocks are to be opened and shut by
means of a ball or other float, the lever must be much longer
or   the float much larger than in common,                as some   of those
cocks require        a force to turn them from 50 to 100 lbs., with
a lever 16 or       18  inches long  :  hence it is    in broad   and shal
low backs      (the area of some of which are from 4000 to 5000
feet)   that the    ball begins to contract what is termed the water
way of the cock before the back or reservoir is half full, in
consequence of which the whole quantity of water would
seldom be admitted in one tide.               I have therefore inclosed
you a drawing and description of an apparatus* to obviate
this objection, and which 1 feel confident in saying will be
found far more useful in similar situations than the ball-
cock. — I am, sir, your obedient servant,

                 Description     of the Autocratic     Cock.
    Let   ABC      (Plate VIII.) represent the section of a portion
of a reservoir or liquor-back. DE, a large pipe supplying
the same.        F, a cock on which is fixed the large wheel T,
about two feet diameter, and the small wheel u, about five
inches diameter : to the former is attached on one side the
weight G, and on the other the vessel Hs, which is provided
with the tube so. ik is a tube to supply the vessel Hs, and
is moveable on the joint c, to allow the orifice i to be occa
sionally raised above and depressed below the surface of the
water, by means of the line or copper chain w, which is
fastened to the wheel u. Im is a slender rod of iron or wood
moveable on the centre          I: to this, by means of the bar zr,
 is fixed the cork or hollow metal float r, which, for the sake
of rendering visible, is represented a little below its proper
 situation.      To the end of the rod Im          is fixed the wire    mn,
 provided with a valve at n and another            at  j, for the purpose
of closing alternately        the ends   of the  tube so.     The   valve n,
 when the apparatus is in the present position, must be as
 much below o as is equal to an arc of 900 of the wheel T :
 the tube so must also be equal in length at least to on, that
 the orifice   o may fall within the waste-pipe op, which passes
 through and is supported by the bracket qq, which bracket
 serves also to receive the vessel Us when it descends.                 The
 vessel    Ms is capable of containing a sufficient quantity of
 water, when about four-fifths full, to overcome the weight G
  and the friction of the cock F : this cock being open when
  the weight rests on the bottom of the back, it is evident if
  the vessel H be filled it will descend until it meets the
  bracket qq, by which descent the weight G will be raised
 and    the  cock shut    :   the tube  i will  also, by means of the
  wheel u, be lifted above the surface          of the water vi, which
  will prevent any more from running into the vessel H; and
  the application of the orifice 0 to the valve n will prevent
  that which      is already     in from escaping until it is again
  opened    by the- descent      of the float r, which cannot happen
  until   a portion    of   the   water is drawn off: the valve near 5
   prevents   the water from escaping while           His    filling; but  if
                                                                         the

  the tube so, or the orifice o, be small, there will be rto oc
  casion for the valve s. Now it is plain from the figure, if
  the back be filled until the surface of the water rises to           xr,
  the float   r will  be lifted, and the valve n brought        within  the
 reach of the tube 50 when it descends,              which will presently
 be   the case     ; for when the surface        arrives at v it will run
 through ik into H, and cause it to descend and shut off the
 cock F. .The wheel T should be a hit'e flatted near y, that
 after being set in motion it may nos be stopped               by friction
until the cock is effectually turned off.
 XLIX.        Description    of Mr. Arthur Woolf's improved
                       Piston  for    Steam- Engines.
  J. he   common        method of packing the piston of a steam-,
-engine     is  so   well known, that a very particular description
 of it in this place is not necessary.             Suffice it to say, that
the    hollow    part round     the  piston (A, a, Plate VII.) is filled
with rounds of hemp or cotton, loosely spun or twisted,
 -which is pressed into a pretty compact form by a ring B,£,
which is worked down by screws distributed round the
 ring and working into            the    body of the piston ; by which
 means the packing is made to fill the diameter of the cy
 linder pretty closely, and to prevent, while the packing re
mains sound, any steam from passing between the piston
 and the cylinder.        In  the usual method, whenever the          pis
ton, by continued working,             becomes    too easy, and so occa
 sions a waste of steam, it is         necessary to take off the top of
the cylinder, even when fresh hemp or cotton is not wanted,
merely to get at the screws, which serve to force the upper
ring    nearer     to the bottom      of   the piston,   by which means
the packing is forced outwards against the side of the cy
linder.      This is heavy laborious -.ork, and is therefore ge
nerally shunned by the man that attends the engine, as long
as the engine can possjbly be made to work without taking
this trouble ; and in consequence of this neglect 'a great and
unnecessary waste         of  steam     is occasioned, and a waste       of
fuel in proportion.
                                                                      Mr.

                      On the Food      of Plants.                          317
   Mr. Woolf's improvement on the piston is such                         as  to
enable   the engine-man       to tighten      the piston without            the
necessity of taking off    the cover     of the cylinder, except when,
new packing becomes necessary.               He accomplishes this by
either of the two following methods :
   He fastens each of the screws into a small wheel (c,fig. 1,
and c,c,c,c,c, fig. 2. Plate VI.), which are all connected
with each other by means of a central wheel {d,d,)f which
works loose upon the piston-rod in such a manner, that if
one of the small wheels be turned, it turns the central wheel,
and the latter turns the other four.              The one that       is to be
first turned is furnished with a projecting square head, which
rises up into a recess in the cover of the cylinder.                This re
cess is surmounted by a cap or bonnet e (Plate VI. and VII.),
which being easily taken off, and as easily put again in its
place, there is little difficulty in screwing down the packing
at any time.     The parts are so clearly expressed in the plates
that no further description is necessary to make any person
comprehend it.
    The other method is similar in principle, but a little dif
ferent in construction. (See Plate VII.)                Instead of having
several screws all worked        down by one motion, there is in
this but one screw, and that one is a part of the piston-rod i
on this is placed a wheel of a convenient diameter, the centre
of which    is furnished with a female screw.                This wheel is
turned round, i. e. screwed down by means of the pinion otot
which is furnished with a square projecting head rising into
a recess of the kind already described. The ring is prevented
from turning with the wheel by means of two steady pins.

 factory answer to this question we must collect facts, we
must multiply experiments.            For this purpose, in the years

 I79S and 1793 I put various seeds to        vegetate  in different
 airs; in atmospheric air, in vital air,     and  in azote. The
general  result was, that neither wheat, oats, nor barley, ve
getated in azote; but in vital air vegetation was uniformly
rapid.
   July  12, 1796,  I  placed  eleven cabbage plants   in pots, all
healthy plants, and weighing each a quarter of an ounee
apothecaries' weight.       The pots stood in pans with water,
and remained in them till June 12, 1 797^ when the plants
were taken out of the pots and weighed again.
    Of these pots four had quartz sand, washed clean, and
rendered  perfectly free from mixture      of either argil or cal
careous earth.
   No. 1.   had nothing but this sand: the plant lived, but
did not increase in bulk ; when examined, the radical fibres
were found numerous and extended, but very small ; and
when the plant was weighed in January 1797, it had not in
creased in weight.
   No. 2. had the same kind of sand and woollen rags : the
roots shot vigorously, the plant cabbaged, and in January
 1797 weighed two ounces.
   No. 3.  had the same kind     of  sand,  with about  l-4th part
charcoal in powder    :  the roots were less vigorous than the
former, and in January 1797 the plant weighed 3-4ths of an
ounce.
   No. 4. had this sand with about l-20th lime. The plant
did not increase, yet lived, and in January 1797 weighed
only Sdwts., have lost 2-5ths of its original weight.
   No* 5. had brickmaker's clay alone : the plant lived,
looked fresh, but in January 17 97 weighed only half an
ounce.
   No. 6.   had brickmaker's     clay, with an equal proportion
of the quartz sand. This plant, like the former, lived,
looked fresh, and in January 1797 weighed half an ounce.
   No. 7. had brickmaker's clay, with about l-4th part
charcoal in powder.        In January 1797 the plant weighed
half an ounce.
   No. 8. had brickmaker's clay     and woollen rags.   This plant
cabbaged well, and in January       1797 weighed   four ounces.

  No. 9. had brickmaker's    clay, with about l-20thlime.
The plant lived till December, but never grew.
  No. 10. had clean dung From the bowels of a horse, with
quartz sand well washed. This plant dropped some of its
largest leaves during                     the   frost, and yet in January 1797 it
weighed 4-J- ounces.
  No.    1 1.   had peat earth alone                   :    the plant continued healthy
lo appearance, and in January                           1   797 weighed   half   an ounce,
but the soot was rotted off.
  No. 12. was planted at the same time in the garden, near
the pots, in rich mould : this did not drop any leaves, and
in January       weighed four ounces.

  Such was the result of these experiments on cabbage plants.
  In January 1797, having removed the cabbage plants,                                     I
sowed wheat             in the       same       pots   ;    and 25th September of the
game year       I   made the subsequent report                      :
  No.  1, with quartz sand alone, had two stems 23 inches
long, and the ears If- inch.
   No. 2, the sand and rags, had four stems 28 inches long,
and the ears 2£ inches.
  No. 3, the sand and                         charcoal,       had   one stem     18 inches
long, and the ear I inch.            J
   No. 4, the sand and lime, had two stems                                21   inches long,
and the ear         2       inches.
  No. 5,        the clay alone, had three                       stems    27 inches    long,
and the ears            I   -J-   inch.
  No.    6,     the clay and sand, had four stems 25 inches long,
and the ears       2-J- inches.
  No.     the clay and charcoal, had four stems 24 inches,
         7,
and the ears two inches.
  No. 8, the clay and                         rags,    had    twelve    stems    33 inches
 long, and the ears 2£ inches.
   No.    the clay and lime, had one stem, very slender, 15
         9,

  No.     10, the dung and sand, had sixteen stems 37 inches
long,    and the ears 2$ inches, very strong.
   No.  11, the peat earth, had six stems 35 inches long, and
the ears 2J- inches.

     Thus, it appears,     that in both sets of experiments the re-
  salts were similar.
     From these facts, compared with other facts with which
 we are conversant, such as the flowering of bulbous roots in
 water, and more especially the vast increase of the withy-
 tree, recorded by Mr. Boyle, our attention is naturally turned
 in the first place to water, as the supposed nutriment of
 plants.
     In the experiments before us, both the cabbage and the
 -wheat of No. l. were well supplied with water; but in the
 space of six months the former had not increased in either
 weight or bulk ; and the latter, in eight months, produced
 only two miserable stems.
    In Catalonia, more especially in the vicinity of Barcelona,
the soil is principally quartz, from decomposed granite ; yet
being well watered, and plentifully supplied with light and
heat, the crops of every kind are most abundant.
    M. de    Saussure  remarks,      that   "  we deceive ourselves ex
ceedingly when we imagine that the fertility of any district
depends wholly on the nature of its soil, because abundance
and scarcity in crops arise principally from the degree of
heat and humidity       in the air with the quantity and quality
of the exhalations with which it is charged." He adds,
" I have seen, in Sicily and Calabria, rocks and gravel arid
and uncultivated,      such   as  in Switzerland      would   have  been
altogether barren, which there produced more vigorous
plants than are to be seen on the richest and best cultivated
lands amongst the Helvetic mountains *."
    It is astonishing     to see, in a warm climate, the rapid
growth    of  vegetables when they are well supplied with water.
The smallest cutting of a vine will, in the space of fifteen
or sixteen months, cover the front of an extensive edifice,
or form    a  spacious harbour from which the assembled family
may gather in abundance of the most luxuriant grapes. la
Such a situation the seeds of limes, oranges, and lemons,
will, in four or live years, produce         a shady grove; and mul

triment of silkworms,           will again, in a tew days, be covered
thick with foliage.
    Adanson, in his account of Senegal, informs us, that
" when      every thing green has been devoured             by locusts, not
a vestige     of their destructive progress,         after a few days, can
be discovered."
    From    the consideration        of  these and     other facts similar
to    them, many distinguished chemists have delivered it
as   their opinion that water is decomposed by vegetables.
M.     Chaptal says, " La decomposition de 1'cau est prouvee
non seulement dans le vegetal mais dans 1'animal."                      And
for this last he quotes the authority of Rondelet.
    That water,     as  such, enters largely into the composition of
vegetables, is evident; but whether or not, and to what extent,
it is decomposed, has not, as I apprehend, been yet demon
strated.      In water meadows, with           a  plentiful supply of run
ning water, vegetation           proceeds even in the depth       of winter,
and     during the severest frosts ; but stagnant water is at all
times unfriendly to our meadows. Any given quantity may
remain upon the surface for weeks or months subject to de
composition; but          instead     of being in ihis   state beneficial, it
is injurious    to our crops,          fn our water meadows we uni
versally observe that it is not humidity which does good, but
a thick sheet of water flowing incessantly, night and day,
 (for a certain period), over the surface.
    Hence it seems          probable that water is essential to the
growth of plants, not merely as such, but as it proves a
vehicle of other substances which are their proper food.
    If we    may form      a   judgment from their analysis, carbon
may be regarded         as   the   chief pabulum of plants; and this
we know can, in a given proportion,                 be conveyed to     them
by water.       M. Chaptal        is not only    of opinion   that carbonic
acid is essential to their growth,           but he affirms that the base
of this     acid   contributes       to the formation      of the vegetable
 fibre.    In support of this opinion he observes, that in fungi,
which     live  in subterraneous places, this acid abounds ; but
by bringing them from almost perfect darkness gradually to
the light, this acid disappears, and the fibres proportionality
increase. This opinion is confirmed by some experiments

  of M. Senebier, in which            he observed,    that " plants  abun
 dantly supplied with water which had been impregnated with
  carbonic acid, transpired much more oxygen than when they
 were supplied with common water."
     Some plants take more carbon than others into their com
 position ; as for instance, the Agaricus quercinus, Agaricus
 antiquus, Boletus versicolor, Boletus igniarius, Boletus stri
 atum,     Boletus perennis, Clavaria hypoxylon, Clavariu pistil-
 lar'is, and many others. All these contain, from the result of
 analysis,      a  quantity of carbon nearly equal to all their other
 component parts.           But the Lichen crispus, Pinaster granu-
 latus, and Lycoperdon tessellatum, contain a very small por
 tion of carbon.
    Plants do not, however, retain all the carbonaceous mat
ter they receive       ; they obtain more     in   the day, when exposed
to light,      than they    naturally require but by the absence of
                                                 ;
light they part with this surplus, and therefore yield respira-
ble gas only in the day-time.
    The     separation    of oxygen from plants by radiant light,
seems      to arise    from the chemical affinity between oxygen
and    light.      For this fact we are indebted to Dr. Ingenhouz ;
but Humboldt was the first who ascertained                   that hydrogen
gas applied to plants,           even   when excluded      from the light,
occasions       a  separation of their accumulated oxygen.
    Some plants, as for instance tremella nostoc, the Jilices,
musci, and algce, retain their oxygen weakly, and part with
it readily. And it is remarked by Van Uslar, to whom I
am indebted for many of these observations, that such plants
as contain much oxygen, and retain it obstinately, are white;
as for instance, our endive and ce'ery when excluded from
the light     ;   while such    as.  contain much oxygen, and part
with it easily,      are generally green.
    If   the analysis    of plants   leads us to consider carbon as one
of   the most essential        articles in their composition and sup
port,     no  less  does   the  experience of ages prove to us that
the principal source from which they derive their nutri
ment, whatever it may be, is to be sought for in vegetable
earth, the produce of animal and vegetable substances de
cayed.       Many plants, indeed, require little or no carih for
                                                                      therf

  on the most elevated       mountains of the Fyrennees.          These
  dgain, by their decay, form vegetable earth, in which the
  luxuriant pine-trees and the ilex grow.
     This vegetable matter, being washed down into the val
  leys, helps to form and to increase their soil to a considera
 ble depth, and to give them that fertility which is not rea
 dily exhausted.
     When    we analyse: a soil, we never fail to find it composed
 of  substances  derived from a superior level.         If the hills are
 quartzose, calcareous, argillaceous, or niagnesian, so is the
 soil in all the valleys which communicate with them.               But
 with these earths in a rich soil we find a great proportion of
 vegetable   matter, or of animal exuviae       ; imd as these are de
 ficient or abound, vegetation          languishes, or is exceedingly
 luxuriant.
     Good mould- abounding with vegetable matters is com
monly of a dark colour, pulverises easily, and has therefore
 what is called a mellow look          ;  but when exhausted     or im
poverished by frequent crops, the richest soil, such as I hare
here described, becomes arid, of a lighter colour, compact,
and comparatively barren.           In a maiden soil, or where every
shower of rain brings down from more elevated regions a
quantity of vegetable matter, a succession of luxuriant crops
may be taken incessantly without any diminution of ferti
lity.    Thus it is in the country newly occupied by the          Ame
ricans, in Kentucky,       on the Ohio, and in the whole extent
of territory   watered    by   the   Mississippi   or by its tributary
streams.     Thus   also in some parts       of Spain, where     an ex
tensive   plain happens to receive the spoil? of rich circumja
cent hills, as in the well-watered vale of Orihuela, near Mur-
cia, of which they say, " Let it rain or not rain, corn never
fails in Orihuela."      Indeed, so productive is wheat in that
highly-favoured     district,   that the farmers commonly receive
100   lor i upon their Mitd.

   In my experiments, No.                     10, we see, by the luxuriant
growth of the cabbage and the wheat, what vegetable matter
can produce : for in neither of these could any kind of nu
triment be derived from the quartz sand in which they
spread their roots!
   The     same kind         of   sand    in the vicinity of Barcelona       is,   by
the assistance of    bright sun and copious irrigation, ren
                           a
dered exceedingly productive    hut then they spread upon
                                              ;
the land all the dung they can procure, and not only station
children and old women on the highways with little baskets
to collect this manure as falls from horses or from mules,
                                         it
but, like the farmers             in   the    south of France, they pick the
leaves from         the trees in autumn,            and this at considerable
                                                                a
expense.       Of such importance
                                do they consider vegetable
matter        food
           as the  of plants.
   It must be confessed that we have frequentlv occasion to
observe plants dependant on the nature of the earth in which
they are found, and affecting each its peculiar earth,                in     which
they grow spontaneously and thrive.
   Thus on chalky and               calcareous       soils we find Thesium         li-
nopliyllum, Anthyllh vulnsraria, Asperida cynanchia, Lotus
borniculatus, Hippocrepis comosa, Poa cristata and three of    ;
the Sedums,  the S. acre, S. album, and S. reflexum                      ;   as    on
the Wiltshire downs, and on the hills round Bath.
   On             Arenaria, Rumex acetosella, and all the
          sand we see
sorrels;    Planlago maritima, the Plantago Coronopus,
             the
the Onopordum Acanthium, the Sedum Anglicum, and most
remarkably the Spartium scoparium.
  On clay,    wet, the Carices, the Junci,
                   if                                          Schwann,       Aha
cespitosa,     and      Aira cceruka, Orchis latifolia,             and Orchis
conopsea;     if    dry,     the    Primula veris,         Orchis mas,     Orchis
mnculaia,     and Poa pratensis.
   On bogs, the Equiseta, Vaccinium tiliginosum, Anagallis
tenella, Scirpus palustris, Menyanthcs trifoliata, and Dro-
sera, delight to dwell.
   On     the sea shore, and wherever the muriatic salt abounds,
as near    Alicant     Spain, we find Salicornia Europcea, four
                        in
species    of Salsola, Chenopodium maritimum, and two spe
cies   of Mesemlryanthemum.
                                                                         These

                        On the Food    of Plants.                  325
    Thtse maritime plants       appear to decompose a part      of the
soil in which      they grow ; the alkali produced by burning
them, or the sal soda used in glass and soap, is evidently
derived by them from the muriatic salt.
    But when we       see the   Lichen parellus fixing itself on the
siliceous rock, or the Lichen immersus affecting as it does
the calcareous    rock in preference to the siliceous ; whatever
may influence this choice, we cannot suspect that either of
these rocks contributes by its decomposition to the nutrition
of these plants   ;  nor,  as I  apprehend, have we reason to ima
gine that either chalk,        sand, or clay, are in any form the
aliment of the plants.
    Woollen    rags have been      found   of great  utility as a ma
nure, more especially for wheat. And in the experiments
before us we may observe, that sand with rags produced a
cabbage    of two ounces, and four strong ears of wheat. In
clay with rags our cabbage weighed four ounces, and we had
twelve strong ears of wheat.           But in what manner these
rags produced effect it is difficult     to say, for in January  1797
they were not visibly decayed ; and in the month of Sep
tember in that year they still retained their texture.            The
quantity we usually spread upon one acre is not more than
four or five cwt. ; and yet in the experience of every farmer
it is found   that in the first year    they nearly double the crop
of wheat, and in the two succeeding years they yielded a,
visible increase.     At present, therefore, we can merely re
cord it  as a fact, that woollen rags are highly beneficial to
the land   : but we cannot pretend to say by what process they
contribute to the nutriment of plants.
    Lime in our experiments          was   clearly detrimental with
sand ; the cabbage lived, but weighed           less in January than
when planted in July :        the   wheat   had two slender stems.
In clay with lime our cabbage lived till December, but never
grew. The wheat had one stem, which was extremely sleni-
der, and the ear was diminutive.
    These facts appear discordant with the experience of far
mers in every quarter of the globe ; for lime is found to be
an excellent manure.         In some parts of Wales they have
                                   X 3                        scarcely

326                    On tlie Food       of Plants.
scarcely  any other dressing for their wheat.              I well remem
ber, that in the parish of I^ansamlet, in Glamorganshire, my
father, who was very attentive to agriculture, put most of
his stable dung on meadow land, and used only lime for
wheat.     He had two lime-kilns constantly burning for his
own yse, and with this manure he obtained the most abun
dant crops   ;  but then    his   land     was principally a dark vege
table mould,     and much     of it was      peat,   which before it was
drained had been     a  bog. On this         land I have counted sixty
grains 'to an ear,   not picked and culled out of many others
as being longer than the rest, but taken by handsful at
random.
    In his land, lime as a dressing was particularly apt, be
cause, as we know,       it hastens      the putrefactive process,       and
promotes the dissolution of vegetable substances, converting
them quickly into vegetable mould.
    Now in my expvriments there was no vegetable matter to
be dissolved, and therefore no benefit, according to chemical
principles, was to be expected from the lime.                 The trial was
however    made,    and   the   received     opinion    as  to the effect of
lime is thus far confirmed.
    But in my experiments the lime appears to have been de
leterious.    This was not from its causticity, for the plants
lived  ; but from its action      as a cement      in forming a crust on
the surface of the pots impervious to air.              For in these pots
I remarked, that      after  rain   the   water  stagnated, aud did not
readily penetrate as in the other pots.
    Free access of air to the roots of plants seems to be of
vast importance, and almost essential to their ejowth. With
regard   to seed",   access of air is absolutely needful to their
vegetation.     Hence it is that charlock (Sinapis arvensis) will
remain in the earth for centuries, if deposited below the ve
getating distance, as we .have occasion to observe on Salis
bury plain, where no charlock is ever seen, unless when
the downs are broken up. The land is then covered with
 it; but till then the seeds remain as in vacuo, and are there
fore not liable to change.
    Thi» deposit of seed must have happened                in most remote
                                     . . .                       antiquity,

antiquity, either when the hill country, like the low lands,
formed part of an extensive forest ; or more probably when
these extensive downs were subject to the plough.
   Being solicitous to know whether these seeds were ante
diluvian, I took earth from different depths, and soon got
below the stratum in which these seeds are found.
   The necessity of air for the vegetation of seeds will ac
count for effects which in agriculture are too frequently ob
served.
   If soon after wheat or barley has been sown on what is
called a running sand there falls a dashing rain, the sand
runs together, that is, it forms a crust, which in a great
measure is impervious to air, and scarcely a grain of corn,
will grow    ;    or   if on   clay land, during            a     time of drought,          a
garden plot is watered, and                    left exposed         to the scorching
beams   of   a   meridian sun, the ground will bake, that the                    is,
surface will be hardened,      and being thus rendered imper
vious to air, vegetation ceases.   But                  if      the surface has been
previously  covered  with  fern  leaves,                    as practised    by   skilful
and attentive gardeners, no such effect will be produced.
The plot may be watered, and vegetation will be rapid.
  The admission of air, and its vast importance to the
growth of plants, will account for the good effect produced
by harrowing our wheat crops in spring, as lately intro
duced, and now universally adopted        our best fanners.  by
The good effect produced   made apparent by the luxuriant
                                          is
growth of pease, beans, turnips, and cabbages, after they
have been hoed          ;    and    is   at present    so well understood,            that
many agriculturists hoe their turnips twice, and their beans
four times, not merely with      view to the destruction of
                                               a
weeds, but because they observe the benefit arising to their
crops   by   the free admission             of air into      the earth.     The       pal
pable advantage              of this practice         has   led     many fanners to
consider     the       principles        on which       the      practice has been
founded,         and    to    try    by    experiments          how far     can be
                                                                           it
pushed.
   In this pursuit, and satisfied of the benefits to be derived
from loosening the surface of the ground contiguous to his
crops, the Rev, Mr. Close has given up the broad -cast hus-
                                           X   4                                tunJ;   v.

bandry, keeps the hoe constantly in motion,                               and now finds
that he has never occasion for a fallow.
  But the most astonishing effect produced by giving free
admission of air to the roots of wheat was last year exhibited
by       Mr. Baitley,          secretary    to the Society of Arts at Bath.
In August                1800 he sowed his wheat in rows with three feet
intervals, and six inches distance from grain to grain.  The
proportion  of seed was two  quarts to an acre. The soil was
a    deep sandv             loam, but out of condition,                 and        filled with
couch.              This    wheat       was hoed in autumn,         hoed again, and
earthed           up both at Christmas           and     spring.        When it        was in
bloom             the     intervals were dug up, and it was once more
earthed           up.       At harvest this crop yielded sixty-six bushels
per acre.                Such was its luxuriancy, that many of the plants
produced 98 perfect ears, many of which, nine inches long,
contained each 100 grains.
   In the broad cast husbandry of the hill counties of Wilts
and Hants,                the produce was formerly three or at most four
for one,            as   it was in the greatest part of France.  By the
drill, without hoeing,                    the   return    would     not         be near      so
much          ;   but in     Mr. Bartley's crop          we   see   more           than 1000
for       1   ; and some grains yielded nearly ten times as                         much*.
    shall make but one observation more upon this subject,
     T
which             is,
           that an orchard planted on the green sward re
quires double the time for its maturity as one on culti
vated land, that has more plentiful supply of air admitted
                                    a
to its roots.
     Thus          we see that all        the great    agents      in   nature arc con
cerned        in the process of                  may he considered
                                           vegetation, and
as       the food of plants.    But to determine     what maimer    in
each contributes to nutrition,                    must be left to the investiga
tion of succeeding generations.
                                                                                LI.     Letter

    Bonnycastle's Treatise on Plane and Sp/ierical Trigo

                               To   Mr. Tilloch.
t
X
       SIR,
     beg     leave to correct some erroneous statements in your
valuable Magazine for November 1806, article xxx. p. 176,
&c, respecting Mr. Bonnycastle's Treatise on Plane and
Spherical Trigonometry, lately published ; not doubting, from
that attention to impartiality which I have had frequent op
portunities of observing in your work, that you will do me
the justice to insert my remarks.
     It is not my intention, sir, to follow the writer of this
article step by step in his observations on Mr. Bonnycastle's
book, nor in the smallest degree to doubt the rectitude of his
intentions when he says,             " we are conscious that in recom
mending         this  treatise  to  general favour, we are equally dis
 charging an act of justice to the author, and of service to
 the   public."       My remarks will therefore            be as short as pos
 sible.
     The plane trigonometry, we              are told, contains        <( a
                                                                             great
 variety of practical examples;" and the spherical is applied
 "   to the solution of astronomical problems," and contains
 " tables      of right ascension, &c. useful in the preceding so
 lutions    ;"   to which he adds, " This part of the work cannot
 fail to be     of  the highest    utility."     In another place, (speak
 ing of     a part   of  the  work, the merit of which I am not in
  clined to     dispute, as it concerns not myself,) " This part of
  the work alone is sufficient to stamp its value, did not every
  other part bear evident traces of the same hand."                        This is
  an assertion,       sir, which could not possibly have been made
  had the writer seen my treatise on the same subject, pub-
  situations.   Consequently, the result of any experiments made in such a spot,
  is not to be considered as applicable to the general practice of agriculture  and
  planting    on a large and common scale of cultivation.       With the necessary
  allowances which the local advantage above mentioned suggests, the conse
  quences drawn by this gentleman may still be of importance for the consi
  deration of our practical readers. — Editor of the Letters and Papers.

    lished by Longman and Co. and Vernor and Hood, in 1801-
    I do not, from this observation, by any means wish to ascribe
   to myself any of the merit attributed to Mr. Bonnycastle by
   the writer of the article in question, nor to put my work
   in competition with Mr. Bonnycastle's; but I cannot surfer
   such     a  remark  as the above  to pass unnoticed,    when   I can
   clearly    prove that a very  considerable portion of Mr. Bonny
   castle's work is a direct copy    of mine. Exclusive of detached
   matter, there are upwards of seventy pages in which there
'
   are scarcely ten lines in any one pasre which are not directly
   copied from my work ; and in many pages not a single line
   nor figure but what is copied.        For instance, pages 232 and
   233 are both entirely copied from different parts of my work :
   thus, example 2d, is my second example, p. 267 ; example
   3d, is my fourth example, p. 268. The note at the bottom
   of   the page is taken from my article marked      D,  p. 268 ; and
   the xixth problem is a copy of my first example, p. 255. Iq
   p. 255 of my Treatise is the following erroneous remark :
   "   The sun's parallax is about 9", therefore his upper limb
  will appear in the horizon when he is 32' 5l" below it ; and
  as his semi-diameter is 15' 47", his centre will appear in the
  horizon alien it is 48' 38" Itlow."           Mr. Bonnycastle, in
  his note, p. 233, says the same.          At p. 303 of my work,
   10° 46' are stated to be equal to 43' 40" of time; and this
  error is carried through my calculation : this Mr. Bonny
  castle has copied at p. 250 of his treatise ; and brings out
  my conclusion, though the calculation occupies two pages.
  All the astronomical problems in my work, the framing and
  calculation of which were attended with a considerable de
  gree    of labour,   are adapted to the year  1 796, at  which time
  I expected my work to be published ; and the       " tables of right
  ascension, &c. useful in the solutions," and already noticed,
  were collected from the Nautical Almanac, for the purpose of
  illustrating the examples. Mr. Bonnycastle has adapted all
  his examples to the year 1796, and copied my tables altoge
  ther; the intention of which is too obvious to need any com
  ment!       Lastly, the geometrical figures in various parts of the
  book arc likewise the sameasthose-in my work, as if pricked
  from my plates by schoolboys. Thus the figure at p. 1 1 1 is the
                                                                  same

same size as my figure xiii. Plate VI ; the figure in p. 128
is a copy of my figure xvii. Plate VI ; and the examples at
both places are mine, as well as the constructions ; but as
my examples and constructions are placed at different pages,
and my figures are given in plates, the coincidence, at first
sight, is not so obvious as it would have been had my work
been printed in the manner or'           Mr. Bonnycastle's.
   From      the specimens already given, the truth            of my     asser
tions cannot be doubted ; for it would baffle all the mathe
matical laws of chance to produce, from fortuitous circum
stances, such a coincidence as I have pointed out : but as
this subject will be more amply discussed elsewhere, I shall
desist from troubling you with any more remarks ; and hope,
as it is a mere act of justice to myself, that your reader)
will excuse me for having occupied any part of your valuable
work with matter which has no tendeucy^ither to instruc

ALTHOUGH             the ardour   with which     the   British nation pur
sues whatever promises to be           of public utility, is perhaps un
equalled by any other, and certainly exceeded by none ; yet
there is one subject which has hitherto been permitted to
escape our attention, and in which several nations upon the
continent       can   not only boast     of their superior policy, but
are already enjoying considerable advantages from                 it; I mean
the cultivation of the poppy to a great extent for the benefit
of its oil, as an article of food, and for other useful purposes.
    It will doubtless be remarked, that we ought not to ascribe
 the neglect of it as an article of food to inattention altoge
 ther, but to a superior caution,            as  the narcotic quality of

the poppy renders               it totally unfit             to be taken                  inwardly.
This, it is allowed,            is,in appearance,                 a   very formidable ob
jection  and, as
         ;                it   respects the lives      ought of multitudes,               it

                                              :
argument from analogy on which         founded, ought to be
                                                        it   is
completely confuted before the article can be recommended
to the community               in   this novel point of view.
    We might          observe         that the objection     solely founded
upon very slight and imperfect analogy.
                                                                        It is    assumes,        that,
because some parts of    plant are noxious,
                                      a                                      the whole must
be equally noxious.     But this assumption may be con
futed in numberless instances.      Daily experience testifies
that different parts of plants possess not only different, but
opposite qualities. Oranges and lemons, which are used iu
profusion, possess juices that are both palatable and refri
gerating; but these are inclosed in   rind, the essential oila
of which    extremely acrid and stimulating
               is                              and       well                :            it   is
known        that the bland and nutritive tapioca                           isthe produce of
a   tree whose roots are highly poisonous,                        f    n    this case, there
fore, the argument from analogy may be considered as                                                very
                           but                                                                 it a
proper motive for caution          advances further,
                                          ;        if   it                                            de
generates      into   a   pernicious prejudice.
    There have been, however, many incidental circumstances
which have had       partial influence in removing these preju
                          a
dices.   It   well known that compounders of medicine have
               is
made     very liberal use of the seeds of poppies, as substi
         a
tutes for the oil of sweet almonds, without the least detri
ment to the patient.   They have sometimes imputed to                                                  it
additional virtues, from its being supposed to possess nar
cotic properties. But that they have erred in their hypo
thesis   plain, from the practice of many individuals who
         is
have made the seeds             of    poppies     a   common article                 of food *.

         it         be the principal            object of

moved prejudices long and inveterate                       ;   and that the white
poppy (Papaver hortense semine albo) is cultivated to a very
great extent in France, Brabant, and Germany, and, more re
cently in Holland, chiefly to extract the oil from its seeds;
which is found not only to be salubrious, but to be pecu
liarly delicate in its flavour. It is now become a considera
ble article      of commerce           ;    the oil   of a superior quality for     the
use   of    the table, and the inferior                for manufactories and va
rious other purposes. It is produced not only with consi
derable profit to the cultivator, but also to the merchant and
consumer.
  As it is natural to imagine that the prejudices against the
common use of poppy oil for culinary purposes will be very
general, since they are apparently sanctioned by prudent
caution, it is not expected that the most positive assertions,
founded upon the experience of strangers on the continent,
would be sufficient to remove them.                            But   a   circumstantial
narrative      of a contest which              has already      taken place, and     of
the final triumph of experience over the opposition founded
on analogous reasoning, and a particular statement of the
advantages which have accrued to the cultivator, merchant,
and consumer, may perhaps attract the attention of some
agriculturists in our own country, who may thus be encou
raged to make similar experiments ; and as the issue must
be the same, they will be able to produce absolute demon
stration that the oil is totally destitute of the noxious quali
ties that have been ascribed to it ; and finally convince the
public that it may become a cheap and useful substitute for
the olive oil, and  very beneficial article of commerce.
                                a
   For this purpose I shall state to the agriculturist a suc
cinct account of the rise and progress of the cultivation of
the poppy, in order to express the oil from the seed; the
manner of cultivating                 it,   and   the emoluments           which   have
been        received       by   the   cultivator,  from authentic documents
in    the    Dutch     and German            languages which are in mv pos
session.
     In     the year   1   798, the society established                  at Amsterdam
for   the encouragement                of agriculture, being informed that
                                                                                    the

   334              On the Cultivation   of the Poppy.
  the oil of poppies was cultivated in several parts of France,
  Flanders, and Brabant, thought it an object of sufficient im
  portance to make more particular inquiry ; and they learned,
  from indubitable authority, not only that it was generally
  xised in the place of olive oil, but that several thousand casks
  of  it were exported    annually,   a large quantity   of which was
 imported into Holland and sold under the           name of olive oil,
 or mixed with it in considerable abundance ; and they ap
 pealed to several merchants, who were members of the soci
 ety, for the truth of this assertion, without being contradicted.
     These facts induced the society to propose three premiums,
 consisting of a silver medal and ten ducats each, which were
 divided into the three following classes :
     The first to the husbandman who should sow not less than
 half   an acre  of a clayey soil with poppy seed    ; the second on
 a sandy ground ; and the third on         turf or peat land.
     They   also offered to the person    who shall have cultivated
 the largest quantity of ground, on the two first species of
 soil, in the most masterly and advantageous manner, a gold
 medal, value fifty ducats, or that sum in money, in lieu of
 the above premiums.
     The candidates were to give an accurate statement of the
quantity of seed sown per acre ; the time of sowing and of
gathering the poppies ; the quality of the soil ; the manner
of procedure in      every part  of the   process ; the quantity     of
oil produced, and the total       of the  expenses.
     In consequence of the above proposals, in the year fol
lowing; (1799) Mr. P. Haak became a claimant; sent in sa
tisfactory specimens of the oil produced, accompanied with
testimonies from two respectable physicians, that upon ex
periments made, it fully appeared that the use of the oil was
not in the least prejudicial to the human constitution ; and
that the oil cakes were very wholesome and nutritive food
for cattle.
    The committee appointed to receive this report, not only
expressed their entire satisfaction at the attestations of the
physicians, but they laid before the society at large an ac
count of the proceedings which had taken place in France
upon the interesting question concerning the noxious or sa
                                                              lubrious

                    On the Cultivation                  of the Poppy.                       333
lubrious qualities of the poppy oil, in the following narra
tive:
   So early as the beginning of the 17th century the oil of
poppies was produced in such large quantities that it gave
rise to great and lasting contentions, which rose to such a
height that the government was desired to interfere and ap
pease the   contending parties, either by authorising the use
of this oil, or totally to prohibit the consumption, according
as experiments should decide whether it contained the nox
ious qualities ascribed to                   it,   or not.
     The opposers urged the objections                  already stated they             :
asserted,        that   as       the capsulum      or poppy- head contained
juices highly narcotic,                  this must also be the case with its
seeds    ;    that the frequent use                 of the oil        extracted    from them
exposed   the consumer to all the dangerous consequences
arising from   the too liberal use of opiates and that they                ;
would finally obtund the faculties of the soul that the oil                    ;
,was of   drying quality, for that
             a                      was upon this account
                                                        it                                    it
became peculiarly useful to painters                         :   they therefore implored
government to confine its uses to this object.
     The     advocates       maintained that no proofs existed of these
pernicious effects           ;on the contrary, expsrience testified that
the seeds were peculiarly nutritive both to men and cattle;
they asserted that the anticnt Romans, concerning whose
mental powers there could be no doubt, were accustomed to
mix the oil and meal                    of     the poppyseed with honey, and
have     it   served up as        a     second course at their tables and that     ;
it   was on account              of   its nutritrious        qualities, so well known
to the Romans,           that Virgil gives              it   the title of vesatm, food,
 by  way of pre-eminence     and that the peculiar qualities of
                                             ;

taste was delicate and pleasant, somewhat resembling that
of    the hazel     nut;         that    fluid state, exposed
                                        it   continued           in   a

 that oil acquired           by      length of time and that the poppy oil
                                                             ;

decidedly deserved a preference to every other oil expressed
from seeds, whether nut, almond, or beech ; which, though
they    yielded large quantities, soon became rancid : and as
there was no appearance     of its being pernicious in the more
extensive use of       it,
                      so valuable    product ought not to be
                                          a
confined within the narrow bounds of the painter's use.
   Things were in this state, without any prospect of accom
modation      between the parties, when the severe winter of
1709 overtook      the combatants.  This damaged the olive,
nut, and almond         trees   to such   a   degree,   that there was   a
great scarcity of their oils and they were obliged to have
                                    ;
recourse to the substitutes, beech and rape, &c. But    was         it
soon perceived that these were far inferior to the oils ex
tracted from the red, white, or brown poppy, which had a
much nearer resemblance to the small portion of the olive
oil which the winter had spared.    This was consequently
mixed with the olive oil in the proportions of one-fourth,
one-third, one-half, without the least opposition. But when
itwas attempted to sell the poppy oil in its pure and un
mixed state, the opposition became so violent, that the lieu
tenant-general of the police of Paris resolved, in the year
1717, to order the medical faculty of that city to make the
strictest   examination concerning this subject, and deliver in
their report.
   The faculty appointed forty of the most celebrated practi
tioners in medicine as    committee of inquiry, who were
                                a
witnesses to various experiments accurately made, and whose
report was expressed in the following terms
                                               " cum sensu-
                                                        :
issent doctores,    nihil narcotici,    out sanitati inimici in se con-

they were of opinion, that as there        nothing narcotic or
                                               is
prejudicial to health contained in the oil,  the use of  might it
be permitted.
   But this decision was unsatisfactory and popular cla
                                                    ;
mours determined the court of justice to pass decree     a the      in

mine, with the closest attention, all that had been alleged^
either     by
          writing or otherwise, for or against the general
use of this oil. Experiments were repeated, in the presence
o£ the  most distinguished chemists, with the same result,
and the society presented  petition to the minister of police,
                                     a
setting forth the great advantages that would accrue both to
commerce and agriculture                 by
                               reversing the prohibition.
  This petition was put into the hands of                      persons who vended
various kinds of drugs, and who had, as                        a   body, opposed the
subject of      it,
              with orders             to state all their objections to the
medical faculty;            by
                    these means the faculty became masters
of every thing that was urged in the debate. They again
made several experiments in the year 1776, and finally con
firmed the decree       of the faculty issued in 1717* declaring
that the oil      of poppies was not injurious to health, that                            it
did not contain    narcotic power^ and that

ture in Amsterdam proposed the premiums above mentioned^
in order to ascertain whether the experiments made would
authorise the cultivation of the article upon a large scale ,
whether the soil and climate of Holland were beneficial to
its growth ; whether the quantity or quality of the oil would
be similar to the product of France and Brabant ; whether
the profits would indemnify the husbandman from giving it
the preference to other crops ; whether the oils could be af
forded cheaper than those in common use ; and to what pur
poses either   in the   arts or manufactories it might be applied.
   Deeming it possible that the narrative of a contest which
subsisted the greater part of a century, and in which the
advocates for the internal use of the poppy oil were uni
formly triumphant, may have some influence in destroytrtg
cur own prejudices and apprehensions respecting the perni
cious quality of this oil, I shall now proceed to state, in as
concise a manner as perspicuity will permit, the most in
teresting particulars respecting its culture, selected                         from
various foreign publications upon the subject.
   Soil. — The poppy may be cultivated with success on va-
tious kinds of soil. It has been tried on a rich black soil,
peat ground, and sandy heaths, and been productive. Those
lands in which the wild poppy abounds the most, are obvi
ously most congenial to its nature. The richer the soil, and
the clearer from weeds, the larger will be the crop.     It is
not so adviseable, however,  to manure for the poppy, as for
the crop preceding       as it, more exposed to injury
                                  it   is                                        by
weed*. Hence       succeeds the best after carrots, cabbage,
                  it
potatoes, &c.    The   land was generally prepared        the              by
spade, as in planting potatoes  and the finer
                                       ;             worked,    it   is
the greater the advantage.   But when         cultivated to
                                                      it   is                    a
great extent, they use the plough.   The seed has generally
been sown broad-cast, the plants thinned, and weeded after-
Svards, asin the culture of turnips; but in drills      sowrr        it   is
about six or eight inches distant in the rows, which has
been strongly recommended, experiments upon        small scale  a
having manifested superiority in this mode.

the supposition that it produced the finest oili yet it has been,
found that various other kinds will answer the purpose as
well.    It is even asserted that the blue poppy, while it yields
the largest quantity    of  seed, is in no respect inferior in the
quality of the oil.        Admiral Kingsbergeni whose private
virtues render him no less a favourite with his countrymen
than his skill and courage as a naval officer, instituted an
experiment with different kinds of seeds in the same soil>
and he could not perceive any difference in the quality of
the oil, while the seeds of the blue poppy yielded considera
bly more.
   The quantity of     seed generally used in the broad-cast has
been after the rate    of   2 lbs. to an  English  acre.  In drills  a
lesser proportion has been used.
    Time  of sowing. —This is from the middle of March to
the middle of April. If it be sown much earlier, it is more
likely to   be choked by weeds ;       if later, the harvest will   be
thrown    deep into the     autumn;     and unless   the weather be
unusually favourable, the seeds will not ripen kindly.
    Weeding, — As soon as the plants appear about two inches
above the ground,      they must be carefully weeded and thin
ned, till they stand about seven or eight inches from each
other.    The weeding to be repeated as often as it shall ap
pear necessary.
   Harvest.— In the beginning, middle, or end of August,
according as the time of sowing has been earlier or later, and
the season propitious, the seeds are ripe for gathering the
poppy heads.      Several methods have been recommended to
harvest the crop.      At first, the heads or balls were broken,
off from their steirts, gathered together in large quantities, and
deposited in a barn, or any other convenient plate, in large
heaps, in order to dry them. This method was not only tedious
but injurious ; some of the balls becoming musty, commu
nicated a disagreeable taste to the seeds, and consequently to
the oil.  Mr. Poske, of Zell, in the electorate of Hanover, pre
fers the  following method : — He draws the entire plants out
of  the ground ; binds a sufficient number of them at each ex
tremity,   and places them against each other in the manner
of  wheat-sheaves; and lets the whole remain in the field for
                                  V  3

    eight or ten days, until they are perfectly dry.          It was cuS*
    ternary   to  cut open the capsulum with a knife : he prefer*
    hacking it in two or three places with a bill-hook, and as
    serts that one person may in this manner do more work than
    ten times the number        of hands in the former manner;         and
    that the seeds    are more easily evacuated from their cells. But
    the most convenient and expeditious method is to cut off the
   poppy heads as they stand in the field : the reapers having
    an apron before       them, tied up at the corners.      In this they
   collect as large a number as is convenient, and empty them
   into bushel baskets placed upon a cloth ; by which a con
   siderable quantity of seed is saved.            The heads are after
   wards put into corn sacks, in a competent number to be
   trodden by men or children in sabots, or to be bruised by a
   mallet or flail ; by these means the heads are confined from,
   flying from     the stroke, and      the seeds preserved   from being
   scattered, and afterwards passed through a sieve           of a  proper
   fcize.
       In extracting    the  oil, it is of the utmost importance      that
   mill,   press,   and bags,     be perfectly clean and pure.       New
   bags are necessary, as those used for linseed, rape, or any
   other seed, will communicate an unpleasant taste to the oil.
  It   is adviseable to extract the oil as soon after the harvest as
   possible,    as the seeds   will yield  a larger quantity than   if de
  ferred till tlie spring.
       The first oil is destined      for the use  of families.    This is
   cold-drawn, as any degree of warmth injures the flavour.
  After as much is extracted in this manner as possible, a con
  siderable quantity of an inferior quality is obtained by heat
  ing the cakes, and pressing them a second time.
       The oil expressed must remain for the space of five or
  B'IX   weeks before it is used, that it may deposit in a sedi
  ment a kind of milky substance that is mixed with it.                 It
  must then be poured into another vesscl ; and this should
  not be perfectly closed at first, but the opening be covered
  with a linen cloth, or a pricked bladder, 'that certain exhala-
-
  tions may pass.          Nor should the oil be immediately used
  after the process is finished, as it continues to improve fof
  a considerable length of time.
               7                                                     That

     That which          is first expressed           is of a pale colour   ;   is pecu
liarly bland and soft, has a flavour approaching to that of
the almond oil.    It is used for salads and other domestic
purposes, either alone or mixed with olive oil. Should the
latter be stale or rancid, it will be considerably improved by
a mixture of recent poppy oil.       It is not asserted that this
oil may be placed in competition with Provence or Italian
oils of prime quality ; but that it is superior to the olive oils
sold in shops, being often used to improve their quality.
May I not add, that the inhabitants of this country are
somewhat prepared for the culinary use of this oil, by being
already accustomed to its taste, though without theirknow-
ledge.   For since'it has long been imported into Holland,
and used without suspicion, we cannot suppose that the mer
chants of this commercial nation are totally strangers to the
commodity           *.
     The second-drawn oils              of a deeper colour, and are ap
                                          are
plicable to all the          purposes of the more common oils.     This
may even be used as lamp oil ; and it is alleged that it does
not give off so large a quantity of smoke, and emits a brighter
flame.
   The oil-cakes are peculiarly serviceable for feeding and fat
tening of cattle ; being deemed equal to linseed cakes.      AH
cattle are very fond of   and eat   it,
                                      with eagerness.   This

the constant use of in Brabant.

     *    We are told by Mr. C. A. Fisher, in his   Letters written during Journey
                                                                                a

    Expenses, Produce, and Profits. — Concerning                 these arti
cles   it will be necessary     to be particular,     though it is some
what difficult,     from a difference in the current coins, mea
sures,     &c.    I shall state the result      of experiments     made on
300 roeden      *, about one     acre   of a  sandy soil, and 300 roeden
of  a heavy    peat,   made by a claimant named $•            N. Van Eys.
The    peat land being low and humid, he was obliged to make
deep     trenches between       the beds.        The harvest on this soil
was later, the poppy heads were not so dry when gathered,
and they shrunk considerably in drying.               There was so small
a difference in the quantity of seed from these different soils,
that no important preference could be given. The sand
ground yielded in this instance rather less than the peat land.
As the quality of the seeds appeared perfectly similar, he
mixed the whole produce together, when he sent them                         to,
the oil mills.
   The produce of the sand ground rather exceeded 13 sacks,
that of the veen or peat land was about 1 2 sacks ; together,
they made 25 sacks 1 bushel of seed. These yielded of oil
in  the   following proportions       :

   This degree of profit upon nearly two acres does not at
first appear to be encouraging ; particularly if we take into
consideration rent of land, taxes, &c. which are not men
tioned in the statement. Mr. Van Eys has remarked, that
the expenses attendant upon pressing out the oil, in this first
essay,    were considerably greater than would be experienced
in the usual course of business. We may also notice that
the preparation of the ground by manua iabour created a dif
ference in expense that would prove an equivalent at least
to the value of land and contingent charges. But what is
of much greater moment is the very low price of the oil, as
stated in the above account : that of an inferior quality being
valued at somewhat less than        5s  per gallon, and the superior
at less than 5s.    6d.,    whereas   common lamp oil is with us
sold for 6s. per gallon,       and salad oil of no extraordinary
quality at 2s. 6d. or 3s. per pint, or         1 /. or  1  /. 4s, per gal
lon.
    It  clearly appears from these facts, that Is. 6d. per pint,
or 125. per gallon for the prime article wholesale, and at
least 4 s. per gallon for the inferior sort, would be an advan-
                                  Y4                               tageous

 tageous price for the purchaser, who would              be able to retail
it considerably under the current prices of these articles.
   According to this estimate, the receipts upon 271 min-
gelen, or quarts, of the cold-drawn would amount to about
40/.; upon 102 quarts of the inferior, to 5/.; and upon 7S2
cakes, at 1 /. per 100, to ll. \0s.: total 52/. 105. for one
morge, which would be after the ratio of 26 I. 5 s. per acre.
The expenses, not exceeding \0 I, per acre, would yield a
clear profit of 16/.
   Should the oil of superior quality answer the description
given of     and be more palatable than the olive oil
             it,                                          com      in
mon use, \2s. per gallon would, perhaps, be too low an
estimate for our national character.   For observation autho
rises   me   to assert   it   as   a fact, that nothing has
                                       serious                              a
greater tendency with us to depreciate articles of nutrition,
especially   they approach to luxuries, than to render ihem
             if
too cheap    and although we complain universally, that such
             :
articles Ire extravagantly dear, we almost as universally sus
pect or despise whatever may be purchased at very reasona a
ble price.   But as retailers are both able and willing to ob
viate this objection, the above statement for the vender in
wholesale may be permitted to remain.
   But there      another important point of view in which
                   is
this subject may be considered.     Successful attempts have
lately been made to procure opium from the poppy, in no
respect inferior to that imported from the East*; and
                                                                        it
                                                                        is
asserted, that although  may be afforded at
                              it              very inferior
                                                          a
price, the product would afford ample profits to the culti
vator.   As the opium issues from the rind, and the seeds
have been proved not to partake of its narcotic properties,
an important inquiry presents itself, Whether the poppy
may not be cultivated with    view to both articles
                                       a            This          ?
can only be determined by solving another question  Will           :
the incisions made in the green and unripe capsulum, and
the exudation of its juices, prove injurious to the seeds in
this advanced state of its growth  The argument from ana-

logy,    which is the only mode until we can obtain facts, ap
pears to favour the negative of the question ; not only as
there is no immediate correspondence in the qualities of
these two parts of the same vegetable, but as many experi
ments have proved that by checking the growth, or weak
ening the vegetative powers of one part of a plant, they are
increased and improved in another.
    Desirous     of obtaining   some   information concerning this
interesting subject,      I sowed, in the year 1804, about half a
 lug of  garden ground with the white poppy seed ; and when
 the heads were advanced to a sufficient state of maturity,          I
 scarified the external surface of one portion of them with a
 penknife, suffering the others to remain entire; and though
 the exudations were very considerable, there was no per
ceptible difference in the colour, taste, or size of the seeds;
excepting where the incisions passed through the whole in
 tegument, which frequently happened from the imperfec
 tion of the instrument, and my inexpertness.              The seeds
 which lay      nearest to the openings      were discoloured by the
 admission of external air, but the taste of the seed was not
 injured.
     This little experiment   served to convince me that the seeds
 of  the poppy are peculiarly grateful to birds, rats, and mice.
 The first dexterously      made  large holes in the    lower surface
 of the ball, through which        the seed fell to the ground ; and
 they thus materially injured a considerable portion of my
 crop while it was standing ; nor were the latter less destruc
 tive, when the poppy heads were spread upon the floor of
 the summer-house in order to dry them.              I was, however,
  indemnified for this loss, by observing, that not a single in
  stance of mortality presented itself to evince the noxious
  quality of the seed.
     If future experiments        should    prove  that both  objects
  be  pursued by the same culture, scarcely any plan can be
  devised which would prove equally profitable to the culti
  vator, and more beneficial to the community.
     I am not so sanguine, gentlemen, as to expect that
  any person, upon reading the above account, will immedi
  ately resolve    to cultivate the poppy to a great extent, as an

 article  of profit. There is often a long repose between thtf
 acquisition of knowledge, and the application of it to prac
 tical purposes; and in this case I allow that many difficulties
 are to be surmounted before the open and avowed consump
 tion of this oil would be sufficiently extensive to make the
 production of it an object of sufficient magnitude.          But the
 increasing demands for oils of all sorts in our extensive ma
 nufactories, and by the daily improvements in our provin
 cial towns, the immense sums expended in the importation
 of foreign oils,  and most probably        of this very oil under 9
 false name, and     the daily    increase  of their price, render a
power in reserve most desirable. The time may arrive when
 the scarcity of oils for domestic use may increase to an alarm
ing degree ; in this case, the general reluctance to the use of
 those which are now deemed         of an inferior quality may in
a great measure    subside, and we may perhaps rejoice at being
supplied at a cheaper rate with that very oil which passes
smoothly among us under the fictitious character of genuine
oil of olives. 1 shall at least enjoy the satisfaction of put
ting it in the power i,f the public to assist themselves at
some future period ; and take encouragement respecting the
success of my endeavours from the nature of this very plant,
which is frequently known to lie for years in the soil in a
state perfectly inert, until some favourable circumstances
may have promoted a vigorous vegetation, to the surprise
and alarm of the farmer, who has uniformly mistaken it for
a weed.
    N. B. It may be objected that in the above estimate of
the profits mention is not made of the duties which may
hereafter be imposed by government, and become considera
ble deductions.      But this objection has no reference to our
first essays.   The duties will not become        an object until the
product of poppy oils shall sensibly diminish the importation
of foreign oils ; and in that case the wisdom of government
will doubtless   prevent   their rising so high as to operate as a
discouragement to a culture which would turn the balance
of the oil trade in our favour ; and, should we be able to ex
tend this culture so far    as to export the article,  a very mode
rate duty upon both home consumption            and exportation may
                                                               prove

   Since writing the above,     I  am informed by     a person who
deals largely in foreign oils, that letters from       Leghorn an
nounce an alarming deficiency in the last year's product;
that the quantity is very small, and of a very inferior qua
lity. This information should operate as an additional mo
tive to the attempt recommended.          The injury induced upon
olive trees by inclement weather is frequently to such an ex
tent, that it can only be repaired by the slow growth of new
plantations.    This circumstance gives an astonishing advan
tage to a substitute, of which, by its being an annual pro
duct, the deficiency of the most unfavourable year cannot
be equally extensive, and would probably be supplied by the
increased abundance     of the   year ensuing.
    LIII.  History of Astronomy for the Year 1805.            By
                     JEROME DE LALANDE.
                       [Concluded  from p. 253.]
 A HE meteorolpgy of 1805 has been remarkable for the va-i
nations of temperature. It froze in the months of March,
June, and September: on the 17th and 18th of December
a degree   of cold of from      6° to 7° froze the Seine at Paris ;
»nd on the 31st we had the same temperature as in spring.
    On  the 7th  of December,     at eight o'clock  in the evening,
at Basle, in Switzerland,     the inhabitants thought themselves
at the mouth    of a furnace.     This  heat lasted three hours.
    There was a hurricane on the 13th of December, in which
 several vessels were lost.
    Perhaps the auroras boreales, which have such an intimate
 connection with electricity, and which are constant in the
 north, may occasion storms which determine the winds,
 and contribute to these unaccountable variations        of the sea
 sons in our country.
    There happened a phenomenon this year which furnished
 me with an opportunity of explaining the origin of hurri
 canes.   At Bclfort, on the 4th of July, there was one of
 those hurricanes, so rare and extraordinary in Europe, which

                                                       I
  tore up trees, and unroofed houses. Hitherto had not been
  able to ascertain the cause; but my journey to Lyons fur
 nished me with an idea which might be realized. M. Molet,
  an intelligent medical professor, found, from his notes, that
 it thundered     that day at Lyons.    In passing through Sens       I
 saw   M.   Soulas, who informed me that the wind had changed
 from north to south.        The journals informed me that there
 was a dreadful storm at     London on the same day.
     There is, in my opinion, a mass of electrical clouds of
  100 myriametres in extent, the detonation of which had
 made an immense vacuum, and that the air rushed with
 great violence to fill up this vacuum.        I had a confirmation
 of this on     the  llth of January  1806.     Some dreadful claps
 of thunder    at Brest, Rouen, Chartres,     and Ypres,     produced
 tempests    and    hurricanes which overturned the chimneys of
 the houses at Bourdeaux, Besanijon, Nancy, and Dijon.
 Loud claps of thunder are very rare at this time of the year,
but the south wind made it very hot ; the atmosphere was
 rainy, the lower clouds were near enough to draw sparks
 from the earth to an extent of 60 myriametres : there were
 also earthquakes at the same time.
    The hurricanes of the Isle of France and America, which
 are much     more violent,    require us to suppose the stormy
masses much larger; but to these must be added water
spouts and submarine eruptions.
    M. Fiot, inspector-general of health, has sent roe the
results  of the heights of the river,   observed   every day during
the year 13. The mean state of the river this year was 1'35
metres on the scale of the bridge of La Tournelle, instead of
 1-24, which I had found by a mean of eighteen years, 1 777— i•
 1794.    The year      13 has been   considered    as   a rainy year,
nevretheless     there have been years   of l-73,   as 1787;    whilst
in   1803 we had only 0-59.         This height    is relative to the
low water of 1719; but the river has sometimes been lower
by some centimetres.

     Meteorology and navigation may equally claim a memoir
 by M. Biot, which explains, by means of. an interior mag
 net, all the declinations and inclinations of the needle ob

     There is an unpublished memoir of Tobias Mayer,                of
 which his son had the goodness to send me an extract.               It
 contains    an hypothesis      by which be explains the observed
 inclinations   and     declinations.    He supposes a very small
 magnet in the interior of the earth having two poles, the
 centre of which magnet is removed from the earth by one-
 seventh of the Tadius, and recedes from it each year one
 thousandth part.
     The line drawn from the centre of the earth through that
 of the magnet was in 1750 at 201° of longitude and J 7° of
 north latitude   :  the longitude increases    8' a year, and the la
 titude 14'.

     M. Azuni    has published a dissertation upon the origin       of
 the compass, in order to prove that the French were the first
 who used it: it was known in France in the 12th century,
 by the name of mariniere : it was used in the reign of Saint
 Louis. Gioia d'Amfiai, to whom it has been attributed,

    Nautical astronomy        has been enriched     with   an important
 book entitled     "A     complete Collection     of Tables for Navi
gation," by M. Mendoza, a Spanish officer, who has re
sided some time in England ; comprised in 727 pages,
in  large quarto.      It  contains all the tables necessary for cor
recting the altitudes and distances by the simplest method
hitherto found out ; for it is reduced to the addition of three
numbers, which we take from these tables.                We have also
tables of logarithms, semi-diurnal              arcs, amplitudes, the
most extensive table of the longitudes and latitudes of places
on the earth, and, generally speaking,             every  thing that is
requisite at sea. If we add to the above the horary tables
,which 1 published at great length in my Abridgment of
Navigation, in 1 793, sailors will require nothing more to
know when they are in any part of the world ; and I hope
that, in spite of all the efforts of the English, the French
will not   be the last to profit by these       advantages, under an
emperor    who   is  so  well  acquainted     with  the importance of
a navy.
    These tables render the calculations so easy, that naviga
tors would do wrong not to use this method of finding the
longitude.    M. Mendoza         is at present occupied     with a more
Complete treatise on nautical astronomy.
   M. Luyando has published at Madrid twenty-three charts,

or angles of spherical triangles within           a few minutes,      and
the correction    of   the distances observed      at sea  within  a few
seconds.     These charts,     as  well  as those  of Mi Margett's,     at
London> may be useful to navigators who are not fond of
calculations.       Those of M. Luyando will cost less, but
their use is rather more difficult.

     On   the  6th of February 1805, Mungo Park sailed front
 Portsmouth, in order to return into the interior of Africa,
 where he before made an interesting expedition.
    Lieutenant Ohlsen is occupied in drawing a map of Ice
 land.     He speaks of a boiling spring at Stort, which first
 made its appearance      in 1 784. It throws up the water to the
 height of 300 feet.        This proves that there is a great deal
 of water in the interior of the earth, and supports the hy
 pothesis by which I have explained the sinking of the wa
 ters which covered our mountains, and which I think must
 have entered into the interior cavities.
    M.   Schubert, the able astronomer       of Petersburg!!, has set
out for China with the         Russian embassy.        We may there
fore expect from him some good observations on the geo
graphy of Asia. We understand that the embassy had ar
rived upon the frontiers after a journey of 600 myriame-
tres, and that they were within 130 myriametres of Pekin ;
but the Chinese         are  not  fond   of much        company,  and
M.    Schubert returns by the north i his journey will be very
useful in many respects.
    M. Portalis, minister of religion, wishing to send some
missionaries      to  China,    concerted for that purpose with
M. Brunei^ the superior of St. Lazarus. They hope to be
able to set out this year, accompanied by an astronomer,
who    is already preparing his instruments.          The manuscripts
collected by    M. Bertin on the subject of China, are in the
hands of     a secretary,  who has offered to sell them to govern
ment.       M.  Billien and M. Abarie, attached to the foreign
missions,     have been in China; and kno\v the Chinese welh
Thus we have not lost all hope of seeing this branch of
knowledge come again into favour in France.
    The geography of Europe         has  also    received some recent
advantages.       M.  Benzenberg     writes from Dusseldorf,     that
the king of Bavaria has ordered some accurate maps             of the
country of Berg to be drawn.
    M.   Henry has returned from Alsace        ;   on  account of the

surement of the meridian.            He will resume his triangles for
his degrees      of longitudes, or rather         he  will continue his
triangles  of    Helvetia.
    M.  Heruiet,      imperial commissary of land-surveying, has
published     the    laws, arrets, and instructions, the circular
orders and decisions on that subject,           in two volumes octavo.
He will give      a  third in 1806.      They are busily occupied in
drawing plans of every part of France.
   The chief geometer of the department of Aveyron, and
the learned professor at Rhodes, M. Tedenat, are occupied
in rectifying     the principal points     of  the plan with a circular
instrument      of eight inches radius,       made by Messrs. Becker
and   Michel, which         gives the angles certain to two seconds.
   While we have            been  waiting for this complete and de
tailed description         of France, there has been published a
geographical, statistical, .historical, and political dictionary
of France, containing a description of the cities, villages, the
history, population, mineralogy, hydrography, commerce,
natural and artificial productions, the bid and new govern
ment, the civil, military, and ecclesiastical institutions, and
a  dictionary     of   the colonies,   with a general map, &c. in
five large volumes in quarto.          Fifteen years' labour has been
bestowed on this great work, and much pains and expense :
several men of learning have assisted in it ; they arc not
named, but they certainly deserve to be known. The dic
tionary of Expilly, in six volumes folio, was never finished,
although 1 had repeatedly requested it might : this perhaps
will supply     the place     of it.
   As it is     necessary      we should     conclude our History     of
Astronomy with           an  account of  the losses it has sustained,  I
shall begi.i with       M. Ratte, who,     as an  astronomer, has for  a
long period been an honour to the academy of Montpelier.
   Etienne-Hyacinte de Ratte, son of Jean-Pierre de Ratte,
and of Gillette de Flaugergues, wa3 born at Montpelier the
 1st of September, r722.             His taste for the sciences, and
principally for mathematics, displayed itself very early : he
had masters of every kind ; he studied all the sciences with
ardour, and the extent and the variety             of his acquirements

at so early     an age,    astonished the literary characters who
were then very numerous at Montpelicr. The Royal Society
of Sciences established in that city in 1706, were anxious
to receive among them          so promising     an associate, and    in
spite  of  the regulation, requiring     the members to be twenty
years  of  age,   that requisite was dispensed     with in favour of
young de Ratte, who in 1741 was admitted a member.                   ta
the year following he was elected perpetual secretary ; the du
ties  of which function        he continued     to discharge with the
greatest    credit until    the Royal Society     of Montpelier    was
suppressed.       IJe published   some volumes in 1766 and 1778,
under the title      or'  Memoircs,  afterwards under the title of
Assemblies     et  Bulletins, and in every volume there are some
articles, eulogies, and memoirs of his composition.                His
eulogies on Plantade, Clapies, Lapeyronie, Venel, Lafosse,
1'itot, Sauvage, Linne, Leroy, Lamure, &c. have proved
both the extent of his knowledge and his ability as a writer.
   He also composed several physical and mathematical me--
moirs upon vortices, fluids and aloes,          which are printed in
the Collections of the Royal Society          ;  and he furnished for
the French Encyclopedic the articles cold, ice, Jtail, &c.
   The famous prediction of Hal ley, respecting the return           of
the comet      of   1682,   which   he fixed    about 1757 or 1758,
occupied the attention not only of astronomers, but also of
all the scientific men of the day. M. de Ratte was anxious
to participate in the discovery of this comet; and this was
the occasion that determined him to pursue the study of
astronomy.        He was among the first who discovered it at
its issuing     from the sun's rays.       These observations gave
him pleasure,       and he never afterwards omitted observing
every comet any way remarkable.              He also observed the
transit of Venus in 1761 : the observation which he made
of it   at Montpelier      was one  of  the most complete ; and it
became the basis         of much calculation upon the sun's pa
rallax, with which M. Ratte was occupied.               He afterward?
made several observations upon the transits           of Mercury over
the sun, upon the eclipses of the sun and moon, the sa
tellites of Jupiter, and occultations of the stars;                 the
greatest    part of which have never been published.           He di-

rected       M.    Poitevin's studies towards astronomy, who is still
occupied with            it, and whose observations have been fre
quently printed.  He often regretted very much, that no
astronomer was established to make use of the observatory
of Montpelier.
  M.     de Ratte, the father, died in                  1    770   :   he was deacon         of
the counsellors         of   the court        of aids   at   Montpelier. The           wished
of his family  and of the public engaged M. Ratte, jun. td
take that office upon him    and he discharged the duties of
                                          ;
it,until the suppression of the court of aids, in the most                                  di
stinguished manner.    He was often the principal organ of
that assembly on important occasions and in times of diffi
culty   .-   it    was totally set aside, however, in 1793.
  At     the conclusion             of   the reign      of terror,          the members      of
the old Royal Society who had the   good fortune to escape
proscription, conceived the idea of re-establishing   under                           it
the name of the Free Society of Sciences and Belles Lettres.
This idea succeeded    the society was formed, and M. de
                                ;
Ratte was at first appointed secretary; and then president.
This society has already published two volumes of its me
moirs under the title of Bulletins, which contain interest
ing researches and observations.- There          discourse by          is   a
M. Ratte in the bulletin of the 3d of May, 1804. We
there see that his zeal set his age at defiance.
  M.     de Ratte was          chosen         a   non-resident          associate      of the
National Institute,            and afterwards named                    a    member of the
legion       of honour.
  He        enjoyed the most perfect state of health during
             had
the whole course of his life; but he was latterly attacked
with    retention of urine, the attacks of which becoming
        a
very frequent,          were        exceedingly painful            ;    but the habit he
had taught          himself of suffering without complaining;,                         and his
natural gaiety, made his friends forget that he was unwell.
He was present at the academy on the 24th of June, 1805                                      ;
and    was not until the night of his death that he was
      it
thought in danger.                  He expired on              the      loth of August,
aged 83.
  M.     de Ratte was          of   a    low stature    ;    he had
                                                               happy anda                   in

good humour ;         he never contradicted any one ; and he
always descended to the level of every person with whom
he conversed : his modesty and simplicity were extreme ;
and it was surprising to find in a man so consummately
learned, the candour and simplicity of a child : his memory
was surprising : he lived a life of celibacy, and by his death,
the house of Ratte, established in Langucdoc since 1433,
became extinct.        This family was originally from Bologna
in Italy,    and was   known so early as the year 1125 by the
talents and virtues     of Hubert    de Katie, cardinal and archbi
shop of Pisa, and by the military exploits of Jean de Ratte,
count of Caserta in the kingdom of Naples.
    The astronomical observations of M.          de Ratte have been
collected by his nephew M. de Flaugergues, at Viviers.
M. Poitevin, secretary of the academy, who is also an astro
nomer, has published his eulogy at great length at Montpe-
Jicr.
    We   have also lost   M. Romme,      an able professor    of navi
gation    at Rochefort.      He  had laboured in astronomy along
with   me   in his youth   ; I procured  a place   for him at Roche-
fort,  and he made several observations.
    In 1 771   he published a method for determining the longi
tudes at    sea;  in 180O he gave a model of a calculation for
finding the latitude and longitude at rca, wherein he seems
to think the method of Borda inconvenient in certain cases.
M. Dclambre, in the Connoissance du Temps, An XII.
p. 263, has shown that several authors are actually mistaken
in thinking that the sum of the two altitudes* and the di
stance surpasses 1 80° ; but this cannot happen.
    Romme gave in 1/78 the art of mast-making ; in 1781,
that of sail-making ; in 17§7, U Art de la Marine, or prin
 ciples and general precepts on the art of building, manoeu
vring, and steering       vessels ; a work     very    much   esteemed
among navigators.
    He  had composed several other works,           which   Barois the
elder was upon the point         of printing in     1 798 ; but  I was
particularly desirous     of  seeing   published his tables     of the
winds,     the tides,  and the currents in every sea ;      which   ap
peared    in two volumes in octavo.           In   1 796 he sent    me
                                                                  son it

 some curious observations upon the tides          of the Charante ;
in which     there  are some     particular circumstances which I
intend to publish in a       second edition of my Treatise on tho
Flux and Reflux of the Sea.
    In  1787   he made     some experiments upon the resistance
of water, which ship-builders        are much in want of.       I have
given the result of them in Montucla's History of Mathe
matics, tome iv. p. 454, according to the account given by
the commissaries of the academy.             He gave a marine vo
cabulary in French and English ; and perhaps no person
was ever more usefully or more constantly employed in this
grand art, which       is the principal     source of the prosperity
and grandeur     of states.
    He   was brother to the deputy, who obliged me           to make
the republican calendar in 1793, and who perished in the
troubles of the revolution on the 17th of June, 1795; the
latter had been tutor to the children         of count Stroganoff,   a
Kusssian nobleman, who resided           a long time at Paris.
   We    have also lost   M.   dc Chabert, a celebrated    navigator,
of whom I shall     speak more at length.
   Joseph Bernard dc Chabert, ci-devant marquis, chef d'es-
cadre in the navy, commander of the orders of Saint Loui*
and Saint Lazarus, inspector of the marine depot, free asso
ciate of the Academy of Sciences, and lately member of the
Board of Longitudes,       and  of the Royal Societies   of London,
of Berlin, Stockholm, Bologna, and Brest, was born at
Toulon, 28th February, 1J24-            He was the son of an officer
of   the royal navy, and he entered into the service in 1741 ;
his father, when dying, caused himself to be carried on
board the ship commanded by his son, and said, " I shall
now die without regret."
   In 1740 he went to Nova Scotia in a French squadron.
He then saw how very defective the maps of America were ;
he was   a witness to the dangers our vessels experienced, and
he gave an account of them upon his return.              Lemonnicr
undertook to request permission of the minister to allow
him to remain at Paris for the purpose of studying astrono
my, that    he might     go and remedy the inconveniences           he
b.ad   met  with, and encourage        the officers  of the navy to

pursue the study of a science which equally contributes to
their glory and their security.       At the age of thirty he re
ceived the cross of St. Louis, which he preferred to a pen
sion.    At the return of peace in August 1748, he pre
sented    a prospectus of the voyage and the observations.
M. Rouille     and  M.   de la Gallissoniere     furnished   him with
instruments     ; he set sail in 1750, in a frigate commanded by
the marquis de      Choiscul-Praslin, and he executed a chart of
the coasts of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, and of the
banks and islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.                I had the
saisfaction of furnishing him with an object of comparison
                                                                         ,
by my first observation of an eclipse of one of the satellites
on the 2d of October, 1750.             His voyage was printed in
 1753, in 288 pages in quarto.         It contains observations on
the magnet and upon currents        ; details  upon the calculations
which navigators require ; all       of  which evince that he had
already become      a very   good astronomer, and his example
excited emulation      in the navy, where it was much wanted.
The first volume of the Swans Etrangfres, published by
the academy in 1 750, contains a memoir of M. de Chabert
upon the longitude of Buenos Ayrcs.                 In the history of
the year 1756, his observations made in 1753 along the
coast of Spain and at Port Mahon arc mentioned.                In 1 756
he gave several other memoirs upon the transit of Venus,
upon hurricanes, and the eclipse of 1/GO.
   In 1758 he was received a member of the academy ; and
on the 25th of April, 175.9, he read at his public entry into
it his idea of cqnstructing charts of the Mediterranean, for
the purpose of making a second volume of the Neptune
Frnti^ah, published in 1693, and thereby following the la
bours of Chazelle and Feuillce, who died in 1710.
   He   set out on the first   of May,     1 764 :   after having laid
down the eastern coast of Spain, he passed into Sardi
nia, and crossed over to Fez, Algiers, and Tunis, where he
succeeded    in determining several important longitudes, by
means of a transit instrument which he fixed on shore, and
which he succeeded in placing in a few hours exactly in the
meridian.
   In  1 767,   after having sailed    ro.uad   the coasts   of Sicily,
                                                                     lie

             History of Astronomy       for  the Year 1805.          359
he steered for     Tunis    : he then went to   Tripoli,   and returned
into the Adriatic gulf.           In 1768 he commanded the Hi-
rondclle, in 1775 the Mignonne, and in 1776 the Atalanta,
on board of which was          M.  Choiseul.     He   was in possession
of  a time-keeper,        without which he could not have drawn
the chart    of the Cyclades and that part       of Greece adjoining     :
he had     reserved      this business to the present       opportunity.
The inscription        he caused    to be engraved      in the grotto  of
Antip.iros proves his great learning, and            will  be a monu
ment of it to future travellers. At his return our able astro
nomer Mechain,            being attached to the depdt of which
M.   de Chabert       was director, passed several years of his life
in reducing       and    calculating this immense quantity of ob
servations, which had cost so many years of labour and tra
velling, and from which resulted the best charts of that part
of the Mediterranean.            Several times he was in imminent
danger    of  his  life.    I hope his journal will be published, as
it cannot fail to excite considerable interest from, the anec
dotes   I have heard him relate.
    The American war obliged him to exchange his scientific
labours for the military marine service in the naval arma
ments of generals d'Estaing and De Grasse.                   In 1/78 he
 commanded the Valiant in d'Estaing's fleet : in 1 780 he
 had the Saint Esprit : he fought a battle, near the Chesa-
 peak, with five English vessels, on the 5th of September
 1781 : he relieved the Diadem, which the English were very
 near having taken.           He brought safely into a French port a
 convoy of 130 sail ; he was then named ckef d'escadre, and
 received the red ribbon ; this was the reward of twenty-two
 naval campaigns, in fifteen of which he commanded cor
 vettes, frigates, or ships of the line : he sailed during the

 of a  vessel and afterwards as       chief of a division, without ever
 neglecting     his astronomical observations and the use of the
 time-keepers, as may be seen in the Memoirs for 1783.

 from France, he went to England, where Dr. Maskelyne

                                                b,e
in calculating observations.                             Having returned      to Paris in
1   802, he was received                  in   the most distinguished manner by
those heroes of France who were best acquainted with his
talents and bravery,  He received pension in the monfh of   a

Longitude, and would have been included in the reorgan
ization of the Institute in 1803, had there been      vacant                    a
place. On the 4th of January 1805 he presented to the
Board of Longitude     chart of Greece, with the particulars

he never ceased his labours   he generally wrote or dictated
                                                  :
until nine o'clock   every evening; and when M. Nevev, his
secretary, left him,   he always felt regret. We have many
times found his memoir useful in the geographical discus
sions of the assembly. Some days previous to his death he
asked me for some observations which   had received from           I
Spain, in order to compare them with his own; and two
days before his death he desired some passages of his Me
moirs upon Pensacola, in Spain, where he laboured in 1766,
to be read to him.   Whenever his journals are published,
the world will be astonished at his ardour, his accuracy, his
labours, his dangers, and the presence of mind with which
he remedied all the inconvenient circumstances that opposed
his pursuits.
   An inflammation                    of      the      lungs carried him off     nine
                                                                                  in
days     ;        but he died without                 pain, consoled     by
                                                                        religion and
adored            by   a   beloved family.
        He married, in            1771, mademaiselle Tascher, the daughter
of      a    gentleman at Coire,                      in the Orisons,    and sister of     a

who   was   considered the best informed      man in Paris, and
frequented   as such by  men of letters.   M.de Chabert left one
daughter, niadame Roland, who, in concert with her mo
ther and her husband, afforded the greatest comfort to this
excellent man.     M.  Roland,   who   has   been    already distin
guished by his travels in Egypt, is at present attached       to the
army of Naples, and his extensive knowledge will enable him
to profit by his interesting travels.
    No person is better qualified to speak of M. de Chabert
than myself, who have known him since the year 1750, and
have lived with him    : his benevolence and tyis mildness were
universally admired by his inferiors.      He once found a new
born infam upon a desert, nearly dying, whom he reared
and educated.     She became an interesting girl, but died too
young to enjoy the full extent of his bounty. M. de Chabert
was one of the first among the officers of the navy to show
an example of zeal and learning: he was also one of the
first who made use of his dignity to promote the good of the
service itself; and his memory will be preserved among those
who have rendered service to all nations,       since the navy is
one of the sources of their prosperity,        as  it is one of the
means of improving the human species.             M.   de Missiessi,
known by his campaign in America in 1S04, and by his
work on the stowage of vessels in 1789, was the son of a
first cousin of his ; and the name of this worthy successor
of his fame was in the expiring lips of his illustrious parent.
    On the 9th of September we lost M. Dulague, bora at
Dieppe on the 26th of December 1729, an able professor of
navigation at Rouen, to whom we arc indebted for several
works and observations.       The Academy of Rouen will pub
 lish his eulogium.
    M.  Lesage, who died at Geneva, was occupied with ce
lestial philosophy.      His Newtonian Lucretius, upon the
cause of universal gravitation, is a curious work, which             I
 have quoted   in my Astronomy, art. 3530.

    M.  Arago,   secretary   to   the observatory,      devotes himself
 entirely to astronomy,      and we have       reason   to hope he will
repair our losses.
    Isaac Lalande,    the third of the name, has begun to turn
his attention to astronomy : he both calculates and observes.
The first eclipse which he calculated made us acquainted
with an error of a quarter of an hour in the calculation of
the next eclipse. I baptized him Isaac in honour of sir
Isaac Newton, whom I wish him to take for his pattern,
and that he might always have him in his memory.
   M. Copte, who died on the 6th of December, at the age
of fifty years, was not decidedly an astronomer, but his la«
hours in aerostatics authorise me to speak of his loss here ;
which isiindced, truly lamentable both for the arts and sciences,
or, in more extensive terms, for the whole human species.
LIV.   Method   of ascertaining whetlier Wines are adulterated
        with Litharge.      By M. Nauche, Physician*.
 JL he property    possessed      by litharge, or the demi-nitrous
white oxide of     lead, in depriving wines of a bad quality of
their bitterness or pungency, and thereby rendering them
mild and pleasant to the taste, has induced some avaricious
speculators to raise the price of their wines by adding a cer
tain quantity of litharge to them.
   This reprehensible practice, occasioning colics and va
rious other diseases, renders it dangerous to use wine.              It
is necessary, therefore, to be in possession of the means of
ascertaining this adulteration, or of ascertaining the inno
cence of such persons as may be unjustly accused of it.
   The agents employed for this purpose are the sulphuric
acid, and water charged with sulphuretted hydrogen gas.
   When pure sulphuric acid is poured upon wine contain-

»ng litharge,   it causes a white precipitate     in the  liquor which
eoon falls to the bottom       of  the vessel.
    The  same    acid   poured upon unadulterated wine merely
brightens   its   colour  a little, without producing any precipi
tate.
    This method, although         a good one, is not so accurate as
the   employment       of water charged with sulphuretted hy
drogen.
    In order to prepare this water, it is only necessary to put
into a phial a paste made of iron filings and sulphur; pouring
afterwards into it some drops of sulphuric acid, and libe
rating the gas which is produced from the mixture into a
flask filled with water, by means of a bent tube with which,
 the phial is furnished.
    Poured upon unadulterated wine, this water does not oc
 casion the least change in it ; while, on the other hand, it
 renders the wine adulterated with litharge black and flaky,
 and   produces an abundant precipitate, which soon falls to
 the bottom    of  the vessel.
    Some people make use of sulphur or alkaline sulphurets ;
 but these re-agents produce in pure as well as in adulterated
 wine a change of colour, and precipitates so little distinct
 from each other, that it is difficult to establish anv thine
 decisive from their differences.         It will  be much    better  to
 adhere to the processes here pointed out.

 made by the patients, the one a boy of seven, the other of
  thirteen years of age, were similar to those recorded in the
 writings of Poll and \Vare, whose opinions these two cases
 only served to confirm.         One of these patients discriminated
 correctly the difference between colours, but called a card
 that was held before him round, until that he was suffered
 to touch it with his fingers, when he observed that it was
 square.     In the dimensions and distance of external objects
 they both evinced extreme ignorance, and seemed to acquire
 that knowledge gradually, as childien        learn to read.

and proceeded      to detail the various minute experiments he
performed with plano-concave and plano-convex lenses in
order to produce these circular rays.            The reading, of this
curious paper was not concluded.

but from the name of the earl of Buchan, and other col
lateral circumstances,          it   appeared    not to be of         a later date
than 1250, and was probably granted during the reign of
Alexander the First or Second. In sir' John Sinclair's Sta

                    ORIGINAL VACCINE INSTITUTION,
                 Broad Street, Golden Square.
     A   meeting of the members of the Vaccine Club                            was
 held on the 4th        of December,           at the British Coffee-house,
 VV. Devaynes, Esq. M. Pi vice-president, in the chair. After
 the minutes of the proceedings of the institution since the
 former meeting were read, it was determined that the most
 important part of the investigation of the cow-pock for the
 public at present        is,
                        the ascertaining the proportional num
 ber of cases of small-pox amongst those who have been ino
 culated for the cow-pock.               It
                                 appeared, that  the practice    in
 of this institution the proportion was little more than one
                                                     a
 case out of each thousand inoculated since the commence
 ment       of this establishment.            These cases   it   was     requested
 might       be well    considered,       to discover whether or no they
                                                                             could

                    Original Vaccine Institution.
 could have been prevented by any known circumstances of
inoculation.       On examination it was admitted that no such
circumstances were known, and             of the reality of   the sub
sequent     occurrence    of the small-pox      there   was the most
convincing      evidence.
   The next question for consideration          was, the prbportion
of persons who might          be still susceptible   of the small-pox
after vaccination, but who had not been yet infected, either
because they had not been exposed,          or,  if  exposed, because
their constitutions were not at that time susceptible.
    It was proposed to defer the attempt at an estimate tilt
subsequent      occurrences should furnish data, except that it
might be admitted that at least not more than one half had
been infected with the small-pox, who were susceptible ;
so that at the fewest number, according to the prac
tice of this institution,      was one out    of five hundred, who
might     be considered as    susceptible of the small-pox after
vaccination.       These results, it was remarked, had induced
the institution not to warrant any person           as secure  without
the test of a second inoculation.
   In   the fourth place-,   inquiry was made, What might have
been the probable proportion          in the same region of prac
tice    in other hands than those of this establishment                ?
This could not be accurately stated for want of documents ;
but there was no reason to believe that it was less thin above
mentioned,       in all probability it was   greater,   if confidential
communications        were to be depended     upon.
   In the fifth place, the question was proposed, What
might be the proportion of failures elsewhere than in Lon
don, in our own country ?
   It  was observed,    that in all probability the proportion of
failures of persons duly vaccinated was much smaller in
other parts of the imperial kingdom than in London, for
which two      reasons might    be assigned.
    1st. Because    there was a less    chance   of exposure to in
fection.
   2d. Because there had probably not been any epidemic
prevalence of small-pox as there had been in .London.
Hence, if even one person out of a hundred was left sus
                                                               ceptible

                    Original   Vaccine   Institution.              367
ceptible of the small-pox, it was very conceivable that a
failure might not yet have occurred in many places ; and it
was remarked that on this account, without supposing any
imposition,     a delusion might subsist for some time that per
sons were secure who in reality were not so.
    With regard to the accounts from abroad, the evidence
was almost entirely negative with regard to failures.             This
evidence, however, was stated to be of little weight com
paratively to that in London, for various reasons.
    1st.  For  the reasons assigned     for the exemption from fai
lures in this country out of London.
    2d.   Because   the mass of people had not the liberty of
acting    or speaking as they profess under our government :
however, lately accounts had arrived, and more might be
 expected,    of failures in India.
    Iri the last place was discussed the proportion of failures
in the small-pox inoculation ; and here it appeared astonish
 ing, that any sensible practitioners should ever have consi
 dered the small-pox       inoculation    as upon the same     footing
 as vaccination upon this point.          It would  be unjust to place
 the two modes of inoculation          upon the same footing ; for
 the most extensive      inoculators in this country had declared
 they had never seen the small-pox twice in the same per
 son.     Such was the evidence of the late Dr. Archer, baron
 Dimsdale,     sir William     Watson, Dr. Woodville, and the
 whole family      of  the Suttons.       Thus, while in the course
 of sixty years, or from        1746 up to 1806, at the Small
 pox Hospital, amongst          60,000     persons who had under
 gone the small-pox, not one had been known to have
 taken the small-pox a second time ; yet in the course of
 seven years vaccine practice at the same place, it was well
 known that     a certain number had taken        the small-pox   sub
 sequently to the cow-pock.
     It was not to be concluded,        however, from these state
 ments, that vaccination was not greatly preferable >to vario
 lation ; but it was to show the necessity of a second inocu
 lation until    the circumstances       should be known     in which
 security could be given by one inoculation.
    It was the conduct of the too sanguine and prejudiced
                                                             advocates

 quired for secure practice;

both with excess of acid and excess of base.
    Indeed the partisans of the old doctrine suppose, that in
these cases of variable proportions there is no combination,
but the superabundant principle is simply interposed in the
free state between the molecules          of   the two principles com
bined in the ordinary proportion.
    M. Berthollet says in answer, that              if this was the case,
sulphuric acid poured upon a sub-earbonate would at first
take up some free alkaline molecules, before attacking those
which      are combined with carbonic acid.              But this is not
the case ; for the least drop of the first acid immediately
produces the liberation of the second, that is to say, effer
vescence.        The acidulated    sulphate   of soda effloresces in the
air, i.   e.  it there loses  its water of crystallization ; which
would      not lake place    if  the superabundant         sulphuric acid
was present in the free state, because there is no substance
which more strongly attracts humidity than this acid.
                                                                  M. Bcr-

      M.  Bcrthollct    had given a method       of estimating    the de
  gree of acidity of the different acids, and the degree of alka
  linity of the different bases, hy the quantity required by each
  of these kinds of substances in order to saturate or neutra
  lize the other completely, so as that the combination may
  evince no sign of acidity or alkalinity.
      He confirms this method by showing, that the propor
  tions of these quantities are constant, and that if it requires,
  for instance, twice as much of any kind of acid to saturate
 one base than another, there must be twice                 as  much   of
 every other kind       of acid to the first than to the second.
      But the degree of resistance of heat does not correspond
 to. this force, and it is easier, for example, to decompose by
  fire the carbonate     of magnesia than that of lime, although
 the affinity    of  these   two earths   for the acid is nearly the
 same.     It is that the former carbonate has much more water,
 and, as other experiments show, that water favours the libe
•
  ration  of carbonic acid.
      The consequences of       these  facts to all    the  branches   of
 chemistry, and particularly for the theory            of analyses,   are
  incalculable.
     The  tables   of the affinities  and   a   great  part o"f the ana
 lyses made to this day are invalidated by the above ; and in
 short, experience proves that almost all these products have
 need    of being     revised.   For example, M. Klaproth, and
 after him    M.   Vauquelin, have found a fifth of fluoric acid
 in the topaz, where its existence had never been suspected.
 This stone therefore passes into the class of acidulated sub
  stances.
      Another mineral, hitherto regarded as        a  stone, passes into
 the class of the metals : it is that which        was formerly called
 oisanite,    or octaedral     schorl .of Dauphiny, and which
 M. Haiiy has recently named anatliasis. M. Vauquclin
 found nothing in it but the oxide of titanium, as in the
 other mineral called red schorl.
     This fact    is important,    because   it presents   two minerals
 among which chemists cannot yet find any essential diffe
 rence of composition, although- their physical qualities, and
 particularly their crystallization, are all diUcrcm.

    In mineralogy       there  has also been a similar         case     in that
of   the urragonite, where chemists have only found a carbo
nate of lime, although its weight, hardness, fracture, and
crystallization differ much from that of calcareous spar or
common carbonated lime.
    A  different example, but which           also   establishes a sort      of
opposition among the physical and chemical characters of
the minerals, has also presented itself this year.
    It is the ore of iron known by the name of spathic iron*.
It   constantly has The same crystalline form as carbonated
lime, and indeed it often contains a very considerable quan
tity of   the latter substance.       M. Haiiy     had ranked        it among
the varieties of this species, considering the oxide of iron
in it as merely accidentally arising out of the crystallization
of the lime, nearly the same as it is with the sand in the
singular crystals of stone found in the forest of Fontain-
bleau : in fact, we have known for a long time past that
the quantity of iron is very variable in it.
     But two young chemists, Messrs. Drappier and Descos-
tils, have discovered that the quantity of lime varies still
more considerably in spathic iron, that sometimes there is
none at all in -it; and that magnesia and the oxide of man
ganese are often in as variable quantities, according to the
specimens.
     Here, therefore,        there  are  very    different combinations
which present themselves under a form always the same.
     These kinds of difficulties, these apparent oppositions be
 tween two branches of one and the same science, or between
two methods of regarding objects, must be referred to some
 imperfection in the principles of the one or other of the two
 methods,      and merit all the attention       of   the friends     of truth.
 ^Researches     on the subject would probably terminate by the
 discovery of some new general fact, which conciliates every
 thing.
     The labours upon native platina, of which we have spoken
 in our two last reports, have been continuc-i! this year by dif
  ferent chemists, and have led to some clear and satisfactory
  results.

       M.   Fourcroy has given an account of these labours in a
   memoir, wherein he has done justice to those who have
   taken part in them.
      The following is an abridged account of these labours :
       It will be recollected that M. Descostils, in endeavouring
   to account for the various colours of the triple salts of pla-
   tina, perceived that the red colour of some of them was
   owing to some unknown metal.
      Messrs. Fourcroy and Vauquelin on their part, on exa
  mining a black powder which remains after platina has been
  dissolved, and finding that in some experiments a very strong
  smelling metallic vapour arises, that in others the substance
'
  is manifested in       a  manner more fixed, they also regard this
  powder as a       new metallic substance, the different properties
  of which they attribute to different degrees of oxytrenation.
      But at the same time Mr. Tennant of London had exa
  mined this same black powder, and succeeded in decom
  posing it once more into two different metals, the one fixed
  and the other very volatile : and Mr. Wollaston, another
  English chemist, operating upon the solution which was
  formerly thought to contain only platina, found in it two
  other metals, different both from platina and from those
  which compose the black powder.
      Thus, after     the long and painful researches        of which this
  singular mineral has been            the object for more than forty
  years, chemistry has succeeded             in proilucine; from it eleven
  metallic substances, viz. platina, gold, silver, iron, copper,
  chrome 'and titanium,             found by Messrs. Fourcroy and
  Vauquelin in the sands, more or less coloured, which are al
  ways mixed \vith platina.
      The two new metals discovered by Mr. Wolhsion were
  palladium and rhodium ; and those discovered by                Mr. Ten
  nant were indium and osmium*.
      The    metal discovered in platina            some years ago by
  M.    Vauquelin and called chrome, has been discovered in
  the meteoric stones by M. Laugier.
     •  Mr. \Vcllaston's and  Mr. Tennaot's paper* have already been given in
  the VhiloEophica! Magazine.

   It has been since discovered by M. Thenard in the me
teoric stones which fell near Alet, department of Gard, and
which the Academy collected and sent to the Institute,
   These stones, the fall of which has been established by
testimony no less respectable than that of preceding ones,
differ from them, however, in colour and consistence : they
are blacker and more friable ; but their analysis yielded
M.   Thenard nearly the same principles : the metals in them
are only more oxidated,         ajid there is a little more coal in
them.      This result    has been    confirmed by a committee         of
the Institute.
   The    last  year  announced      the   opinion of M. Pacchiani
upon    the composition or the muriatic acid, which           bethought
he had produced by         depriving water of a part of its oxygen
by means of the Galvanic pile.
   This discovery would have been one              of the most impor
tant that chemistry had ever produced            ;  but it is not veri
                         '
fied when care is taken to remove                  from   the  apparatus
every thing which could furnish sea-salt.               This has beetj
established by Messrs. Biot and Thenard by direct experi
ments.
   In   a  work upon refraction,        at first undertaken for astro
nomical purposes, M. Biot was            led to employ the action      of
bodies upon light in         a very advantageous       manner,   for the
analysis of transparent substances *.            The substances pro
duced by organized beings have never yet been sufficiently
rigorously examined.            Although we know generally of
what elements they are composed, and thai these primitive
elements are not very numerous, their combinations are so
varied, they change their nature so easily in the operations
which they undergo ; that we must study for a much longer
time these combinations themselves as if they were simple,
and abstraction wade of their true elementary principles.
These matters thus considered are what are called the imme
diate principle* of organized bodies.            This   year has made

T  HE comet discovered by M. Pons at Marseilles on the
10th of November has not been visible to us these few days
past, on account of its too great increase of southern de
clination.  According to observations made here and at Li-
licnthal,      M. Bessel, superintendant of the observatory of the
celebrated      senator        of justice Schroter, at Lilienthal, has cal
culated       the path        of this comet. From the calculation      fol            it
lows that the new comet, after appearing      superior bril             in
liancy in the southern parts of the globe, and aftc-r passing
very close to the        south pole of the ecliptic on the   1st of                   3
December,          will be again visible towards the middle of Ja
nuary, above the horizon of the observatories in the south
of Europe, and about the 20th of the same month will be
also visible in this neighbourhood.                         will then be seen in

us the comet will rise but                   a   very little above the clearest part
of    the south and south-west                     horizons,       and on that account

may be very distinctly observed, and followed                                with the       te
