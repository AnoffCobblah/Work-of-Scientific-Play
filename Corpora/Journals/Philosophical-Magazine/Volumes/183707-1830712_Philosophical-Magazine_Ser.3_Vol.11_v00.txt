the    conducting     wires.      These experiments were published
 early      1825 in    the  Edinburgh
                                 in         Philosophical Journal.
    It  had been ascertained            that time, that   at     diminution                  a                          of
deflecting power exhibited itself                the needle          on

                      I
 namely, whether the effect was produced                     the transmission           by

     whether two fluids rushed           simultaneously      from each pole;
     lastly, whether the effect was due                  the transmission       to                                      of

as single plates.
     With this power at my disposal       I was anxious if possible
to make the      experiments    upon  such a scale as should leave
nothing doubtful in the results.                        I
                                       accordingly procured about
900 feet of small    copper   bell wire,   in one length. This was
arranged in the manner hereafter described, and experiments
carefully made upon it with three compasses at twenty different
lengths, varying from 838 feet to 98 feet, and the results care
fully read and registered. The three compasses were placed,
one at each extremity of the wire and the other exactly in the
middle of       its
                length.

state     of
           electric tension, and that the diminished effect                                                  by
lengthening the wire was not,             had     first supposed, due

4       Mr. Barlow   on the Electro-magnetic conducting   Power
limits, beyond them the galvanometer must become an ineffi
cient instrument.
                          I
   In my experiments employed twelve copper wires, each
two feet long, varying in weight from 17 grains to 1590 grains,
and twelve brass wires varying from 38 grs. to 3770 grs. ;
the squares of the diameters of course varying in the same
ratio. One would naturally think, therefore, had such a law
had place, it must have been rendered sufficiently obvious in
these experiments; but so much was it the contrary, that I
could perceive no increase of power in any of the wires which
exceeded in weight 180 grs. for a length of two feet.
   These results are therefore so decidedly at variance with
                              I
the law above stated, that shall be excused bestowing a few
lines in describing the manner in which the experiments were
conducted. This was as follows:
   Two stout wires about 3 of an inch in diameter were bent
into the form shown in the diagram, their ends m m' being bent
down about an inch, properly amalgamated, and inserted into
two wooden cups containing mercury, these cups being about
20 inches apart. Two notches were cut in the sides of the cups
m m', in which were laid the specimens to be experimented
on, these being placed so that the wire m m' was exactly in the
magnetic meridian, and therefore parallel to the needle placed
between them but considerably below the wire.     These speci
mens it should be observed, were all also bent down an inch at
each end and amalgamated, to be,
like the poles of the battery, in
serted in the mercury. The notches
in the sides of the cups m m' were
for receiving each successive spe
cimen, so   #.   no change should
take place throughout in the rela
tive position of the wire and com
pass.
    The only remaining point to
  uard against was the variable
power of the battery; and to provide against this, a standard
wire, weighing 470 grains, was inserted in the cups, and the
deviation produced by it observed and registered before and
after that produced by each successive specimen; the mean of
the former deflections was then considered as indicating the
mean power of the battery for that experiment, and it was

   With such a series of results, obtained on a large scale,
with a powerful battery, and with every necessary precaution to
ensure their accuracy, it is impossible, using the deflections as
the measure of the conducting power, to arrive at the conclu
sion, that the power of wires of different diameters and of the
same length varies directly as the squares of their diameters,
or as any power of the diameter whatever.
   A similar discrepancy has place in the law which has
reference to the length, M. Becquerel making the power
vary inversely as the length, while my experiments make
it vary in the inverse ratio of the square root of the length,
or at least very nearly in that ratio. I am aware that as
suming this law, viz. l-º, the errors between the computed

6          Mr. Barlow           on the Electro-magnetic conducting Power
and observed variations average about a degree, and in one
case out of twenty exceed two degrees, and for this reason
I have only stated my result as an approximation; but admit
ting the power to vary inversely as the length, the average error
amounts to nearly 20°, where the whole observed angle does
not amount to 16°; and on this account I am again obliged to
employ a few lines to explain the manner in which these ex
periments were conducted in order to trace that error to                                                             its

    On examining the errors arising from the assumption that
 the deflection varies inversely as the square root of the length,
 we find them amount on an average to about a degree, the
 maximum exceeding 2°; and Mr. Christie properly observes,
 that with such errors we cannot admit the law of the square
 roots. These errors however, employing the law of the                                                                               in
verse of the length, would amount to 18°; and it          therefore,                                           is,
 very desirable                     to

that of what is called the galvanometer, is any certain measure
of the relative conducting power of a wire, without reference
to the intensity and productive power of the battery employed,
whether our inquiries relate to their length, diameters, or
natural qualities.     To take the case of wires of the same kind
and same length, it may perhaps be possible, where the pro
ductive power is great and the intensity inconsiderable, to em
ploy a wire so small that it shall not be able to carry off the
whole of the fluid the battery is competent to supply; and when
this is the case a larger wire may be advantageously used, and
if it does not greatly exceed the other, the power of conduc
tion and the indications of the galvanometer may be consistent;
but after employing a wire capable of conducting away the
fluid as fast as it can be supplied by the battery, it will be use
less to expect to produce a greater effect on the galvanometer
by employing a greater wire.
     hould this view of the subject be correct, it must be ad
mitted that the indications of the galvanometer are no certain
measures of the conducting power of wires, unless reference
be had also to the intensity and productive power.
   To take, by way of illustration, a more tangible, but some
what analogous case, viz., the conducting power of metals for
caloric. I would suppose a spirit lamp of given power and                                                 in

some degree            of

        The    names   of   these authors are a sufficient guarantee that
each    has reported his results correctly, and there must be
 therefore some cause for the discrepancies involved in their
 estimations which it is very desirable to discover; for till this
 is done we cannot be said to be in possession of any law of
 conduction in electricity derived from one source only, and
 much less are we enabled to assign the comparative conduc
 ting powers when derived from different sources.
                                     I
    According to the idea have advanced, the galvanometer
 only measures the conducting power of a metal while the wire
 is so small as to be insufficient to carry off the generated elec
 tricity; beyond that point it only measures the intensity of the
 battery. Now this intensity certainly varies with the length
of the conductor. Sir Humphry Davy, it appears, considered
 the law to be inversely as the length, and M. Becquerel states
this law distinctly; while the experiments                    I
                                                  have referred to
make it nearly inversely as the square roots of the lengths.
 So that while M. Becquerel, by quadrupling the length of his
wires, reduced his deflections to about one fourth, mine were
only reduced to about a half, and with nine times the length
to about one third.
    My battery, as I have shown, had a large generating sur
face; what the other batteries may have been I cannot tell;
but      if,
         according      the view. have taken, my battery gene
                            to           I
rated the fluid faster than the conductor could carry           off,        it
and the others did not, we see           once why the intensity
                                             at                                    in
my instrument did not exhibit the same reduction; but                              if
from the nature and magnitude                of
                                        these batteries this cannot
be be
     supposed, then this explanation fails and some other must
     sought for.
    When we reflect that besides this great discrepancy         the         in
law      of
         the length, we have       still greater

lates to diameter, and another nearly as large between the
conducting power of different metals as given by various au
thors, including men of the first rank in the science, we must
conclude that there is some inaccuracy, and that there are pro
bably other circumstances influencing the results which are not
at present understood.                               If
                              the explanation I have attempted
should be thought satisfactory I shall feel much gratified; and
if not, and it should only lead to inquiries that shall elicit a
satisfactory explanation, my object will have been attained.

III.      On the Eristence of Structure in the Ashes of Plants
      and their Analogy to the Osseous System in Animals. By the
      Rev. J. B. READE, M.A.”
-
 THE   broad assertion that   plant differs from an animal is
                                                a
   so obviously true, that while points of difference rapidly
 present themselves, it appears to be a matter of no easy ac
 complishment to discover points of resemblance.              MAN is
 not more readily distinguished from other animals by his
 divinely bestowed power of looking before and after, than the
 generality of animals stand high above            vegetable creation all
    bytheir powers                of
                          voluntary motion and perception.        Yet

without interfering with the process of vegetation.     But since
the residual matter which combustion separates is as it were
carefully arranged, in certain definite forms, throughout the
entire plant, those forms varying uniformly in different parts
of the same plant but preserving many similar characters in
similar parts of different plants, we cannot suppose that there is
no connection between structure like this and the general oeco
nomy of vegetation, or that so concealed but curious a con
trivance has no share and interest in the functions of vegetable
life.
   We   may also further infer that there is a chemical union of
the earthy, saline, and metallic ingredients which the ashes of
plants contain.        If
                      these ashes were wholly destitute of struc
ture, we might with justice suppose that they contained their
elements in mechanical combination merely, each particle be
ing a pure portion of a separate element. But the fact of
organization compels us to conclude that, in each and every
particle of the incombustible residuum, every element is com
bined under the operation of a natural chemistry. And hence,
under this impression, we can pronounce the ashes of plants
to be a purely vegetable product, equally with the nutritive
products, starch, sugar, and gum.
   Whether the physiologist will condemn as fanciful and
vague any idea of analogy between the bones of animals and
this systematic distribution of incombustible matter in plants;
or whether, bearing in mind that created things differ in mag
nitude preeminently,–he will be disposed to confirm such spe
culations; these are points which I cannot decide. Of this,
however, I feel confident, that every lover of the microscope
          i.
will be glad to place in his cabinet a series of objects which,
to say      least, will call forth his admiration, if they do not
also awaken a suspicion that he is examining structure which
has been obedient to some rule, and is therefore conducive to
some effect.

     Note.   — The above observations              may   possibly    tend   to
throw some light on the natural process of the silicification of
wood.   By the agency of an intense heat the surrounding si
liceous matter may be liquefied and the carbon and gaseous
products of the wood dispelled, while the essential characters
of the fibrous and cellular structure are undisturbed. The
unconsumed portions, which alone constitute the true vege
table frame-work, are then, as it were, mounted in the fluid
silica.   This property of retaining         its
                                               form notwithstanding the
action    of   heat, which seems   to   be

of coal; and, upon examination, I find that the white ashes of
“slaty coal" furnish most beautiful examples of vegetable re
mains.    We have thus additional evidence that the basis of
 vegetable structure is independent of carbon.

   Still smaller open and elevated areas are called Saoitos, and
partake        of
              the common character, having         few straggling               a

markable for the undulations of its surface, and consists of a
countless series of rounded hills, which rise from one hun
dred to four or five hundred feet above the bed of the prin
cipal streams.    Some of these hills are prolonged in the form
of  ridges, stretching  several miles in a direction varying be
tween north-east and east; their sides penetrated deeply, at
inconsiderable    intervals,   by innumerable lateral ravines.
Other eminences are so surrounded by watercourses and ra
vines as to appear in regular oval or circular forms, as if con
structed by the hand of man, like the ancient mounds and
earth-works of Europe, on a gigantic scale.          Some of them
are a few hundred yards only in diameter, and rise from two
to four hundred feet in elevation, and slope on           sides with               all

20     Mr. R. C. Taylor's Notes relative                          to the Geology         of Cuba,
     From the midst of the barren savanas and the lower wooded
plains arise those lofty detached mountains of compact marble,
whose singular forms, and whose white, precipitous, waterworn
sides, contrast so remarkably with the rounded, sunburnt hills
of the savanas, and give such a peculiarity to the contour
of this coast, and furnish to the mariner such conspicuous
landmarks.        At a little distance, and even at several miles
from the base of these mountains, their precipitous faces ap
pear vertically and distinctly striated, like clusters of enormous
columns, hundreds of feet in height. We at first attributed
this appearance to the possibility of a section of vertical strata
being thus presented.           But on closer examination we found
no such traces of stratification:                      all
                                               sides appeared        possess            to
the same singular, strongly marked vertical lines; and we saw
that this remarkable columnar appearance was derived from
the erosion         the perpendicular face
                       of                            the hard rock, wher

    In the vicinity of Savana Veija are limestone hills, composed
of very thin layers or laminae, dipping to the south from 50°
to 75°.    This rock is white, occasionally tinged with green,
and contains numerous interposed beds, varying from half an
inch to 4 inches thickness, of red and flesh-coloured crystal
line limestone. In other situations we observed that this lime
stone is either cream-coloured, or with various delicate tints
of yellow, green, or pink.
    The Gibara river is crossed repeatedly by bands of this
limestone, which are traversed by a network of quartz veins.
 In these positions the rock exhibits evidence of having been
 shattered and broken, the fragments being reunited in a sili
 ceous cement, and so distorted that the original arrangement
 of the laminae or seams of the limestone is obscure and almost
 obliterated.    In general         all

are so  extremely  rare, that during months of examination but
two or three specimens came under our observation. They
were madrepores, the structure of which had been partly ob
scured by crystallization, or by the change which the mass of
limestone had undergone. We have not observed the slightest
trace of a shell in this formation. . It is possible that it may
have originally contained organized fossils which have been

     From the foregoing description it would appear that this

by M. de Humboldt at the west end of the island of Cuba,
under the name of Calcaire [Jurassique?] de Guines, which
we ourselves have had some opportunity of examining in the
vicinity of Havana.    We conceive that it is more ancient than
those rocks; and that it is contemporary with the Euphotides
                                            É.i.
and metalliferous serpentines of this region.
   It is a prevailing character of the         and Gibara lime
stone that it contains large masses of carbonate of lime of a
much later origin. These are accounted for, on the supposi
tion that they were open fissures, cavities, and even large ca
verns, which in process of time have been wholly filled by
stalagmitical infiltration. All these later deposits are of a
brick-red colour, remarkably fetid, and embrace vast quan
tities of casts of land shells, occasionally intermixed with ma
rine univalves, and with a few small bones, apparently of the
great Indian rat, one of the very few indigenous quadrupeds
of the island, and now inhabiting the same mountains.

assistance  of the luxuriant foliage of certain creeping shrubs, or
an occasional tree growing amongst the recesses and crevices.
    The barometer being injured in the ascent, no correct cal
culation was made of the height of La Silla, which we esti
mated at from one thousand to twelve hundred feet above the
sea, here distant about eight miles.
    Contrary to our expectation, we found that the summit was
limited to a narrow ridge; a mere vertical wall of honey
combed limestone, on which it was practicable only in a few
places to obtain sufficient space for standing, assisted by the
shrubs that were rooted in the crevices.
    We have adverted to the singularly beautiful appearance
of these rocks when viewed either from the crest or from below;
which effect was produced by the vertical wearing or erosion
of the white marble in grooves, giving them the aspect of
enormous columns and of gigantic groups of crystals.
    The upper surfaces of this rock are deeply honeycombed;
that is to say, they have numerous sharp projecting points, on
which it is dangerous to walk, and have also innumerable cir
cular holes two or three inches in depth and one inch or more
in diameter, perfectly smooth and regular in their interior, as
if bored with an auger.
    No stratification can be perceived in this enormous mass of
limestone. Certain lines of separation there are, which may
be traced at various angles, as well as vertical fissures, but
none of these were the result of stratification.      Large blocks
are commonly seen piled on the sides near the summits of
these mountains. They are remarkably sonorous when struck,
ringing under the blow of the hammer like a bell.
    Land-shell Limestone of La Silla.-We have adverted to
the barrenness of the white marble in organic remains, and
 we obtained from hence only a single specimen, a madrepore,
 which was somewhat modified in form.
    We have now to describe a deposit, rich in fossil shells, of
 a novel and remarkable character.
    On the surface and on the sides of La Silla is a great abund
 ance of subsided masses of stalagmitical rock, derived from the
 limestone, and filled with hollow casts of an immense assem
 blage of univalve shells, which at the first glance I thought
 were tertiary.    On examination these shells were observed to
be   peculiar to a separate rock of a brick-red colour, but the
position of that rock was not immediately discovered. This
 red earthy stone was also crowded with small spherical bodies;
 black, smooth, polished, with minute rounded and kidney
 shaped pebbles, from the size of mustard-seed to that of a

      Jrom the Observations of himself and Mr. Clemson.                                       67
small pea. They were unequally distributed, and in some spe
cimens but few can be observed.            The shells were in almost
every instance enveloped in crystallized carbonate of lime.
    During subsequent researches we ascertained that the red
rock was not interstratified with the white limestone, but oc
cupied the spaces formed by ancient open fissures, sometimes
a few inches only in thickness; but in one instance, within fif
teen feet only of the summit, it was exhibited of the breadth
of fifty feet, and of a thickness varying from ten to thirty.
This mass was evidently composed of a numerous series of
deposits, having different tints, and being more or less earthy
or crystallized, emitting an offensive odour when broken.
    It was not until after two or three visits to this mountain
that we traced satisfactorily the extent of these insulated shelly
deposits, acquired a knowledge of their origin, and per
ceived the process by which they were consolidated.                It be
came    evident,  on  comparison,   that these   univalves, which were
as abundant as in any deposit we have seen, were referrible to
land genera, such as exist in profusion among the rocks of the
same mountain, amounting to eight or nine species at least.
The inhabitants of these shells retire into the open fissures
and caves, and in some instances are probably carried into
them; and the dead and unoccupied shells                     vast num    lie   in
bers   in   such   places,     every

                                                the real origin and cha
racter     of
            the new red shelly limestone. We perceived that
perfectly fresh            or
                       recent marine univalves were                 means     by   no
uncommon even upon the highest crest                            of

La Silla. This mystery was solved when we found that the
active agents        the transportation, and
                           in                          the admixture
                                                               in                            of
sea and land      exuviae,    were the soldier crabs, which abound
here, and which inhabit the littoral shells almost wholly,
wherever they are found, borrowing those habitations for their
temporary purposes, and discarding them when too small for
their convenience.
     The soldier crabs (genus Pagurus)     certain seasons re
                                                          at

tities. They return from their pilgrimage, carrying      rather                    or
dragging the shell               of
                         some marine univalve for      many                                  a
weary mile; and thus, like the pilgrims   the olden time, each

bearing his shell to denote the character and extent of his
wanderings, they proceed for miles into the interior.     Thus,
at the distance of eight or ten miles from the nearest shore,
we trace them to the very summit of a precipitous mountain,
almost twelve hundred feet high.     When these borrowed ha
bitations become too confined for the accommodation of their
tenants, the crabs desert them, and seek for larger shells,
leaving the others mingled with the terrestrial shells, as we
ºbserved.    The marine shells which had been thus conveyed
from the sea to the top of La Silla were
   Trochus, two or three species.
   Turbo, two or three species, particularly T. muricatus, Lam.
  Littorina, one.
   Monodonta, one.
No doubt other genera and species were also transported
thither by the same agents, but those above mentioned we can
testify     to.

referred.    These caves swarmed with    bats, snails, spiders,
tarantulas, scorpions, and other vermin, and the large snake
called the Majus. They are also the resort     hogs, which run    of

  30   Mr. R. C. Taylor's    Notes relative to the Geology   of Cuba,
  of which the apertures are nearly closed up.        All these cham
  bers have nearly level floors, covered to an unknown thickness
  with red earth or mould, on which is thickly strewed the dung
 of the thousands of bats which congregate here, and myriads of
  snail-shells.    I think the dung of the bats alone would be in
 sufficient  quantity   to account for the red earth, and that the
 colouring matter of this earth and of the rock into which it
 passes is vegetable and not mineral, as the examinations to
 which it has been submitted appear to determine.           We would
 have ascertained the     depth of this soil on the floor of the cave,
 but the annoyances from the causes alluded to rendered our
 stay there almost impracticable. We ascertained quite enough,
 however, to feel assured that in this soil, to which the bats
 have largely contributed and have coloured by some vegetable
 exuviae,     in the multitude of dead and decomposing shells, for
 which this cave seemed the charnel-house, the tomb of mil
 lions,—in the gradual conversion of this mass to the state of
 solid rock, we saw the origin of those beds of shelly carbonate
 of lime which at first sight seemed almost inexplicable.
    Admirture of Terrestrial, Marine, and Freshwater Shells.—
 The shores of the bay of Gibara supply to the geologist an
 instructive instance of this association of shells of different
 habits. There are several streams which empty themselves
into this bay, and which in times of floods, during the rainy
 season, bring down an immense number of dead land-shells
 from the high lands of the interior. We here noticed ex
 tensive banks' or deposits of terrestrial and marine shells,
as on the mountain of La Silla; but the agency is re
versed. In the one case we saw that the marine shells were
conveyed by those active agents the soldier crabs even to
the highest crest of La Silla. In the other the land shells
have been brought down from the rocky recesses of La Silla,
and are deposited in multitudes with those of the sea, on the
margin of the estuary. Were any great geological catastrophe
to occur, by which these accumulations would be buried, and
be subjected to the examination in future times of some            in
quiring naturalist, he would see repeated here the phaenomena
which have been observed in more than one position in re
mote parts of the globe: with these he would find also a full
proportion of freshwater shells, but of one genus and species
only, the inhabitants of the Cuba streams, the Neritina vir
ginea of Lamarck; of which great quantities are brought down
by the freshes and deposited on the beach with the terrestrial
and sea shells, and with the small oysters which cluster so
thickly on the pendent branches of the mangroves of the
creeks.

  Coral Rock of different Ages on the Shores of the Island of
Cuba.-In our    examination of the rocks which approach the
north coast of Cuba, we have seen riothing to countenance the
hypothesis of a gradual transition from the crystalline white
limestone we have described in this article, to the fragmentary
coral rocks which appear on some parts of the coast, and
thence to the modern reef of living corals which encompasses
the Indian islands.  Some such passage we have observed on
the borders of the sea near Matansas, the Havana, and the
Moro Castle; but the compact limestone of the first class is
not in those positions, and a newer lithographic rock inter
poses.
   On the west side of the Bay of Gibara the white limestone
is observed, declining at first at an angle of 45°, and then de
creasing to 20° towards the sea. Upon and near the base of
this slope rest ancient beds of aggregate coral rock, reaching
to about twenty feet above the present high-water line. This
rock is indurated and externally honeycombed like the white
compact limestone of the mountains.
    Three or four miles to the west of the bay the shore is

    From this old reef we collected                      series   of  characteristic      spe
 cimens,

of the distinguishing characters of this old coral rock is that
it is for the most part made up of          a branching species, which
  appears to have existed at that time in great profusion, but
  which we have failed to discover living in the vicinity on the
 present reef.     This ramose coral of the beach, when worn by
 the action of the waves, reminded me of forms which were
 nearly similar, which I remember to have seen at the base
 of the chalk at Hunstanton Cliff in Norfolk, and to which
  I made reference more than fourteen years ago in an article
 in the Philosophical Magazine, First Series, vol. lxi. p. 82.
    Our notice of these different aged reefs would be incom
 plete did we stop here. We have remarked that there is a dif
 ference of level, amounting to full twenty feet, perhaps thirty,
 between the outer and the inner reef.             Now as the coral                           in
 sects do not live above high-water mark, and indeed are sel
 dom seen living above the extreme low-water level, and com
 monly are several feet below          it,  would appear that this an
                                             it
 cient inner reef, which passes inland, was produced under
 different circumstances of relative elevation of the sea and
 land; and that either the sea has been depressed                    depth     to    a
 corresponding with the existing reefs             the coast, or, what
                                                       of                                     is
 more   probable,   that the   land has   been   elevated  since the con
struction    of the old  reefs,   not only   here but                 at
                                                             more distant
 points.
    We have also        note that the Zoophytes differ decidedly
                       to                                                                     in
the two   reefs,  and therefore the circumstances which promoted
the growth       ofgenera and species          one case, were changed

gantic species of quadrumanous animals contemporaneously
with the Pachydermata of the Sub-Himálayas, and thus supplies
what has hitherto been a desideratum in palaeontology—proof
of the existence, in a fossil state, of the type of organization
most nearly resembling that of man.

having passed into a higher state of oxidation; whereas the
black-looking grains are met with in highly calcareous sand
stone, where the texture is too firm to admit of the percola
tion of water. From either kind of rock the green matter may
be obtained by washing with water and subsidence, since the
colouring matter subsides less readily than grains of quartz, and
more readily than calcareous and argillaceous substances. For
the purpose of analysis it is best procured from those calcareous
sandstones where the cement predominates, as in the neigh
bourhood of Hythe and Folkstone in Kent.            On reducing
such samples to powder, washing away the finer particles with
pure water, and separating any adhering carbonates by dilute
muriatic acid, the colouring matter is left, mixed only with
small grains of quartz.          It then always appears in the form
of  earthy   particles  of a  deep   green tint.
    The   green   matter,   when not previously weathered, is very
feebly attacked by concentrated acids, even by the nitro-mu
riatic.    It gives out water when heated, and becomes brown

quite free from phosphoric acid, and traces only were detected
 in  the other. The former was also free from lime, and the

 be   regarded        as
                    casual.

     Itis superfluous to speculate on the precise atomic con
stitution of the green particles, since they were not obtained
in a state of perfect purity. The ingredients which appear to
be essential, both from the quantity in which they occur, and
their constancy in the colouring matter of green-sand from
different localities, are silica, alumina, oxide of iron, magnesia,
and water.          I
                  should hence consider the green matter as a
hydrated silicate of alumina, magnesia, and black oxide of
iron, and as being, in        probability, the true green earth,

different compounds have been examined under the same
name,       that the specimens under examination were very im
           or

The first series is recurring; take 1, 2 as the first two terms
and 2, 3 as the constants of relation.
   First series 1, 2, 7, 20, 61, 182, &c.
   Second derived series 6, -18, 54, -162, &c.
The successive quotients of the first series converge to the
greatest root 3, and those of the second series are exactly the
product —3 of the two roots, and not the sum which would
be +2.
   (2.) A, B, C, D, E, &c. being as above the primitive recur
ring series, if another be formed such as A C-Bº, B D –C’,
&c., the successive quotients converge to the product of the
first two roots (p. 72.). This is correct, and may easily be
proved as in the preceding case.
   (3.) From the primitive series, Fourier adds, 3 other recur
ring series may be deduced by rules we have announced [in the
MS. of sixth book]. The first will give by            successive con                 its

 44           Formulae         for the Summation of Infinite Series.
    By comparing the several steps of this process with those
 in the working of the first example, we are led to conclude that
 the aggregate of two series, like this last and that of the first
 example, will always be accurately expressed in a finite frac
 tion, provided the factors in the denominator be even in num
 ber, and that the difference of the two series will also be a
 finite fraction, if the number of these factors he odd.  In all
 other cases the sum and difference will involve trº. Thus the
 difference between the two series

IX.     On the Right Rhombic Baryto-Calcite,     with reference
    to Prof. Johnston's Paper in the Phil. Mag. for May 1837.

    Professor of Chemistry, Glasgow.
 To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
TH IEreceived
      Number of the Philosophical Magazine for May, which
              yesterday, contains a paper by Mr. Johnston
of Durham, entitled “On the composition of the right rhom
bic Baryto-Calcite, the Bicalcareo-carbonate of Baryta of Dr.
Thomson.” This paper makes it necessary for me to send you
a few observations, and to request their insertion in the next
Number of the Philosophical Magazine.
  The mineral which constitutes the subject of Mr. Johnston's
paper came into my hands in the year 1834, being in a collec
tion exposed here for sale by a mineral dealer from Alston.
It was                             I therefore
                                                                  of it,

my experiments that was             it        a    compound

   The analysis of a double carbonate of lime and barytes is
very easy.      Mine was made during the winter session, in a
laboratory where a number of practical students were con
stantly engaged in experimenting.             It was possible therefore,
as I stated to Mr.      Johnston,    that some accident vitiating my
results might have taken place without my knowledge.                    de               I
           ...
termined in the first     place  the constituents of the    mineral,   and
then ascertained the quantity of carbonate of barytes from the
nitrate left when the dry salt was digested in alcohol.              Here
the  analysis    stopped.      For I was not able for more than a

accidentally by one of the students. But from the known weight
of the                         and the quantity of nitrate of barytes
obtained I inferred the       composition     of the mineral.

     have now finished three successive analyses of this mine
ral. For the greater security they were made in a separate
room which my practical students seldom entered, and I
watched over              all

quantity        of
               nitric acid employed                   to
                                            dissolve the mineral.

The flask was corked, the alcohol                   to the boiling

point, and then left to digest for some hours on the salt. It
was then drawn off by a sucker, an additional portion of the
same alcohol was poured on the undissolved salt, and the                        di
gestion continued as before.      A third portion of the same al
cohol was finally added and the whole was thrown upon a
filter to collect the undissolved nitrate of barytes. After being
dried in a heat of 300° this nitrate weighed 12.05 grains, equi
valent to 9:08 grains of carbonate of barytes.
    4. All the alcoholic liquids were collected together in a small
retort, and the alcohol distilled off till only a few drops of
liquid remained in the retort. It was taken out of the retort,
evaporated to dryness, and digested again in alcohol of 0-800.
The whole dissolved with the exception of a dirty yellowish
black powder, which was separated, and weighed after ignition
0.3 grain. When examined before the blowpipe it proved
to be oxide of manganese, not quite free from iron.
    5. The alcoholic solution was distilled as before.       It was
then   evaporated   to dryness, and the salt that remained heated
in a platinum crucible till the nitric acid was decomposed.
The residue was digested in weak nitric acid and the undis
solved portion collected on a filter, ignited, and weighed. It
amounted to 0-67 grain, and was red oxide of manganese, not
quite free from iron. This with the preceding 0-3 grain makes
0.97 red oxide of manganese, equivalent to 1:45 grain of car
bonate of manganese.
   In my first analysis I separated the manganese by caustic
ammonia, but       I
                  could not in this way free the nitrate of lime
from    all
          traces   of
                    manganese.         the second analysis

this method only succeeded imperfectly.         Even the process
employed       the third analysis did not render the lime quite
              in
colourless, though the manganese and iron remaining were
very small     quantity.

  Thus it appears that neither Mr. Johnston nor myself had
given a correct analysis of the mineral.   It is a triple instead
of a double salt. I failed in  discovering   the manganese, in
consequence of having neglected to examine the calcareous
residue: Mr. Johnston failed in consequence of dissolving the
mineral in muriatic instead of nitric acid. This last acid
should always be used in examining the earthy carbonates,
because it enables us to see by the colour when any iron or
manganese is present.

   The extent of these alliances does not yet rest upon any fixed
principle.     Linnaeus and Adanson throw plants into fifty-eight
assemblages, and we must consider a botanical family of that
day as representing the alliance of our own time.        Bartling
makes    sixty  classes or alliances.  The annexed table makes
sixty alliances also, averaging each about five families. Those
of Dr. Lindley are more numerous, averaging rather less than
three families; he seems to have looked for consolidation in
his groups, and precision in the alliances. The alliances of
the table sometimes correspond with Dr. Lindley's groups, as
in Curvembryosae, Aggregosae, Glumosae, Spadicosae, but they
more generally correspond with his alliances; the smaller al
liances of Dr. Lindley must however continue under any
scientific classification as suballiances.
   In the revised table, the improved nomenclature of Dr.
Lindley is of course usually adopted; his work on the Natu
ral System must henceforth be a standard of reference every
where;    and there is much convenience in the definite manner
by which such reference points out the tribes and genera                                     in
tended to be included.            His happy manner of designating
the Ali. ANCEs      by   a termination in ales is also adopted.         In
amending the nomenclature, it were to be further wished that
botanists would regularly designate              the families from ge
                                                      all

50         Sir Edward Ffrench Bromhead's Remarks on
º:
and also the tendency to cut off families at the limits of an
alliance for the sake of rounding the character. After the first
             the investigation of characters will, of course, be
  ound   useful;  it will settle the limits of an alliance, where a
family has stood ambiguously between two; it will negatively
settle the place of many doubtful families; it will shake hete
rogeneous alliances, and confirm such as are sound.
    The characters must be formed on the whole structure ; it
may in a few instances be possible to point out an assemblage
of families by some happy peculiarity, but such is not the plan
of nature, in which even species require an enumeration of
 many parts. The utmost extent of simplification will be a
 statement of the NortMAL structure (the Nixus of Dr. Lind
 ley), followed by remarks on the limits of deviation and equi
 valent changes.      The error in this case has arisen from the
 received notion, that every species passes imperceptibly into
 some other; such, however, may not be the case,          a change of
 one   particular part  generally  implies, in natural  history, some
 corresponding change of every other part, so that families
 may differ more abruptly than genera, and alliances more ab
 ruptly than families. In some families the differences of ad
joining species are much greater than in others.
    A collection of characters is necessary also for ascertaining
 the nature of the properties which usually extend over a suc
 cession of families; the properties which most conveniently
 distinguish genera are often of little value to distinguish fami
 lies, and those which separate adjoining families will probably
 have little further range.      In this research it is mortifying to
 find a property running through the greater part of an alli
 ance, and often passed by in the remainder as being unimpor
 tant within the usual limits of classification.      The characters
 may too frequently amount to nothing, or indicate merely that
 there is not a deviation from general normal structure; but
 such were some of the characters of Jussieu.              They may
 often be   negative, but such are more definite than any other,
 and may hereafter be pushed to any extent, so as to form dif
 ferential characters between any two alliances whatsoever.
    Results apparently trivial should be admitted, where they
 offer themselves, as it is impossible to foresee what may serve
 to illustrate the general progress of structure. Where a pro
 perty occurs through an alliance, with comparatively trifling
 exception, it should be given, and the exception stated; the
 place of the excepted family may be shaken, or some remark
 able equivalence of structure may be discovered.
     Bartling very properly gives the lead to the structure of
 the stem, foliation, and inflorescence, as Linnaeus does in the

                 the present state     of    Botanical Classi<U+017F><U+017F>cation.             51
elegant sketches of his Botanical Philosophy.       Those pro
perties are not often used in distinguishing genera, and are
comparatively neglected by many late writers; they will pro
bably hereafter rise to importance, and it may be found useful
to refer to the older writers, who laid so much stress on folia
tion.
   In giving the characters it is necessary to use a modified
language of a greater breadth of expression than usual.                                 -
   I have collected some materials for ascertaining the founders
of the different alliances in the table; and the first publisher
must be so considered, even were it thought to be the result
of an indistinct happy accident. Few writers can take the
range of a whole science and instinctively select from the mass
whatever is well founded.      Writers may see the truth placed
before  them,  but seeing it mixed up with objectionable matter,
they may throw it aside, and after long inquiry and many
qualifications, may find on reference the final result of their
labours to be the same. Science herein differs from literature,
that the truth must bring two writers to the same point; but
it is also true that we may                 let
                                   the result     our reading digest

       akind          of
                  compulsion, after long research the views                        of
others are   adopted.    The annexed table has thus been most
materially improved, and was          some parts new cast, from the

            DEAR SIR,

         wet-bulb thermometer, preferable to other hygrome
     ters from the permanence, directness, and simplicity of
    its
   action, has the inconvenience                         of

only subject     necessary calculations, but also, hitherto,

considerable discrepancy       the principlesin     which these              on
computations are made; and        corresponding differences
                                                   to                                    in

  In Dr. Apjohn's I omit the barometrical column, which
Dr. Mason finds to be needless (p. 101), and that of the cal
culated dew-points, in which the error is generally on one
side, occasioned, as the author supposes, by an error in one of
the elements; and I substitute, for the sake of comparison with
Mason's, a column (5) of differences between the dew-point
and dry bulb thermometer; having for the same purpose
changed the order of arrangement to that of these differences.
   In Mason's table such numbers only are taken as come into
comparison with Apjohn's; and to facilitate this comparison,
three columns                     (6,
                          interpolated, illustrating his method

  56          Mr.   Prideaux on the Detection  of minute
  tion (col. 7), which was found by experiment, we deduct it
  from the double difference (col. 8), we get (the numbers in
  col. 6, corresponding with) the differences between Apjohn's
  dry-bulb and dew-point (col. 5); and so close is this corre
  spondence when the slight differences in the leading numbers
 (cols, 3 and 9) are taken into the accompt, that we can hardly
  persuade ourselves that it is accidental.
      Hence Apjohn's experiments fix the dew-point at double
  the descent of the wet-bulb –the effect of current; and an
  upward current, in some proportion to the rate of evaporation,
  must obtain over an evaporating surface. But Mason's num
 ber to be deducted, which takes the effect of current in +, is
  both deduced from and supported by direct experiments.
     It further follows from the premises, and is apparent in the
  table (cols. 5, 6, 8, 10), that the mean of their respective dif
  ferences between the dry-bulb and dew-point is simply double
  the difference between the dry and wet-bulb ; a relation pre
 viously deduced from numerous experiments by August,
  Bohnenberger, and others. Berzelius in giving us this informa
 tion (Tr. de Chim., viii., art. HYGRoNIETRE) has not referred
 to the works in which these experiments are detailed: if you
 have the means of hunting them out, and giving such abstracts
 as will enable British meteorologists to judge of the compara
 tive degree of confidence to which they are entitled, it may
 render an important service to meteorology. The best in
 struments are subject to the influence of various circumstances
 in taking the dew-point; and the experiments of Apjohn, in
 which most of these interferences are obviated, are objected
 to by Dr. Hudson, in a paper immediately accompanying
 their publication.
     In the  mean    while it must be remembered that Dr. Ap
john's dew-point is that at which the air, by passing through
 water, took up moisture, and should be under rather than over
 saturated, so that it would, of course, not deposit any at that
 temperature.      Dr. Mason's, on the other hand, was that at
 which a metallic surface became dewed; the air depositing
 moisture, and being of course supersaturated.            Between
 these two a few degrees of temperature would intervene; the
 mean of which, the true point of saturation, would be the
same as above deduced from the tables. It therefore becomes
a question whether this simple deduction may not bring us
 nearer the truth, on the long run, in the present state of our
knowledge on the subject, than more elaborate calculations or
even observations with our best instruments, considering the
temporary character of such observations, and the influence
of circumstances to which they are liable.
     I have been led into these inquiries, in considering the pre

     Quantities of foreign Matters diffused in the Atmosphere.               57
sent difficulty of ascertaining chemically the causes of differ
ences in the atmosphere, produced by the diffusion through it
of infectious and other matters in very minute proportions.
It would seem that the aqueous vapour likewise diffused
brings down with it when condensed, such miasmata, &c.,
as were either merely suspended, or, being dissolved, have
much affinity for water.        In fact we find the glass of win
dows and other non-absorbent surfaces here incrusted with
salt, for three or four miles inland, after long southerly and
westerly winds; our stream of water from Dartmoor                            al
ways acquires a slight saline impregnation before it reaches
the town; and in malaria and other unwholesome climates
the stranger is particularly cautioned to avoid the evening
dews. This natural dew, if collected in sufficient quantity,
would probably be most fully impregnated; but when this
cannot be done, a common glass carboy, filled with a cheap
refrigerating mixture and suspended over a funnel in a gentle
current of air on a dewy evening, will collect a sufficient quan
tity for experiment.      Rain is too dilute, and the clouds from
which it falls too    migratory    to answer the purpose.          For
matters little attracted by water, reagents of more energetic
affinities may be suspended in shallow vessels, kept cold, when
requisite, by refrigerating mixtures beneath.           But when the
air is very dry, when it is necessary to concentrate upon a
very small quantity of reagent the foreign matter in a large
quantity of air, or to know the quantity of air submitted to                 its
action, the test may    be contained      in tube like that

   9. My method of observing was to keep the chronometer
at the ear till the instant that the termination of a vibration
was observed, then to count five beats of the balance (corre
sponding to two seconds), which affords time to bring the
dial-plate into view, and the seconds entered in the Table are
those read off at that time, namely two seconds later than the
absolute times.    Thus the impracticable attempt to observe
two  things  at once by the eye is avoided.     For this and some
other suggestions,                   I
                       am indebted to my friend Captain P. P.
King, R.N. The observations are registered in lithographed

                                     have been extremely parti
cular, often at great personal inconvenience”.       Places remote
from any trace of habitation have most usually been selected,
and in no case have intensity observations been made in a
house.    The specialties of the sites will be noticed in the fol
lowing Tables.                   I
                     have invariably removed        masses     iron               all                   of

some distance from the apparatus.        But some direct experi

   There is another chronometric correction worth mentioning,
arising from the necessarily imperfect division of the seconds'
circle of an enamelled dial-plate.   In my watch this amounts
to a sensible quantity, and has often given an apparent discre
pancy/to the partial results of a series for which I was not
prepared. Upon investigation, I find, however, that the effect
upon the mean will always be so insignificant as to be hardly
worth notice.

   sity would appear too great (the magnetic energy in iron being
   increased by cold and diminished by heat).                                 I therefore en
   deavoured to            compare         the   intensity    of the needles employed
   within the         range     of   temperatures         usually    observed. The ap
   paratus employed was of this kind.                         The needle was first al
   lowed to take the             temperature          of a heated room and vibrated.
   Then everything else remaining the same (and of course any
   local attraction which might exist being unaltered) the appa
  ratus was placed in a cylindrical glass jar, with ice in the bot
   tom, placed in a dish of ice, and covered with a glass plate
  also covered with ice. A steady temperature, but little above
  the freezing point, was thus attained, and the oscillation again
  observed.            These experiments were repeated many times.
  One series was undertaken at Geneva in October 1832, an
  other at Edinburgh on four different days of August 1834.
   Those for the needle, No. 1, were conducted with the most
  scrupulous care, nearly 5000 vibrations having been counted
  for this purpose alone. One set was discarded as differing
  too much from the others, and the remainder agreed very
  closely, although made under such different circumstances,
  and at such different times.                      The result adopted for needle
  No. 1      gave      an increase in time of -00045 for a diminution of
  temperature of 1° Reaumur, and vice versd; for the flat needle
   (determined from two concordant series, both observed at
   Geneva on different days,) 00030.                           From these results the
  following tables were calculated, giving the reduction in each
   case to 0° of Reaumur (which being the scale attached to the
   instrument, was always observed in these experiments).                                    This
   seems preferable to referring to any other arbitrary tempera
   ture, upon which observers do not generally agree.

the condition of magnetism in the needle is not necessarily that

I am desirous of adding a few references                                    and observations
which have since occurred to me.
     With respect to the changes which have taken place in the
course of the Euphrates, the authority of the Nubian geographer,
Ebn Idrisi, is important. This writer, after showing that one
branch of the Euphrates joined the Tigris, by which vessels
were brought down from Samosata to Bagdad, says that the
other branch, skirting the desert, divided itself into several
arms, of which one passed Tsarsar, another Alcatur, a third
Sura, and a fourth Kufa, and that all             terminated in  these arms
the lakes”, which lakes, as described in my former papers, will
have been formed, to the destruction of the course of the river,
by the same process of change which has also subsequently
annihilated them.
                              I
   This change, as have before stated, consists as well in an
alteration of the courses of the rivers as in an advance of the
land at the head of the gulf. And as upon this latter point
Mr. Carter regards the express statement of Pliny as a mere
“notion,” adding that “certainly serious doubts may well
arise of the authenticity of the passage” in which it occurst,                                             I
am glad to be able to refer to so valuable an authority as that
of the Rev. G. C. Renouard, who, far from doubting the au
thenticity of the passage or regarding the fact recorded in it
as a notion of the writer, says: “Nor can any doubt be en
tertained as to the continual augmentation and change of this
coast, when we learn from Pliny (vi. 31) that Charax, at first
a maritime town, only 10 stadia (13 mile) from the sea, was
distant 50 miles from it according to Juba, and as much as
 120 miles in his own time, (in the first century of our era,)
as he had heard from persons well-acquainted with the place.”

68     Mr. Binks        on the Laws      of Action of Voltaic Electricity,
  On the subject of the distinction between the Babel of the
book of Genesis and the Babylon of Nebuchadnezzar, I have,
in conclusion, to adduce the authority of Diodorus Siculus,
who informs us that, at the time of the conquest of Babylonia
by the Assyrians under Ninus, Babylon itself was not in exist
ence, although   the country contained several other cities of
importance”.          statement is entirely corroborative of the
                        This
conclusion drawn from the various other authorities already
cited by me, namely, that the Babylon which was known to
the prophets, and which existed in the times of the writers of
profane history, was a totally distinct city from, and one of a far
more recent date than the Babel which was erected in the
plain of Shinar previously to the dispersion of mankind.

       DEAR SIR,
       your letter addressed to Dr. Faraday<U+017F>, describing your
IN constant voltaic battery,  you speak of seeking to reduce
the zinc to a minimum comparatively  with the surface of copper
employed in the same mass of electrolyte; but it does not seem
to have been your intention to determine precisely what was
the proper relative proportion of the two metals.        Subse
quently to this remark in your letter, Mr. Mullins § has ex
pressed his belief that the surface of zinc ordinarily brought
into action in such combinations is much greater than is
needed: but neither has he stated the precise results of ex
periment upon this point.
   In the same communication, and in allusion to his new bat
tery, Mr. Mullins speaks of his having discovered the exist
ence of a new principle of action in voltaic combinations. He
remarks, “In this battery the power is immense in proportion

utmost care can scarcely provide, it is but to be expected, so
long as the same materials are used, that the greatest contra
riety of opinion will exist on points apparently so easy to de

origin in the irregularity of the mutual action of the acid and
zinc will be submitted to you towards the end of my letter.
    In order to avoid a too frequent recurrence to description
in the course of this paper, I will, at this point, state generally
some of the precautions (beyond the common and more obvious
ones) that were taken to ensure accuracy in the results of the
experiments.
    The magnetic needle was never resorted to as a measurer of
 the amount of action or of the quantity of electricity developed;
 but this was estimated by what appears to me to be the more
 certain, though infinitely more laborious method, of finding,
 by the balance, the equivalent of zinc expended, or by actually
 measuring the volume of the evolved hydrogen. In no instance.
 was the one calculated merely from the volume or weight of
 the other.     In general both the balance and the meter were
 employed, whatever the number of the series in any experi
 ment to be examined, and the number amounted in some cases
 to as many as fifty.     I had anticipated that some curious re
 sults would appear from this mode of testing the phaenomena,
 and have not been altogether disappointed. Again, when plates
 of amalgamated zinc were used in comparative experiments,
 in which equal ones, or differing by a certain ratio, were wanted,
 these comparative values were not estimated by the mere
  measure of their surfaces, but, by actually finding the amount
  of action upon them in a given time, by previous immersion
  in acid of a kind similar to that intended to be used ; for an
  equality in the extent of surface does not ensure an equality
  of voltaic action, nor does that action increase in the same ratio
  as the surface may be increased, as has hitherto been believed.
  Again, the zinc employed throughout these experiments was
  always of the same quality, indeed was cut from the same sheet,
  and itsequivalent determined, with hydrogen as unity, and found
  to be 34°5. And in order, as far as possible, to reduce the num
  ber of the conditions involved in these experiments and requi
  ring to be attended to and estimated, one of such was entirely
  avoided, viz. that of variation in the distance between the two
  elementary plates.      Whether used in independent or compa
  rative  experiments   the mass of fluid interposed between the
  zinc and   copper  plates was invariably equal to one inch. The
  acid employed was the diluted sulphuric, and in those propor
  tions which have become standard ones, through their having
  been used as such by yourself and Dr. Faraday.          It is,per
   haps, almost needless  to  remark that   in any case where local

action was discovered to have taken place it was either pro
perly allowed for, the defective plate dismissed, or the experi
ment wholly repeated, and that where comparative estimates
were made of the evolved gas or gasses, the proper corrections
were made for temperature and pressure.

74      Mr.   Binks on the Laws                 of Action of Voltaic Electricity,
By which it     is made apparent that (compared with equal
plates) the effectiveness of any simple voltaic circle is increased
about 4% times, by having the surface of copper 16 times
greater than the zinc.
    But these results may not follow from the operation of an
invariable law, but of one peculiar to the prevailing condi
tions of the arrangements herein employed; as the activity of
its  action may evolve            much hydrogen
                                          as               needs      large

surface      permit
             to            formation with the greatest facility.

let the activity        of

                                                       lessened, and will                                 it

greatest effect?      Now this rapidity           action may   of   lessened               be
 by either removing the elementary plates further apart,                                             or   by
more largely diluting the exciting acid. And                 determine the      to
influence     ofsuch changes, first, the plates were separated from
the distance       of

                                various    surfaces,   repeated, when,                                    al
 though less zinc was expended                  the  aggregate

                                                          in
when the copper was                   16
                                times larger than the zinc.
    The plates being restored                       to
                                         their usual distances from one

 times greater than the zinc.

Demonstrating that the laws just proved to operate in the
case of single arrangements, operate also in that of compound
ones. But the advantages gained in B and C are greater even
than had been anticipated by those laws, a circumstance which
is explained in a subsequent investigation (No. 3.), when it will
be proved that the above results are in exact accordance with
those found to obtain in the case of the single arrangements
already treated of.
     There is one fact brought out by the above experiments to
which I should wish to attract your attention, merely pre
mising, that inasmuch as the coincidence between it and some
other facts, which I suspect may be detected, may or may not
be purely of an accidental character, I should wish to be un
derstood as attaching no importance to it beyond that which
would make me bear it in mind till our further acquaintance
with the origin and operations of this still mysterious agent
may contribute to             its
                            proper explanation.         The fact allude           I

     It will
          be observed here that in the 4th and 5th instances,
in which there was a great disparity between the sizes of the
two arrangements, the results of their combined action were
not divided equally between the two, but appeared greater
in that vessel in which the greater zinc plate was acting. But
when we come to those experiments in which the arrange
ments are fitted to copper plates in the relative proportion of
 16 to 1 of zinc, it will be seen that the results are different;
that then in every instance the action is equally distributed
through any combined series.

     now tried a combination of three arrangements, in which

  controverted points in the laws of this science; and one of
  such to which I shall attempt to apply it will be to determine
  the real relation that subsists between the deflexions of the
  magnetic needle and the quantity of zinc expended in pro
  ducing those deflexions, or, which is the same thing, between
  the deflexions and the quantity of electricity which produces
  them.
                       Fourth Investigation.
        Up to this          inquiry I have restricted myself to
                        step in the
 the use of diluted  sulphuric acid as the exciting agent. The
 foregoing facts, or, it may be, laws of action, have therefore
 been determined for this one condition only out of the many
  under which the electrical action may be developed. The
  phaenomena attendant upon this mode of excitation are, pri
                                                                                                    as its

     My own experiments have been extended to the examina
 ion of only two of such cases; namely, first to that in which
sulphuric acid is the exciting agent, and gaseous hydrogen the
product upon the surface of the conducting metal; and se
condly, to that in which sulphuric acid (derived either from
the dissolved sulphate, or from free acid previously added) is
still the exciting agent, but in which metallic copper is the
product appearing at the conducting plate; these two having
been selected, from the highly distinctive character of their re
spective phaenomena.
   Recurring to the former of these investigations,          should                   I
wish, before concluding this paper, to attract your attention
to a fact which has been invariably presented in their course,

when the arrangement of any voltaic battery has been such
that the whole
           quantity
                       evolved hydrogen could be collected, and
                                                              its                         be

  A   small battery            of    16
                            equal pairs, arranged      the couronne      as

weighed at the end of a certain time. Each vessel was found
to contain as nearly as possible the same measure of hydro
gen; and a like equality of action upon the zinc had taken
place throughout       series.
   The total quantity of hydrogen was 60.6 cubic inches; the
total quantity of zinc expended was 74.0 grains.
   Now,    Ihad previously determined that 34.5 grains of the
       I
zinc employed were needed to produce an equivalent of hydro
gen; and taking the weight of 100 cubic inches to be 2:1318
grains, we have the measure of an equivalent of hydrogen
equal to 46.9 cubic inches. Therefore, the 74.0 grains of
zinc here consumed should have yielded 100.5 cubic inches of
the gas, but they actually yielded only 60.6 cubic inches.
   Whether or not a voltameter were interposed the results
were similar: invariably the same want of correspondence ap
peared between the loss of the zinc and the volume of evolved
gas and their relative quantities as found by theory; and the
amount of this difference was always somewhat similar to that
exhibited in the above experiment.
   The operations within the cells of the battery admit of easy
analysis, and this phaenomenon also admits perhaps of an easy
explanation; but the fact it seems to indicate, viz. that a certain
portion (and that about one third of the whole) of the hydro
gen subserves some purpose closely connected with the power
of the battery to decompose water, appears to be of so much
importance as to make it deserving of a more careful exami
nation.                 I

disturbances and divisions of the electric current produced by the
 battery, arising from secondary combinations; the results of which
 observations form the subject of the present paper.        He found that
 the resistance to the passage of the current was diminished by dis
 solving the sulphate of copper which was in contact with the copper
in the standard sulphuric acid, instead of water. The increased
 effect of the current, as measured by the voltameter, was farther
augmented by the heat evolved during the mixture; and wishing
 to study the influence of temperature in modifying these effects,
the author placed the cells of the battery in a tub, filled with hot
water.     On charging the cells with a solution of muriate of am
monia in the interior, and aqueous solution of sulphate of copper in
the exterior compartment, he observed that a portion of the current
is discharged by the water in which the apparatus is immersed;

   May 4th.-On the adaptation of different modes of illuminating
Light-houses, as depending on their situations and the object con
templated in their erection.    By William Henry Barlow, Esq., in
a Letter addressed to Peter     Barlow,  Esq., F.R.S., and communi
cated by  him.
   The letter of Mr. W. H. Barlow, addressed to his father, in which
the paper is contained, is dated Constantinople, March 14th, 1837,
and states that the experiments which he made with the Drummond
light, and other means of illuminating Light-houses, and of which
he now communicates the results, were undertaken at the request
of the Turkish Government, with the view of placing lights at the
entrance of the Bosphorus from the Black Sea”. The object of his
inquiry is to investigate the principles on which the illuminating
power, resulting from the employment of reflectors, and of lenses,
depends; and the most advantageous application of that power to
the purposes of Light-houses.
    In discussing the relation which exists between the illuminating
power and the intensity of an artificial light, he observes that the
former is proportional to the quantity of light projected on a given
surface at a given distance; and that the latter is dependent on
the quantity of light projected by a given area of the luminous
body on a given surface at a given distance.          Hence the intensity
of a light multiplied into     surface   its
                                           the measure is  the illuminating  of
power, whether the light proceed from one                         or
                                                    from several luminous
bodies: and the illuminating power            equal                sphere                                 of

light, whose intensity and apparent surface are equal            that     the                        of

produces the strongest impression            the eye,   on  intensity; but
                                                                        is   its

                                                                       in

                the impression made            the retina   onproportional        is
only   to the illuminating power.       The mathematical investigations
of the author lead him                       to
                                 the conclusion that all reflectors and
lenses     of
           the same diameter have the same illuminating power when
illuminated          by
                   the same lamp; and that                        by
                                                     diminishing the focal
distance, and intercepting more rays, the illuminating power             not                         is
increased, but simply the divergence, and consequently the surface
or  space over which       acts. The author then proceeds

the inference that the advantage gained by the employment of the
former does not arise from their superior perfection as optical in
struments, but from their using the light more economically, in con
sequence         of their producing less divergence of the rays, both hori
zontally and vertically, and illuminating a much smaller space in
the horizon.    Rules are then deduced for the application of lenses
and reflectors in Light-houses, according to the particular situations
in which they are placed, and the purposes they are intended to
serve.   With this view, the author divides Light-houses into three
classes: the first comprising Beacon or Warning Lights, placed in
order to prevent the approach of vessels, and which consequently
can never be nearer than three or four miles; the second being
Guiding or Leading Lights, placed to guide a vessel, and therefore
admitting of a very near approach ; and the third including those
which, according to the respective directions in which they are seen,
have both these duties to fulfil. In the first we require great                                               il
luminating power, and a long duration of the brightest period, with
a small angle of vertical divergence; in the second, less illumina
ting power, but a larger angle of vertical divergence are requisite,
while the duration of the extreme brightness is of minor importance;
and in the third,              all
                       these properties, namely, great illuminating
power, long duration
           a                the brightest period, and
                                            of         large angle                        a                   of
vertical divergence, are necessary.

mena of periodical colours there are three peculiarities demanding
notice; first, that the dark lines change their places by varying the
inclination of the plate ; secondly, that two or more lines never co
alesce   into one ; and thirdly, that the colour of the luminous bands
in   the complementary spectrum are the same as those of the original
spectrum when the thin plate is perfectly colourless. The author                                        in
stitutes a comparison of these phaenomena with those of absorption
as exhibited by a solid, a fluid, and a gaseous body; employing as an
example of the first, smalt blue glass ; of the second, the green sap
of vegetables; and of the third, nitrous acid gas. No connecting
link between these phaenomena appeared to exist, excepting that
both exhibited a divided or mutilated spectrum ; but even this com
mon fact has not the same character in both. The nacreous substance
described by Mr. Horner, however, in some cases, when the plates
were small, was found to produce bands perfectly identical with those
of thin plates; while in other cases the bands were exactly similar to
those of coloured media.       By employing the iridescent films of de
composed glass, the author obtained combinations of films which gave,
by transmitted light, the most rich and splendid colours, surpassing
every thing he had previously seen among the colours either of na
ture or of art. These facts have proved that the transmitted colours,
though wholly unlike those of thin plates, are yet produced by the
same causes, and are residuary, and generally complementary to the
sum of the reflected tints.      Thus the author has succeeded in com
pletely identifying in their primary features the two classes of facts;
the one resulting from absorption, the other from periodic action.
The minor points of difference, namely, the uniformity of the bands
 and tints of absorbing media at         incidences, and the non-appear

and the purpose which they answer in the animal economy. He had
discovered in the lenses of many fishes the alternation of portions,
exerting, the one a positive, and the other a negative refractive
action ; but in his subsequent investigations he met with the greatest
discrepancy as to the regularity of their arrangement.         He found
that in quadrupeds the central structure is positive ; while in fishes,
where there are three structures, it is always negative ; but their po
sitive structure in the former case sometimes exists alone, with faint
traces of a negative structure, and sometimes it is followed by
another positive structure separated from the first by a black neutral
circle, in which the double refraction disappears ; at other times va
rious other combinations of these structures are presented.       Occa
sionally, in the dark neutral line which separated two positive struc
tures, he perceived a trace of an intervening structure, which seemed
 to be either about to disappear or about to be developed. This con
jecture was satisfactorily verified by a series of observations which he
 made on the lenses of the sheep, the ox, and the horse, at different
 ages, and also on the same lens, during the spontaneous changes
 it undergoes when kept in distilled water. The negative structure
 was in these experiments gradually developed at the space inter
 vening between the portions of the lens which had possessed the
 positive structure; and thus the same parts assumed in succession
 doubly refractive actions of opposite kinds. The author intimates
 his intention of pointing out, in a separate paper, the conclusions
 deducible from these facts respecting the cause and cure of cataract.

   January 4.—A paper entitled, “Some Observations on the Elevation
of the Strata on the Coast of Chili,” by Alexander Caldcleugh, Esq.,
F.G.S., &c., was first read.
   The author commences by stating, that previously to his return to
South America several circumstances induced him to suspend
his opinion as to the correctness of the details which had been
published of the effects of the earthquake of 1822. He thought that
the wreck in the Bay of Valparaiso, which had become accessible after
the earthquake, might have been thrown higher up by the heavy rollers,
and that rocks covered with testacea, which after the event were laid
dry, might likewise have been drifted. He also thought that the ac
curacy of the observations might be doubted, because certain genera
of shells were stated to have been found adhering to the rocks in
Valparaiso Bay, which it was well known did not exist there ; and
because there was a vagueness in some of the statements,           as the
raising of the whole country from the foot of the Andes to far out at
sea. Since        his
                  return      South America, however, especially since
                                   to
the earthquake       1835, Mr. Caldcleugh has investigated the evi

  The subject of recent elevations on the coast of Chili being, in the
opinion of many, still open to discussion, Mr. Darwin gives, in this
memoir, the results of his own observations. The portion of the coast,
more particularly examined by the author, extends from the river
Rapel, about sixty miles south of Valparaiso, to Conchali, about
eighty miles north of
   Close    the mouth
               to                       of it.

rocks three     four feet above the highest tidal level; and
                         or                                       the                                                in
neighbouring country recent marine shells are scattered abundantly
to the height             of
                 about 100 feet. Ten miles      the north, and                    to                                  at    an

of rock about fourteen feet above high water, and removing the dung
of sea fowls, discovered Balani adhering to the stone.
   With respect to the historical evidence of the earthquake of 1822,
Mr. Darwin     says that he met with no intelligent person who doubted
the rise of the land, or with any of the lower order who doubted that
the sea had fallen.         He mentions also the altered position of the
wreck and of the rock in the bay; and from a part of the fort being
invisible from a point on the land before the earthquake, but visible after
wards, he infers that the movement of the land was unequal”.                        A
further proof of change, obtained for the author by Mr. Alison, is
shown by the remains of a sea-wall built in 1680, and over which,
up to 1817, the sea broke during the northerly gales. Mr. John
Martin, a ship carpenter of Valparaíso, remembers walking in 1819
on the beach at the foot of this wall, and he has been frequently
obliged to climb up to the street to avoid the sea. This wall is now
separated from the bay by two rows of houses, but a portion of what
                                                                             by

may be owing to the action of a river, Mr. Morris says it may be difficult
to determine, as the recent species of the above genera have variable
habits. The principal localities at which the Woolwich beds have
been noticed are, Sundridge park near Bromley, Chiselhurst, Orping

Plumstead; the ninth milestone beyond Shooter's Hill, Erith ballast

   With respect to the geological position of the Woolwich beds,
Mr. Morris is of opinion that they ought to be assigned to the lower
part of the London clay, as they occupy the same position, with re
ference to the chalk, as the Bognor strata.
   3. The Bognor or lower arenaceous beds of the London clay are
then described, and the following list given of the localities at which
they have been noticed: Pegwell Bay (Isle of Thanet): Herne Bay",

ral character is remarkably persistent, consisting of grayish green sands
with layers of pebbles, but sometimes passing into sandstone and
limestone. The fossils, which in some localities are numerous, agree
specifically with the well-known Bognor shells; those imbedded in the
sands being in good preservation but those in the rock chalky and
friable.    From the position occupied by these beds Mr. Morris is                                               in
duced to consider them as the equivalents of the lower beds of Wool
wich, Upnor, &c., and in support of this opinion alludes to the strata
of calcaire grossier which rest immediately upon chalk at Meudon.

identified these with the remains of the Phytosaurus, which in 1835
he saw in the Museum at Wirtemberg; and, as this genus has hitherto
been found in no other formation than the Keuper, it leaves little
doubt as to the identity of the Warwick sandstone with the Keuper
sandstone of Germany.           Fragments of vegetables also are dispersed
through the Warwick sandstone, in the same state of imperfect pre
servation as the greater part of those in the Keuper of Stuttgard.
     In October 1836, further remains, apparently of Phytosaurus, were
found at Warwick by Dr. Lloyd of Leamington, who is engaged in
 tracing the extent of the Keuper throughout this district.
     Dr. Buckland has also recognised the Keuper-sandstone in the
quarries of Sutton Mallet near Bridgewater; and of Rumwell Heale
and Oake near Taunton ; the latter have supplied the freestone used
in the towers and bridges at the town of Taunton.
     In the cliffs at Oreham, two miles E. of Exmouth, there are beds
of sandstone, probably referrible to the Keuperformation, which have
supplied the olive-coloured sandstone of which the cathedral of Exeter
 is built; and at Pyle, in Glamorganshire, a few miles E. of Neath, a
 valuable building-stone lately employed in constructing the castle of
 Margum, is obtained from strata, which the author also refers to the
 Keuper-sandstone of Germany.
      Mr. Murchison has noticed Keuper-sandstone in several localities
 in Gloucestershire and Worcestershire, near Tewkesbury and Ne
 went.
     A paper “On the Geological Structure and Phaenomena of the north
 ern part of the Cotentin, and particularly of the immediate vicinity
  of Cherbourg,” by the Rev. W. B. Clarke, F.G.S., was then read.
      In an account of the Cotentin published in the 35th volume of
  the Journal des Mines, M. Alexander Brongniart gives a full account
  of the limestone, slates, quartz rock and syenite or granite com
  posing the country; but the chief object of that memoir is to prove
  the comparatively recent origin of the granitic rocks.
      Mr. Clarke, in detailing the characters of the formations follows
  closely the account of M. Brongniart, and adopts fully the views of
  that geologist respecting the age of the granite.            He also quotes
   Prof. Sedgwick's   observations on the     comparatively recent origin of the
   granite of Cornwall, and the adjacent portion of Devonshire; and
   points out the general agreement in structure of that district with
   the Cotentin.      The characters of the formations are further noticed
   in the abstract of the paper given in No. 48 of the Proceedings.

       This district, so highly interesting on account of the phaenomena
   which accompanied the earthquake that devastated it in 1819°, is
   situated near the eastern branch of the Indus, between 22 and 24

    The tertiary deposit consists of a hard, argillaceous grit covered by
 a conglomerate.     The organic remains, which are very numerous, are
 often disposed in beds confined to one species; the prevaling genera
 being Arca, Pecten, Ostrea, Cardium, Conus, Cypraea, Ovula, Fusus,
 Trochus, Solarium, Strombus, and Cassis. Patches of Corals, two or
 three acres in extent, sometimes also occur.

 of changes,   produced along the southern coast by the deposition of
sediment.     At Mandavee is a ruin, at a spot called the old Bun

the town is a small temple, built upon a rocky foundation, but said to
 have stood in the sea when the old Bunder was the landing place.
At other localities in the Gulf of Cutch, similar processes are going
on, rendering it necessary to remove the landing-places frequently
further seaward.       The rapid progress of these accumulations is
ascribed to the sea, during nine months washing back the sandy
detritus, brought down by the periodical floods.         The same ope
ration is also in progress at places separated from the main waters
of the gulf by small creeks or inlets, some of which penetrate six
or seven miles from the coast, through a tract covered with shrubs.
At low-water the whole of these plants are exposed down to their
roots, but at high-tide merely their tops are visible, so that boats
sail through a conpletely marine forest. The growth of these shrubs
is rapid, and the sailors have constantly to force the boats through
the upper branches, particularly at the angles of the creeks, when
they wish to save a tack. The stems and lower branches are
covered with testacea, whilst the upper are occupied by numerons
water-fowl.     The land gains in this dictrict, by the deposition of
the muddy contents of the small streams during the monsoon, when
the water passing very slowly between the stems of the shrubs, a great
portion of the matter held in suspension, is precipitated. This alluvial
district occurs only on the southern coast of the Province.    In August,
 1834, the rains were very violent and continuous, and the river which
flows past Nurra, on the borders of the Grand Runn, covered with a
fine soil a surface of nearly 1000 acres.   On the opposite or southern
side of Cutch, not far from Mandavee, 300 acres were washed away;
and not    far
             from the same spot, half small village was removed bodily
                                               a

     Wolcanic Rocks.—Besides       the southern range     hills already stated

                        which   forming   small conical hills, are arranged
around    a  central area.    The author noticed no recent crater, unless
the hill, called Denudar,            be
                                   considered     such, and down the flanks
                                                       as
of which he traced          lava stream. The volcanic rocks consist of
                             of a
several varieties           basalt, often columnar, amygdaloid, green
stone, and trachyte. Capt. Grant described these rocks                in  great
detail,   as well  asthe effects  evidently produced        by
                                                          them,   enumerating

be traced, in the clearest manner, to the protrusion of trap. In some
cases the volcanic mounds are themselves cracked or fissured from top
to bottom.
   That the igneous eruptions occurred at many distinct periods,
Capt. Grant showed by sections, in which beds of trap alternate with
others of crystalline limestone, calcareous tuff, and a calcareous grit,
which sometimes contains angular fragments of basalt; and by beds of
very different characters reposing on each other.
   Among the phaenomena connected apparently with volcanic action,
the author described a number of mounds, varying in diameter from
3 to 20 yards, and covered with small tabular plates of sandstone, the
lines of fracture radiating, though irregularly, from a centre. In some
instances the summits of these little mounds having been removed,
a regular circle of stones appeared, inclosing an area of sandstone,
the fracture of the stones decidedly radiating as the stones of an arch.
In other instances they resembled small hillocks, from the upper part
of which the outer coating or tabular plates had generally fallen away,
and the whole consisted of a heap of broken masses of rock.
   The author then described what he considers to be a very recent
volcanic outburst. It is situated in the nummulitic limestone, near
the village of Wagé-ké-pudda, and forms a rather high flat basin,
or table land of about two square miles, composed of calcareous marl,
and flanked by low irregular hills of ironstone and gravel. The
sides are broken by fissures, ravines, and hollows, and the bed of
the basin is covered with hillocks of loose volcanic scoriae of various
colours.    Within the basin are also several small craters or circular
spaces, surrounded imperfectly by walls of columnar, globular, or
friable basalt. These basaltic walls, however, he conceives, are of an
terior date to the mounds of scoriae, which he is of opinion cannot be
of great antiquity, on account of the facility with which their loose mate
rials are removedby atmospheric agents. Other similar outbursts were
also described.
   The paper concluded with an account of the Great Runn, a district
 (exclusive of the elevated tracts called “the Bunnee and Islands")
of 7000 square miles. This singular region, as already described by
Capt. Burns, consists of a sandy flat, dry for the greater part of the
year, but during the prevalence of the south-west winds, con
verted  into an inland sea, passable however on camels.             Capt.
Grant believes that               its
                          present oscillating position between land and
water,     due          to   an

January,          was concluded.
  The observations detailed                    in    this memoir were made during 1827,

1828, and 1829, and are arranged under the heads of the physical
features of the county, the geological structure, and the effects
produced by causes now in action.
   Physical FEATUREs.—The general form of Suffolk is an oblong of
about 47 miles by 27, bounded on the east by the German Ocean, the
south by the river Stour, the west by the Ouse and Lark, and the north
by the Little Ouse and Waveney. It is impossible, says Mr. Clarke, not
to be struck with the fact, that whilst some of these river-courses have
an east and west direction, others flow from N.N.W. to S.S.E., and that
the coast section from Harwich to Orford is nearly parallel with the
latter; and he adds, if these observations be extended to Norfolk and
Essex, counties similar in geological structure, an accordance will be
found in the direction of their rivers and estuaries.
    How far these river channels may be due to dynamical action,
operating from below, the author thinks it is difficult to determine; but
he is of opinion that when they are studied with reference to the proofs
of violent derangement in the north, east, and west corners of Nor
folk, and the almost unequivocal evidence of disturbance on the
coast of Suffolk, there is sufficient reason for assuming, that the
drainage of Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex has been induced by a violent
strain acting from below, and throwing the whole mass of the country
into a position, by which 1200 square miles of Norfolk and 220 of Suf
folk are drained by the Yare, and about 2000 of the latter county at                                          its
south-east corner.
   In  addition     these facts, Mr. Clarke says, that the estuaries
                        to                                                       the                     of

                                          or                                                                  on

                          Geological Society.                                       113
to the depositin Suffolk, is a platform of nearly regular elevation, which
appears to have been worn into ridges and valleys by currents acting
in parallel lines from N.E. to S.W., and the cliffs both in the interior
and on the coast, are sections of these ridges. The dip of the London
clay corresponds with that of the crag, and therefore Mr. Clarke in
fers, that both were acted upon by the same agents, and while they
were beneath the level of the sea.
    According to the author's observation, the deposit nowhere extends
more than twelve or thirteen miles from the coast, and at Pakefield,
where the diluvial clay comes to the very edge of the sea, it disappears
as a surface deposit, but is visible at intervals further north, between
that point and Cromer. Mr. Clarke also states, that though undoubt
edly crag is discernible here and there, in situ, as a regular formation
north of the Waveny, yet he by no means allows that it is regularly
stratified, as an undisturbed deposit, between Leiston and Pakefield.
He is fully convinced from observation, that the diluvial clay and crag
are distinct deposits; and he is almost equally convinced, that if the
crag has any share in the formation of the cliffs between the Blithe
and Lake Lothing, it has been introduced by disturbances of a simi
lar nature to those which are presented in the cliffs of East Norfolk.
That the localities in dispute may have been once occupied by crag,
there is no reason to deny, but they now present no traces of an undis
 turbed deposit.
    To previous descriptions of the structure of the crag, the author
 states that he has nothing to add, except that where the shells are
 not visible, the sands contain a slight mixture of calcareous
 matter.
    He objects to the separation of the beds with shells from those
 without, and shows that the shifting of a sand-bank, would correctly
 account for the occasional occurrence of beds of sand 30 feet thick,
resting upon strata inclosing testacea.
   Believing that the true rationale of the crag is to be found in the
hypothesis of sandbanks, inhabited by testacea, and situated in a
tidal way exposed to violent fluctuations of the sea, as well as subject
to drifts of extraneous matter from land waters, the author sees nothing
extraordinary in the idea that accumulations of sand and shingle may
have formed a part of that deposit in which the crag is regularly
stratified ; but he cannot consent to such accumulations, though con
temporaneous with the crag, being classed under that name, much less
can he consent to diluvial clay being also included in             it.
  If  then, says Mr. Clarke, we assume that       this tertiary sea, sand
                                                  in
banks were formed, around the shelves and under the lea              which    of                .
testacea collected, lived and died,     as    present, many

              the crag may  be  readily solved, and we shall not need
                                                                                        to to
nomena    of
wonder why the bivalve shells are found lying with the flat sides
the strata    ofsand; why the young are congregated        one group, and

  With respect to Mr. Charlesworth's" subdivision of the crag into
two ages, the author fully agrees with a qualification of the word
age.     If that gentleman                 had said different periods                    of the same age,
Mr. Clarke would find no difficulty in admitting              of the                    the justness
classification;  as not only species but genera of shells are differ
ently grouped according to localities.    The Norwich crag, he also
admits, differs from the Suffolk, and on the authority of Mr. Wood
ward alludes to bouldered Suffolk shells occurring at Thorpe, in
Norfolk.
  The corals of the lower bed of the Suffolk crag, the author is of
opinion, betoken a warnier climate, and he says, if during the crag era
 the earth gradually cooled, the change from a coralline deposit to one
 more nearly related to the inhabitants of the present era, would be
 the natural and inevitable result.
    Mr. Clarke fully assents to the observation brought forward by
 Mr. Charlesworth in a paper, read before the British Association at
 Bristolt, on the mixed nature of the deposits now forming on the coasts
of England, in which the remains of the adjacent cliffs are intermingled
 with the shells of existing species; and adduces examples with which
he was acquainted, long before the reading of that paper.
    The author then offers some further remarks on the necessity of
separating the diluvium from the crag. He is of opinion that the gravel
 found in the latter, if carefully observed, will be acknowledged to dif
 fer from regular diluvial gravel, and that                          its
                                                   occurrence only betokens                                             a
diluvial action during the period          the crag. That such actions have

                           one who has studied gravel deposits accurately,

   On the conchological history of the crag, Mr. Clarke offers no re
marks, partly because it did not fall within his object in writing the
paper, and partly because the data which he formerly collected have
been lost.
   Diluvium.—The diluvium of Suffolk may be divided into three
classes : 1, clay ; 2, gravel; and 3, erratic blocks.
    1. Clay.—This     division covers a considerable portion of the
county, and extends into Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, and Essex, rising
to a considerable elevation in High Suffolk, and attaining near Cromer,
a thickness of 400 feet. A considerable portion of the clay is of a
yellowish hue, but the greater part is blue; and both varieties contain
chalk pebbles, sometimes disposed in layers but more commonly                di
spersed, a character by which the diluvial may be distinguished from
the London or plastic clay.        It is difficult to determine the origin of
this argillaceous deposit; but the author is inclined to think, that the
yellowish portion may have been derived from the plastic clays, and
the blue from the clays below the chalk.             Fragments of coal have
been found in the diluvium at     Lavenham,      also fragments of mica slate
containing garnets and tourmaline.          Specimens of a similar rock were
obtained by Mr. R. C. Taylor, at Cromer, with masses of granite, por
phyry, trap, oolites, &c.” At Ballingdon Hill near Sudbury, Mr. Brown
has procured thirty varieties of primary, secondary, and tertiary rocks.
Comparatively few flints occur in the clay. At Ickworth a beautiful
specimen of the Dudley trilobite was obtained in making a drain :
and at various other localities, numerous species of tertiary and
secondary fossils abound.
   It is inferred that the clay contains cavities, as streams of noxious
air occasionally issue from fissures.
   2. Gravel.—The gravel is less generally diffused than the clay, and
is considered by Mr. Clarke to have been partly deposited at a distinct
period.     In some cases, it consists merely of unrolled flints, left in
situ by the dissolution of the chalk; in others, large masses of flint
slightly mixed with chalk pebbles are imbedded in sand; and occa
sionally flints are intermingled with boulders of various dimensions,
and sometimes unknown origin. Many of these extraneous fragments,
he thinks, may have been washed out of the clay; and he shows that
the river valleys have been excavated through both the clay and the
gravel.    With respect to the relative proportional quantity of each
ingredient, chalk flints are said to be the most numerous, primary and
transition rocks the next in abundance, and secondary and tertiary
the fewest in number; the absence of the two latter being explained
by their inferior hardness.
   3. Erratic blocks.—These occur in great abundance, and occasion
ally of vast size. They are sometimes found in the river valleys, and
sometimes on the level platforms and hills.         They agree in lithological
characters with the smaller      fragments      of the gravel, and are con
sidered to be of the same diluvial       origin;   but are so conspicuous as
to deserve a distinct notice.
    Lacustrine deposits.--Under this head the author alludes to the bed
 containing freshwater shells, discovered by Mr. Charlesworth and Mr.
               • See Phil. Mag, and Annals, N.S. vol. i. p. 346.

Wood    on the banks of the Stour at Sutton; and that described by
Mr. Brown   at Copford near Colchester, which contains similar shells,
also bones of the ox and deer.   Accumulations containing the same
testacea, occur at Grays near Purfleet, and at Southend in Essex, but
associated with remains of the elephant, rhinoceros, deer, ox, bear,
&c. In the bed at Grays rounded pebbles of chalk occur, agreeing
with those found in the diluvium, and from which they were probably
derived.
   CAusEs 1N Action.—In this division of the memoir are described,
 1st, the alluvial accumulations;          2ndly, the changes in the river
courses; and 3rdly, the action of the sea on the coast. In illustration
of the two first, Mr. Clarke enters into a discussion on the supposed
position of the Roman station, Ad Ansam, and the alterations which
must have taken place, if the site assigned to it be correct. He then
proceeds to the action of the tides on the cliffs.
   His first acquaintance with the coast about Bawdsey was in 1814,
and between that period and 1829, a battery which once stood 100
yards beyond the present low-water mark, has been dismantled ; and
the life-boat house has been three times removed, to a distance at least
a quarter of a mile in rear of                    its
                                      original position.
   The destruction between the Alde and Bawdsey cliff during the last
 20  years,                    have been upwards           100 acres; and the
                                                                            is of

between the Deben and Harwich harbour, batteries and martello
towers having been successively undermined.

clusive, and the debris thus produced, together with numerous masses
of ancient rocks, was spread by a rush of water over the surface of the
tertiary formations and the chalk, in some places to a depth of 400
feet, constituting the beds of drift clay, &c., which occupy so great an
area in Suffolk.

  In support also of the land having been raised and not the sea de
  pressed, he referred to the submarine forests of Somersetshire, in the
  prolongation of the same coast from Blue Anchor to the Parret; and
  argued that their position could not be accounted for by a subsidence
  in the sea level, but by an unequal movement of the land.
     A communication by Mr. James de Carle Sowerby on his new genus
  of fossil shells, Tropaeum, was then read.
     This fossil is described by Mr. Sowerby as an involute chambered
 shell with sinuated septa; the whorls free, sometimes very distant;
  siphon in the external margin. The natural place of the genus is be
  tween Hamites and Scaphites, and the shells which may be grouped
  with Tropaeum, have been hitherto ranked as Hamites, but have no
 sudden bend which may be compared to a hook. The species hitherto
  found have been obtained from the gault and green sand.           The
  species (Tropaeum Bowerbankii) described in the paper was obtained
  by Mr. Bowerbank in the Isle of Wight, and was found in the lower
 green sand on the south side of the Island.

     The following observations on a species of Glaucus, referred to
 the Glaucus herapterygius, Cuvier, by George Bennett, Esq., F.L.S.,
 Corresponding Member of the Zoological Society, Surgeon and
 Superintendent of the Australian Museum at Sydney, New South
 Wales, were read.
     “On the 20th of April, 1835, during a voyage from England to
 Sydney, New South Wales, in latitude 4° 26' N., and longitude 19°
 30'W., with light airs and calms prevailing at the time, about 3
 P.M., a number of damaged and perfect specimens of the Glaucus
 herapterygius, Cuv., were caught in the towing net.       On being im
 mediately removed from the net and placed in a glass of sea water,
 they resumed their vital actions and floated about in the liquid ele
 ment, exhibiting a brilliancy of colour and peculiarity of form,
 which did not fail to excite the admiration of the beholders.
     “The back of the animal, as well as the upper surface of the fins
 and digitated processes, and the upper portion of the head and tail,
 was of a vivid purple colour, varying occasionally in its intensity;
 appearing brighter in colour when the animal was active or excited,
 and deeper when remaining floating tranquilly upon the surface of
the water.       The abdomen, and under surface of the fins, are of a
beautiful pearly white colour, appearing as if it had been enamelled.
The usual length of my specimens, measured from the extremity of
the head to the tail, when extended floating upon the surface of the
water, was 1% inches; sometimes one or two lines more or less.
The body of the animal is subcylindrical, terminating in a tail, which
gradually becomes more slender towards the extremity, until it
finally terminates in a delicate point. The head is short, with very
small conical tentacula in pairs; two superior, and two inferior;
three (and in G. octopterygius,      Cuv., four) branchial fins on each

ber of digitations, however, varying; and the centre digitations are
the longest; the first branchial fins, those nearest the head, are
larger and denser than the others. The mouth is armed with bony
jaws; the body is gelatinous and covered by a thin and extremely
 sensible membrane.
    “These little animals were very delicate and fragile in their struc
ture, and although many, indeed, I may say numbers, were caught,
yet very few in comparison were found to be in a perfect condition,
some being deficient in one, two, or more fins, and others being com
pletely crushed.        Not one of the specimens caught on this occasion,
or  during   the  voyage,    had the silvery line or streak running down
the   back,  from the head to the extremity of the tail; branching off
also to the fins and along the centre of each of the digitations. Seve
ral Porpitat were also captured in the net at the same time with
these animals, and serve as food for them.

beauty of these interesting little animals, and               means             all

faeces.
    “But few of these animals were caught after the 20th until the
 24th of the same month, in latitude 2° 26' N., longitude 19° 51" W.,
 when having light airs from S. by E., nearly calm; in the morning
 a great number were seen floating by the ship, and it was not diffi
 cult, by aid of my towing-net, to capture as many as I required, for
 they swam very superficially upon the water. The whole of those
 taken proved to be of the same species (G. herapterygius) as those
 before caught.     I again placed several of the specimens in a glass
 of sea water; they were full of life, sometimes moving about, not
 very briskly, however,      and at other times remaining floating upon
 the surface of the   water,  merely gently moving the fins. As they
floated upon the surface of the water in the glass, the sides of the
head, back, tail, fins, &c., exhibited at the time a light silvery blue
 colour, which was admirably contrasted with the deeper blue of the
 upper surface, and falling into the elegant pearly or silvery white of
the under surface of the animal, displaying an exceedingly rich and
elegant appearance. Often, when at rest, the animal would drop one
or more of the fins, but on touching them, they would be immediate
ly raised to the former position, and that organ was turned back as
if to throw off the offending object, followed at the same time by a
general movement of the whole body. On touching the animal upon
the back, it seemed to display more sensitiveness in that than in any
other part of the body, judging from the effects produced, in com
parison with similar experiments on other portions of the body; for
instance, the centre of the back was touched lightly and rapidly with
a feather; which caused the little creature to sink as if under the
pressure of the touch, throwing at the same time the head, tail, and
 all the fins upwards, followed                  by
                                         general distortion

movement but that which proceeded from the undulating movements
of the digitated extremities of the fins,     as well as an occasional
slight twisting motion of the same organs.
    “I felt much interest in the beautiful display of a circulating fluid
on the dorsal surface of these animals, which was afforded me by
the assistance of a microscope. Through the semi-transparent mem
brane of the back, a fluid could be readily perceived close to the sur
face, evidently flowing in two directions, one taking a course down
wards, and the other returning upwards; but I was unable to di
stinguish two distinct vessels for these separate actions.
   “These animals seemed to be very torpid in their movements,
although sometimes, when floating upon the water, they would
be seen busily engaged in moving their fins about, but those actions
were soon suspended and their fins were suffered to hang lazily
down, as if fatigued with the short exertion, which did not move
them one inch about the glass of water; and even when the little
indolent creatures did take the trouble to move themselves from one
side of the glass to the other, it was effected by a tardy motion,

       “Soon after, another Glaucus began a devouring attack upon an
   other Porpita which had been placed in the glass, eating a little of
   it and then ceasing after a short meal, occasionally renewing the at
   tack at short intervals.       On examining the Porpita, which had been
   partially devoured by the ravenous Glaucus, I found the disc had
   been cleared of the tentacles and other soft parts; a small part of the
   fleshy portion only remaining upon the disc. Only one part of the
   horny disc exhibited any injury, and that appeared to be the place
   where the animal was first grasped by the Glaucus.
       “When any of these animals came in contact with another in the
   glass, they did not display any annoyance, or coil themselves up,
   nor did they evince any savage propensities one towards the other;
   and they would often float about, having their digitated processes in
   contact one with the other, without exhibiting any signs of annoy
   ance; even when placed or pushed one against the other, they did
   not manifest any irritation, but remained undisturbed as in their
   usual moments of quiet repose.
      “On the back of the animal being seen in a strong light, a black
  line could be discerned on each margin, and passing down the centre
  of each fin, and sometimes varied in having two black lines on the
   upper part of one fin, although the opposite            may display but one.  fin

  “To place these little animals in the glass of water from the towing
net without injury to their delicate structure required care; so that as
soon as they were captured in the net attached to the meshes, they
were not handled, but carefully washed off, which was effected by
dipping the meshes in the glass of water, when the animal soon
detached itself without sustaining any injury, and floated in the
Water.
   “Although these animals are so fragile, so easily destroyed on
being taken out of their natural element, yet they fling themselves
about in the water without sustaining any injury, without even the
loss of any of the digitated processes of the fins; yet when there is
much movement of the water in carrying the glass from one place
to another, they are evidently disturbed and restless, and the fins
are dropped; if therefore, a slight motion of the water disturbs them,

weather? can they be similar to the delicate Ephemeris, doomed to

immense number seen only from the ship—and how many myriads
more extended beyond our range of vision!—it conveyed to the mind
some idea of the profusion of living beings inhabiting the wide ex

   “The more we pursue the investigation of the actions of living
objects, the more we see of the unbounded resources of creative
power; and, after all our reasoning, must conclude that some wise
purpose, though dimly perceptible to our imperfect understandings,

law of variety.”

  erect, with the mouth upwards, so that the animal was equally pressed
 against each side of the shell, was flattened and curved on each side.
  like the specimen examined by M. Ferussac.”
      Mr. Gray also stated that, so far from the animal using the finned
 arms as sails, they were the means by which it retained itself in the
 shell; and he further observed, that it was very difficult to distin
 guish the species of Argonauta, as they varied greatly in shape, and
 that on a comparison of many specimens, he had found that the
 presence or absence of the spines or ears at the back of the mouth
  were of no importance as a specific character, specimens of each of
 the recorded species having this process developed only on one or the
  other side.
      The Chairman, (Mr. Owen,) after premising some observations
  on the diseases to which the mortality of the larger feline animals
  in the Society's Menagerie was attributable, proceeded to read the
  following description of two Entozoa infesting the stomach of the
  Tiger, (Felis Tigris, Linn.,) one of which forms the type of a new
  genus of Nematoidea.
     “I  received a few days ago, from the Medical Superintendent of
 the   Society's Menagerie, a portion of the stomach of a young Tiger
 (which died of rupture of the aorta), exhibiting on the internal or
 mucous surface what were considered to be scrofulous tumours.
 They were five or six in number, of a round and oblong form, vary
 ing in size from half an inch to two inches in the largest diameter,
and the largest of them projecting about half an inch from the plane
of the inner surface: they made no projection externally.      The mu
 cous membrane covering the smaller tumours was puckered up into
 minute reticulate ruga: the surface of the largest tumour was smooth.
On wiping away the tough thick mucous secretion from the tu
mours, and examining more closely their surface, two or three orifices
presented themselves in the larger, and a single orifice in each of the
smaller tumours. These orifices conducted to irregular sinuses which
were the nidi of two kinds of Nematoid Entozoa, some measuring
nearly an inch in length and a line in thickness; the others being
more minute, not exceeding 5 lines in length, and about 3% of an
inch in diameter.      Only a pair of the larger Entozoa were found in
each of the three     largest  tumours; the smaller species existed in
countless numbers.
     “Before proceeding with the description of the worms, I may
briefly conclude the history of the tumours by observing that they
were composed of condensed accumulated layers of the sub-mucous
cellular tissue, presenting a flat surface next the muscular coat, to
which the larger tumours firmly adhered, and projecting with a
rounded convexity towards the cavity of the stomach, where the si
nuses opened and terminated.         They did not contain any of the
caseous secretion characteristic of struma, but were most probably
caused by the irritation of the Entozoa.
     “The dimensions of the larger Entozoa above given are those of
the female : the male is about one fourth smaller. In both sexes the
body is slightly attenuated at the two extremities; the caudal ex

tremity is more inflected and more obtuse in the male; the oral ex
tremity in both is obtuse and truncate.
   “The surface of the body appears to the naked eye to be mi
 nutely striated transversely: it is variegated by the white genital,
and amber-coloured digestive tubes appearing through the transparent
integument.     When examined with a lens of half-inch focus, the
anterior two-thirds of the body are seen to be covered with circular
series of minute reflected spines, which, viewed with a still higher
power, present three distinct points, one large one in the middle and
 two small lateral ones.

         “The generic difference indicated by the external peculiarities of
     the Entozoa above described, is confirmed by the internal anatomy,
     which presents some peculiarities which appear not to have been
     hitherto detected in the class Entozoa: I refer more particularly to
     a distinct salivary apparatus, conformable to that which exists in the
      Holothuria and other Echinodermata. This apparatus consists of four
     elongated straight blind tubes, each about two lines in length, which
     are placed at equal distances around the commencement of the ali
     mentary canal, having their smaller extremities directed forward,
     and opening into the mouth, at the base of the lateral tridentate
     processes, and their closed obtuse ends passing backwards into the ab
     dominal cavity.      When examined with a lens of + inch focus, the
    parietes of these salivary tubes present very distinct oblique or spiral
     decussating fibres; their contents are semi-pellucid in the recent
     worm, but become opake in spirit of wine.
        “The coexistence of these salivary glands with an oral apparatus
     which is better adapted for trituration than any that has hitherto
     been detected in the Entozoa, is conformable to the laws which re
     gulate the existence and condition of the salivary apparatus in higher
     animals; and is highly interesting on that account.          The only allu
     sion which I can find to salivary organs in other Entozoa is in Clo
     quet's ‘Anatomie de l'Ascaride Lombricoide, in which he considers the
     thickened glandular parietes of the wsophagus to serve for an analo
     gous secretion.
        “The first portion of the alimentary canal or stomach is about 3
     lines in length; it contains a milk-white substance, and is separated
    by a well-marked constriction from the remaining portion, which we
    may regard as intestine: this is filled with a pulpy substance of an
    amber colour, which grows deeper in tint as it approaches the anus.
    The intestine enlarges slightly as it passes backward; it is wide and
     straight: is not tied down to the parietes of the body by mesenteric
    filaments as in the Strongylus gigas, &c.;       its

       In               this paper, readof    former evening, the author       a

  present continuation, confining himself to the comparatively simple
 case in which the molecules of the aether and of the body are uniformly
  diffused.
     The differential equations of motion inferred from these considera
  tions contain, each, the displacements of the molecules of the aether
  and of the body, with coefficients depending on the masses and      di
 stances of the molecules, the law of force to which they are sub
jected, and the length of the wave. By a particular method of elimi
  nation, these pairs of simultaneous equations may be reduced each to
 a single one, of the simple form which occurs in the case of a single
 vibrating medium, the new coefficient being connected with those of
 the original equations by an equation of the second degree.     The ex
 pression for the displacement, then, is of the same form as in the case
 of a single vibrating medium ; but the relation between the coeffi
 cients of the time and of the distance, and consequently the velocity
 of propagation, will be very different.
     The quadratic equation above alluded to expresses the relation of
 these coefficients, or, in other words, the relation between the period
 of vibration and the length of the wave. When the action of the
 molecules of the aether and of the body, inter se, and on one another,
 is governed by the same law, this equation is resolvable into simple
 factors, one of which only seems to belong to the problem, the other
 giving an expression for the velocity of propagation independent of
 the length of the wave. The author accordingly proceeds to develop
 the former of these formulae, converting the triple sums which it con
 tains into triple integrals, according to the method of M. Cauchy.
     Among the consequences deducible from this development is the
 following: In the expanded expression for the velocity of propaga
 tion, each term consists of two parts, one of which is due to the
action of the aether, and the other to that of the body. It is not im
 probable that there may be bodies for which the first or principal term
 is nearly nothing, the two parts of which it is composed being of op
 posite signs, and nearly equal. In this case the principal part of the
 expression for the velocity will be that derived from the second term;
 and, if that term be taken as an approximate value, it will follow that
 the refractive index of the substance must be in the sub-duplicate
 ratio of the length of the wave nearly. Now, it is remarkable that
 this law of dispersion, so unlike anything observed in transparent
media, agrees pretty closely with the results obtained by Sir David
Brewster in some of the metals. In all these bodies the refractive
index (inferred from the angle of maximum polarization) increases
with the length of the wave.      Its values for the red, mean, and blue
ray, in silver, are 3.866, 3-271, 2.824; the ratios of the second and
third to the first being 85 and '73. According to the law above
 given, these ratios should be '88 and '79.
     Professor MacCullagh made a verbal communication on the pro
bable nature of the light transmitted by the diamond and by gold leaf.
 He conceives that as there is a change of phase caused by reflexion
 from these bodies, so there is also a change of phase produced by re
 fraction; the change being different according as the incident light

134                                           Royal Irish Academy.
is polarized in the plane of incidence, or in the perpendicular plane.
Consequently, if the incident ray be polarized in any intermediate
plane, the refracted ray should be elliptically polarized; and on ex
amining the light transmitted by gold leaf, this was found to be the
case.   Of course the same thing is true of the light which enters the
other  metals, and which is subsequently absorbed.    The same remark
explains the appearance of double refraction in specimens of the
diamond which give only a single image; and it is likely that other
precious stones will be found to possess similar properties.       Mr.
MacCullagh has obtained a general formula for the difference of phase
between the two component portions of the refracted light, one po
larized in the plane of incidence, and the other perpendicular to                                                               it.
He finds from this formula, that the difference     phase, which   no                       of                           is

REMARKS            ON THE COMMENCEMENT of sik E. FF. broMHEAD's
                    PAPER ON BOTANICAL CLASSIFICATION.
The      subjoined remarks were intended to be appended as a note to this
           paper, but were omitted for want of room, as stated in p. 51.
THE   introductory passages of Sir E. Ffrench Bromhead's inter
  esting paper have vividly reminded us of the principles on
which the natural arrangement of organized beings should be in
vestigated, as laid down in the Horae Entomologicae.     The principle
of the “first attempt to arrange natural families,” that of assemblage,
is one of those on which Mr. Macleay has most strongly insisted.
The remark on the representation of the progress of development
by   a spiral, perfectly agrees with the result of investigating the affi
nities of animals, already compared by the Rev. Mr. Kirby (Intro
duction to Entomology, vol.  chap. xlvii.     iv.
                                           407.)      “a convol       p.             to
ving series.” We may add, however, that the relation between the
opposite points         of
                 contiguous whorls    the spiral, “which appear of
to      be
       the nearest, though distant                     by
                                            whole round,”   a      different         is   of
                                                                                           a
nature from that which unites into            series the groups forming
                                                                a

contain         many documents and much information                                       connected with
Newton's life and pursuits that are now highly interesting, and not
generally known. The announcement, therefore, that the MSS. are
now “placed in the hands of an eminent person,” with a view to
their publication, will be hailed with satisfaction by every friend of
science and admirer of Newton, provided they are to be published in
an authentic and unmutilated form. But as considerable feeling has
already been displayed in connection with this subject, it would be
far more satisfactory if the selection were made by a committee of
competent persons, acting under the authority of a scientific body,
and not left to the discretion of any individual, however eminent,
especially as the original documents are not accessible to those
who desire to investigate for themselves.               Government, it has
been    stated,   some time      ago,   expressed   a willingness   to print
them at the   public   expense.    It is greatly to be  regretted   that this
proposal was not agreed                           to.

     M. Rose has examined                 a     considerable number                              of    the compounds
which dry ammonia forms with anhydrous salts, volatile metallic
chlorides, and oxacids, with the view              ascertaining the general  of

XVII.   On the Use of Sulphate of Copper for erciting Voltaic
  Electricity, and on the Employment of Iron in the Construc
  tion of Batteries.    By ANDREw FYFE, M.D., F.R.S.E.,
  Lecturer on  Chemistry, Edinburgh.*
THE  action of metals with metallic salts has been lon
  known, but it is only lately that the latter have been .#
in electric arrangements, and chiefly for electro-magnetic pur
poses.    Aware that sulphate of copper was easily decomposed
by zinc, I was induced some time ago to try                           it,
                                                                                      in as

the exciting fluid     the galvanic battery, and found that

however   unnecessary   for me       relate the experiments that
                                               to
were performed,        byas

making the loss in the former amount to about 16, and in the
latter to about 20 per cent.
   But in this case, where nitric acid was added to the sul
phuric, with the view of increasing the power, the expense
was considerably increased.          When sulphuric acid alone was
used, there was much less electrolyzation indicated by the
volta-electrometer.       For each equivalent of water decomposed,
4-66 of zinc in each plate, with of course a corresponding
quantity of acid, were consumed; so that the loss of electro
lytic power amounted to about 78 per cent. The loss was
therefore less; in other words the electrolyzation was greater.
But this, though it alters the comparative expense, yet it does
so in a small degree; because, if the electrolytic action in this
trough is greater with sulphuric acid, it will be greater also
with the metallic solutions.          But even allowing that it is so
to a  trifling  extent,  it has been shown that the comparative

yet it was very faint. The result was different when sulphate
of copper was used. The electrolyzation commenced almost
the instant that the trough was filled, and continued in the
same way as when zinc was employed; indeed I could observe
very little difference as to energy of action, and to the time
that it continued, with this exception, that in general there
was rather less gas evolved in the volta-electrometer.   That
evolved   by   the action of 1250 of the  sulphate in the zinc
trough being 180, that afforded by the same quantity in the
iron trough was 173, or about gºth part less. When the sul
phate was mixed with nitre and with sea salt, there was an
increase in power, similar to that when using them in the zinc
trough. When therefore blue vitriol is to be used in voltaic
arrangements, iron may be employed instead of zinc, with very
nearly the same electrolytic power. It has been already men
tioned that when the blue vitriol is mixed with nitre, but more
particularly with sea salt, the expense is only about one half

454.           Mr. L. Hunton            on the definite Combinations
duced to examine further, and found that though the solution
when heated in an open shallow vessel, as a watch-glass, may
be alternately raised to ebullition and cooled, for several times
in succession, without forming any permanently insoluble pre
cipitate, yet if heated but once, or twice at the furthest, in a
deep narrow-mouthed vessel, as a test tube, a separation of
protoxide takes place. The presence of free or uncombined
sugar is also of much consequence, for if we add a little to
any of the saturated solution and then heat, insoluble prot
oxide is formed even in a watch-glass; on the contrary, a free
alkali appears to retard the deoxidation in the test tube, and
to prevent the formation of a little which takes place after
four or five heatings in a watch-glass, and resulting from the
formation of a little carbonate of lime, and consequent setting
 free of sugar.
   If instead of boiling, a few test tubes are filled with the so
lution, a result variable with the difference of exposure and
presence        of free sugar is obtained; thus,

The wax of this envelope melts, however, at a much lower

bles bees' wax, and has the same elementary composition.

those of Pyrus Malus, Capsicum annuum, Sorbus aucuparia,
Cucurbita Lagenaria, invariably combined with the colouring

By the experiment before mentioned, M. Du Menil obtained
from the bark of Pinus sylvestris also 13 per M. of a whitish
wax, the nature of which was not more exactly determined t.
   M. Fr. Nees von Esenbeck and the author examined the
milk-sap of several fig treesi, in order to find whether the
Lacca in granis could originate from trees of this genus, as is
said, but must declare it to be erroneous; and they were                        in
duced to consider, as the only plant producing this remarkable
vegetable body, the Aleurites laccifera, which belongs to a
family the chemical constitution of which allows us to infer
the presence of similar resins to that which is contained in
seed-lac.
     At the     same time they  examined the milk-sap of Ficus
elastica from the stem as well as from the young branches; and
arrived at the result that the milk-sap of the young branches
consists of resin, gum, wax, together with some extractive
matter, a salt of line, and a glutinous resin which was only
soluble in aether, not in alcohol, and which they believed to
be identical with the substance found by Macaire in Airaclylis
gummifera, and named by him Viscin S. The milk-sap of the
old stem contained, on the contrary, caoutchouc instead of
viscin, and also the other constituent parts of the milk-sap of
the young branches, which is only observable when the milk
sap is allowed to flow immediately into the aether. If it coagu
lates in the air, traces only of resin, gum, and extractive matter
can be separated from the mass which has become caoutchouc
or elastic resin (Feder harz). The milk-saps of many other
species of this genus contained viscin, but in a few cases only
had it become caoutchouc in the old stems.            M. Zeller|
found this viscin also in the berries of Sambucus Ebulus.
Without doubt the seed-lac (lacca in granis) belongs to the
coagulated milk-saps which have been drawn from the branches
of Aleurites laccifera 2 by some peculiar lac Aphis. I ex

two of which we are already acquainted as possessing a cry

are isomeric or have the same elementary composition, and
consist of 2 (Clo Hig)+O". The resin discovered by Boussin

bright white colour and crystalline, melts at above 100° centig.,
is soluble in aether, aethereal oils, and alcohol.    Nees von

benzoic acid; and M. Landerer * extracted from the roots of
Inula Helenium scales similar to sebacic acid, which possessed
a pearly lustre, were soluble only in aether and caustic potash,
and devoid of smell and taste; the solution acted as an acid.
Dumas describes a similar crystalline formation, which could
be seen with the naked eye in the form of warty excrescences
in the interior of the above-mentioned roott, which consisted
of C, H, O.
   Prussic acid was found by Proctorf in the bark of Prunus
virginiana, and by O., Henry $ in the sap of the root of
Jatropha Manihot, or at least, as in most cases, a radical from
which it might be formed.
    Between these azotic acids and the alkaloids must be
placed, on account of their containing nitrogen a division
of vegetable formative parts, which for this reason have
been termed indifferent, and among which many substances
too little known have been classed: the following however have
found their right place. Emetine may, according to Lan

was in a state of almost perfect repose.
   20. The mode of allowing for this is the following.         All
determinations of   intensity are relative, referring  to some                               in
tensity as a standard; but I have taken the horizontal inten
sity at Paris as unity (which is to that at the magnetic equator
as 4,788 to 10,000 according to Humboldt)*.           Hence, since
the  squares of the times of 100 vibrations are   inversely as the
magnetic forces, the terrestrial horizontal intensity at a station
A is to that at Paris, or 1, as the square of the time observed
at Paris (which time we may call Tº) is to the square of the
time observed at station A (or TA).      Hence,
                                  ..

   If the magnetism of the needle change, we must therefore
find  by interpolation the time of vibration at Paris for the

observation made (in M. Arago's Cabinet Magnetique), 11th
June 1833, as equal to

170               Professor Forbes's Experiments on
               § 3. Observations on Magnetic Intensity.
     24. It now remains to give the observations which have been
made, and reduced in the way already detailed. These con
sist chiefly of two series.       One was made in the year 1832,
intended to form part of a very general investigation in physical
geography, which I meant to pursue throughout a journey of
several years.       Having been diverted from this by the opening
of other prospects, the series remains incomplete as a general
investigation, but embraces a connected examination of a great
district of the higher and central Alps, calculated to elucidate
a question which I had particularly proposed to myself, as to
the supposed diminution of magnetism with height.                  It like
wise includes some observations as to the influence of extinct
volcanos on the Rhine. The second series was made in the
 Pyrenees in 1835, with almost an exclusive view to the                 in
fluence of height, and is confined to one small district.              One
other important point gained was a very accurate determina
tion of the comparative horizontal intensities at Edinburgh
 and Paris.       The choice of the stations was regulated very
much by the views just mentioned: the particular spots of ob
 servation, together with the geographical position and eleva
 tion of the place, will be given in Table VII.           I have thought
 it better to record in the first    place  in  separate   Tables for the
 two needles, the details of the observations in the order in
 which they were made, the data for correction, and the cor
 rected numbers.        These are contained in Tables V. and VI.
 I  have thought it needless to incur the labour and expense of
 printing the individual numbers on which the mean results
 are founded.        They are however preserved in a condition
 adapted for immediate reference”.
     * Many of the numerical calculations contained in the remainder of
  this paper, have been made by two of my pupils Messrs. Irvine and Edward,
  under my own inspection and revision.

 XXI.      On Murio-carbonate and Native Muriate of Lead.

      SPECIMEN I      obtained some time since from Cornwall
     contains both these substances.   I have not observed any
specimen of either of them in any of the collections that I
have seen in Cornwall, nor am                             I

any others from that country, except a few single crystals of
the murio-carbonate in the collection of the late Wm. Phillips,
which came into his possession after the publication of his
“Mineralogy.”
  The figure and measurements of this mineral given in page
343 of his work (edition of 1823)t do not afford data for
ascertaining the dimensions of the prism.
     I annexa figure of one of the crystals from Cornwall, from
which those elements may be deduced.
   The primary form is well known to be a square prism, and
from the inclination of P on a, the ratio of a terminal edge to
a lateral edge is found to be as 35 to 38 very nearly. There
are bright cleavages parallel to                      all

XXII.        On certain Points of Chemical Philosophy and Nomen
    clature.      By Robert HARE, M.D., Professor of Chemistry
    in the     University     of Pennsylvania; with a Letter from
    M. Berzelius.
      [To   the Editors   of the American Journal of Pharmacy.]
         DEAR SIRs,                             Philadelphia, March 4, 1837.
                        1833, I published in your Journal, together
 INwithSeptember,
             some encomiums upon the Treatise of Chemistry by
 the celebrated Berzelius, certain objections to his nomenclature,
and some suggestions respecting a substitute, which I deemed
to be preferable.         In the following June I addressed a letter
 to Professor Silliman upon the same topics, in which my                   cri
 ticisms and suggestions were amplified and corrected in obe
 dience to more mature reflection.                  A printed copy of that
 letter having been sent by me to Berzelius, I received in an
 swer an epistle, of which I furnish you with a translation.
 and there are in other places, in Rutile, for example, impossible values of
 angles given, through the inattention      of the author in copying from his
 rough memorandums, but which a very slender knowledge of the subject
 would have enabled the editor to set right.         His omissions, however, in
 this  respect would be less injurious  to the   reputation of the author than
 the altered and interpolated passages.        In sulphuret of copper, for   in
 stance, the author gives a regular sir-sided prism, either simple or modified,
 as the crystalline form, but the editor has inserted that the primary form
 is a cube. Now an editor so little acquainted with mineralogy as not to
 know that a cube cannot be the primary form of a regular six-sided prism,
 ought not to have attempted any alteration in W. Phillips's text, but should
 have reprinted it exactly as it stood, and have placed any additions of his
 own in an appendix.

    Since the period of that correspondence, so demonstrative
 of candour and good feeling on the part of the great Swedish
chemist, I have published two editions of my Compendium of
 Chemistry, in which I have pursued a course corresponding
with my criticisms above alluded                                   to.

both acids and bases, capable           their union           by
                                                          constituting               of

those produced                   by
                      the other are called amphide salts.

 bases, I condemned the employment of that termination, to
 distinguish the electro-negative, and acid compounds of sul
 phur, selenium, and tellurium.         I considered it inconsistent
 to   give  precedence   to the  syllable designating the radical in
 the acids formed with hydrogen; as in                          hydro
 bromic, hydriodic, hydrofluoric, hydrofluoboric, hydrofluo
 silicic, preferring the terms chlorohydric, bromohydric, iodo
 hydric, fluohydroboric, fluohydrosilicic, &c., in which I have
 been sanctioned by Thenard and others.
     I  proposed a definition of an acid, and a base, which      I con
 ceived to be the only one which could be adopted, consistently
 with the use made of those words by Berzelius, and other           di
 stinguished chemists; and advanced that, agreeably to that
 definition, his double haloid salts must be considered as simple
 salts, severally formed of an acid and a base.
     I objected to his treating the words combustion, and oxy
 genation as synonymous.
     Having thus made the reader acquainted with the substance
 of my criticisms upon the Berzelian nomenclature, I will sub
join his letter in answer to them, and will then state, and en
deavour to justify, the conclusions at which I have arrived.
 Letter from     J. J. Berzelius of Stockholm, to R. Hare, M.D.,
    Professor of    Chemistry   in the University of Pennsylvania,
    acknowledging the receipt of a Communication respecting
    Nomenclature, and replying thereto.
        SiR,                               Stockholm, Sept. 23, 1834.
    I am very much obliged to you for the remarks, which,
under the date of June 21st, you had the friendship to com
municate to me, respecting the nomenclature which I have
employed in my Treatise of Chemistry.
    I   perceive that having contemplated chemical phaenomena
under different points of view, we differ as to the nomencla
ture which is the most appropriate for their description.             I
consider the combinations of metals with chlorine, bromine,
&c., as salts; whilst you, in accordance with Mr. De Bonds
                                     *
dorff, consider them as bases and acids, capable of forming
                                                  -
salts by their union.
     If it were expedient that chemical classification should be
dependent on the number of                  bodies which enter into
                                  2 A2

180                         M.       Berzelius on certain points
each combination, this idea of Mr. De Bondsdorff would
without doubt be preferable; but if attention be due to the
chemical properties which characterize combinations, we can
not adhere to an arrangement founded on the number of the
                                                                                                        .
elements. Yet so essential is it in chemistry to have reference
to properties, that a system of chemistry in which common
and analogous properties should not affect the arrangement,
would present a mass of facts so chaotic, that no memory
would be competent to retain them. In a system thus strictly
conformable to the ideas of Mr. De Bondsdorff, cyanogen,

                 properties resembling chlorine           bromine                       or

        acid having azote for           radical—I am persuaded you
 would not approve                    of
                            extending the system          De Bondsdorff                 of
 so  far; but          if correct,
                                it   be would         inconsistent not

    But let us return          the combinations of the metals with
                                           to
 chlorine, fluorine, &c., and make,           imagination, the followingin

           in                                                                                                in a

182          Dr. Hare and M. Berzelius                        on certain points
ment of the constitution of the oxysalts (which applies equally
 to the sulphosalts and others): but as to myself, I have a
    º:
thorough conviction, that there is therein, something more than
8.        speculation; since it unfolds to us an internal analogy
in   phaenomena,    which, agreeably to the perception of our
senses, are externally analogous. If these phaenomena are to be
considered agreeably to the ideas of Mr. De Bondsdorff, how
does it happen that sulphur, phosphorus, arsenic, and other
radicals of the strongest oxacids, when united with chlorine,
bromine, iodine, &c., do not combine with the chlorides *,
bromides, &c., of the metals of the alkalies and of the earths;
whilst the chloride and bromide of potassium combine easily
with those of magnesium, iron, and manganese ? Should then
the chloride of magnesium, or that of manganese, be a stronger
acid than the chloride of sulphur, or chloride of phosphorus?
How is it consistent with these ideas that we can obtain cry
stallized salts as well with as without water, of combination,
composed of chloride of calcium and of oxalate, or of acetate
of lime? Should the oxysalt be here the acid, or the base?
I  have now displayed to you, the considerations which have
    ided me, and which I think are not destitute of foundation.

culty of defining the terms acid, salt, and base, in any mode
consistent with his classification, they are not met by any facts
or reasoning in the much-esteemed letter of my illustrious
correspondent.      The impracticability of defining a salt, he
does not deny; and with great candour he admits that, in his
definition of acidity, he has not been consistent.   He concedes
that it would be   preferable to give the syllable, indicating the
electro-negative ingredient, the precedence, as nothing but
unwillingness to innovate prevented him from pursuing that
Course.
     He acknowledges that                as combustion,         in many instances,
takes place without the presence of oxygen, the application of
the word combustible, should not be confined to bodies which
are susceptible of oxydizement.
    My definition of acidity was as follows:—
   “When, of two substances capable of combining with each
other so as to form a tertium quid”, and having an ingredient
common to them both, one prefers the positive, the other the ne
gative pole of the voltaic series, we must deem the former an
acid, and the latter a base. Also all substances having a sour
taste, or which redden litmus, must be deemed acids, agreeably
to usage.”                               I
              This definition would now amend by leaving out
the last  sentence,   and substituting therefore, the following:
Also when any substance is capable of forming a tertium quid
with any acid or base agreeably to the preceding definition, it
must be considered as an acid in the one case, a base in the
other. The definition, thus amended, takes in the organic
acids and bases.      In the form in which it was at first pro
posed, it has not been alleged defective by Berzelius; but he
has striven to show an incongruity in the attributes of his
double salts, when contrasted with those resulting from the
union of some of the acids and bases of his amphigen class;
which incongruity             is,
                            his opinion,

184                       Dr. Hare            on certain points
he had endeavoured to establish.        I stated that I did not
deem it necessary to appeal to his excellent observations,
proving certain attributes of acidity to exist in one case, those
of alkalinity in the other.               I
                              alleged my definition to be founded
on the conviction that the property of affecting vegetable co
lours, on which that sagacious chemist lays so much stress,
has not, latterly, been deemed necessary in acids; and that
in bases it never was required.       As respects them, it only
served as a mean of subdivision between alkaline oxides and
other oxibases.                                              -
  I   am at a loss to discover in what part of my letter there
was   any  language which could convey the erroneous impres
sion, that, in defining acids and bases I proposed to overlook
properties, and to be regulated by attention to the number of
atoms in a compound.        Certainly nothing was more foreign
to my    thoughts.
    It is assumed by Berzelius that the saturation of the fluo
base of potassium by fluohydric acid, cannot be considered as
analogous to the saturation of the oxybase of potassium by
 sulphuric acid; because the resulting compound is to the taste
 in one case neutral, in the other sour. In reply I suggested
 that if the salidity of the biborates and bicarbonates was not
 to be questioned on account of their alkaline taste, nor that
of the protochloride of tin on account of          sourness,    was       its                  it

to be formed by the same radicals, with the other halogen
bodies, contrary to experience.            Chemistry makes us ac
quainted with many similar discordances.                How is it that
oxygen forms aériform compounds with an extremely fixed
body in the instance of carbon; while in that of phosphorus
or arsenic, both volatilizable, it forms acids which are com
paratively insusceptible of volatilization? Wherefore does not
hydrogen produce an acid with phosphorus       -        and arsenic, as

prussic acid, iron, and potassa.             As the prussic acid was
viewed at the same time as a          compound     of hydrogen and cy
 anogen, the ferroprussic acid was considered as a compound
 of cyanogen, hydrogen, and iron. According to Berzelius,
 the supposed ferroprussiate is a compound of a “protocyanure”
of iron, and a “cyanure of potassium;” each being a simple
haloid salt, and the aggregate a double “cyanure.” Agreeably
 to my nomenclature, the “protocyanure” of iron is considered
 as cyanoferrous acid, and the “cyanure” of potassium as a
cyanobase; the aggregate being a cyanoferrite of the cyano
 base of potassium, but designated briefly as a cyanoferrite of
 potassium.
     I infer that the “ferroprussic” acid is analogous in consti
 tution to the triple compound of fluorine, silicon and hydro
 gen, improperly called hydrofluosilicic acid; and that, consist
 ently with the hypothetical views under which the latter re
 ceived      its

June             Paper was in part read, entitled “Observations on
       8.—A       the minute structure of the higher forms of Polypi,
with observations on their classification.” By Arthur Farre, M.B.,
Lecturer on Comparative Anatomy at St. Bartholomew's Hospital.
Communicated by Richard Owen, Esq., F.R.S.
   June 15.-The reading of Dr. A. Farre's paper was resumed and
concluded.
   After a short account of the labours of preceding naturalists in
that department of zoology which comprises the various kinds of
polypes, and of the different characters on which they have founded
the classification of these animals, the author proceeds to the state
ment of his own observations on several species which had not
been previously investigated with sufficient minuteness and care.
Two of the species described he believes to be entirely new, and he
has accordingly given them the names of Bowerbankia densa, and
Lagenella repens.       The other species which are the subject of the
author's investigation, are Vesicularia spinosa, Walkeria cuscuta,
Alcyonidium diaphanum, Membranipora pilosa, and Notania lori
culata.
    He then discusses the principles on which the classification of
this tribe of zoophytes should be founded, and proposes on these
principles to give the name of Ciliobrachiata to the whole group of
polypes characterized by the possession of ciliated tentacula, and a
free alimentary canal with two orifices: this group again he divides
into two subordinate groups, namely, the Hydriform and the Acti
niform, or Zoanthiform polypes.       Under the title of Nudibrachiata
he proposes to comprehend                  all
                                  those polypes which partake       the                  of
nature  of  the hydra, and whose tentacula are unprovided with cilia,

had been ascertained by himself prior to these observations; the
results of which observations, together with other facts connected
with the physiology of insects, he subsequently communicated to
Dr. M. Hall.
   Since the time when the author has been engaged in the prose
cution of this inquiry, some observations on the same subject have
been published by Dr. Berthold, of Göttingen, who expresses it as
his opinion that insects ought not to be regarded as cold-blooded
animals, but who does not appear to have detected the existence
of a temperature higher than the surrounding medium in any indi
vidual insect. The author also notices the observations on this subject
made by Hansmann, Juch, Rengger, Dr. John Davy, and others,
some of whom have detected, while others have not observed, the
existence of an increased temperature in this class of animals. He
then gives a detailed account of the precautions to be taken for
ensuring accuracy in making observations of this kind; and remarks
that greater reliance is to be placed on those made on the external
than on the internal temperature of the animal, seeing that compa
rative results are          by
                        that can       obtained, and that the injury inflicted

                          mutilation very materially interferes with the

perature.
   After premising these introductory remarks, the author gives                                                            a

heat so generated bears definite relations to the habits, the locality,
and the energy of respiration in each respective species of insect.
Volant insects, he finds, have the highest temperature; and of these
the diurnal bear a higher temperature than the crepuscular; next
to these must be placed the diurnal terrestrial, and last of all the
nocturnal terrestrial species.
   In the next division of this paper the author considers the tem
perature of those insects which live in societies; and in particular of
the humble bee and the hive-bee. His observations are confirmatory
of many of those of Huber relating to the incubating habits of the
former of these species; and he has farther ascertained that during
the act of incubation the bees possess a voluntary power of genera
ting heat, whereby the temperature of their bodies is raised, appa
rently for the purpose of imparting warmth to the young in the
cells; that this process is accompanied by accelerated respiration;
and that the amount of heat evolved is proportional to the quantity of
air respired. The law established by Dr. Edwards in the case of
the young of mammiferous animals, namely, that they possess less
power of generating heat, and that for a certain time they are unable
to maintain their usual temperature, is shown by the author to be
equally applicable to the early stage of insect life, and also to the
perfect insect immediately after                 its
                                              development from the pupa.

of voltaic electricity conducted, or the force of the current, was a
function of a greater number of variables than had been previously
supposed. As the theory which he proposed for estimating the con
ducting powers of substances has been controverted by M. Lenz", he
has been induced to reconsider the subject, and finds reason to be
satisfied with the correctness of his former views. He farther finds
that with feeble magnetic needles the deflecting forces are not pro
portional to the force of the current, but approach nearer and nearer
to that proportion by increasing the magnetic power of the needles;
a result which the author thinks is strictly deducible from the uni
versal law of nature, that the attraction mutually exerted by two
bodies is measured by the sum of their masses.       He shows that the
formula of Ohm, expressive of the conducting powers of wires, and
of the resistances which they offer to currents of voltaic electricity,
is an approximation to the truth only in the case of feeble currents,
and that with the same metal, the conducting powers are not as the
lengths of the wires.
   The author next inquires into the relation between the heat de
veloped, which he finds to be, in the same wire, as the square of the
intensity of the current ; and in wires of the same diameter, and
conducting equal quantities of electricity, it is inversely as the con
ducting power, or directly as the resistance which they oppose to
the current. The facts he has adduced in this paper seem to be at
variance with the generally received theory of caloric, and to be in
perfect accordance with the undulatory theory.
   He concludes by describing an experiment confirming the views
he has elsewhere advanced with regard to the difference between the
physical, the physiological, and the chemical effects resulting from
the employment of coils formed of wires of different lengths, being
dependent on the time required by the conductor for returning to
its natural state.                 -

the names of Krohi, Tennik or Kennik, and Mallaye; the last of
these is more powerful than the other two, and is obtained from the
roots of the Tuba, the Perachi, the Kopah, and the Chey, and from that
of the shrub Mallaye, whence it derives         its
                                             name. The Krohi poison
is prepared from the root and bark        the Spoh tree, and the roots
                                           of

 Communicated by the Itight Hon. the Earl of Minto, G.C.B. F.R.S.
   The author of this memoir, considering that the practicability of
 a North-west Arctic passage must depend on the mean summer at
mospheric temperature of the most northern point of the continent of
America being above that at which the congelation of sea water takes
place, applies himself to the determination of these temperatures.
 The results of his calculations are given in a table, exhibiting the
extreme and the mean temperatures of the atmosphere for each of the
summer months, from May to September, at                     degrees     latitude,

   “Sequel to an Essay on the Constitution of the Atmosphere
published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1826+, with some ac
count of the Sulphurets of Lime;" by John Dalton, D.C.L., F.R.S.
   The author communicates in this paper an account of the inves
tigations on the constitution of the atmosphere, which have engaged
his attention during a long period of years. He enters into an ex
amination of the comparative advantages of the three methods which
are most in use for analysing common air, namely, firing it with hy
drogen in Volta's eudiometer, or abstracting the oxygen by means
of nitrous gas and quadrisulphuret of lime; and details the pre
cautions to be taken in the employment of each of these methods,
and the degree of accuracy to be expected from the results under dif.
ferent circumstances. He then relates numerous experiments made
on air obtained from great heights, from which he is led to the con
clusion that the proportion of oxygen to azote in the atmosphere on
the surface of the earth is not precisely the same at       places and                           all
times; and that      elevated regions this proportion
                            in                           somewhat less                      is

  The author verified, both at Liverpool and at London, the exist
ence of a fact similar to that which M. Daussy had ascertained at
Brest, namely, the rise of the ocean when the barometer is depressed;
and remarks that the correction due to changes in the atmospheric
pressure is by no means inconsiderable.      He suggests the question
whether the surface of the ocean rises in narrow seas simultaneously
with the depression of the barometer, or otherwise. With a view to
the solution of this question, he gives a tabular diagram showing the
correspondence between the calculated and the observed heights, in
their relation to the heights of the barometer at Liverpool and at
London, from which it would appear that the effect of changes in the
atmospheric pressure on the tide is immediate.

President of that Society.
   The material recommended by the author for the most economical,
as well as effectual method of constructing magnets, is cast iron,
which should be formed in small castings in the form of a horse-shoe,
each weighing about seven ounces; these he finds, on being touched
in the usual manner by a small compound magnet, received and re
tained the impregnation better than any which he had previously
constructed of steel.

imbedded, having only a slight attachment to the maxillary bone.
Their number is not readily ascertained, because the whole series are
not always apparent; but in two instances Mr. Bennett found 8 on
each side.     These teeth exist in adult Whales of both sexes, and
though not visible externally in the young Cachalots, may be seen
upon the removal of the soft parts from the interior of the jaw.
    “The eye of the Cachalot is small, and placed far back on the head,

almost obsolete, there being only faint indications of them on the
sides of the body.
   The most important distinction, however, exists in the teeth, the
present specimen possessing altogether four more molars than the
one brought before the notice of the Society on a previous occasion.
The entire number of teeth is 52, (26 in each jaw), and the 5 posterior
molars are placed closely together, differing in that respect from
those of the previously examined specimen.
   The animal was brought from Van Diemen's Land, and others
similar to it were observed scratching at the roots of trees, and
feeding upon the insects which are generally abundant in such situ
ations.    Their favourite haunts are stated to be the localities in
which the Port Jackson willow is most plentiful.
   Mr. Waterhouse remarked that although the differences between
the two animals were considerable, yet he did not consider the di

   March 22.—A paper “On the Ancient State of the North American
Continent;” by Thomas Roy, Esq., Civil Engineer, Toronto, Upper
Canada, and communicated by Charles Lyell, Esq., F.G.S., was read
in part.
   April 5. The reading of Mr. Roy's paper was concluded.
   The author having in the course of his professional duties, disco
vered in the lake district of Upper Canada terraces or level ridges
which agreed in elevation at considerable horizontal distances, he
was induced to extend his inquiries and to ascertain how far similar
phaenomena have been observed in other parts of North America,
what may have been the probable extent of the lake or sea by which
the ridges were formed,—and by what operations the waters were
drained off, leaving only the present detached Canadian lakes.
   With a view to ascertain the probable extent of the sea, Mr. Roy
traced upwards from Lake Ontario the successive ridges or terraces",
and ascertained that their greatest height was 762 feet above the
lake, or 996 feet above the ocean ; he therefore assumed, that the
boundary of the ancient sea must have had an elevation of at least
 1000 feet, and in consequence, that it must have been formed on the
west by the rocks and mountains ranging from the table-land of
Mexico to the parallel of 47° of latitude; on the north by the barrier
which separates the head-waters of the lakes from those of the Arctic
rivers, and extending to Cape Tourmente below Quebec; on the east
by the hills stretching through the United States to the Gulf of
Mexico; and on the south by a mountain ridge which has been de
stroyed. The area thus circumscribed is calculated to be 960,000
square miles.
   The chief geological feature connected with Mr. Roy's observations
   * These parallel ridges were exhibited on a section extending obliquely
from the mouth of the Niagara to the south of Lake Ontario, and over the
ridge north of that lake, to Lake Simcoe.

and described in the paper, is the high land which separates Lake
Ontario from Lake Simcoe. The distance between these bodies of
water is 42 miles, and the greatest elevation of the ridge is 762 feet
above Lake Ontario, or 282 above lake Simcoe.                    The lowest visible
formation is a stratified blue      clay  which effervesces freely and is of un
known     depth.     Above this are immense masses of clay, sometimes re
sembling fuller's earth, and sand most irregularly associated. The cen

    latter extends from 15 to 20 miles to the east along the north side
    of the Tmolus range; but in Mount Corax the limestone is com
    monly absent, and schistose rocks prevail, in some places yellowish
    and friable, in others dark-coloured and compact ; a fine-grained
     quartzose conglomerate also occurs.
        2. The tertiary lacustrine limestone on the south side of the bay
    forms a table-land extending south from Smyrna about 15 miles. It
    consists of whitish limestone in horizontal beds containing nodules
    and layers of quartz resinite. Planorbes and paludinae abound at cer
    tain points, but are not generally diffused. Greenish marls alternate
    with the limestone, and prevail in the central parts of the area where
    they contain beds of rolled gravel of nummulitic limestone, schist,
    and red trachyte. Conglomerate beds also prevail around the margin.
       3. A vast mass of trachyte appears near Smyrna, and from thence
    to spread over the lacustrine beds. It consists chiefly of reddish
    porphyritic trachyte, in some places stratified on a small scale. A
    breccia of fragments of blackish trachyte in a red paste is also fre
    quent. The aqueous and igneous rocks do not alternate; the lacus
    trine beds do not contain igneous materials, and no dikes are observed.
    On the south side the trachyte overlies the lacustrine formation like
    a lava coulée, the uppermost bed of the latter in contact with the
    trachyte being a conglomerate of hippurite limestone and schist with
    no traces of igneous matter.
       Mount Pagus, south of Smyrna, is chiefly trachyte overlying the
    lacustrine beds, which crop out on the north side and dip towards
    the centre of the hill, consisting of sandy strata with vegetable re
    mains and shells of helix and unio, and between them and the tra
    chyte is the limestone conglomerate.     At the north-east foot of the
    hill is a small isolated mass of yellowish schist and hipperite lime
    stone about an acre in extent.
       The north side of Smyrna bay presents appearances analogous to
    those on the south. The grey hippurite limestone of Mount Sipylus
    is accompanied as at Mount Tartali by black and greenish schists.
º   The lacustrine deposits are overlaid by a great mass of trachyte
    which forms the lofty mountain of Cordileon.      The relation of the
    lacustrine beds to the grey hippurite limestone is well exposed in a
    ravine north of Bournabat ; and a few yards further north they con
    tain beautiful impressions of leaves referred to the genera Laurus,
    Nerium, Olea, Salix, Quercus, and Tamarix ; also shells of Cyclas,
    Paludina, Planorbis, and Cypris.      In ascending hence to the west
    the lacustrine marls are surmounted by non-volcanic conglomerate,
    identical with that of Mount Pagus. Above this are beds of tufaceous
    conglomerate, and at the top the brown trachyte of Cordileon, resem
    bling that near Smyrna, and like it sometimes laminated, but pre
    senting little variety except in a long ridge opposite Smyrna which
    consists of whitish decomposed earthy trachyte.

     Mr. Fox admits that the non-mechanical deposits in mineral veins
 may be due, in part, to infiltration from the enclosing rocks; but it
 appears to him, that such deposits might have been derived in almost
 indefinite quantities, by the circulation or ascension of currents of
 heated water from the deeper parts of the original fissures. He says,
that water in this state possesses very great powers as a solvent, and
would therefore become highly charged with earthy and metallic salts;
but that in ascending it would lose                       its
                                                 temperature, and consequently

 plane of the occipital region of the skull, the same arguments might
 be advanced for referring the Torodon to the mammiferous group
 containing the Dugong, as have been recently urged in reference to
 the Dinotherium, but the existence of air-cells or sinuses in the su
 perior parietes of the cranium in the Torodon, show that the cranial
 characters above alluded to, are not conclusive as to the cetaceous
 nature of an extinct mammal.
    The general conclusions respecting the affinities which the Torodon
 bears to existing orders of mammalia, so far as opinions can be
 formed from the portion of the skeleton preserved, are summed up
 by the author as follows:
    So far as dental characters have weight, the Torodon must be re
 ferred to the rodent order ; but from this order it deviates in the
 relative position of the supernumerary incisors, and in the number
 and direction of the curvature of the molars.
    It again deviates in the transverse direction of the joint of the
 lower jaw, and in the relative position of the glenoid cavities and
 zygomatic arches.      In the aspect of the plane of the occipital fora
 men, and occipital region of the skull, in the form and position of
 the occipital condyles,     the aspect of the plane of the bony aper
 ture of the nostrils, and in the thickness and texture of the osseous
 parietes of the skull, the Torodon deviates both from the Rodentia
 and existing Pachydermata, and manifests an affinity to the Dino
 therium and the Cetaceous order.
    The author observes, however, that the development of the nasal
 cavity and the presence of frontal sinuses, render it extremely im
probable that the habits of the Torodon were so exclusively aquatic
as would result from the total absence of hinder extremities, and
 concludes, therefore, that it is a quadruped, and not a Cetacean; and
 that it manifests an additional step in the gradation of mammiferous
 forms leading from the Rodentia, through the Pachydermata to the
 Cetacea; a gradation of which the water-hog of South America
(Hydrochaerus Capybara) already indicates the commencement amongst
 existing Rodentia, of which order, it is interesting to observe, that
 this species is the largest, while at the same time it is peculiar to the
continent in which the remains of the gigantic Torodon were dis
covered".
    May 3.-A paper was first read, entitled “A Sketch of the Depo
sits containing extinct Mammalia in the neighbourhood of the Plata;"
by Charles Darwin, Esq., F.G.S.
    Mr. Darwin premised his account of the geological features of the
district in which the remains of the Torodon, described at the meet
ing on the 19th of April by Mr. Owen, as above, were found, by re
marking that as the other mammalia and the fossil shells had not yet
been accurately examined, the notice was necessarily imperfect.

            containing extinct Mammalia near the Plata.               207
     To the westward and southward of the great estuary of La Plata,
extend those level and almost boundless plains which are known by
the name of the Pampas. Their geological constitution over many
hundred square miles does not vary. . It consists of a reddish argil
laceous earth, which generally contains irregular concretions of a white
aluminous limestone, or indurated marl, often passing irregularly into
a compact calcareous stone, traversed by small linear cavities,        si
milar to those which occur in many of the freshwater limestones of
Europe.        In the province of Entre Rios, the formation which
composes the surface of the Pampas overlies and passes into a
series of beds of sand, clay, and crystalline cellular limestone ;
containing sharks' teeth, gigantic oysters, and other shells belong
ing to the genera arca, venus and pecten. These shells, with the
 exception of the oyster, have a general resemblance to existing
species. To the northward and eastward of the Plata, the province
 of Banda Oriental, though very low and level, consists of gneiss,
 granite and primary slate. These rocks are generally concealed by a
 considerable thickness of a reddish earth, which, though at first sight
 like ordinary detritus, belongs to the same formation with that
 composing the Pampas.        This deposit, extending over so wide an
 area on both sides of the   Plata, abounds with very numerous remains
 of various extinct    mammalia;     among which the Torodon, Mega
 therium, Mastodon, an animal covered with an armadillo-like case, and
 as Mr. Darwin believes, the horse, co-existed in the same district.
     Proofs of the elevation of the land within a recent period, occur in
 several parts. Mr. Darwin stated that he had seen in the possession
 of Sir W. Parish, marine shells which occur near Buenos Ayres in
 great beds, elevated several yards above the level of the river; and
  these same species the author had found living on the mud banks on
  another part of the coast. He, therefore, inferred, that at no very
  remote period a great bay occupied the area both of the Pampas and
  of the lower parts of Banda Oriental; and that into this bay the
  several rivers, which now unite to form the Plata, poured down red
  dish sediment, resulting, as at the present day, from the decompo
  sition of the granites of Brazil, and charged with carbonate and sul
  phate of lime, perhaps derived from the Cordillera. On the cliff-formed
  shores of Entre Rios, the line can be distinguished where the estuary
  mud first encroached on the deposits of the ocean. The author also
  supposed that the ancient rivers, like those of the present day, car
  ried down the carcases of land animals, which thus became entombed
  in the accumulating sediment. Since that period, by the gradual
  rising of the land, the bottom of the great bay has been converted
   into plains, almost as level as the surface of the former sea; and the
  rivers now hollowing out courses for themselves, have exposed, in many
   places, the skeletons of those ancient inhabitants of the neighbouring
   land.
      Mr. Darwin then briefly alluded to a small formation of mud and
   shingle at Bahia Blanca, some hundred miles south of the Plata, in
   which the remains of several extinct quadrupeds have been dis
   covered. Amongst these he enumerated the Megatherium Cuvieri, the

remains perhaps of a smaller species of Megatherium; a quadruped
closely allied to the armadilloes, but nearly as large as a horse; some
small rodents, and other animals. These remains are embedded with
one species of terrestrial, and several of marine shells, the latter
being identical with some existing in the adjoining bay. It                   there                               is,
fore, certain that the greater number               the above mammalia found of
at  Bahia Blanca lived within             very recent epoch; and from the po

remains            animal which Mr. Owen says has

or scaglia, occasionally more or less crystalline, which forms the
principal rock of the Ionian islands.           It is generally without fossils,
but near     Argostoli   contains numerous organic remains, principally
small  spiral   univalves;  and near the middle of this vast formation are
two beds of oyster shells, about a foot thick each, and parallel to the
stratification which dips to the north-east at an angle of 25".
   The tertiary formation extends for two or three miles to the north
and south of Lixouri, forming several parallel lines of hills, sloping to
the east according to the dip of the strata, and presenting a suc
cession of steep escarpments toward the west. The beds are all
conformable, dipping a few degrees to the north of east by compass,
at an angle varying from 45° to 55°. These beds are remarkable
for their great thickness, the beauty and number of their fossils; and
for the variety of strata through which they extend. The beds, of
which sixteen are enumerated, may be classed under three principal
heads.     First, the calcareo-arenaceous; second, the argillaceous;
third, the gypseous beds. Of these, the first is a loose sandy alluvium,
rising very gradually from the sea side, and resting unconformably
upon the other beds which are conformable. The fossils belong to
numerous genera; and some of the species have been identified with
those at present existing in the Mediterranean.

    On the south bank of the Seine, though the cliffs appear similar,
yet in consequence of a fault the lower argillaceous bed which covers
 the ferruginous sand has been brought down to the level of the shore;
 and has led to the error that the argillaceous beds on the two shores
 were of the same age; and that the argile d'Honfleur, like that on the
 north bank, was identical with the Kimmeridge clay, though it ac
 tually overlies the iron sand.
    Beyond Honfleur a marshy plain succeeds, composed to the depth
of two feet of a marl containing such freshwater shells as Lymnaea,
Cyclas, Planorbis, &c. At Cricque-boeuf a bed of clay, similar to that
at Havre, rises to the surface, covered by a few inches of the green
and ferruginous sands; and as the characteristic shells are found in

   Iodate of Brucia.-Iodic acid combines directly with brucia; if the
acid be in excess a red colour appears, but otherwise it is colourless.
By evaporating the solution two salts are obtained: one, which is
opaque and silky, with excess of base, and which restores the colour
of litmus reddened by an acid; the other is transparent, hard, and
in four-sided prisms, this reddens litmus paper. The subsalt has such
a disposition to form that it may frequently be obtained in crystals,
even from a solution which is slightly acid.
   Hydriodate of Brucia-This salt may be obtained by directly
treating brucia with hydriodic acid; it has a different appearance
from hydriodate of strychnia, the crystals are transparent square la
minae or short four-sided prisms.      Though slightly soluble in cold
water, it is more so than hydriodate of strychnia; hot water dissolves
more than cold, and crystals are obtained on cooling.       It is more
soluble in alcohol than in water. Hydriodate of brucia may be pre
pared by double decomposition by adding hydriodate of potash to
sulphate of brucia.    It is a subsesquihydriodate, composed of

   A mixture of equal parts of iodine and morphia totally dissolved

 neous  evaporation     a red brown substance as the alcohol was dissi

liquor, which when poured off and set to evaporate in another vessel,
yielded crystals of hydriodate of morphia deeply coloured with
iodine.    Various means were tried to determine the nature of the
red brown substance, but it never yielded morphia when a sufficient
quantity of iodine had been employed.            When treated with sul
phuretted hydrogen in order to convert the iodine into hydriodic
acid, and obtain an hydriodate from which the morphia or the sub

of altered morphia with iodine and iodic acid. The facts stated by
Serullas are important; the action of iodine upon morphia supplies
an excellent method of ascertaining the presence of the smallest
trace of morphia, and vice versá, of detecting iodine in the state of
iodic acid.                         -
   M. Pelletier adds, that when iodic acid is put in contact with
morphia, the first effect is that of reducing the iodic acid. The
oxygen of the acid acts upon the elements of the morphia, probably
upon       its
          hydrogen; hence the formation         the rose-coloured sub          of

    The hydrobromate of carbohydrogen discovered by M. Bonnet
 is a colourless and extremely volatile liquid of an agreeable and pe
 netrating odour. Although water causes a precipitate in a solution
 of it in pyroxylic spirit, yet a considerable quantity is retained in so
 lution; it is also soluble in alcohol and aether, from which it is preci
 pitated by water. It is decomposed by heat. The constitution of
 this compound is represented by the formula Brº Hº, C*H*,-

     By boiling camphoric with sulphuric or hydrochloric acid and
  alcohol, a bitter substance of the consistence of syrup is obtained,
  which is insoluble in water, but dissolves in alkalis, from which it is
  precipitated by acids; it is also soluble in alcohol. This substance,
 after having remained some days in vacuo, afforded the following
  composition: C* Hºo Os, which gives the formula (C-9 His O' + Cº
  H O + OH), A.
     If camphoric acid be represented by the formula C* H. O'+OH,
  the formula A will be equal to two equivalents of camphoric acid,
 each deprived of an equivalent of water, and replaced by one equivalent
  of aether and one of water, which is the exact composition of the
 vinic acids. When this substance, camphovinic acid, is distilled in a
 glass retort over a lamp, there are produced a butyraceous sub
 stance, inflammable carburetted hydrogen gas, and a carbonaceous
  residue. The butyraceous matter treated with boiling alcohol and
 the solution gradually cooled, crystals of an extraordinary length
 are obtained possessing neither taste nor smell. The crystals are
 perfectly neutral, fusing and volatilizing without undergoing de
 composition, and combining, notwithstanding their neutrality, with
 bases, forming crystallized salts.         They possess a great number of
 characteristics, both physical and chemical, which completely di
 stinguish them from camphoric acid.
     The crystals are composed of C* H7 O°, and this formula is com
 pletely confirmed by the analysis of the compounds of this crystal
 line body with the oxides of copper and silver; so it may be consi
 dered as camphoric acid minus an equivalent of water.            But these
 crystals, although not possessing an acid re-action, are nevertheless
 an acid, forming aether by the combined action of alcohol and a
 strong [mineral] acid, and producing the same vinic acid which is
 produced by crystallized camphoric acid; this also is a proof that
 crystallized camphoric acid, C*H* O', contains an equivalent of
water, which it parts with when combining with certain bases. What
 follows confirms this opinion.
    The alcoholic mother liquors from which the anhydrous cam
phoric acid is precipitated, treated with water, afford a dense oily
product, which boiled for a few minutes with a little potash
becomes very fluid.           This has a singular odour, a disagreeable
taste, and volatilizes without decomposition.
    The composition of this substance, according to experiments, is
C* Hº Oi, corresponding with camphoric aether C* Hi Os +
C*H* O. . In whatever way this ather is obtained, whether by
crystallized camphoric acid or by anhydrous acid, it appears that
in the process of aetherification the common camphoric acid parts
with an equivalent of water and becomes anhydrous, consequently
the formula is C20 H7 O'+OH, and that when it enters into com
bination it loses an equivalent of water, as in the following formulae:
       Common camphoric acid            = C-0 Hz  O3+H O.
       Anhydrous    . . . . . . . . . . = C20 Hz  O3.

                           GIGANTIC CARP.
   In the Proceedings of the Zoological Society for Nov. 8, 1836,
inserted in our number for June last, (Lond. and Edinb. Phil. Mag.,
vol. x. p. 481.) is recorded the exhibition of a Carp weighing 22
pounds, which had been taken in a piece of water called the Mere,
near Payne's Hill, in Surrey. It is also stated that “Mr. Yarrell ob
served, that he could find no record of any Carp so large having be
fore been taken in this country.” On this account the following notice
which I have just now accidentally met with may be worth citing.
   In the “Historical Chronicle” of the Gentleman's Magazine for
September, 1771, (vol. xli. p. 424), it is related, under the head of
Monday, [Sept.] 30, that “A carp, weighing 23 pounds, was lately
caught in a pond belonging to Sir John Filmour [Filmer], at East
Sutton, in Kent.” This Carp seems to have been the largest speci
men on record; for Mr. Yarrell, in his History of British Fishes,
(vol. i. p. 309,) notices a brace weighing 35 pounds, and two single
fish weighing 18 and 19% pounds respectively, as the largest which
he could then refer to.
   The above, like most of the relations in that department of the
Gentleman's Magazine, is probably newspaper intelligence.          The
circumstance does not appear to be mentioned in either edition of
Hasted's History of Kent.                               E.  ww - B

           Experiments made at Bermuda, per quantity.
   Experiment I. Sept. 25th. A glass receiver of 3920 cubic
inches, = 15.5 gallons, was taken to the north side of the
island beyond any building. Wind north; day fine; thermo
meter 79°. Into this, after well washing with rain water and
collecting the air, were put 1500 grain measures of lime-water.
The receiver was then well closed with a cork, and set aside.
   Sept. 24,    4   P.M.; therm. 82°. Some of the lime-water
used was tested: 1500 lime-water taking 410 test sulphuric
acid, the liquid     would be 1:009 test.   It took 330 to saturate

but the lime-waters but 210 for neutralization.          Wind strong

    Sept. 28th.    The lime-waters from the receivers took 120
grain measures for neutralization, leaving 90 for carbonic
acid gas; a very nearly similar result as before.
    Experiment 3. Oct. 2nd, at 5 P.M.; wind S.W. at the
cessation of a heavy gale, with much rain; therm. 78°, barom.

    Receiver and acid as before. Lime-water required 390 mea
sures for neutralization.     Tested that in receivers at 5 P.M. of
the 8th inst.; therm. 75°. This required 210 measures of
the acid for neutralization, leaving 180 for carbonic acid, being
double that before, or about 1 in 3920.

E. through SE.    to S.; in the southern, the equatorial current,
appearing   as a north wind, will change the polar current,
grown more or less easterly from E. through NE. to N.
   In the parallel D    D, of the northern hemisphere, the va

   Air which flows from the equator towards the poles comes
from   places having greater velocity of rotation to places
which move more slowly towards east.     Hence follows:
   3. In the northern hemisphere a southerly wind in gra

more westerly.

   From the whole of the phaenomena observed, the following,
       ‘.
consequently, is the result:
   A.       the northern hemisphere the wind turns, if polar
         currents and equatorial currents take place alternately,
         upon an average in a direction S. W. N. E. S. through
         the points of the compass, and it springs back between
         S. and W. and between N. and E. more frequently
         than between W. and N. and between E. and S.
   B. In the southern hemisphere the wind turns, if polar cur
         rents and equatorial currents take place alternately,
         upon an average in a direction S. E. N. W. S. through
         the points of the compass, and springs back between
         N. and W. and between S. and E. more frequently
         than between W. and S. and between E. and N.
Hence follows:
   a. Where in the tropical zone only polar currents prevail
         on the surface, there is no complete rotation, but an
         unchanged deviation proportional to the distance of the
         place .# observation from the outward limits of the
         current, which is only modified a little by the variation
         of that limit in the seasons. These are the trade-winds.
   b. Where in the tropical zone, by the peculiar distribution
         of the solid and fluid, a southerly current alternates once
         a year with a northerly one, there is only one rotation
         in the whole year.      These are the monsoons.
   c. In the temperate, and probably also in the frigid zones,
         where equatorial currents continually alternate with
         polar currents, the wind changes upon an equal average
         and more frequently in a fixed direction through the
         points of the compass, but in the northern hemisphere
         exactly in an opposite direction to that in the southern.
                                             I
          This is the phaenomenon which have denominated the
         law of rotation.
   It is evident then that the relations of the tropical winds
are the most simple case of the law of rotation.
   The preceding discussion does not depend on the origin
of the motion of the mass of air contained between the observed
parallels, whether we suppose it to be contemporaneous in all

arising in the north or the south are opposed to each other,
or whether they are more or less beneath one another, and
inclined towards the meridian.   For that very reason I con
sider the names northerly and southerly currents to be the
most conformable to nature, as making their names independ
ent of the variations which the seasons and local causes                                may
produce in their direction.
   The trade-winds and monsoons are a phaenomenon so mani
fest, that it is not necessary to prove their existence.               It is
otherwise with the law of rotation.

do not follow the same rule in this hemisphere as in the north

from north to north-east, to east, to south-east, to south, &c.:
in the southern hemisphere, on the contrary, they move in an
opposite direction; the hurricanes, the tempests and the gusts

  “According to an English captain of an East Indiaman, the
dominant winds from the parallel of 30° N. to the frigid
zone are in this sea from the west or WSW.             He re
marked that a   great  north or north-west wind which ends
with a calm is followed by a south wind, which brings rain,
and which acquiring much force ranges to the west and
NW, or N.       Ifthese latter winds become violent they turn
sometimes to NE. and blow for several days together, or end
in a calm to be followed by a south wind.     If this latter is
rather westerly it is accompanied with rainy weather and
squalls, and often comes back to the south with rain.”

     “How exceedingly changeable are the    winds in Germany
yet   I have remarked a kind of periodical  movement in them,
which is as follows. I suppose the wind to blow from the south,
with a clear sky. The barometer falls, the weather becomes
thick, rain follows.   In the mean time the wind becomes
westerly.   The rain still continues, and the barometer rises.
The wind changes to the NW. Partial rain ensues. It grows
colder. The barometer still rises, and the wind becomes N.
and NE.     The barometer is now at the highest point, the sky
is serene, and the severest cold possible in the season prevails.
The wind veers to the E. and the barometer falls a little,
but the weather as yet remains clear. The wind veers to the
SE., the barometer still falls, the warmth increases again.
The wind then changes to the S., and the warmth reaches the
highest degree agreeable to the season; the barometer falls,
and we come back again to the first point. There are annually
several such periods in every season.        Sometimes it will take
several weeks to complete this rotation of the wind through the
whole compass, sometimes but a few days. The wind will
very rarely change in a direction contrary to that above men
tioned.     In general all  changes from the left     the right

has founded meteoromantic rules upon the supposed correct
ness   ofthis law, and in his “Contributions     Atmospherology”

(namely those motions of the barometer calculated by me in
Paris, from the law of rotation for hydrometeors,) take place
in other countries during rain. I have,” says Dr. Kämtzt,
“brought together in a similar manner the calculations of Ni
cander in Stockholm.     Of three observations out of nineteen,
made between 2 and 9    o'clock, I have taken as a basis for the
comparison the wind which blew about 2 o'clock.        The fol

   “On  the day before and during the rain, the barometer sinks
with easterly, rises with westerly winds, just as Dove has de

   13. North America.     In the State of Missouri, the wind in
constant repetition traverses within from ten to twenty days
every quarter of the horizon, and always in the following order,
going from E. through S. to W., and through N. toward E.

served a completely opposite course.

averages, but not examined the rise and fall.

 XXVIII.        Memoranda on the Origin of the Botanical Alliances.
    By Sir Edw. FF. BROMHEAD, Bart., M.A., F.R.S. L. & E.”
       GARDH         mentions Batsch as the first writer who at
        tempted to form alliances on a sound principle, though
 unsuccessfully;       and Dr. Lindley justly notices “Agardhii
 opera aestumatissima Bartlingiique, qui viam ad meliores res
aperuere.”        Agardh's work and a selection of others, which
 I   in vain endeavoured to procure from the Continent, Dr.
 Lindley most kindly forwarded to me from his own library.
 By this   I have been enabled     to institute a comparison with the
 alliances   proposed     by  botanists of every school, a test very
 useful in confirming sound assemblages, ascertaining their
 true limits, and developing the ground of their formation.
 Such a reference is moreover a necessary act of justice to the
 founders.
     Us NEALEs.-These are the Rhizophyta or Sporidiaceae of
 Rudolphi: “Sporangia spuria vel nulla, sporidia substantiae vel
 superficiei immersa, cotyledonidia nulla.”           Linnaeus doubted
 whether the Fungi should form part of the series in an arrange
 ment of plants. They have been made sufficiently numerous
 to form one or more distinct alliances; some have represented
 them as passing into Lichens, others as passing into Algae.
     UsNEosF are nearly the Sporidiferae of Agardh, and the
 Fungales of Dr. Lindley.
     JUNGERMANNIALEs.- These are the Musci (hepatici and
frondosi) of Hedwig, who omits Riccia. They are the Foliaceae
 of De Candolle, the Musci of Bartling, and the Muscales of
 Dr. Lindley.
    JUNGERMANNIos E are nearly Dr. Lindley's second section
 of Acrogens.
     Lycopodiales.—The Tetradidymae of Wahlenbergh, found
ed “quaternatá dispositione sporarum,” add to this alliance
 Ophioglossaceae, and doubtfully Equisetaceae.             Agardh ex
cluded the      latter;  Dr.  Lindley  excluded also the former from
his Lycopodales.         Lepidodendrum      is now added: there can
not be any reason why extinct genera should be overlooked in
 botany more than in other branches           of natural history.   All
                        • Communicated  by the Author.

248           Sir Edw. Ff. Bromhead's Memoranda
the great transitions in nature are through small families, in
which the structure seems to want breadth, or what mechani
cians would call stable equilibrium.      A   series of monographs
of the families and tribes, which are limited to a few species,
would be an important acquisition to science.
    Lycopodios/E correspond with Dr. Lindley's first section
of Acrogens.
    CUPREssaLEs.-These are the original Coniferae of Lin
naeus,   if we exclude Ephedra and Liquidambar.
    CUPREssos F.—These are nearly the Lepidanthae acerosac
of Shultz; or the Gymnosperms of Dr. Lindley's System.
 Horaninow, an acute Russian naturalist, includes the Lyco
podial and Osmundal unions with Lichens under the name
of Sporophorae: “Synorrhizis sporae conglutinantur ad embry
onem producendum,        ipsis innatum.”
     BETULALEs.-These are nearly the Amentaceae of Linnaeus,
 who however placed Liquidambar among Coniferae, and
 added to this alliance Myricaceae, Platanaceae, and Pistacia.
 Herman notices this form of inflorescence under the name of
 Juliferae.
       ETULos AE.-This formation perhaps more accurately re
 presents the Amentaceae of Linnaeus. The Lepidantha, foliosae
 of Shultz nearly coincide. The Micranthae of Agardh indi
 cate a property important in this part of the system.
     RHAMNALEs.-The Rhamnales of Dr. Lindley consist of
  Rhamnaceae, Chailletiaceae, Tremandraceae, Nitrariaceae, Bur
 seraceae.    Reichenbach includes several Rhamnales among
 his Variflorae Parviflorae.
     Euphor BIAles.— The Tricocca of Bartling are Stack
 houseae, Euphorbiaceae, Empetreae, Bruniaceae, Rhamneae,
  Aquifoliaceae (Brexia), Pittosporeae, Celastrinae, Hippocra
 teaceae, Staphyleaceae.     The Euphorbiales of Dr. Lindley are
  Euphorbiaceae, Empetraceae, Stackhousiaceae, Fouquieraceae,
  Celastraceae    (Hippocrateac),   Staphyleaceae,     Malpighiaceae
  (Erythroxyleae).     The   Discigyna  Trihilatae of Agardh con
  tain  many   unarranged   Rhamnales,   Euphorbiales, and Æscu
  lales: calyx basi monophyllus, stamina definita discigena,
  carpellis subconnatis subternis.
     AEsculales.—The Malpighinae of Bartling are Malpighi
  aceae, Acerineae, Coriarieae, Erythroxyleae, Sapindaceae, Hip
  pocastaneae, Rhizoboleae, Tropaeoleae.         The calycose struc
  ture of the Nixus appears here.
      HYPERicALEs.—The Guttales of Dr. Lindley's Calycosae
  are Clusiaceae (Canelleae), Rhizobolaceae, Marcgraaviaceae,
   Hypericaceae, Ochranthaceae.
      LIMONIALEs.-The Meliales of Lindley are Meliaceae,

              on the Origin of the Botanical Alliances.        249
  Cedrelaceae,   Humiriaceae,   Aurantiaceae, Spondiaceae.    The
 Aurantiflorae of Reichenbach embrace several unarranged
  Hypericales and Limoniales, to which he adds Linaceae and
 Leeaceae.     The “Carpophyta, Thalamantheat " of Rudolphi
 embrace    unarranged    the families from Hippocratea to     Li
 moniaceae, both inclusive, to which he adds Ampelideae,      Dil
 leniaceae, Magnoliaceae, and Anonaceae.
  º
    FABALEs.—The Legumina of Caesalpinus, or the Leguminosae
 of Morison and Ray, must be considered the basis of this       al
 liance; but they separated the herbaceous and woody plants.
          united them.
      ABos/E.-The Calophyta of Bartling include, among others,
 Rosales and Leguminosae; Dr. Lindley unites these under
 his Rosales with Connaraceae and Calycanthaceae.
    Violales.   –   The Violales of Dr. Lindley, are Violaceae
(Sauvagesiae), Samydaceae, Moringaceae, Droseraceae, Fran
keniaceae.—Decandolle used the parietal structure as a means
of classification. Dr. Lindley improved upon Agardh's Wal
vispora, and introduced the true distinctions.
    Passiflorales.—The Passionales of Dr. Lindley contain
 Passifloraceae, Papayaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Pangiaceae, Ma
lesherbiaceae, Turneraceae.
    PAssiflorosje.—The Peponiferae of Bartling are Samydeae,
 Homalineae, Passifloreae, Turneraceae, Loaseae, Cucurbitaceae,
Grossularieae, Nopaleae.
    PortulacALEs.-The Succulentae of Agardh are Melocac
taceae, Crassulaceae, Mesembryanthaceae, Portulacaceae.
    ELEAGNALEs.-The Proteinae of Bartling are Laurineae,
Santalaceae, Elaeagneae, Thymelaeae, Proteaceae.      Dr. Lindley
brought Penaeaceae into this neighbourhood.         They are part
of the miscellaneous Rigidifoliae of Reichenbach.
    AcANTHos/E.-The true Monopetalae begin here ; they seem
to have been founded by Ray. Bartling's grouping of them
is masterly, though the interior arrangements are not satis
factory.
    LAMIALEs.-These are the Labiales of Dr. Lindley. Dr.
Brown formed Verbenaceae-Lamiaceae into a class. Arnott
unites Selaginaceae-Myoporaceae-Verbenaceae.
    LAMios4.—These are the DiscigynaeMonopetalae of Agardh,
who adds Pedaliaceae: “fructu subtetraspermo; caryopses, vel
capsula tetrasperma disco affixa.” They are the Nucamentosae
of Dr. Lindley.
    RHINANTHALEs.     –   These are the Scrophularineae of Dr.
Brown, if we add Orobanchaceae, and omit Digitaleae, &c.
The Labiatiflorae of Bartling embrace unarranged the whole
Lamial union, if we add Oleaceae and Jasminaceae, and if
    Third Series. Vol. 11. No. 67. Sept. 1837.          2 K

 250             Sir Edw. Ff. Bromhead's Memoranda
we omit Verbasceae-Digitaleae. The Personatae of Dr. Lind
ley's Nixus took the same range.
     ERICALEs.—These are the Ericineae of Richard and Bartling;
the Ericales of the Nixus.       They are part of Agardh’s mis
cellaneous Aridifoliae: “ folia coriacea, calyx saspe coriaceus.”
     CAMPANULALEs.-These         are nearly the Campanulaceae of
 Jussieu and Richard.    They   are the Campanulaceae of Agardh.
     CYNARALEs.-The Subaggregatae of Agardh include Cam
 panulales and Cynarales, but he omits Plantaginaceae, and
 adds Nyctaginaceae with the tribe Staticineae. The Aggre
gosae of Dr. Lindley are Calyceraceae, Compositae, Dipsaceae,
 Valerianaceae, Brunoniaceae, Plantaginaceae, Globulariaceae,
 Salvadoraceae, Plumbaginaceae.
     MyRs1NALEs.—These are the Primulales of Dr. Lindley, if
 we add Brexiaceae and Pittosporaceae: he places Brexiaceae
 near them, and mentions the affinity.           The Sapotaceae of
 Reichenbach contain    Oleinae,  Styraceae  (Humiria), Trientaleae,
 Myrsineae, Olacinae (? Millingtonia),        Asterantheae, Aqui
 foliaceae (Brexia), Mimusopeae.
     RUTALEs.—These are the Rutaceae of Ad. de Jussieu, if
 we add Ochnaceae.      The Discigynae Polypetalae Gynobaseae of
 Agardh are Rutales with Geraniaceae, the other Geraniales
 being scattered in three or four classes: “Stamina disco inserta,
 stylus saepe in Gynobasin dilatatus, carpella quina, saepe libera
 vel apice lobata, subconnata.”       They are the Rutales of Dr.
 Lindley.    They form the first six families of Bartling's Tere
binthinae; he relies much on the double pericarp here and
elsewhere in the Usneaceous or woody race.
     RUTosze.-These are the Gynobaseosae of Dr. Lindley, who
adds Coriariaceae.
     MALVALEs.--Dr. Brown must be considered the founder
of this alliance; he first brought into notice the valvate aesti
vation.    The Columniferae of Agardh are Chlenaceae, Tiliaceae
 (Elaeocarpeae), Buttneriaceae, Bombaceae, Malvaceae: “sta
minibus stylo adpressis, inaequalibus; styli plures, saepe coa
liti; folia Iobata.” The Malvales of Dr. Lindley are Stercu
liaceae,   Malvaceae, Elaeocarpaceae,       Dipteraceae, Tiliaceae,
Lythraceae.
    LAURALEs.-These are nearly the Lauri of Jussieu. The
Laureales of Dr. Lindley are Lauraceae, Illigeraceae, Cassy
thaceae.
    MAGNoLIALEs.-The whole of the Magnoliales stood to
gether in Dr. Lindley's first edition of his “Natural Sy
stem.” He has noticed the woody habit in this neighbourhood;
his Amonales     are Myristicaceae,     Magnoliaceae,   Anonaceae,
Schizandreae, Dilleniaceae.

                                                                            251
              on the Origin   of the Botanical Alliances.
   MAGNoLios E.-This formation perhaps gives the correct
limits of Dr. Lindley's important Albuminosae.
   MENIsPERMos4.—Linnaeus was obviously acquainted with
both the transitions to the Monocotyledons.
    AsPARAGALEs.-The Phylloacroblasta                      Liliaceae   of Reich
enbach       are Juncaceae (Junceae, Triglochinae, Melanthete,
(Scheuchzeria, Butomus)}, Sarmentaceae (Xeroteae, Smilaceae,
Dioscoreae), Coronariae (Methoniceae (Alstromeria),                       Tuli
paceae, Gilliesieae, Scilleae, Hemerocallideae, Alliaceae, Dra
caeneae).
iiaceae.
             Dr. Lindley has very happily disentangled the                  Li
   AsPARAgos4.—The Endogenous alliances begin here; Caes
alpinus vaguely marked them “Triplici principio fibrosae et
bulbosae;” Ray must, it seems, be deemed the founder of the
Monocotyledons as a class, though Lobel noticed the struc
ture.
   BRoMELIALEs.-Richard unites the Hypocarpous Endo
gens (nearly Orchidales and Bromeliales) under the name of
Monosymphysogonie, loosely arranged; he mentions as an
objection, that Hydrocharaceae would so be separated from
Alismaceae.        Hess, a botanist of admirable tact, adopts
Richard's    arrangement,     which is also more or less recognised
by Dr. Lindley.—Agardh makes some Rhizanths stand next
Hymenomycetes; if they          all   lie
                                      together, they may well form
a  distinct alliance.
    UlvaLEs.-These are nearly the Algae.
    CHARALEs.-The Goniopterides              Bartling contain Cha
                                                 of
                                                  as be
raceae and Equisetaceae.         It  may       doubted whether the
shell   of Sigillaria can be   considered     bark.
    OSMUNDALEs.-These seem              to       be
                                            nearly the Capillares              of
 Morison and      Ray.   Dr.   Lindley has judiciously   broken them
down into natural families.
    PIPERALEs.-The Piperinae             Bartling include Chloran
                                            of
thaceae, Piperaceae, Saururaceae.                In
                                              his first edition   the     of
“Natural System,” Dr. Lindley threw together after the
Chenopodiales        the following families: Saurureae, Chloran
theae, Lacistemea, Piperaceae, Podostemea, Callitrichineae,
 Ceratophylleae.       This led directly       the Haloragales, and
                                                  to
suggested the transition from the Urticales,                      on
                                                            which the
arrangement       ofthe Ulvaceous race       founded.
                                                 is
    HAloft AGALEs.-The Halorageac                Bartling contain
                                                      of                       as
 sections   Hippuridea,    Callitrichea, Halorageae    (Trapa).
    CENother ALEs.-The Calyciflorae              Bartling contain his
                                                      of
 Halorageae, Lythrarieae (Elatinaceae), Onagrariae (Philadel
                                 2    K     2

 252          Sir Edw. Ff. Bromhead's Memoranda
 pheae),    Rhizophoreae, Vochysiege, Combretaceae, embracing
 nearly both alliances.
    MYRTALEs.-The Myrtinae of Bartling are Memecyleae,
  Melastomaceae, Myrtaceae (Lecythidaceae, excl. Punica).
     Rosa LEs.-These are the Rosaceae of Jussieu, with the ad
 dition of some later discoveries.
    SAxifraGALEs.—The        Saarifragaceae of De Candolle include
 Saxifrageae,   Hydrangeaceae, Cunoniaceae, Baueraceae, Escal
 loniaceae.     The Corniculatae of Reichenbach contain Cras
 sulaceae (? Cephalotus,     2 Francoa),    Saxifrageae   (Genuinae
 (Adoxa), Cunoniaceae (Bauera, Hydrangea), Philadelpheae),
 Bruniaceae.     His Ribesiaceae contain Cacteac, Grossularieae,
 Escallonieae (Aristotelia).
    CUcu RBItALEs.—These are the last four families of Bart
ling's Peponiferae, with the addition of Begoniaceae, the affi
nity of which he hints at. The Cucurbitales of Dr. Lindley
are Cucurbitaceae, Loasaceae,         Cactaceae,   Homaliaceae;  he
places Begoniaceae near them.
    CHENopodiALEs.-The         Oleraceae of Agardh contain Che
nopodeae (excl.     Galenia, Salvadora, Theligonum), Rivineae,
Phytolacceae (Miltus), Amaranthaceae, § Illecebreae, Petivereae,
Polygoneae.      The Curvembryosae of Dr. Lindley are Amaran
taceae, Chenopodiaceae, Tetragoniaceae, Phytolaccaceae, Poly
gonaceae, Petiveriaceae, Scleranthaceae, Nyctaginaceae, Meni
 spermaceae.     The families of the Portulacales and Chenopo
diales require to be recast; Bartling has effected much in
                                               ºft
his Caryophyllinae.
    Bor AGINALEs.-These are nearly the                      of Ray.
Linnaeus noticed the circinate inflorescence. The Tubiflorae
of Bartling constitute unarranged the Boraginal union, if we
add Plumbaginaceae and Verbasceae-Digitaleae, and if we
 omit Retziaceae.
    GENTIANALEs.—These are the Gentianae of Jussieu, if we
add Retziaceae.
    Apocynales.—These are nearly the Contorti of Linnaeus.
The Contortae of Bartling embrace the Gentianales and Apo
cynales,   if we add Retziaceae, and omit Lygodysodeaceae.
    GALIALEs.-The Rubiacinae of Bartling are Lygodyso
deaceae, Rubiaceae (Stellatae), Caprifoliaceae, Viburneae.

The Geraniales of Dr. Lindley are Geraniaceae, Balsaminaceae
(Tropaeoleae), Oxalidaceae; he mentions the affinity of Suria

               on the Origin     of the Botanical Alliances.                    253
naceae and Limnanthaceae, and places them also among                           Gy
nobaseosae.
     CISTALEs.-The Cistales of Dr. Lindley are Elatinaceae,
Linaceae,        Hugoniaceae,        Chlenaceae,        Cistaceae,    Reaumuri
aCeae.
     BRAssicalEs.—This alliance was established by Dr. Brown,
Resedaceae         being here removed, and              *::::::::::          bein
added.         Bartling's Rhaeadac are Tremandreae, Polygaleae,
Resedaceae, Fumariaceae, Papaveraceae, Cruciferae, Cappari
deae; stress being laid upon the intervalvular placentation.
The miscellaneous Brevistylae of Agardh include Brassicales,
Polygalaceae, &c., but without Tremandraceae: “fructibus so
litariis brevistylis, stigmate suborbiculato; stylus ovel brevis
et quasi acumen germinis; stigma orbiculatum, et peltatum
vel capitatum.”

Cyperoideae, Commelinaceae (Restioneae (Lilaea), Xyrideae
(Aphyllanthes, some Liliaceae), Philydrinae, Xyphidieae (Fla
#. ellaria), Pontedereae, Commelineae).
              take nearly the same range.
     Typh ALEs.-The           Spadicosae
                                                         The Glumosa of Dr.

    July  13, 1837.
    In a note upon Sir E. Ffrench Bromhead's former paper, inserted in our last
 volume, pp. 48, 137, the agreement of some of the principles of arrangement ad
 vocated by the author with those enunciated by Mr. Wm. S. Macleay was briefly
 pointed out.    It may tend to preserve the interest now taken in the subject, if
 some further points of coincidence between the views of classification which have
 arisen in the mind of one naturalist from the investigation of the animal kingdom,
 and those which have been presented to that of another from the investigation of
 the vegetable kingdom, be also noticed.      It is observed in the preceding paper,
 under the head “Lycopodiales,” p. 247–8, that “All the great transitions in na
 ture are through small families, in which the structure seems to want breadth,
 or what mechanicians would call stable equilibrium.” Taking “families” to mean,
 merely, in this place, comparatively smaller groups than those which they are the
 means of uniting, the passage here cited is an accurate statement of the nature
 and characters of what have been termed by Mr. Macleay, Osculant groups. The
 want of “breadth,” or “stable equilibrium ” in their structure, is the consequence
 of their being the means of transition from one type to another, and uniting,
 therefore, in themselves, the structures of the groups which they thus connect.
 In the animal series, as Mr, Macleay has remarked, the osculant groups which

$4. On the Direction of the Isodynamic Lines (for horizonta!
  Intensity) in the Central Alps, and in the Pyrenees; and on
  the Influence of Height.
  25.      The next question comes to                               be how to deduce the                             ge
neral results contained in the preceding tables.                                                   Where it is
merely required to deduce the position of isodynamic lines
(which may be considered as sensibly straight for a district of
moderate extent), projection of the results upon paper would
afford quite a sufficient approximation, where the stations are
sufficiently multiplied.      Thus the variations in latitude and
longitude would be determined, and lines of intensity 100,
1:01, 1:02, &c. might be drawn with great accuracy upon a
geographical map.
   26. But the same process will not suffice, if we have a third
variable, such as height, and require to extract             influence:                            its

                           [With  a Figure:   Plate II.]
 ON        the 26th of June last, a new rain-gauge was exhibited
        to the Royal Irish Academy, contrived by the Rev.                 Tho
 mas Knox.
      The object of this instrument is to register the amount of
 rain that falls when the wind is in different points.                 Its con
 struction is    very  simple.      The   water,     instead of   descending
 from the reservoir directly into the tube of registry,                  passes
 through a lateral tube into an annular-shaped vessel, divided
 into eight compartments, each of which terminates below in a
 graduated glass tube.           It is obvious, then, that if the eight
 tubes be set to correspond with the cardinal and intermediate
 points, and that the reservoir be made to revolve on a vertical
 axis by means of a vane, the direction of which corresponds
 with that of the lateral tube, the object proposed will be attain
 ed. Mr. Knox has preferred to make the reservoir fixed, and
 the system of tubes moveable; but the result is obviously the
 Saine.
     * Since this paper was read, this result has been still more nearly con
 firmed by the observations of Professor Bache of Philadelphia, who, by
 connecting Edinburgh and Dublin, and taking Professor Lloyd and Captain
  Sabine's observations for the comparative intensities at Dublin and Paris,
 has obtained the number 8400.

A COSMOLOGICAL                    phaenomenon of the most interest
         ing kind, although new as yet in the records of science,
is at present attracting the attention of astronomers, meteor
ologists, and physicists. The magnificent assemblage of lumi
nous points and globes which has been seen for several years
presents a
                hº      important subject of inquiry, by which we
may be enabled to add to the stock of our knowledge respect

digious number of them had already been seen at Geneva in
 1832, and especially in the United States in 1833.               What is
the nature of these fugitive stars? Whence do they come 2

questions which every one asks himself, and which       -       are of the
highest interest.
   The much-wished-for fall of one of these meteors would
without doubt furnish the chemist and physicist with the means
of explaining certain points quite unknown. Those observers
also, who were aware of the importance of this inquiry, have
not neglected to bestow their attention in this direction, and
some of them, in fact, state that they have seen several of these
meteors which were projected against the sides of the mountains
by which they were surrounded. This fact is undoubtedly of a
positive nature, but is it such as to prove the authenticity of the
fall of the meteor down to the surface of the earth?. Have not
the illusions which exercise so great an influence here, and un
 der which observers are more or less placed, contributed to a
belief in a projection towards the ground which was apparent
only 2 In support of this suspicion I may be allowed to mention
a fact which I had an opportunity of stating more than six years
agointheformerseries of the Journal of Geneva, in the numbers
for March and April, 1830, as follows: A meteor appeared
on the 19th of March of the before-mentioned year, at half
º
past seven in the evening; according to the report of eye-wit
messes, it had a round disc, with a well-defined edge, which
was almost equal to that of the full moon, and which shed a
          light of a bluish colour; it circulated with great velo
city from east to west, and appeared to be at a very great
height.       Those who observed it at Geneva, and who followed
it with their eyes in       its
                              horizontal course, thought they saw                           it
burst  in    the air,  and fall    pieces
                                      in      some paces before them.

spite    of the distance which separated them, namely, in the one
case    a half league and in the other more than thirteen leagues,
they each thought they saw the meteor fall down near them.
Such a fact evidently shows that this fall is by no means real,
and that if the meteor seemed to descend towards the horizon,
this circumstance without doubt is owing to the quick decrease
                                                                       its

   The appearance         this isolated meteor showed sufficiently
                                     of                                                a

  meters, placed in the open air, remained motionless; lastly,
  the magnetic needle presented, at eleven minutes past nine, a
  slight deviation of 0°5 to the east in declination; a deviation
  which remained the same till a quarter of an hour after mid
  night, after which it varied, always in the same direction, and
  till the morning, between 0°-1 and 0°7.
      Assisted by three amateurs who wished to join me, a conti
 nued look-out was kept, not only towards the region of the
  east, but in every quarter of the heavens; the terrace of the
  Observatory commanding the entire horizon.
      From seven to ten o'clock in the evening a light breeze
  prevailed, hardly perceptible, which blew from the north-east;
 and from ten in the evening till seven in the morning the air
  remained perfectly calm, excepting at three periods, namely,
 at two, at forty-five minutes past three, and at fifteen minutes
 past four, when a light breeze was again perceived, and
 lasted each time ten minutes.
     At forty-five minutes past eight in the evening, and from
 the south-south-east, a feeble white light illuminated the upper
 part of the clouds for from three to four seconds. At fifty-one
 minutes past nine a reddish light, resembling lightning, streak
 ed the upper part of the clouds for nearly three seconds, in
 the east. At forty minutes after eleven there were white glim
 merings, very feeble, which streaked the clouds between the
 north-east and the south-east; they had a kind of intermitting,
 and they lasted about          six
                                seconds.             At
                                               thirty-five minutes past

rarely fall to the surface of the earth, if they ever do. This

    A learned astronomer communicated to the Academy of
Sciences of Paris, in the session of the 5th of this month (De
cember 1836) a curious and very interesting memoir, which
appears to suggest that the luminous nebulosity by which the
sun appears to be surrounded in the direction of        equator,                                      its

of phaenomena.
   In bringing together the different data furnished by obser
vation, and in considering the particular circumstances con
nected with them, we may be led in some measure to conjec
ture that the source of this singular phaenomenon                  perhaps,                is,
 an electric   focus,            of

in order to obtain a definitive solution of the problem.  Re
cently, MM. Olmsted, Arago, Biot and other illustrious phi
losophers have been occupied with this interesting subject”.
They have furnished ingenious ideas and fresh views, by which
science will profit. It is true that some diversities are ob
servable in the hypotheses which they have advanced, but
these documents are not themselves the less to be prized and
preserved.    Who knows, but that the light, to the investiga
 tion of which every one earnestly applies, may not one day
 spring from the clashing of opinions?
II.    On the question whether Shooting Stars are more numerous at
         certain times than at others. By M. QUETELET.t
  M.   Quetelet informed the Academy that during the night of the
12th of November he employed himself at the observatory of the
city in noticing the shooting stars, for the purpose of ascertaining,
whether in fact, their appearance were more frequent than at
another season.     His observations presented nothing remarkable
as to the number of these meteors.
   We remember that M.Arago, in giving to the Academy of Sciences
at Paris an account of the results of the numerous observations
which he had produced in support of this fact, quoted amongst other
numbers as being extraordinary, that of 170 shooting stars which
the students of astronomy in the observatory of Paris entrusted by
him with making observations, had counted during the night of the
13th of November.       For appreciating this number, however, and
establishing a comparison, facts were wanting, that is to say, the
knowledge of the mean number of those meteors which may be ob
served in a night at any other season of the year.    For the purpose
of determining   this number,  M. Quetelet entered  upon  some inves
tigations relative both to his former observations on shooting stars,
and to those of other persons, and he arrived at this result, that
the number of shooting stars which are observed, on an average,
in an hour, looking constantly towards the same quarter of the
heavens, is about eight, and that several observers, placed so as to
observe the different regions of the heavens, may count double the
number. Accordingly, the number of 170 shooting stars observed at
Paris by several persons on the night of the 12th of November would
not be at        all
              astonishing;           on
                              the contrary,   would come very near

 the numerous appearances of these meteors, which, infinitely nearer
to us, streak every night the surface of heaven, and are sometimes
seen in such numbers that the heavenly vault would appear to re
solve itself into a shower of stars.
   Let us not, however, be in haste to suppose that nothing has been
done upon this subject. We might almost be tempted to admit that
the sciences also experience the influence and caprice of fashion,
and that a certain class of researches can only interest at a certain
epoch and under certain circumstances.               Shooting stars, which had
never been the object of an investigation expressly undertaken, were
examined for the first time in a serious manner in 1798, by Benzen
berg and Brandés, who examined them during many nights and at
many intervals, with a view to determine their mean height, their
velocity, and what belonged to the nature of their trajectory.               In
1823, Brandés, seconded by a tolerable number of observers placed
in different stations, resumed the same work.               At nearly the same
time   (1824),   I  undertook,     with the aid of from twelve to fifteen
persons, similar observations, which were made at Brussels, Ghent,
and Liége. I know not whether other regular observations of
the same nature have been made since.                    nly, at my request,
seconded    by Sir John  Herschel,       the  English scientific men assembled
at Cambridge in 1834, thought proper to propose this subject of
inquiry in the list of objects worthy to engage the attention of ob
servers. The Royal Academy of Brussels has just come to a similar
resolution.
   Now, combining the results of the observations made in Germany
and in Belgium, the following are the principal conclusions which
may be deduced from them.
    i. The height at which shooting stars appear varies within very
wide limits; nevertheless the mean height may be considered as
being from 15 to 20 leagues of about 20 to a degree, that is to say,
near about the limits of our atmosphere. The two series of obser
vations made in Germany gave :

    2. Shooting stars have in general a direction inclined towards the
surface of the earth. Of 36 computed trajectories, Brandés found
26 descending ones, 9 ascending, and 1 horizontal; 13 formed an

 angle of less than 45° with the vertical; 14 were between 45° and
 the horizon; 8 between the horizon and 135°; and only 1 was
 still more elevated. With regard to the azimuths, of 34 trajecto
  ries, 23 had a direction southwards and 11 to the north, 21 to
  the west, and 13 to the east. Separating the shooting stars into two
  groups, we find 25 of them whose course inclines more to a south
  west direction, or whose azimuth is less than 135° to the west and
  45° to the east, and only 9 are in the other half portion of the hea
  vens. This difference seems to be connected with the direction of
                                                             as its

                              Abstract.
     T  the commencement of 1828t, in a memoir entitled,
      Analysis of the circumstances which determine the direction
and intensity of the electric currents in a voltaic pair, I showed
by several experiments the impossibility of explaining the pro
duction of voltaic electricity by the theory of contact, and the
necessity for having recourse to chemical action. At the end
of the same year             I
                        published an abstract of the researches
which form the subject of this article, in the Annales de Chimie
et de Physiquet, which appeared in three parts in the memoirs
of the Société de Physique et d’Histoire Naturelle of Geneva, in
1829, 1832, and 1835.        These three parts, especially the last,
were enriched with new facts not contained in theabstract which
I had given in 1828; but the principles were then stated, and
the new details that I added have only had the effect of proving
their exactitude. Thus in 1828, that is long before the labours
of Messrs. Ohm, Fechner, and Faraday,            had already given       I
the theory of the pile, founding it upon principles which have
been confirmed by the important researches of the physicists
whom      I
          have just mentioned.       But    ought to acknowledgeI
that these researches, particularly those of Mr. Faraday, have
led not only to the discovery of new laws of great value, but
in addition, have given, by the discovery of those laws, a more
solid basis to the chemical theory of the pile than was afforded
by my own labours.       As my memoir forms a volume of 170
pages, and consequently cannot be inserted entire in a scientific
              I
journal, have endeavoured to give an abstract of               com                      it,   as

that there    likewise

             Researches into the Cause             of   Voltaic Electricity.                      275
 ber of facts in 1828, has since that period been the subject of
 a warm controversy.            It has been attacked by many physicists
 upon two grounds: 1. That electricity is produced by the
 simple contact of bodies; 2. That a good theory of the pile
 cannot be given without admitting Volta's electromotive force.
 A reply to the second objection is unsuited to a portion of the
 memoir devoted to the chemical theory of the pile; I shall here
 therefore notice only the first, and endeavour to show the ex
 actitude of the principle which               I
                                              have stated above.
     The reason that it has been, and is still often supposed
that the simple contact of two heterogeneous bodies develops
electricity, is the difficulty of securing them from                        calo           all
 rific and mechanical, and especially from                         chemical ac

Two principal circumstances may explain this anomaly; viz.
the immediate recomposition                  larger   in
                                                      a  smaller proportion

by chemical action ; and the particular nature of this action,
which, according to the bodies between which it is exerted,
gives rise to electric effects more or less intense.
    When there is chemical action between two bodies, one
takes possession of the positive electricity, (these are in gene
ral oxygen, orides, &c.) the other of the negative electricity,
(these are in general the bases, metals, orides, &c.). Each of
these bodies is in a state of electric tension, and it may be ren
 dered sensible by putting one of them in communication with
an electroscope, and the other with the earth.                 There is an
 electric current when the two bodies are united exteriorly at
the points at which the chemical action takes place, and it may
 be rendered sensible by employing the metallic wire of a
galvanometer to effect this union.           Thus when a communi
cation is established between the condenser of an electroscope
and an oxidable metal, and it is touched with the finger or
any other humid conductor, the metal takes the positive elec
tricity, which it transmits to the condenser, and the humid con
 ductor the negative, which passes into the earth. In the

tricities, applies also to the production of electric currents in a
pair.      In very lively chemical actions the larger proportion of
the two electricities developed often undergoes this recompo
sition; a small part only runs through the whole circuit, espe
cially if it be not a very good conductor; which is the reason
that the strongest currents are not always those produced by
the most lively chemical actions, and that in a pair the metal
the most attacked is not always the positive one, that                    the one                        is,
whence the current commences.                   However, the latter case oc

from the particles of zinc to the particles of iron. These cur
rents decompose water; the hydrogen is disengaged, and the
oxygen, by combining with the zinc, increases the energy of
the current, which thus successively becomes cause and effect;
and the action may be observed to go on constantly increasing
in intensity, as if it were the effect of an accelerating force,
and neither to be constant or diminished but when the surface
of the  metal becomes covered with a little suboxide black ari
sing from the decomposition of the sulphate of zinc by the local
currents.        If,

  mated zinc: it appears from the observations of Professor

     This law flows immediately from the theory                        the pile            of

                                               these paths, depends upon
 the relative facility afforded                   by

  tension, these two circumstances nearly counterbalance each
  other;  I   am, however, disposed                believe, from experiment,

tering their surface, the number                  pairs     ofincreased, taking be
care that the additional pairs are exactly similar                        those                    to                  of
which the pile           already composed. The following are the
                         is
results:
  I.     That the tension               of
                                  the pile increases constantly with the
number        of   the pairs, but that for dynamic (magnetic, calorific,

and chemical,) effects, there is a limit in the number of pairs
which produces them with the greatest degree of intensity.
  II.   That the number of pairs which in each case produces
the maximum of effect, diminishes in proportion as the body
placed between the poles is a better conductor, and the liquid
interposed between the poles a worse one, and less adapted to
exert a lively chemical action.
  III.   That it often happens, especially when the pile is not
very energetic, that when the number of pairs the most fa
vourable to the production of a certain effect, in each case,
j
has been exceeded, the diminution in the intensity of the effect
which results from the addition of other pairs, ceases when
this addition amounts to a certain number; that the effect then
again becomes as intense as it was previously, to diminish a
second time in the same manner by again increasing the num
ber of pairs.
    IV. That whatever be the absolute intensity of the effects
 produced by a pile, this intensity diminishes with a rapidity
proportional to the amount of the number of the pairs com
         the pile, such at least is the fact when the conductor
placed between             its
                        poles     very good, and the liquid with
                                          a is
which    it   charged
              is       exerts   feeble chemical action.

                              found that two, twenty, and a hun

The strongest currents were developed by fourteen and seventy

   To exhibit the influence of the duration of the effect upon
its  intensity,I  shall produce some further experiments per

Lastly, six pairs gave      the first instant 500°, but the effect
                                  at
diminished with      great rapidity.    The preceding pairs had

                                                found a great difference
in the effect resulting from the larger or smaller number of
pairs. Thus in the first experiments were obtained, with two
pairs, 53° of Bréguet's helix; with four pairs, 75°; with six
pairs, 97°; and in the latter experiments were obtained, with
two pairs, from 11° to 12°; and with six pairs, from 5° to 6°.
    The following experiments were made with a slightly acid
solution, and show the rapidity with which the intensity of
the current diminishes according to the number of pairs.
At the instant of immersion two pairs gave 50° of Bréguet's
helix, but at the expiration of a minute they only gave 80°;
fourteen pairs perfectly similar gave at the first instant 35°,
but at the end of a minute their effect was reduced to 10°.

upon the quantity of electricity circulating between the poles;
in fact, as we have seen, the intensity of the current is not                                              di
minished by increasing the number of pairs. . But if the che
mical action, instead of being lively, is weak, it cannot be
considered as developing, in the same instant, physically equal
quantities of electricity; and the differences are more sensible
in proportion as the absolute quantity of electricity developed
is less.    On the other hand, as the quantity of electricity in
circulation in each pair, and between the poles of the pile, is
determined by that disengaged by the most feeble pair, when
once the necessary limit has been exceeded, the more pairs
there are the more the number of cases is increased, in which
a feeble disengagement of electricity may take place in a given
time, and consequently the more diminished is the total quan
tity of free electricity in circulation. To prevent this diminu
tion there must always be an absolute simultaneity and equality
in the quantities of electricity disengaged, in the same instant,
by each pile, which is physically impossible, and that impos
sibility increases as the number of the pairs becomes greater,

contrary effects with energies which acknowledge no regular

circumstances; such for example as the nature of the pairs,
their dimensions, the degree of acidity and conductibility of

 XXXVI.        Analytical Investigation of Professor Wallace's Pro
   perty of the Parabola. By J. R. YoUNG, Esq., Professor of
    Mathematics in Belfast College.”
 IN     the Philosophical Magazine for August 1836, a remark
     able property of the parabola, first established by Professor
 Wallace, is made the subject of a communication from Mr.
 Lubbock; in which communication that distinguished mathe
matician has given a proof of the theorem upon the principles
 of analytical geometry.
    In a subsequent Number of the Magazine, that for January
 1837, two other analytical investigations were given; one by
Mr. Greatheed of Trinity, and the other by Mr. Holditch of
Caius College, Cambridge; and a neat geometrical proof was
at the same time offered, differing but little from that of Pro
fessor Wallace himself.
    Ingenious and interesting as these several investigations are,
they can, I think, scarcely be regarded as more than mere
verifications, by analysis, of a previously known geometrical
truth; in as much as they do not exhibit the steps by which
an analyst would be likely to be led to such a property, unless
it were anticipitated at the outset. It is certain also that no
analytical investigation hitherto given is comparable, on the
score, of simplicity, with the geometrical proof; although it
would be premature to assert that analysis is incompetent to
furnish a proof equally simple and elegant.
                                 I
   The investigation which here offer is remarkably easy; it
differs essentially from those hitherto given, and will I think
bear a favourable comparison with the geometrical method.

304                   Mr. Watkins on Thermo-electricity.
   In instituting a comparison between the geometrical and
analytical methods, in any given instance, account should of
course be taken of the amount of extraneous aid required for
the furtherance of each process.     In analysis the truth is in
general evolved from the fundamental conditions, independ
ently of subsidiary propositions beyond those which consti
tute the first principles of the subject. In geometry, on the
contrary, we cannot arrive at the same conclusion without the
assistance of some neighbouring truth or chain of truths nearly
as remote from first principles as that to be established.    It
may be proper to remark, that the expression         2 m cos 3,         –
for the ordinate of the focus, is deduced from the simplest
and most obvious considerations.    The abscissa of the focus is
m, which is also the radius vector of the origin; the ordinate
is thus the base of an isosceles triangle whose side is m, and
angle at the base 3 or the supplement of 3, accordingly as this
ordinate is negative or positive;                  its   true value     is   therefore
that employed above.

and 1% inch broad, the coils being well insulated by brown
paper and silk.
   We gather from these observations that Cav. Antinori em
ployed an elongated coil as his electro-dynamic helix with
temporary magnets for eliciting the spark, while Professor
Wheatstone very judiciously resorted to the flat copper ribbon
coil, contrived and recommended for developing electricity
of feeble intensity by Professor Joseph Henry, of New Jersey
College, Princeton.
    Cav. Antinori gives different lengths of his coils, and I
presume in        all
                 cases that                     he
                                 had the advantage         the in                        of

short and slender coils surrounding different metals, wood,
&c., and failed entirely    obtaining sparks under these con

soft solder form a part.     I arrange one of my extremities of
the pile of strong sheet copper, cut like a comb, and covered
 with soft solder (the latter is a plan, I believe first suggested
by Dr. Hare, to obviate the trouble of amalgamating at every
experiment), and when the moveable extremity of my Henry's
coil is passed over the comb, and the thermo-electric pile in
action, splendid sparks are seen every time the moving part
of the coil breaks the circuit by leaving a tooth of the comb.
I have used stellar-formed wheels, vibrating pendulums, &c.,

  temperature to the pile.      All that now need be said on that
  head is that I have thermo-electric piles varying from fifteen
  to thirty pairs of metallic elements, which give brilliant sparks
  by simply pouring hot water on one end, while the other end
  is at the temperature of the atmosphere. Again, sparks are
  exhibited by the same piles when the temperature is reduced
  at one end by the aid of ice, and the other end at the tempe
  rature of the surrounding air.
      Of course, as has been noticed before, the effects will be
  greatly enhanced by still greater difference of temperature
  being produced at the opposite end of the pile.

 or of masses of dead coral rock. As long as Lagoon islands were
 considered the only difficulty to be solved, the belief that corals
 constructed their habitations (or speaking more correctly, their
 skeletons), on the crests of submarine craters, was both plausible and
 very ingenious; although the immense size, sinuous outline, and
   reat number, must have startled any one who adopted this theory.
   Ir. Darwin remarked that a class of reefs which he calls “encir
 cling” are quite, if not more, extraordinary. . These form a ring
 round mountainous islands, at the distance of two and three miles
 from the shore; rising on the outside from a profoundly deep ocean,
 and separated from the land by a channel, frequently about 200
and sometimes 300 feet deep. This structure as observed by Balbi
resembles a lagoon, or an atoll, surrounding another island.          In
 this case it is impossible, on account of the nature of the central
 mass, to consider the reef as based on an external crater, or on any
accumulation of sediment; for such reefs encircle the submarine
prolongation of islands, as well as the islands themselves.      Q<U+017F> this
case New Caledonia presents an extraordinary instance, the double
line of reef extending 140 miles beyond the island. Again the Bar
rier reef, running for nearly 1000 miles parallel to the North-East
coast of Australia, and including a wide and deep arm of the sea,
forms a third class, and is the grandest and most extraordinary coral
formation in the world.

ing to the theory recent subsidence, violent earthquakes are known
lately to have occurred.
   The author then removedan apparent objection tothetheory, name
ly, that subsidence would form a disc of coral but not a cup-shaped
 mass or lagoon, by showing that the corals which grow in tranquil
 water are very different from those on the outside, and less effective;
 and that as the basin becomes shallower they are subject to various
 causes of injury. The lagoon nevertheless is constantly filling up to
 the height of lowest water spring tides, (the utmost possible limit of
living coral,) and in that state it long remains, for no means exist to
complete the work. Mr. Darwin then proceeded to the main object
 of the paper, in showing that as continental elevations act over wide
areas, so might we suppose continental subsidences would do, and
in conformity to these views, that the Pacific and Indian seas could
be divided into symmetrical areas of the two kinds; the one sink
 ing, as deduced from the presence of encircling and barrier reefs,
and lagoon islands, and the other rising, as known from uplifted
shells and corals, and skirting reefs. The absence of lagoon islands
in certain wide tracts, such as in both the West and East Indies,
 Red Sea, &c., was thus easily explained, for proofs of recent
elevation are there abundant. In a like manner, in very many cases
where islands are only fringed with reefs, which according to the
theory had not been subsiding, actual proofs of elevation were ad
duced. Mr. Darwin remarked that, excepting on the theory of the
configuration of reefs being determined by the order of movement,
the circumstance that certain classes which are characteristic and
 universal in some parts of the sea, being never found in others, is
quite anomalous, and has never been attempted to be explained.
    Mr. Darwin then pointed out the above areas both in the Pacific
and Indian Oceans, and deduced the following as the principal re
sults. 1st. That linear spaces of great extent are undergoing move
ments of an astonishing uniformity, and that the bands of elevation
and subsidence alternate. 2. From an extended examination, that
the points of eruption        fallall        on
                                      the areas             of

insisted  on   the importance      this law,

Society.
     †uthor    referring to the observations of Mr. Lyell and of Mr.
Nilsson, on the unequal elevations of Sweden and subsidences of
Scania; as proving that not only does elevation go on at a different
rate, but that motion takes place in opposite directions, adduces, as
instances of similar phenomena, the islands of Saltholm and of Born
holam      as well as the Danish coast of the Sound.               The island of
 Saltholm opposite to Copenhagen, and hardly five feet above the
level of the Sound, being mentioned from the thirteenth century
as a source of income to the chapter of Roeskilde; must have been
elevated at a slower rate than Bornholm, which rises about one foot
in a century; for if it were now to sink only two feet a very small
portion of the island would be left.
    On the Danish coast however of the Sound, six miles to the north
of Copenhagen, a well characterized beach is observed, six feet
above sea-level ; hence the author infers that the change of level on
the Danish, proceeds in a different proportion from that on the Swe
dish shore; which he ascribes to the slight earthquakes so frequently
felt in Sweden, but never observed in Denmark.
    With respect to the Danish island of Bornholm, the author ob
serves, that          its
                   whole eastern shore          composedis         granitic rock,  of   a

terials for a rough calculation as to the time when this beach was
formed.       The continuous but very slow elevation of the island, as
shown      by  the sloping beach, would thus have been about one foot
in a    century;      and the beginning of the regular elevation of the
island about 1600 years ago.                   Previous to this there must have
been a long and perfectly quiet time, during which the horizon
 tal beach was formed.             Supposing the rise of the island and the
lateral addition to the         sloping    beach to have been quite regular, and
the lateral extension of the horizontal beach to have been equally
uniform, we require for                    formation  its    period        2500 years.

to the north by the line above indicated, and to the south by a line
which, commencing at Boss Castle on the coast of Cornwall, ranges
to the south side of Launceston, and thence in a somewhat devious
course to the northern edge of Dartmoor. This southern boundary also
descends considerably on the east side of Dartmoor, inclosing some
of the country near Chudleigh. The region thus bounded is composed
of one great formation (occupying more than a third of the whole
 county), to which the authors give the name of Culm Measures.

  5. The last group in this part of the ascending section commences
on the south side of a line drawn from Baggy Point on the coast in
the direction of the strata, or east and by south.                 It is composed of
arenaceous     flag   stones and soft      earthy  slates,   alternating   with harder
and coarser bands: it conforms to the mineral type commonly found
in the lowest part of the Silurian system, has abundance of organic re
mains, and is in parts calcareous; but the fossils are often                       pre                      ill

     1.   An ill-defined group near the granite, supposed to be meta
morphic.
    2. A great complex slate group, with two subordinate calcareous
zones, in some places swelling out to a great thickness.      The lower
calcareous mass (called the Ashburton bands) pass into Cornwall,
and range through the greater part of the county; the upper are re
presented in the most striking form by the Plymouth and Torbay
limestone.
   3. A coarse red arenaceous group, like the second group of the
  receding chapter, immediately surmounts the Plymouth and Torbay
 imestones, and like them is of enormous thickness.
   4. A great schistose deposit, striking with the other rocks in the
southern region, nearly east and west. The prevailing dip is south,
and it is not much contorted, but at length it is reversed to the north,
being thrown off by an anomalous mass of chlorite and mica slate
which occupies the promontories of Start Point and Bolt Head.
    5. Mica and chlorite slate;—the relation of which to the other part
of the series is unknown.                                     -
  The authors then contrast the two regions above described. In
the southern, trap rocks appear occasionally ; in the northern they
are wanting.   The slaty cleavage so common in the northern is want
ing in the southern region, though the rocks are in many places so
fissile as to make good roofing slate, but in such cases they exfoliate
parallel to the stratification.
   In comparing the two regions they endeavour, first, to identify the
calcareous group of Linton (No. 1 of chapter ii.) with the calcareous
bands (No. 2) of this chapter. Secondly, to identify the coarse red
group of North Devon (No. 2, chap. ii.) with No. 3 of South Devon.
Lastly, to identify the great slate group of South Devon (No. 4) with
Nos. 3 and 4 of North Devon. The absence of the calcareous band
of North Devon (No. 3) is not considered to throw much difficulty in
the way of this classification.   By way of general conclusion, the au
thors consider       all
                    the above   groups   North and South Devon
                                                of                        to    be
newer than the rocks     Snowdon and central Cumberland (lowest part

  At Shrawley Common, near Warwick, the surface of some of the
beds is impressed with foot-marks of an animal, probably a crocodile
or saurian, having feet with four claws.
  The marls beneath the sandstone are of great thickness, and
have been sunk through at Stoke Prior, near Droitwich, to a depth of
near 600 feet.       Besides gypsum they contain masses of rock salt,
and are the sources of brine springs.             In piercing these marls no
bed of sandstone has ever been met with, and no fossils have been
observed.       This great marly formation, comprising the fossil
iferous   sandstone,    is compared with the Keuper of Alsace and Sua

age as that of Bromsgrove, being also a soft, light-coloured,
slightly micaceous and thick-bedded sandstone : and rising up
immediately from beneath the red marl, it cannot be confounded
with the upper or Keuper sandstone, which at Rowington Tunnel
and Shrawley Common is seen to overlie the great mass of red
marl in manner before described.
     Portions of bones of saurians abound in what the workmen call
 the dirt bed of the Warwick sandstone; but the fragments are so
mutilated, and generally in such a decomposed state, that they can
 not be identified.      Plants also occur, but from a similar cause their
 recognition is very difficult. In addition to the fossils collected
 by Dr. Buckland, the authors have found teeth of fishes.
     As no attempt has been made to prove that the animal found in
 Guy's Cliff is of the same species as either of the Phytosauri of the
 Keuper of Wirtemberg; the authors throw it out as a probable
 conjecture, that if ever accurately determined, it will prove of the
 same species as one of the saurians in the bunter sandstein of the
 continent.
     The sandstone of Warwick is therefore identified with the rock
 of Bromsgrove and Ombersley in Worcestershire, and Hawkstone
 and Grinshill in Shropshire, which has been shown to be a portion
 of the red sandstone representing the grès bigarré or bunter sand
 stein.
     Although assiduous search has been made to discover a calca
 reous stratum between the two formations above described, which
 might represent the “Muschelkalk,” no traces of such a rock have

 a band of very impure limestone, occupying the same interme
 diate position, but as yet no organic remains have been observed in
 it.
     On the whole the authors conclude, that the          most exact parallel
 exists between the         upper   formations of the new red system of
 England, and those of a large part of France, where the muschel
 kalk being also absent, the marnes irrisées and grès bigarré pass
 into each other in the manner above described”.

       M. Dumas and Peligot by passing a current of dry carbonic
 M        acid into a solution of barytes in pyroxylic spirit (l'esprit de
 bois) obtained carbo-methytate of barytes.           The production of this
compound led them to suppose that the preparation of the carbovinates
would be attended with but little difficulty.          When, however, this
idea was    put   in  practice,  they  were   interrupted   by the discovery
that   although    pyroxylic    spirit dissolves  anhydrous    barytes, yet al
cohol does not       possess   this property;   they  therefore tried whether
the use of an alcoholic solution of ammonia would not be attended
with success.        By passing a current of dry carbonic acid through

a solution of anhydrous ammonia in absolute alcohol a salt was ob
tained, but it did not possess the properties of carbovinate of am
monia.    They then tried the action of dry carbonic acid on a solu
tion of potash which had been heated to redness, in absolute alcohol.
As the operation is attended with the evolution of heat, it is neces
sary that it should proceed slowly and the vessel be kept cold in
which it is conducted.     The crystalline substance formed by this
action soon becomes so abundant as to solidify the solution; a
volume of anhydrous aether equal to that of the solution must then
be added, and thrown upon a filter. By washing the product with
anhydrous aether there remains a mixture of carbonate, bicarbonate,
and carbovinate of potash. To separate the last salt the mixture
must be washed with absolute alcohol, which dissolves        and anhy                            it,
drous aether added     the filtered solution, which reprecipitates

in this combination, it may be considered as the basic constituent,

                ON GALLIC ACID.       By M. RoB1QUET.
   M. Robiquet   remarks that before M. Pelouze had published his
work on tannin and gallic acid, it was generally admitted that the
acid was ready formed in the gall nut, and it was far from bein
supposed, as attempted to be shown by this chemist, that gallic                                                .#
was entirely derived from the tannin.       M. Robiquet, after stating
some difficulties in  admitting  this  opinion,  observes, that whether
the acid pre-exists  or not in the  gall nut, it is certain that a large
quantity separates independently of contact with the air or with
oxygen, and without any action, if indeed there be one, which
occasions the evolution of any gas.
    M. Robiquet then details experiments which show that tannin
does not yield much above half           weight     gallic acid; and
                                                    its                      of                                  he
observes that there      great
                             isdisproportion  between the time required
to  convert  pure  tannin into gallic acid and that required for the en
tire gall nut.         In

weather      tocomplete  the action.    He therefore        opinion
                                                                  is that                   of

by  acting      as
                 kind
                  a      ferment, and M. Robiquet supposes that the

gum,    orrather mucilage, which may        separated       be

   Following out the opinion formerly stated           M. Chevreul, that          by
                                   which gallic acid

the results were the following M. Pelouze had inferred from his

of iron when obtained from      a filtered infusion of galls and finery
cinder, as above described, on being evaporated to the consistency
of thick molasses, gum arabic in due proportion having been pre
viously added, forms a pigment which might, it is conceived, super
sede Indian ink. When completely dried it glistens like jet with or
without the gum.
    This tanno-gallate of iron only requires to be dried and ignited
at a low red heat, in order to be converted into a pyrophorus.         A
few years ago Dr. Hare ascertained that, by a similar ignition in close
vessels, cyanoferrite of iron, the Prussian blue of commerce, gave
a pyrophorus.      But as the pure cyano-ferrite of iron, resulting from
the addition of the ferro-prussiate of potash, more properly the cy
ano-ferrite of potassium, to a ferruginous solution did not form a
pyrophorus; he was led to believe that the presence of sulphate of
alumine in the commercial Prussian blue was the source of the differ
ence, probably by being converted into a sulphide of aluminium, or
potassium.
    The production of a pyrophorus from the tanno-gallate proves
that iron and carbon, when in a state of minute division, are capable,
by ignition in close vessels, of acquiring that property of sponta
neous combustibility which entitles the body which possesses it to
be called a pyrophorus.
    In truth these results are consistent with some facts mentioned
by Berzelius, as having been ascertained by Mitcherlich, respecting
the spontaneous combustibility of iron, reduced from the state of
magnetic oxide to that of the pure metal in an extreme state of       di
vision.    They are also consistent with the spontaneous combusti
bility of the residue resulting from the ignition of the oxalate of iron
at a red heat.
RAPID CONGELATION OF WATER BY MEANS OF HYDRIC (SUL
    PHURic) AETHER AND CONCENTRATED SULPHURIC ACID, &c.
    BY R. HARE, M.D.
    In freezing water by the vaporization of hydric, commonly called
 sulphuric, aether, there is much labour in pumping, and the aetherial
 vapour condensing in the pump, disqualifies it for nice experiments
 until cleansed. Dr. Hare finds that the interposition of sulphuric acid
 lessens the requisite labour, and protects the pump.       By means of
 a globe or bottle with two tubulures, and a glass funnel with a cock,
 the acid being in the globe, the water in a retort, and the aether in
 the funnel, while the two former are exhausted, on allowing the
 aether to descend upon the water, the congelation of this liquid is
 instantaneous.
    It has been ascertained by the same chemist, that a permanent
 self-regulating reservoir of chlorine may be made by means of the
 apparatus heretofore used by him for nitric oxide, substituting for
 the materials used in that case, manganese in lumps and concen
 trated muriatic acid.

   substituted for the sponge, in the experiment above described, or
   carried red hot from a fire and passed into a bell glass containing
   the mixture over mercury.
      In fact a piece of charcoal soaked in a solution of chloride of pla
   tinum, (choroplatinic acid,) produced effects analogous to the pla
   tinated asbestus.
      To produce platinated asbestus, it was found sufficient to dip it

XL.     On the prepared or peculiar Voltaic Condition                            of Iron.
  By Sir John F. W. HERschel, K.G. H., M.A., F.R.S.*
  N the Number of the Annales for the month of March of
   the present year, (1833, vol. lii. p. 288,) which I have re
cently received, I find a remark of M. Braconnot upon the
manner in which concentrated nitric acid acts, when brought
into contact with iron, which brings to my recollection some
experiments made several years ago upon the same subject,
presenting particularities sufficiently curious to merit a closer
examination. I am at present unable to resume my researches,
but I think that an account of them will not be uninteresting
to your readers, and that it may induce one of them, per
 haps M. Braconnot himself, to study in detail the very re
 markable phaenomena of the action in question, and to con
 nect them with the usual laws of chemical action.
    M. Braconnot says, “filings, or if they be prefered, plates of
iron immersed in concentrated nitric acid, do not experience
                                                       all

       If a piece
              of soft iron wire, well brightened, be immersed
in nitric acid of the density 1-899, the iron instantly becomes
brown,     and an effervescence more or less lively takes place,
attended with the disengagement of red vapours; but this
 effervescence only lasts a few moments.                 It very soon ceases;

 a green colour, it was found incapable of communicating the
 prepared state to iron. A piece of iron, immersed in acid
 thus impregnated, continued to produce a lively effervescence
 until it was entirely destroyed.
   A piece of prepared iron was immersed in a solution of
 nitrate of copper.   No precipitate resulted, but when it was
 touched in the solution with a piece of copper, the surface
 became instantly covered with a thick layer of metallic copper.
    Between those states of the acid, in which it is capable and
 incapable of preparing iron, several intermediate states inter
 vene, in which the preparation of it is effected with more and
more difficulty, and the effervescence lasts longer and longer.
 In these intermediate states the following remarkable phaeno
menon sometimes occurs: the action ceases for an instant,
and then recommences, and that several times in succession,
and with convulsive intermittences, which sometimes succeed
each other at intervals of # to # of a second, sometimes with
an extraordinary rapidity, so that they cannot be counted.
When they are slow, it is easy to see that the cessation of the
action is propagated from one extremity of the wire to the
other, though a reason cannot always be assigned why it
ceases at one extremity rather than at the other.
   It often happens that the iron, without acting with vivacity,
does not cease to have a brown surface, to colour the sur
rounding acid, and to give off gaseous bubbles: this slow action
may be arrested immediately in a singular manner, by with
drawing the iron from the acid, holding it for an instant in the
air,  .#  then letting it fall suddenly with a little shock.                                         ...   In

 proves that these phaenomena are owing, not merely to the
 absence of the water necessary to hold the nitrate of iron in
solution, but rather to a certain permanent electrical state of
 the surface of the metal.           This mode of considering the
subject is confirmed by the following experiments.
    A piece of iron wire was heated, and a small zone of wax
 placed around the middle of it to divide it into two pro
 tions.    The wire being immersed in the concentrated acid,
 the action ceased at the same moment upon each half, and
 upon touching one of          its
                                 extremities with copper the action
 was renewed           each simultaneously.
                         in                        The prepared state
 being again established, the iron was withdrawn              glass rod     by

               the   wax,   and one           of   its
                                             extremities was touched
 while   itwas       the air. The action commenced as usual
                     in                                                                       at

   Since these experiments were made,         have found a very         I
curious memoir by Keir, in the Transactions of the Royal
Society of London for the year 1790, entitled, Erperiments
and observations on the dissolution of metals in acids, and their

   Keir was led to remark the prepared state of iron, when
studying the precipitation of silver by that metal, in which
Bergman had previously found some anomalies.             He even
discovered that this singular state may be developed by the
action of nitrous acid.     But the remarkable effects arising
from contact with other    metals,   by which these facts may be
included in the class of electro-chemical phaenomena, escaped
his observation.     That the contact of one metal should pro
tect another from the action of a chemical agent, as long as
the contact lasts, does not now surprise us;         occurs when                     (it

Chemists, it is true, distinguish the alkaloids from the henbane,
the deadly nightshade, and the thorn-apple; they appear to us
however so nearly related to each other, that their difference
consists in their greater or less degree of purity. One might de
signate them as the bases from the Solaneae if the genus Sola
num did not contain an alkaloid differing from them, and which
is principally distinguished from the above by the circumstance,
that it causes no dilatation of the pupil, which property belongs
to the former in a very high degree. The history of the alkaloids
obtained from the genus Solanum seems to us yet to be rather
in darkness: for the bases from the above-named genera pos
sessing the property of dilating the pupil, a name should be
chosen, from one of them. They are contained in              parts                         all           of
the plants combined with          acid.       an

   We are yet unacquainted with the origin of the drug known
under the name of Cusco bark; it belongs according to chemi
cal observations certainly to the bark of some Cinchonaceae.
 Wincklert prepared the Cusconin which had been dis
covered in it by Pelletier and Leverköhn. It possesses great
similarity to the known cinchonic bases, melts like quinia, is
not so easily sublimed, and differs in            elementary composi          its

Pelletier further proved that there could be no doubt as to the
existence of the narceia which he had discovered in opium;
that the codeia discovered by Robiquet is not the result of
the reaction of a certain substance in the opium; that from
one and the same quantity of opium, narcotina, morphia, nar
ceia, meconia, codeia and paramorphia might be obtained.
Of particular interest to physiology is the examination of
opium obtained from heads of poppies cultivated on the grounds
of General Lamarque at Eyris, Dept. des Landes. Pelletier
found in it no trace of narcotina; on the other hand, a much
larger quantity of morphia than in the oriental opium. There
was also, excepting a small quantity of codeia, none of the

    Of inorganic  substances which have been found in plants we
can only mention those remarkable either by their rarity or
quantity; and with regard to the latter, we must notice the often
        i.
mentioned paper of Radig on Digitalis, who states that he
has found in the herbaceous part 3.7 per cent. of oxide of
iron. Also the memoir of Struve * on the siliceous contents
of some plants. The author determined only the quantity of
silica in the ashes; he should have taken into consideration
the               of silica to the vegetable substance in order to
render his labours of more physiological importance.           Under
this section  belongs    also a part of the crystalline   formations
discovered in plants, to which De Candolle has given the
name of Raphides, and, among others, those found by Nees
von Esenbeck in the root of Mirabilis longiflora, consisting,
according to him, of phosphate of lime and magnesiaf.            The
examination of these crystals is always connected with many
difficulties; and we seldom succeed in obtaining the object so
pure as in the case which Fr. Nees von Esenbeck mentions f,
and as in that where the author [Marquart] obtained from
the stem of Alöe arborescens pure raphides in such a quantity
as to be able to submit them to careful analysis, which con
vinced him that in this case the acid could not be of organic
nature, but phosphoric acid combined with lime and magnesia,
as in the above-mentioned raphides from Mirabilis longiflora.
 These data do not exclude in any way whatsoever the state
 ments, that crystals of oxalate of lime may also frequently be
 found in the cells of plants.     Among others we may just no
tice the oxalate of lime in the root of Rheum australe, which
I  however have never been able to see under the microscope
 in a crystalline form, but more in the state of granular ex
crescences.     Not unimportant to the explanation of the oc
currence of salts of difficult solubility in the interior of plants
 may be the old observation of Vauquelin § (almost forgotten)
 which he made on occasion of analysing forty-seven varieties
of potato, and according to which phosphate of lime dissolves
in water, when some mucilaginous substance, gelatinous starch
or animal gelatine, for instance, is mixed with           The state               it.

XLII.    On the Bromo-cyanide and Chloro-cyanide of Potas

    HE iodo-cyanide of potassium and mercury has been de

the cyanide  is combined with twice as much cyanogen as would
be  necessary  to convert the potassium of the iodide into cy

that the double salt is compounded of an atom of iodide of

                                                     This salt
called       by
            Caillot the  cyano-hydrargyrate       the bromide     of
potassium, believing            as   he
                             does that the bicyanide     mercury              of
plays the part           of
                    the electro-negative     acid element, whilst
                                                            or
the bromide         of
                 potassium takes upon itself the electro-positive,
or base function: his mode                 of
                                  obtaining the salt    much the          is
same as that which       have described.
                              I             M. Caillot considers

344      Mr. Beke             on the Complexion        of the Ancient Egyptians.
that it contains 8-74 per cent. of water of crystallization.   Now
the atomic   weight of the salt according     to my  experiments   is
372, and if the above per centage of water of crystallization
be taken as correct, it will be found that 372 parts of the
anhydrous salt will combine with 35.62 parts of water, which
is very nearly equal to 4 atoms; this agrees with the state
ment of M. Caillot, who considers the quantity of water in his
salt as equal to 4 atoms. The proportions of the constituent
salts in 100 parts as given by Caillot, is very nearly the same
as that given in my analysis: according to him the propor
tions are as follows: Bicyanide of mercury 68°49; bromide
of potassium 31.51. M. Caillot says that diluted nitric acid
when mixed with the salt decomposes              forming nitrate it,                             of
potass and bi-bromide         mercury, and disengaging hydro
                                      of
cyanic acid; and certainly, reasoning from the known action                                      of
many     the acids upon the iodo-cyanide
            of                                  potassium and merof
cury, we might priori have expected this.
                         d                          my own experi      In

of  mercury was present, the cold, and even concentrated
mineral acids did not disengage any hydrocyanic acid, neither
did the same acids when hot;        prolonged digestion with
                                                  a                                              or

       is  more than   likely that this was done        M. Caillot's         in
investigations.

    Fourthly: the naturalists who have investigated the physical

   Lastly: we know full well, that in the present day the com
plexion of the natives of Egypt is far from being black; and
  that, in reality, they possess the general physical characters
  of an European or Asiatic, rather than of an African race.
     What, then, is the conclusion to be come to under this con
 flicting evidence?      It seems utterly impossible to reject alto
 gether the testimony of Æschylus and Herodotus, and espe
 cially of the latter, by which the fact is established, that, at
 about 500 years before the commencement of the Christian
 aera, the complexion of the natives of Egypt, if not actually
  black, was at       all                  shade, that such        epithet                          an

 bitants     of
             Greece: and         we admit this fact, there appear                                               to

 ancient Egypt were derived from two distinct original stocks:
 the one, and the earliest possessors            the country, being   of                                        of

thing.
   But admitting for a moment that Michaelis's construction
be the correct one, it is still manifest that among the Hebrew
women childbirth is stated to have been so easy, that they
could dispense with the aid of the midwives; and that, in fact,
they were able to deliver themselves.      This assertion may, or
may not, have been true: from Exod. i. 17. it would seem
rather that it was not so, and that, on the contrary, the Mitz
ritish midwives did actually assist the Hebrew mothers; but
 that they “feared God, and did not as the king of Mitzraim
 commanded them, but saved the men-children alive.” The
truth, or untruth, of their assertion is however entirely imma
terial to the consideration of the present question, which re
lates to the Mitzritish, and not to the Hebrew women. Now,
as the midwives expressly told Pharaoh that the Hebrew wo
men could dispense with their assistance, and that in this re
spect “they were not as the Mitzritish women,” it was equi
valent to the assertion, that the latter, on their part, did re
 quire such assistance: and as this excuse was allowed to pass
 current with the tyrant, (which would scarcely have been the
 case, had it been untrue in this respect also,) it affords the
 strongest evidence of the physical character of the Mitzritish
 women in this particular; and hence the distinction is suffi
 ciently established between them and the women of Egypt, as
 described by Ælian.
    For various other arguments in confirmation of the distinc
 tion existing between the land of Mitzraim of the Hebrew
 Scriptures, and the Egypt of profane history, it is sufficient
for me to refer to the work already alluded to.
    The separation and distinction between the Egyptian and
 Mitzritish nations continued (there is reason to consider) until
about the time of the Israelitish king, Solomon.       At that pe
riod, wars between them ensued, in which the Mitzrites were at
first the conquerors; but after a time, the Egyptians regained
their independence, and in the end acquired the supremacy.
Of these occurrences we have manifest traces in the corrupted
and distorted fragments of Egyptian history which have come
down to our time, although the period when they took place is
thrown back to a much earlier date. The country of Mitzraim
being thus subjected to the dominion of Egypt, and being
further devastated by continual aggressions on the part of the
Assyrians and Babylonians, whilst, from         its

    The variations in Paris are calculated in millimetres for
 twelve hours; in the first 5 years the direction of the wind at
 midday was observed, in the last 5 years the mean of the
 entire day. The observations made at Danzig are variations
 in sixteen hours expressed in Parisian lines; those made at
                                                                         .
 London in English inches from morning to evening, with
 out closer determination of the hour of observation.                          I have
 omitted the inconsiderable correction for the daily variations
 at Danzig.
    The magnitude of the variation is in Paris for the morning
and evening observation,
             In the 5 years —0.336                         –0°01

   a. The independence of the phaenomenon on the daily periods
is evinced by the circumstance that the motion dependin
thereon in the observations of Paris and London, is
by bringing them together with opposite signs. In Danzig
this independence follows from the circumstance (Pog. Ann.,
vol. xxxi. p. 477) that the variations from 6 o'clock in the
morning to 10 at night, coincide completely, as regards the
   ;
sign, with the variations from 10 at night to 6 in the morn
ling.
       The    independence      on the yearly periods is evinced by
the following table, which contains the motions in 12 hours

  The import of the signs is here the opposite to that of those in the
other table, in order that they should coincide with the monthly determi

      The independence of the law of rotation on the differences
     c.
 of the yearly mean directions of the wind of individual places
 will then first be accurately proved when we possess similar
 observations for several places. The greatest difference among
 the places of observation above mentioned amounts, in rela
tion to the meandirection of the wind, to 30 degrees.
   d. The rising and falling of the barometer with the various
winds is so closely connected with the mean distribution of the
atmospheric pressure in the wind-compass (the so-called ba
rometrical wind-compass), that, if two maxima and two minima
occur in       even it,  the intermediate wind there will be ob

     B. Hydrometeors—In three memoirs contained in                                      these   An
mals   (Poggendorff's) viz.             “On the connection                 of hydrometeors
with the variations of the temperature and of the barometer,”
 (vol. xiii. p. 305), “On thunder-storms,” (vol. xiii. p. 419),
and “Some remarks on rain,” (vol. xxxi. p. 541), I have
specially proved that the atmospheric precipitates depending
on the direction of the wind, whether they appear as rain,
hail, or snow, whether accompanied with disengagements of
electricity or not, are nothing less than a necessary conse
quence of the law of rotation.         Since there is at present no
reason to modify the positions laid down in those papers, and
as these may rather be extended to the southern hemisphere, if
we consider the line drawn on it from SE. to NW. as a line of
division of the west and east side, a repetition in this place of
what has been stated in them, seems to me quite unnecessary.

         observations,
                           to the calculation of the first group of
                           those including the alpine country of
 Switzerland, Savoy, and Italy. If we arrange the observations
relatively to Geneva as a fundamental station, taking the data
from Table VII. and writing the equations of condition in the
form (3.) art. 28, where a denotes the excess of northern
latitude of the given station above that of Geneva in minutes;
by the excess of eastern longitude in minutes of a degree; c,
the excess in height, reckoned in hundreds of English feet in
round numbers (using of course negative signs to represent
the reverse of         all
                     this), we shall have the following equations
of   condition, distinguishing    from one another the absolute
numbers obtained              by
                         the two needles,     order that they may                   in

 ferred... The discrepancy of the results obtained by No. I.
 and “Flat” are, I presume, attributable to one or both of two
 causes,—a progressive change in the magnetic state of the
 needle somewhat different from what has been allowed for,
 and a slight error in the correction for temperature, which,
 during the period of observation (the autumn), was generally

    Hence it appears, that on the same parallel of latitude the
intensity increases in a westerly direction, which is the reverse
of the result found for the course of the isodynamic lines in
the Alps; but, in truth, I do not attach much importance to
these observations, unless for the sole consideration of height,
on account of the small area of country over which the obser
vations were made. There were probably in the Pyrénées
some sources of local disturbance which the observations on
the Pic de Bergons particularly indicate, and which, having
been repeated with coincident results, could not be owing to
an error of observation*.     At the same time it is satisfactory
 to find that the influence due to height is the same in direc
 tion, though greater in amount than that obtained in the alpine
series. On this subject I proceed to offer some remarks.
    37. The first experiments which seem to have had even
remotely in view the question of the decrease of magnetic in
tensity with height are those of Saussure, made during his
memorable stay on the Col du Géant in 1788.        The observa
tions were too rude, and differ too widely from each other to
deserve much confidence; but those made at Chamouni and
on the Col du Géant, which were fortunately under almost
the same temperature, agree very closely, but give a slightly
greater intensity to the latter, which is the effect due to the
latitudet. The great diminution of intensity in going from
Geneva to Chamouni, observed by Saussure, is certainly er
roneous, as the reverse has been shown to take place.
    38. In 1804 M. Gay-Lussac performed his celebrated
aerostatic ascent, and from his magnetic observations con
cluded that no appreciable difference of intensity existed at
the surface of the earth and at the height of 23,000 feet. This,
however, can only be considered as referring to great and
palpable change. The difficulties inseparable from the ex
periment prevented many oscillations from being observed,
or great precision in the times from being attempted, whilst
corrections for arc, diurnal variation, and temperature, were
not applied.    The last of these, however, could hardly fail to
    * Since this passage was written, on mentioning to Professor Necker of
Geneva, the anomalous, result as to the direction of the isodynamic lines
in the Pyrenees (anomalous, decause differing from the supposed direction
inserted in Hansteen's map, which is deduced from analogy, and not, I  be
lieve, from direct observations in that country), he pointed out the curious
(though perhaps accidental) coincidence which this result offers to the
views he has long entertained as to the general parallelism of the lines of
;
geological elevation, and those of magnetical intensity, which the bearing
     the isodynamic lines which I have given for the Alps remarkably

be sensible, the variation of temperature being no less than
36° Cent, and as cold tends to increase the apparent intensity,
if no such increase was observed, it might plausibly be argued
that the real intensity had diminished.    It must, however, be
observed, that the observations lasted only in general from
one to two minutes, and that in so short a period (and de
pending on a single value of the elapsed time) the accelera
tion due to the above-mentioned cause would hardly be per
ceptible.   Taking the mean result of the effect of temperature
ascertained by myself for No. I. and “Flat” needles, we find
the factor –'00037 applicable to the time for a decrease of
1° R. of temperature, which agrees exactly with Hansteen's
mean correction.                  If
                        we apply this to Gay-Lussac's observa
tion we find a correction of —-0108 as a factor applicable to
the time, for the effect of —36° Cent. of temperature.      Yet

        (4500 French feet) offered a very small basis for so ge
 neral a conclusion.         But, besides this, there is an oversight
 in M. Kupffer's deductions (first pointed out to me by Pro
 fessor Necker of Geneva), which tends yet further to diminish
 the probability of his conclusions.            The estimate of the effect
 of geographical position on the magnetic intensity, M. Kupffer
 conceives to be such, that the variation for 12' in lat. (dimi
 nishing from the lower to the upper station) would exactly
 counterbalance the variation due to 38' in E. long. (also di
 minishing from the lower to the upper station); the one in
 creasing the duration of an oscillation as much as the other
                it. Now       appears from his own statement on the

the variation in the time of an oscillation would be only half

culty of ascertaining                is its
                          existence from    very limited number          a

     To   this we would reply,     that no reason can be assigned why

   being known, the direction of the lines of equal total intensity
  may be deduced geometrically.         I am, however, too well aware
  of the great uncertainty which a small error in the elements
  produces, to attempt to assign a result which might prove very
  erroneous indeed.
     Postscript.—Since this paper was written, and the results
  made public, a suggestion has been made in a quarter entitled
  to attention, as to how far the apparent diminution with height
  may be due to the hour of the day at which observations at
  great heights have usually been made. I have already stated,
  that I have attempted no correction for the hour of the day,
  owing to the want of accurate data, but I thought it worth
  while to inquire how far there was any general ground for
 such an explanation of the observed difference.         I accordingly
 divided my observations into 18 series above 4000 feet, and
 22 below that height. I found that the mean hour at which
 the former were made was 11h 12", the latter at 12" 42".
 According to the best observations, the intensity would be
 somewhat less at the former period than the latter, and would
 so far give a false indication of diminished intensity with height.
 But the variation for 1' 40" would undoubtedly be trifling,
 compared even with the small variation which the preceding
 paper assigns for 51 10 feet, which corresponds to the mean
 difference of height for the two series, the mean height for the
 first being 7160 feet, and for the second 2050.

the Royal Society of Edinburgh, is accompanied by a “Map
of the Central Alps,” shewing the lines of equal horizontal
magnetic intensity, and equal dip, in 1832.           As the magnetic
lines in this map have been projected entirely from the obser
vations recorded and discussed in the paper, we have deemed
it unnecessary to copy it.—EDIT.]
XLVI.        On a permanent Soap-bubble, illustrating the Colours
             of thin Plates. By Joseph READE, M.D.”
Noattention of
           subject in natural philosophy has more engaged the
                       the learned than the discovery of a perma
nent     soap-bubble.      Mr. Boyle, Dr. Hooke, and Sir Isaac
Newton were        among    the first, Dr. Herschel and Sir David
Brewster      among   the last experimenters. After such characters
it may appear presumptuous to enter the lists unassisted by
                      * Communicated   by the Author.

376               Dr. J.       Reade on a permanent Soap-bubble,
novelty  of experiment; I therefore rest my claims principally
on that ground, and hope in this paper that the reader may find
that interesting subject simplified.           The first account of the
colours produced by thin plates is to be found in Mr. Boyle's
works: “To show the chemist that colours may be made to
appear or vanish, where there is no accession or change either
of the sulphureous, the saline, or the mercurial principles of
bodies, he says that all chemical essential oils, as also good
spirits of wine, by shaking             they rise    till
                                                     bubbles, appear  in                                 of
various colours, which immediately vanish when the bubbles
burst,       so
             that      colourless liquor may

                                                                                   he in

tions the colours that appear            soap-bubbles, and also
                                                       in              tur                      in
pentine.      He sometimes      got   glass blown      thin              so
                                                                   exhibit           as    to
similar colours.”        Here we may remark, that although Mr.
 Boyle did not advance any theory from these experiments,
yet   it   evident that
            is                        he
                               connected the production            colours                 of

                  to                                 This suggestion                                     in
all  probability afterwards gave the idea               Dr. Hooke, and   to
finally      Sir Isaac Newton, who has the merit

a dense volume of vapour, which expelled                  the air.        now         all                      I

creased in number, but the results of the labours recorded in
them continue to become from year to year greater and more
important.     Systematic botany has received in the year which
is past numerous and valuable contributions, for a whole series
of most important works have appeared, not only on Phanero
gamia, but also on Cryptogamia; vegetable physiology, also,
has been enriched by a great amount of new data, and more
correct views have been diffused in numerous publications upon
many subjects, respecting which less accurate notions had
heretofore been entertained. Nay, the number of works which
appeared last year on subjects of physiological botany is so
great that it is impossible in the small space allowed us to go
fully into their contents, and it is more especially difficult to
accomplish this with respect to the rich contents of some of
the manuals which have appeared.
   Several subjects of vegetable physiology which have been
very fully treated of in former reports must also be now again
noticed with greater minuteness: this perhaps might seem
superfluous, but the object aimed at by the writer in these
elaborate reports is to produce an unity in the views and an
accordance in the observations and doctrines relative to the
structure and functions of vegetables; so that this science may
in the end become worthy to take        place     the side    aniits          by                  of
 mal physiology.
   Great     the loss which the circle of botanists has sustained

peared; and Valentin of Berne* has given a critical view of
the results of the principal physiological labours belonging to
the year 1835; there is no want of competition, therefore, in
works of this class, and it is only to be hoped that no one
will go so far as to make up reports out of year's reports. The
author of the present report designs to continue his labour in
future years, and, circumstances permitting, will extend it to
systematical botany also.
   Convenient as it is to science that most of the learned so
cieties now publish more or less copious notices of the labours
i.
of their members, it must still be remarked that short reports
on the contents of several memoirs, read at the meetings of
these societies, often appear in print, until at last, too fre
         after a very long interval, the entire memoirs are
published.    Since however these short reports often contain
but very incomplete statements, we have in many cases
thought it necessary to wait the appearance of the original
paper itself.
 On the Symmetry, Arrangement, and Characteristics of the
                   Nature of Plants.
  The new edition of Link's Elementa Philosophiae Botanica,
which appeared last year, begins with the remark that natural
bodies, when in a perfect state, possess a more or less sym
metrical figure.    In p. 30 he adduces proof that the entire
plant or          its
             parts are symmetrical, yet differing          little from             a
exact  symmetry.      The    plant        compound    organic
                                                      is     a   body;

384             Prof. Meyen's Report of the Progress                   of
comparison of them with the formation of the thallus in the
lower plants. “We have seen,” says he, p. 38, “according to
#.
what has been said, in the organs of vegetation a constant pro
    ession from the symmetrical to the concentric formation; not
             fixed progression, but one interrupted by fluctuations.
 The pure symmetrical formation in the lower order of plants
raised itself to the concentric on the stems of the Jungermanniae
and Lycopodiae; this however did not yet appear openly, but
still showed a considerableaffinity to the symmetrical formation.
 In the Phanerogamia a weak tendency to the symmetrical for
 mation is yet often evident in the stem; on the contrary, how
 ever, in general the most determined concentric organization
 shows itself; while in the leaves the symmetrical formation
 takes place in a manner not less remarkable than in the thal
 lus of the Cryptogamia.        In the branches we often observed a
 return to the symmetrical formation, while in the more highly
 developed leaf-forms many phaenomena pointed to the ten
 dency of the petiole of the leaf to raise itself to a concentric
 formation.      We observed in the leaved stems and in the pin
 nate leaves the symmetry showing itself in a double form:
 first, in a narrow circle, in the corresponding formation of both
 side-halves of the individual leaflet; and secondly, in a wider
 circle, in the symmetrical formation of the two opposite leaf
 lines sacrificing the symmetry of each individual leaflet.”
     In flowers it rarely occurs that they are not separated by
 a  perpendicular    section into two equal halves; and the general
 rule is that    all
                   terminal flowers are regular; that         the con       on
 trary irregular flowers are allotted                  to
                                                such inflorescences                     as
 are not terminal. According          this the symmetrical formation

by a septum.        This supposition I can fully confirm;                                                        for

               Vegetable Physiology        for the Year   1836.      387
    by Mirbel's beautiful observations on the formation of the
    pollen in the Cucurbitaceae. I myself have often thought I saw
    in the formation of the glandulae capitatae of several plants the
    origin of septa in the cells; the peculiarly formed hairs on the
   internal surface of the sacs in the genus Utricularia also ap
   pear to originate only by contraction, excrescence, and sepa
   ration.    Nay, even such a formation of more or less complete
   septa is evident in the diachymous cells of the leaves of Pinus
   silvestris; they may be seen in diagonal sections as runners
   from the internal side of the cellular septum; but a complete
   division of these cells is in truth not to be perceived.
      An increase of vegetable cells by separation has been
   already proved in a direct manner; and therefore those            di
   stinctive characters which Ehrenberg” established between
  animals and vegetables are by no means so conclusive, but
  might on the contrary be used to prove what Ehrenberg en
  deavours to refute.      Ehrenberg considers an increase by        di
  vision as a character which belongs to numerous beings
  plainly evincing themselves to be animals, and which is to
  tally wanting in plants, since the latter always grow by           in
  creasing in length and the formation of buds; and that on that
 account the Bacillariae are not plants, but must be classed with
 animals.      As it has now been proved that the division of cells
  takes   place exactly in the same manner in well-defined plants
  as in the   Bacillariae,  and as it can be shown that the separa
  tion in the increase of Infusoria and other lower animals is
 very different from this separation of vegetable cells, such a
 separation by septa might even furnish a character to               di
 stinguish vegetables from animals.
      Mohli observes that the character mentioned by Ehren
 berg, viz. the power of separation in animals, the want of it in
 plants, suffers the fate of various other distinctive characters
 which have been started separately: in general they are right, but
 in special and doubtful cases they are not to be depended on.
 Mohl here refers to his observation on the separation of the
 conferval sacs, of which we have already spoken. Mohl also
 confesses that after many years' observation he still remains
 quite in doubt as to the place which the Bacillaria, should
occupy, that however their increasing by separation does not
justify us in classing them as animals.

have of late remarked that these doubtful creatures which are
known under the name of Bacillariae ought to be arranged
with vegetables; according to this there would remain no other
botanist, with the exception of Corda, that had paid any con
 siderable attention to vegetable anatomy who did not con
 sider the Bacillariae to be plants.

    Morren, in the above-mentioned highly important memoir
on the Closteriae, has very fully              the question whether
they should be arranged with animals or vegetables; he suc
             º
ceeded,      employing very high magnifying powers, in show
ing that those red and very moveable little points discovered
by Ehrenberg at the ends of these beings were nothing else
than minute vesicles which afterwards change into new indi
viduals.    It was these moveable and as it were oscillating
points which were considered as organs of motion, and ap
peared to justify the placing of the Closteriae among animals,
which however at present, after Morren's discovery, falls to
 the ground. Besides the occurrence of these self-moving pro
pagula in the interior of the Closteria, Morren has observed
a formation of fruit by conjugation quite similar to the mode
of formation of the fruit in the Conjugatae"; and besides this,
 there also takes place an increase of the Closteriae by separa
 tlCI).

cuticula, and is only separated from this by the destruction of the
organic parts. Besides this siliceousenvelope Morren supposes
the existence of two other distinct membranes, which form the
cuticle of the Closteriae and inclose the green substance; he
however remarks that they only become evident upon the me
 tamorphosis of the plant. I consider the inner pellicle to be the
analogue of the inner envelope which is formed in the members
 of Confervae when their spores are ripened, or they begin
 to increase in any other manner, as for instance by excre
 scence and separation. Morren thinks it possible to explain
 the motion of the Closteriae by the action of opposite electri
 cities. The author also gives a very complete description,
 accompanied with drawings, of the very manifold forms which
  the Closteriae exhibit at different periods; and by this he shows
  how at least six of the new species of the genus Closterium, de
  scribed by Ehrenberg, belong to one and the same species.
      De Brébisson" also made observations on the enigmatical
  Diatomeae in order to decide the question whether they should
  be classed with animals or vegetables.         On burning a great
  number of      Fragilaria pectinalis  an animal smell was noticed.
  Such a smell would however be a very indefinite character,
  for various other Algae produce a similar odour on their being
  burnt to a coal. After the burning of the Fragilaria pecti
  malis, and various other beings of the same kind, Brébisson
  found siliceous envelopes surrounding them in a very per
   fect state, and precisely similar to those exhibited by the fossil
   Diatomeae discovered by C. Fischer in the peat-bog near Franz
   ensbad, and which led to those beautiful observations that
    Ehrenberg made known on this subject in the course of last
   year+.     The results of those latter observations belong pro
   perly to geognosy; but we must add this one remark, that
    under the fossil Infusoria hitherto discovered, only those beings
    are to be understood which botanists, as has been previously
    shown, receive as plants.      The occurrence in a fossil state of
    these minute    microscopical   plants is caused by the hard sili
    ceous   envelope,  which resists     all
                                         destroying influences.     Küt
    zing's discovery that the envelope         the Bacillaria, consists
                                                    of

 mass of such siliceous envelopes might also be produced by
 the decomposition of the plants, or in the moist way; and also
 that the mountain masses, which consist more or less of such si
 liceous envelopes, might not always be regarded as being pro
 duced by the action of heat at the bottom of the sea".                  Bré
 bisson tries to bring the Diatomeae into two divisions, viz. the
 proper Diatomeae, which exhibit a siliceous envelope, and the
 Desmidiac, which are without a siliceous coating and entirely
 reduceable to carbon.           In the more perfect plants, the epi
 dermis of which is penetrated by a siliceous envelope, it would
 at least be improper to make such divisions; in this case, how
 ever, they may be of some use.
    In a recent memoir Mohlt has again declared himself
 against the animal nature of the Bacillariae.             “I   admit,” says
 he, “that the doubt which was raised respecting their vege
 table nature is not yet removed; their animal nature however
 has been as little proved, and we find evident transitions from
 them to vegetables, &c.

wild.      The deputation left Calcutta in the end of August, and reached
the Kossia Mountains early in October.         In crossing the Delta of the
Ganges and Bramaputra (Burrampooter), a high tract of land, two or
three hundred feet above the level of the plain, was observed (but not ex
amined) near Dacca. Between this and the Kossia Mountains, distant
sixty miles, the old channel of the latter river extends, so that the
above highland is situated between the channels of the two great rivers. .
The country is generally composed of silt, but at Mymensing (where
the navigation is most obstructed), the Bramaputra crosses abed of yel
low clay containing ferruginous and calcareous (the kunkar of India)
concretions.     The author thinks this bed of clay extends from the
above high land to the foot of the Kossia Mountains, or the extreme
point of the portion called the Garrow Hills, where the late Mr. Scott
found the fossil remains of animals.       The partially inundated plain at
 the foot of these mountains is interspersed throughout with small
 rounded hills, which reposing on the above-mentioned yellow clay
 are themselves composed of various layers of sands, clays, gravels,
 and boulders, even at the greatest heights.         These appear to be the
 remains of a talus of great extent, which had covered the foot of these
 mountains and been swept away by the Soorma and other great rivers
 falling from them.
     The foot of the mountains is composed of a rock in which Num
 mulites are imbedded in a compact calcareous basis. Sandstones
 seemed to rest upon this, but the relative position of the two rocks
 could not be clearly ascertained from the dense vegetation and the
 short time available for the examination.
      On ascending to Cherraponji, a sanatory station established at
 an ascertained height of above 5000 feet, the limestone was soon
 lost sight of; but great masses of sandstones presented themselves,
 which had been rent and the fissures filled up with boulders and gra
 vel.     If the mountain acclivity be supposed to be divided into three
 stages, the first forms a steep slope covered with deep soil and vege
  tation; the second is precipitous and more or less naked; and the
  third is composed of sloping ridges terminating in mountain and table
  lands from 5000, to near 6000 feet high.
      At the top of the first stage, or at about fifteen hundred feet above
  the sea level, the author discovered a well-defined marine beach, con
  taining shells and other marine exuviae about two feet deep, and
  reposing upon sandstone and covered with soil. The shells consist
  of Pectens, Cardia, Ostreas, Terebratulae, and Melaniae, mineralized
  by a fine yellow sandy matter, and united together by a brown indu
  rated clay. Between the curved slaty layers of animal matter and
  shells, as well as in nests, loose sand is found. The whole presented
   the form of shingles caused on a beach subject to tides.    In the course
   of an hour several hundreds were, and with more time many thousands
   might have been obtained. These shells were compared with a col
   lection of about one hundred and fifty species from the Bay of Bengal
   and the estuaries of the great rivers, but not one was found to cor
   respond; nor with those found by the late Dr. Gerrard in the second
   ary strata on the north of the Himalaya; but a small collection of

about one hundred species from the Paris basin were at once recog
mised by the author as familiar objects, from his acquaintance with
those from Kossia and Cherraponji : these consisted of about an equal
number of species, and on being submitted to systematic comparison
about twenty species were found to be identical in the two collections.
   On crossing this deposit, the rock composing the superficial strata
of sandstone forming the precipices of the second part of the ascent,
was found to contain the impressions of shells and other organic re
mains, which the author believes to be ramose Alcyonia; these
continued to appear      the way

   containing crystals of the same mineral, and in others as hornblende
   slate; all, and especially the second, with veins and beds of quartz
   projecting upwards, the veins often radiating irregularly from the beds.
  Along the veins a laminated structure is produced in the rock; this
  structure follows the course of the vein, and disappears as you recede
  from one vein, re-appearing again as you approach another.
      These, as well as many other objects of geological interest, could
  only be cursorily observed from the necessity of accompanying the
  expedition. Hot and salt springs,       from the latter the natives derive
  a muriate of soda, as well as fossil bones, as first discovered by the
  late Mr. Scott, present themselves along the base of the mountains.
      The author also collected about one hundred and sixty species of
  the animals, chiefly birds, from the forests of Assam, which have been
  forwarded to the India House, as well as one hundred and twenty
  species of the fishes of the Bramaputra in Upper Assam ; many of
  which are identical with Hamilton's Gangetic species, but several are
 new ; regarding the habits and peculiarities of which the author states

     On the remains of a fossil Monkey from the tertiary strata of the
 Sewalik Hills in the north of Hindoostan; by Captain P. T. Cautley,
 F.G.S., Bengal Artillery, and H. Falconer, M.D., Bengal Medical
 Service.
     The authors commence their paper with       some general observations
 on the differences in habit in different animals, which prevent the
 remains of some being so frequently preserved as those of others
 in a fossil state, and they adduce as instances birds and quadrumanous
 animals. So speedily are the remains of these carried away by the
 hyaena, the chacal and wolf, the scavengers of torrid regions, that in
 India, the   traces of casualties are so seldom seen, -even where mon
 keys occupy in large societies the groves of mango trees round villages,
—that the simple Hindoo believes they bury their dead by night.
     The authors since engaged in the examination of the Sewalik fos
 sils, were early led to anticipate the finding of some quadrumanous
animals, and several months ago obtained an astragalus of the right
hind leg, which they minutely describe, and compare with that of the
recent Semnopithecus         Entellus; which, though, certainly belonging
to a distinct    species, it closely resembles both in size and general
form, as is exemplified in the specimen sent with the fossil astragalus.
This was completely mineralized, having a sp. gr. of about 2:8 and
appearing to be impregnated with hydrate of iron. Although only a
solitary bone of the foot, the relations of structure are so fixed that
the identity of the fossil is as certain as if the entire skeleton had been
found.       But the authors deferred making the announcement, in the
hopes of soon finding specimens of the cranium and teeth; these have
been discovered by Messrs. Baker and Durand of the Bengal Engi
neers, who have obtained a considerable portion of the face, and the
whole series of molars of one side of a quadrumanous animal, be
longing to a much larger species than theirs.

 a member of the oldest Pachydermatous genus of Europe and reptiles
 of the present day.
    The camel (Camelus Sivalensis, F. and C.), antelope, and ano
 plotherium have been exhumed from the same bed. There have been
 found also the elephant, mastodon, hippopotamus (H. Sivalensis and
 H. dissimilis, F. and C.), rhinoceros, hog, and horse, together with the
 Sivatherium giganteum, a huge ruminant, exceeding in size the largest
 rhinoceros, armed with four enormous horns, divided and foli
 ated like the dicranocerine antelopes.       There is also a musk deer
 scarcely larger than a hare; specimens of the cat (Felis cristata,
 F. and C.) and of the dog tribe; the hyaena, bear (Ursus Sivalensis,
 F. and C.), and ratel, with other carnivora. Of the feathered tribe,
 there are Grallae much larger than the gigantic crane of Bengal
 (Ciconia Argala).     Of reptiles, besides the magar and gavial, there
 are other crocodiles of enormous size (C. Leptorhyncus crassidens,
 F. and C.); and of Testudinata ordinary-sized species of emys and
 trionyx, with humeri and femora as well as corresponding fragments
 of the bucklers of a species as large as the corresponding bones of
 the Indian rhinoceros. The authors refer to the “Journal” and “Re
 searches of the Asiatic Society of Bengal"        ["the Asiatic Researches"]

    December 27th, 1836.-The remainder of M. F. Cuvier's Paper
  on the Jerboas and Gerbillas was read.
    M. Cuvier commences this memoir with observing that his atten
 tion has been particularly directed to the Rodentia, with a view of
 arriving at a natural classification of the numerous species composing
 that order, among which considerable confusion had hitherto pre
 vailed, particularly in the genera Dipus and Gerbillus, the relations
 of which to other allied groups have been but very imperfectly un
 derstood by previous writers.
    The species included in the genus Dipus have been formed by
 M. Lichtenstein into three divisions, which are distinguished by the
 absence and number of rudimentary toes upon the hind feet. In the
first section are placed those with three toes,         all
                                                         perfectly formed;            in
 the second, those with four, one        of which rudimentary; and
                                                   is                        the in
 third, those with five, two      of  these being rudimentary.      M. Cuvier
              he    unacquainted with the second division             M. Lich
                                                                        to of

distinguished from those     of  the third    by the form      the teeth, and

genus for the Jerboas with five toes, adopting the name Allactaga,
given  by  Pallas   to aspecies,    as the common generic appellation.

     “We know,”      observes M. Cuvier, “that the three principal toes
 of the  Allactagas,   as well as the three only toes of the Jerboas, are
articulated to a    single metatarsal bone, and that the two rudimentary
toes of the first   genus  have each their metatarsal bone; whence it
results that the    penultimate  segment of the foot is composed of three
bones in the    Allactagas,  and of one only in the Jerboas. The incisors
of the Allactagas are simple, whilst those in the upper-jaw of the
Jerboas are divided longitudinally by a furrow. The molars of the
latter genus are complicated in form, and but little resemble those of
the former. They are four in number in the upper-jaw, and three in
the lower, but the first in the upper is a small rudimentary tooth,
which probably disappears in aged individuals.”
    The structure of the grinding teeth is then described in detail, and
illustrated by drawings which accompanied the paper.
    “The general structure of the head of the Allactagas and Jerboas
is evidently the same, and is characterized by the large size of the
cranium, the shortness of the muzzle, and above          by the magnitude           all
of   the suborbital foramina.        The cranium             the Jerboa    ofdistin               is
guished      by   its
                  great breadth posteriorly, resulting from the enormous
development         the tympanic bone, which extends beyond the occi
                    of
 pital posteriorly and laterally            far    as the zygomatic arch, which
                                                                 as

of the ear are of moderate dimensions. Another differential character

BRITISH ASSOCIATION                FOR          THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE :
                             MEETING            AT LIVERPOOL.
   Sept. 13.—Professor Graham made a communication on the sub
ject of the Inorganic Salts, and in particular, on the function which
water discharges as an element of their composition.     He had been
requested, at the meeting of the Association held in Dublin, to re
port at some future meeting on the present state of our knowledge
of saline bodies; and his communication to the Section was under
stood to have been made with the view of discharging the duty
which had been thus imposed on him.
   The Professor developed at some length his own views respect
ing the constitution of salts.  The hydrated acids are unquestion
ably salts, having water as base, and they correspond in a remark
able manner with the salts having for base magnesia, oxide of zinc,
oxide of copper, or any other oxide isomorphous with magnesia.
Hence water as a base belongs to the magnesian class of oxides.
Super or acid salts have two bases, of which water is one. They are
double salts, and correspond with the double salts of the same acids
containing magnesia, oxide of copper, &c. Thus the salt called the
binoxalate of potash is really a double oxalate of water and potash,
and corresponds in constitution with the double oxalate of copper
and potash, as will be seen on comparing their formulae below:
                              K    CC H CC H2, and
                              K CC         Cu CC          H2.
     Mr. Graham's researches tend to prove that                       all
                                                             salts are neutral

    composition, with the exception          certain specified classes. One
of in
    these classes     the phosphates,
                       is                    which there are three kinds,
containing respectively one, two, and three atoms                 base        of
                                                                            one              to
atom    of  acid, and for which the names of monobasic, bibasic, and
tribasic phosphates are proposed,           substitution for the old names
                                                     in
of  metaphosphates, pyrophosphates, and common phosphates.                                         In

stallization, but which Mr. Graham distinguishes as constitutional
water.     Now it appears that metallic oxides may be substituted for
this constitutional water; and it is in this way that subsalts come to
be produced.     Thus the salt called subnitrate of copper is really a
nitrate of water with three atoms oxide of copper attached to that
combination in the place of water of crystallization.     The nitrate of
water, or nitric acid of specific gravity 1.42, the nitrate of copper,
and the submitrate of copper, are                                  all

vitriol or the sulphate of water absorbs the same proportion of    am
monia, the bisulphate of ammonia being produced.          The two pro
ducts are of the same constitution.      The basic adjunct, ammonia,
is attached to oxide of copper in the one case, and to oxide of hy
drogen in the other.      Both are double salts, and may be expressed
by the following formulae:–
                         Cu S + NH3 Cu S, and
                            H S + NH3 H S.
It  thus appears that the ordinary ammoniacal salts which contain
water, are a particular class of an extensive order of salts; as, for
the water there may be substituted oxide of copper, oxide of zinc,
nickel, cobalt, and many others. Many of these combinations are
capable of assuming an additional dose of ammonia, which, however,
is feebly retained, and is in a relation to the salt like that of water
of crystallization.
    In the discussion which took place on Prof. Graham's communica
tion, Mr. Richard Phillips gave it as his opinion, that the difference
between constitutional water and basic water arises from the well
known law, that when one principle combines with more proportions
than one of another, the first proportion is held with a stronger af.
finity than the others.-Mr. G. Bird could not conceive how water
 could be considered as a base, and inquired what view Professor
 Graham would take of the function of the atom of water in oil of
 vitriol and in caustic potash.--Dr. Faraday expressed his satisfac
tion that such a variety of opinions should be advanced, and even be
maintainable by powerful arguments, upon so interesting a subject;
 for, from this collision of opinion, it was most likely that the truth
 would ultimately be struck out. He also cautioned chemists against
 considering electrical relations as affording, in every instance, con
 clusive proofs of what is a base and what is an acid.—Prof. Johnston
 concurred in the observation of Dr. Faraday, and professed that he
 had a very strong leaning to the theoretical views in reference to
 the constitution of salts which had been just propounded by Pro
 fessor Graham.—Dr. Kane made some remarks on the same sub
ject, objecting to some of Professor Graham's statements.            To
these Professor Graham briefly replied, and the discussion closed.—

       ON THE ARTIFICIAL PREPARATION OF FORMIC ACID.
    Prof. J. B. Emmet of the University of Virginia makes the fol
lowing observations respecting, and proposes the annexed methods
 of preparing formic acid :
   One part of tartaric acid (or sugar), one and a half of peroxide
of manganese, one and a half of sulphuric acid, diluted with about
two and a half parts of water, when well mixed and subjected to
distillation, will furnish the formic acid according to Doebereiner's
process.     In order to diminish the inconvenience arising from the
frothing of this mixture, and which is exceedingly great, it is directed
to add only half the amount of dilute acid at first, and to make use
of a retort having five or six times the bulk of the matter to be put
into it.
     The explanation given by Doebereiner and other chemists, assigns
to the peroxide of manganese an agency absolutely necessary for suc
cess, viz. that, while it parts with a portion of
                                                                         it its
                                                          own oxygen and
combines,      the protoxide,
                    as          with sulphuric   acid,      enabled by the        is

                                          to
the formic and carbonic acids.
   The whole      this explanation

in the process, we shall have (4 C+4O4-4 H), from which subtract
H, or one atom of water, (removed by the sulphuric acid,) and we
shall have 4 C+3 O-H-3 H, which is equivalent to one atom of for
mic acid (2 C+3 O-H-H) together with 2 carbon, precipitated, and
2 hydrogen, unaccounted for. Again, assuming (6 C+5 O+5 H)
as the formula for one atom of starch, and subtracting 2 H, or two
atoms of water, removed by the sulphuric acid, the remainder will
be equivalent to one atom of formic acid, (2 C+3 O+H) together
with 4 atoms of carbon deposited, and 2 atoms of hydrogen unac
counted for.
   During the preparation of formic acid by Dübereiner's process,
as well as by my own, in which no peroxide of manganese is em
ployed, there is always formed, previous to the carbonization, a con
siderable quantity of volatile oil, which, at first, might be considered
as arising from the excess of hydrogen and carbon in the process;
but a special inquiry has convinced me that this is not the case, al
though the           oil

  I DOUBT       whether there is any part of natural history in

 of affinity and analogy as in systematic botany. It          con                        is,

 ceive,       to   this cause that we must ascribe the widely different
opinions entertained                    by
                          botanists upon the manner          which                       in

we can hope        discover the true principle

extensively the present fundamental distinctions       Polypetalae,          of
Monopetalae, and Apetalae            Incompletae, interfere with

410                  Prof. Lindley's Remarks upon the
serted that Orobanchaceae have the flowers of Personatae and
the fruit of Gentianaceae, and he accordingly stationed the
order between Gentianaceae and Gesneraceae (Naturliches Sy
stem, p. 395); and two years afterwards the Russian naturalist
Horaninow placed the order under the name of Phelypaeaceae,
between Monotropaceae (confined to the genus Monotropa)
and Gesneraceae, stationing Gentianaceae next the latter and
separating the whole from Scrophulariaceae by twelve natural
orders (Primac lineae Systematis Naturae, p. 73).                It does not
however appear whether these two last botanists formed their
opinion from a correct knowledge of the real nature of the fruit
of Orobanche; it would rather seem that they were led to their
 conclusion by the parietal placentation of that genus, a cir
 cumstance of no great consequence.
    The great points of resemblance between Orobanche and
Scrophulariaceae are                 its
                             monopetalous didynamous flowers and
 bicarpellary polyspermous fruit; and                 these which have led
                                                                it   is
 to the  general   opinion   that the two      genera     are closely allied.
 Such marks          of
                    agreement are doubtless important; but they
maybe overbalanced                    by
                              circumstances          disagreement   of  more             of

personate, labiate,         irregular plants, the carpels stand fore
and aft with respect          the axis; while
                                      to                Gentianaceae, andin

412   Remarks upon the Botanical Affinities    of Orobanche.
system, must be considered nearly related members          of the
same natural series.
   I am unwilling to dismiss     this subject without adverting to
the   placentation  of Orobanchaceae. That their capsule con
sists of two carpels standing right and left of the axis of in
florescence, and with the margins not inflected in the form of
dissepiments, is incontestable. Yet in Orobanche and Phely
paca the capsule has four placentae, placed equidistant in pairs
upon the face of each valve or carpel, and considerably within
the margin.     In Epiphegus each carpel has two intramarginal
placentae, which diverge from the base upwards, and terminate
before reaching the apex. In Lathraea there is to each valve
but one placenta, which may be regarded as two confluent
ones occupying the very face of the dorsal suture of the car
pel.    And finally in AEginetia indica, and I believe in AEgi
netia abbreviata also, the placenta is in like manner confined
to the axis of the valve, occupying the same position upon the
 carpels as in Lathraea, but broken up into a number of pa
rallel plates of unequal depth, over the whole surface of which
multitudes of minute seeds are distributed.       If   we connect
these facts, about which there can be no sort of question, with
the well known placentation of Flacourtiaceae, Nymphaeaceae,
and Butomaceae, we shall find that they invalidate a general
carpological rule, that the placentae belong to the ventral su
 ture of a carpel, and consequently alternate with the dorsal;
 and we shall have to admit that the position of the placentae
with regard to the margins of the carpel is reducible to no
 certain rule, but depends upon specific organization.        Con
 sequently we shall no longer be unable to account for the un
 usual situation of the placentae opposite the stigma, in Papaver,
 (as M. Kunth has lately noticed) in Parnassia, or elsewhere.
    We ought not indeed to be surprised at coming to this
 result; for if the ovules are, as botanists generally believe
 them to be, a modification of buds, then the uncertainty in
 the position of the placentary lines will only be conformable
 to the uncertainty in the origin of buds from leaves.       If  in
 Bryophyllum, Malawis paludosa, and most other cases they
 usually spring from the edge of the leaf, they also arise from
 its surface in ferns; and in the famous case of the Ornitho
galum leaf mentioned by Turpin, they were found issuing           in
 discriminately from  all      of

414        The Rev. J. B. Reade's further       Observations
males de  Chimie, vol. lxi. p. 187. ......      Both these observers
conclude that these foreign principles were produced by the
organic power of vegetation.” Unfortunately, however, these
experiments, and others similar to these, though conducted by
able naturalists, have as yet failed to gain any very general ac
quiescence in the conclusions which are drawn from them.
And this arises from the gratuitous supposition that not only
undetected sources of error may possibly have existed, but
that the very presence of foreign matter in the ashes proves
error to be unavoidable.
   The facts which I have already brought forward, in my
former paper, have led me to adopt the conclusion of Bra
connot, and to dismiss, as altogether untenable, any supposi
tion of accidental introduction with respect to the elements of
vegetable structure.      For, if it is not to be doubted but that
the  presence   of  organization     is direct evidence of the pre
sence and agency of life, and that every organized portion
of a plant is a proper product of the power of vegetation,
then it will follow, that the place which the solid materials
occupy is an important and an appointed one, and we shall
be warranted to say, under a more extended application
of Professor Henslow's own remark, that the process of re
spiration prepares the organizable materials", whether car
bonaceous, siliceous, saline, or metallic, from whose subse
quent elaboration are derived those infinitely varied condi
tions of organized matter which are essential to the develop
ment of the numerous tribes of plants; and here I cannot
but add in the eloquent language of this author, that “from
these same materials are constructed those organized sub
stances which seem to stand as portals to the intellectual and
spiritual world—channels of direct communication by which
reason and revelation may tell the frail tenants of a few mould
ering atoms, of that more glorious condition which will as
certainly be their heritage hereafter as their hopes and yearn
ings after immortality are within the actual experience of their
present state.”
   On communicating the nature and result of my experi
ments to Professor Henslow I was gratified by receiving the
following reply: “Mr. R. Brown, with whom I have had
some conversation upon the subject of your letter, confirms
your conclusion that silica enters as an organizable product
into the structure of plants, and I have now no doubt of the
fact from what you and he have stated, though I had not sus
pected it before.     Mr. Brown told me that he had long since
 made experiments similar to yours, but had never published
                  •  Principles of Botany, p. 202.

                     on Structure             in the Ashes of Plants.                         4.15
them, and I had not heard of them.” I have myself also been
favoured by Mr. Brown with some account of his experiments.
He showed me in the ashes of one plant, what I have never
seen      elsewhere,         beautiful form of siliceous cellular
                              a very
structure, having the walls of the cells covered with minute
siliceous granules; and in another plant, owing to the pre
sence of some alkaline product, the silica which it contained
was readily fused, and Mr. Brown was therefore able, by
                     j
careful incineration, to procure perfect spherical lenses.
    Having now satisfactorily ascertained that the siliceous or
ganization of recent plants is not destructible even under the
blowpipe, it appeared to me to follow, as a natural inference,
that the less intense heat of a common fire would not destroy
the siliceous organization in the fossil plants of coal.                                      Ac
cordingly, I        in the white ashes of coal all the usual forms
of   vegetable  structure,  viz. cellular structure, smooth and
spiral fibre, and annular ducts. An engraving of some of
these forms accompanied my former paper, and perhaps a
still more accurate idea may be given of them if I refer to
the late Mr. Slack's drawings of the tissue of plants in the
Transactions of the Society of Arts, vol. xlix. plate 6. The
elementary organs represented by Mr. Slack possess of course
their due admixture of carbonaceous matter, and there can
be no doubt that the removal of the carbon, by fire, would
be universally supposed, d priori, to be accompanied with the
destruction of the tissue.     But so far from this being the case,
the most delicate markings remain undisturbed, and I can
confidently refer to figures 7, 12, 21 b, 23, 26, 27, 28, 30, as
most accurate representations of the vegetable forms which
occur in the white ashes of coal.
    The vegetable origin of coal, which even at this day                                  is,    by
some persons, admitted rather than believed",          thus clearly              is
proved, and from       comparison
                              a        the ashes      of
                                                    coal with those      of

 coal appear to be so different, that  think by the aid of the       I

              due weight with the geologist.  From these facts
it   is  evident that the true framework and basis                     vegetable              of

  I      find, upon further investigation, that silica             not the only         is

not be uninteresting to return to Fresnel's reasoning throug
which the equation to the wave-surface was originally esta
blished, so as to facilitate the comparison of Fresnel's ideas

the following very brief remarks.   It seems to have been ge
nerally considered that M. Cauchy's wave-surface is identical
with that of Fresnel, but I confess that I do not think that
this point has been sufficiently considered; and indeed it has
already been asserted by Mr. Kelland that little construction
beyond the explanation of dispersion can be put upon M.
Cauchy's results, from their great complexity.

Moreover Fresnel's wave-surface depends upon the situation

422     The Rev.         J. B. Reade         on the Chemical Composition
three elements, oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon, the exact pro
portion in which these are united being uncertain; and that
therefore it remains to be ascertained whether the two organic
elements of vegetable structure are identical in chemical com
position, and whether the membrane and fibre which com
pose the cells and tubes in different parts of plants are always
of the same kind. It is further observed by the same author
that an inquiry into this subject would be one of extreme dif
ficulty, if not of absolute impossibility with the present resources
of chemistry.
   It gives me great pleasure to be able to lay before the
members of the British Association a few well ascertained
facts on a subject, of which the difficulty has hitherto pre
vented it from being placed even among the debatable ques
tions in the philosophy of botany.     Having, on many occa
sions, had the good fortune to witness the admirable tact with
which Mr. Robert Rigg, of Walworth, effects the chemical
analysis of vegetable products, I felt convinced, when I saw
Professor Henslow's remarks, that the difficulty, which has
appeared to be almost insurmountable, would be readily over
come in my friend's laboratory".                            I
                                       therefore separated the
spiral vessels which form the central column of the roots of
the hyacinth from their surrounding cellular tissue, and the
membrane and fibre thus obtained furnished upon analysis
the following results.

I quite expected would be the case, from observing that those
spiral vessels which line the interior surface of the hollow
flower-stalk, emerge, not into the petals but into the pistils
and stamens of the flowers.
   In order to carry out this investigation still further, I se
parated the flower-stalk of the hyacinth into four distinct parts,
among which the obvious variety both of structure and func
tions is not more marked than the diversity of their chemical
composition.       The parts to which I allude are,
   The epidermis with        stomata.  its
   The   soft,  bright green cellular tissue beneath the epidermis.
   The compact column                        of
                                ducts and fibre forming the main
support      ofthe stalk.
   And the spiral vessels which line the inner surface         this                                       of
hollow column.
   Mr. Rigg has furnished me with the following analysis                                                         of

      “Professor Henslow observed that in his work he had                                  al

  brane or fibre.  The cells of the cellular tissue must contain
  some fluid matter in their interior, besides the fibre that lined
 them externally [? internally]. Mr. Rigg had experimented
 on spiral vessels which contained both membrane and fibre;
 therefore the ultimate composition of membrane and fibre was
 still a desideratum.   Professor Lindley said it was important
 that facts of this kind should be well made out. As a proof
 of want of care in the paper, it might be inferred, from the
 author's statements, that there were no spiral vessels in the
 petals of the hyacinth; but the fact      they are very abunis,

   Now it will be found upon examination that the vesicles of
the cellular tissue are formed, with comparatively few excep

 Professor Henslow observes”, “ consists of tubes which are
 also formed of membrane to                                   all

 from the one you suggest.
    The facts brought forward are these: The spiral vessels
 of  the root give hydrogen            excess, and the cellular tissue
                                                      in                                                            of

                                  excess.                          It    is
 lysing different parts             the flower that the petals con
 tain        an
            excess        oxygen, while the pistils and pollen are

        found

hydrogen, emerging, not into the petals, but into the pistils

of   potassium, there is ammonia disengaged, and a brown
powder formed. To this reaction I shalifiereafter recur in
order to determine the composition of this yellow powder,
the following experiments were made:–
    A.—100 parts of corrosive sublimate were dissolved in
water, and ammonia added in excess.        The mass, in place of
being filtered cold, was boiled until the light-white precipitate
was changed into the clear yellow heavy powder; it was then
filtered, and the quantity of product determined.     The liquor
and   washings  were acidulated by  nitric acid, and precipitated
by nitrate of silver, and the chloride abstracted from the sub
limate thus determined; the liquor contained a very small
trace of mercury.     Several experiments were made on this
plan, the results of which are exhibited in the following table:
    100 parts of sublimate gave,
             Exp.              Yellow powder.                    Chlorine in liquor.

    100  parts       of
                   white precipitate were boiled with water until
 completely converted into the yellow powder; the liquor,
 which was quite neutral, was acidulated; and the chlorine dis
 solved precipitated                                   of

    C.—100 grains of white precipitate were boiled with water
 until completely decomposed; the resulting yellow powder
 weighed 91.15 grains.         The liquor was cautiously evaporated

    D.—It has been already stated, that when this powder is
heated, it is resolved into ammonia, azote, water, calomel, and
    º
quicksilver.      Having found that, by performing this operation
in a very small retort, the water and gases could be dissipated
without any remarkable loss of the other constituents, I made
some trials in this way to determine the amount of the chlo
rine and quicksilver.        For this purpose a higher temperature
is             than for the corresponding analysis of white pre
cipitate, and the condensation of the mercurial vapour must
be very carefully effected.         In other respects the manipula
tion was the same, and the following table contains the re
sults:

   From this result we can easily calculate the quantities of

436                   Prof. Meyen's Report of the Progress of
has succeeded in doing this will in part be shown in the course
of this report from the observations of other botanists.
    Mohl finds this homogeneous substance most clearly in the
Algae between the cells, which are combined by it into a
whole.
    In the Nostochineae, Rivulariae, in Protococcus, Palmella,
Hydrurus, Oscillatoria, Scytonema, &c. the more or less thick
mucous or gelatinous substance is to be regarded as the
analogue of the intercellular substance in the perfect plants.
In the proper Confervae the common mucous substance has
disappeared, or only forms a very thin envelope over the
fibres, so that these are lubricated and rendered slippery by
it,
               a no
     but    longer combine into masses; instead      which they                      of
possess      homogeneous external tube. Of the true Con
fervae the Spirogyrae                    of
                            Link are those which possess the
  reatest mucous  envelope,  and    those,     also inother Con            as        in
fervae, we can observe that this mucous substance becomes
thicker with increasing age, and that        the young plants        in                                it
is entirely wanting. According       this, the view which Mohl
                                                         to
has advanced on the nature of intercellular substance can
hardly         be
             extended             to
                           this substance.
         In
      the more    compound     Algae this mucous matter, accord
ing   toMohl's   observation,     not only disposed
                                              is           the surface               on
of the entire plant, but also between the individual cells, which
had already been observed                      by
                                     Eysenhard and Agardh; and
since this  homogeneous     substance entirely fills the intervening
space       of
           the cells, the intercellular passages are totally want
ing these vegetables.
       in                                In
                               the thallus                         of
                                              Ferns the intercellular
substance forms less remarkable constituent part than
                            a                                      the                            in

             this case       the cells

transparent      water, which are connected
                       in                             this substance,           by
 sothat here also                no
                           intercellular passages remain.          the                         In
more perfect plants                     easy   demonstrate the pre

                                                              as
the cells lie      closer contact with each other, but since also
                       in
intercellular passages run between their parenchymatous cells.
Mohl however alleges that notwithstanding these difficulties,
we may still succeed         many cases
                                   in         meeting with this mass

              in           other.    Mohl then enumerates        num                       is a
ber of instances       which the intercellular substance
                            in                                  found
in mosses, ferns,       the wood

cotyledones.      The intercellular substance shows itself more
plainly       the protended thick-sided cells which often occur
              in

                   Vegetable Physiology             for the Year 1886.                        437
in the bark of the stem, or under the epidermis in the petiole
of   the leaf, than between the woody cells.                we examine    If
this cellular mass in the stem of Sambucus            nigra   in diagonal
 sections, the cellular cavities appear at first sight to be very
irregularly distributed in a completely homogeneous glass-like
 transparent substance; by a more accurate examination it is
however evident that this substance is not totally homogeneous,
but that it separates into cellular membranes and into inter
cellular substance.        The lines of demarcation are said to be
very fine and easily overlooked.
    Our views on this point are very different from those of
 Mohl. If we take very thin sections, and observe them with
 a magnifying power of 1000 or 1800, with achromatic glasses,
no lines can be perceived distinguishing the exterior surface
 of the cellular membrane from the intercellular substance;
but it can be plainly seen that there takes place a gradual
transition from the substance of the membrane of the cell into
the so-called intercellular substance. I will also mention an
observation which most clearly proves that the intercellular
substance of Mohl is no peculiar separately constituted sub
stance, which is as it were diffused between the cells, but that
it belongs to the cellular partitions, and is secreted by them
when a more close connection of such cells is to take place.
If,  for instance, we observe          diagonal sections the solid cel
                                              in

                                                         Beta Cicla (the
red   variety      best for this purpose), we find that the so-called

                                                   in
cellular layers; we however can distinguish even with weaker
magnifying powers that                  to
                                 each one               of
                                              the surrounding cellular

case   is   precisely similar; and consequently his view              the                of

 438            Prof. Meyen's Report of the Progress of
tions; never, on the contrary, between simple sacs in any per
ceptible quantities; the cause of which lies in the very exist
ence of the intercellular substance.           Valentin's observations
also show, that the intercellular substance does not exist at
the beginning, but occurs first after the commencement of lig
nification, and must therefore certainly be distinguished from
the substance which is found around and between the sacs of
the lower Cryptogamia.           We have however previously men
tioned, that this substance is also wanting in germinating
Confervae. Since the intercellular substance, observes Wa
lentin, appears first after the process of lignification*, it can
not be regarded as an organic mucus which holds the cells
together.        It is no less a secondary layer without the primi
tive sac than the ligneous lamellae are within the same.                  It
occurs only where a considerable number of ligneous lamellae
exist. If we may use an old technical expression, the intercel
lular substance occurs in all cases where thick-sided cells are
closely connected with one another, few or no intercellular
passages remaining.
     Closely connected with this subject are the observations
which have been made on the structure of cellular membrane.
 Mohl in the above-mentioned memoir has given an accurate de
scription of the stripy structure of the partitions of the cells of the
liber of Nerium Oleander, Vinca minor, and various other plants
belonging to the families Apocyneae and Asclepiadeae.                These
cells show in a       diagonal  section,   as also in a horizontal one,
that their sides consist of a       great  number of superincumbent
membranes. The cells of the liber of Winca throw more light on
 the subject; Mohl describes them as broad, abruptly and
greatly contracted at their ends, sides not very thick, and com
 posed of several layers. In the wider parts the membrane was
 covered with spiral, steep, ascending lines, and so that a part of
 these lines wound round to the right, the other to the left, and
 in this manner the membrane was divided into small rhom
 boidal portions.        Mohl previously supposes, that the lines are
 wound in the one layer to the right, in the other to the left,
 and that the layers which compose these cellular membranes
 are not homogeneous, but possess a fibrous texture.
     “Are     we now to deduce from this aspect of the tubes of the
 liber of the plants above cited,” says Mohl, “the view already
 entertained by Grew, that the cellular membrane is woven toge
 ther of fibres? I do not think so. As far as we can observe of
 these extremely delicate formations, discernible only with good
    * The author, differing from other phytotomists, understands by ligni
 fication, nothing more than the thickening of the sides of the cells by the
  deposition of new layers.

                   Vegetable Physiology         for    the     Year 1836.                          439
instruments and under favourable light, the substance of these
apparent fibres appears to be exactly the same as that which
fills out the intermediate spaces; and this fibrous appearance
seems to indicate not the existence of real separate fibres, but
rather a small difference in the thickness of the cellular mem
brane: perhaps a different arrangement of the molecules at
various points, perhaps a small difference in the thickness of
the membrane causes a different refraction of light, precisely
in the same way as fibres are visible in badly melted glass.”
 Mohl also throws out the opinion that such a texture of the
 cellular membrane is very common, as several observations
 have seemed to prove to him.
    Valentin (l.c. p. 89) repeated these observations of Mohl,
 and has completed them in many respects.         He observed per
fectly well in the cells of theliber of Nerium odorum, that the dia
 gonal or rather horizontal stripes which these cells exhibit are
 found entirely outside, while the spirals which cross one another
are found in different lamellae bent over each other. And in
 each partition of the cells these spirals always take one and
the same direction; and for that reason they must cross in
opposite partitions. Valentin observes this structure of the tubes
of the liber and woody cells in various other cases partly known,
and partly not yet noticed, and arrives at the conclusion that
they are      without exception lignifications, and that their par
             all
titions are never those          of
                                 the primary cellular sac alone, but
that   they are also covered with ligneous lamellae.              And,                               as
Valentin had not        yet    found these   spiral   lines     the more      in
simple cells and septa (in which they however occur quite                                            as

                this subject.
    Valentin      the same time gives
                   at                         historya     the formation of
of   the spiral  stripes,   which are    certainly  very difficult      ob                    to
serve  in their formation.        “In the centre of the tube of the
liber very fine granular substance perceived, the granules

  regarded as a layer of spiral tubes which are easily unrolled.
  Link found under these another layer or membrane consisting
  of long parenchymatous cells, which are closed at one end,
  and contain fibres just beginning to be evident; but at the other
  end are spiral fibres which became true spiral vessels.                On
  this  ground   Link has advanced the          opinion  that the cellular
  membrane changes with age into spiral fibres; this is repre
  sented in Plate          III.

  voured to confirm the opinion that the cellular membrane is
  composed of fibres having a spiral course. .

 of new layers is called by Valentin the process of lignification,

the gap originates between the partitions of contiguous cells,
and indeed from a local separation of the membranes, and the
real dots, here showing                     as the small and interior
circles, which consist of a cavity on the interior partition of the
cellular membrane raised towards the inner side.
    Valentin himself confesses that the porous opening exhibits
                                                                                        44.1
quite different forms, not only in different plants, but also at
times in various parts of the same plant; but nevertheless he
considers it necessary to give various denominations to the
different parts. Thus he calls the space which characterises
the formation of the gaps, and which is continued in the true
W.       opening, the gap-funnel; yet in the Coniferae, in which
                                                          .
  alentin has figured this gap-funnel so very great and so
plainly, this space is not present. The opposite end through
which the termination of the porous opening enters the cavity of
the cell, he calls the entrance-funnel, and           more cylindrical
part situated between these, the middle part.
   He afterwards draws attention to the various forms of these
individual parts of the dots in various plants.                     have           I
however not been able to find these forms so constant as
they are described.        At        all

                                minutely  into details              on

of Marquart. The observations of the latter on this subject
are however much more accurate than those of Dr. Hope;
 Marquart showed, for instance, that the Xanthogene is pro
 duced from a blue extractive substance converted to red by
 an acid, &c. It also appears from the statement of Dr. Hope
 that he made no use at all of the microscope, which however
 was quite necessary. One consequence of this is the retaining
 of the term Chromule, which De Candolle had proposed for
 the colouring matter of plants; against the adoption of which
 however many reasons exist.      Dr. Hope states that he found
 that the Xanthogene   occurs independently   of the Chlorophyll
 in   all
       green leaves; that    white flowers (about thirty different
                                                 in
 ones were examined) Xanthogene only        contained, exactly                  is                               as
 inthe yellow flowers, where also        Erythrogene occurs. The   no
explanations      this are   of   found,     think,
                                                  to   the experi
                                                        be                I                in
                                                                        as on
ments      Marquart. Red flowers
             of                            the contrary exhibited
Erythrogene,       also        as
                         Xanthogene,        did blue, purple, and
orange flowers, &c.
 I   believe, judging from my own observations, that the work
 of Marquart deserves the preference           every respect; also              in
that his   names,       account             on
                                     priority  even, should  of   re                                        be

 the air-cavities. Besides the yellow gummy substance, there
 often occurs a greater or less number of very small molecules
 in these cells, arranged laterally from the bundle of crystals;
 and these also pass through the apertures of the cell when it
 bursts by the entrance of water. This bursting of these cells
 undoubtedly belongs to the most interesting observations for
 which science is indebted to Turpin; but to load these cells
with peculiar names would not be allowed on a general con
sideration of the subject. In the diagonal sides of the air pas
sages in Pontederia cordata, the occurrence of cells with spi
cular crystals is quite of the same kind as those in the leaves
of the Aroideae; and we there also find similar single cells,
containing a yellowish gum-resinous substance; and indeed
sometimes with, but in general without crystalst.
    We are also indebted to Unger for an extended noticef on
the occurrence of carbonate of lime upon the surface of Saxi
frage leaves.     It has already been known for a long series of
years, that the gray and white efflorescence which occurs on
the upper surface of the leaves of various species of Sarifraga
consists of carbonate of lime; this calcareous covering is espe
cially found in great quantities on those very species of this
genus the leaves of which have at their borders small basin
like depressions,          as,
                        for instance, Sarifraga Aizoon,        caesia,      S.

446              Mr. R. Addams       on the  Action of
phyll.    The carbonate of lime is secreted through                 these
cavities in greater quantities the richer the soil is in lime.
We also, however, find the leaves of the above-mentioned
species of Sarifragae very thickly covered with lime, when they
have become old, in a soil very rich in humus.              It may also
frequently be observed, that many other places on the upper
surface of the leaves of those plants, besides the cavities, are
covered with a thin crust of chalk; that the deposition therefore
of this calcareous substance does not take place through the ca
vities only. Unger, it is true, says, “We should in this case be
mistaken if we were to consider the calcareous excretion as a
product of the entire epidermis.        I myself, however, think that
this is the   case; and it is   easily  observable on many garden
plants of this tribe. These excretory organs on the upper
side of the leaves, are said to be represented by an immense
number of pores on the under surface, as if the increased
process of secretion on the one side had produced an antago
nistic process on the other side, but different in quality.”           In
fact, this deposit of lime upon the leaves of Saxifrages is an en
tirely peculiar phaenomenon, and can be connected with a few
others only; it cannot even be viewed as parallel with the incrus
tation of the Charac, for in these the lime appears to be precipi
tated from the surrounding water, as the carbonic acid, which
held it in solution, is imbibed by the plant. In the Saxifrages
only an exuding of the calcareous fluid seems to take place, and
this is strongest in those cavities where the cellular tissue is
very delicate: the phaenomenon may be classed with the de
position of lime in the air-cavities of the leaves of Lathraea,
and with the occurrence of crystalline druses on the sides of
the air-ducts in Myriophyllum.           We also often find in other
plants a secretion of a salt which is contained in the soil on the
surface of the leaves, &c.”

LIX.    Notice   of New Discoveries of Ehrenberg's          respecting  the
                 Bacillariae.”     By M. Wiegmann.
          readers of this Journal will have seen from Meyen's
THE  Report on Botany, (Phil. Mag., present volume, p. 385–
390.) that the microscopical animal forms of this family continue
yet to be a subject of dispute, inasmuch as they are referred by
several botanists to the vegetable kingdom.             Meyen is also of
this opinion, which seemed to be supported by the circum
stance that these creatures had hitherto not been observed to
take in any coloured nutritive substance, like the other Infu
soria.    Recently, however, Ehrenberg has succeeded in feed
ing various species belonging to the genera Navicula, Gom
phonema, Arthrodesmus (Scenodesmus Meyen), Closterium ace
rosum, on which subject he read a paper, at the same time ex
hibiting specimens in proof of this, before the Society of Na
turforschende Freunde at Berlin. Vesicular ventral sacs, per
fectly similar to those of the other polygastrical Infusoria, were
                “I   could count,” says Wiegmann, “with the
#.
apparent.
           distinctness from six to seven ventral sacs completely
  lled with blue colouring matter, in the clear middle part of
a Navicula gracilis exhibited by Ehrenberg.” With this dis
covery, therefore, the most perfect proof has been afforded of
their coincidence with the Polygastrica, which, however, the
peculiar gliding motion        f  which was perceptible in many of
them had before         sufficiently  indicated; which motion may
be plainly recognised in many of them, and cannot be com
pared either with the lively motions of the sporules of Algae,
or with the motions of the Oscillatoria. The foot-like             pit.
which these animalcules protrude out of various apertures, and
draw back, may also be remarked in many of them: for                    in
stance, in Navicula very easily, when the water is rather thick;
we can also perceive with the greatest facility the above-men
tioned apertures in the empty shields; of the fossil Infusoria.

have often seen various species of Bacillaria and Navicula not only push

LXI.        On the Palo        de Vaca or Cow Tree of South America.
                     By Edward Solly, JUN., Esq.
     AM indebted to the kindness of Dr. Lindley for specimens
        of the bark, sap, &c., of the Galactodendrum utile, or
 Cow tree of Humboldt, accompanied by a highly interesting
letter from Sir R. K. Porter to the Hon. W. F. Strangways,
and communicated by him to Dr. Lindley; from which the
following are extracts.
                                     Dated “Caracas, June 8th, 1837.
    “Towards the close of last month,                        I  started from hence
across the mountains, in a north-west direction towards the
coast; and a most fatiguing and not a little dangerous jour

                       or Cow Tree               of South America.                                  453
roads we have none), it becomes break-neck work. Fifty
miles of travel brought us to an elevated valley called Catorori,
about a couple of miles from a mountain-perched respectable
town called Cariacco; at a small sugar estate in the above
named valley we halted, as from it some four miles higher up
in these elevated regions, grew the object of our search. On
inquiry we learnt that it would not be possible to go there
otherwise than on foot; therefore at six the next morning we
started, accompanied by a few Indians and coloured peasants.
I   need not trouble you with the difficulties we encountered
ere we had achieved our long league of fatiguing ascent
through a dense forest, obliged at almost every step to have
the way hewn out for us, so thick and interlaced were the
branches, jungle, and pendent bejucos. A couple of hours'
toil placed us at the foot of one of the trees in question, which
very far exceeded any idea I could have formed of it from                                            all

30.57 grains of galactin were dissolved, leaving a brown pow
der weighing 7-43 grains.
    Cold water was poured on this residue, and dissolved 4:37
grains, yielding a solution precipitated by alcohol, becoming
viscid when evaporated, and having hardly any taste; what
little it had was derived from traces of saline matters: it was
evidently gummy matter coloured slightly by extractive. The
residue, weighing 3.06 grains, was boiled in alcohol; the solu
tion gave a precipitate with perchloride of mercury and with
galls; this agrees entirely with the characters of gluten.
There yet remained a small quantity of a brown powder, which
was easily soluble in a weak solution of caustic potassa; this
proved to be vegetable albumen.      It is very probable that in
the sap, these two last-mentioned substances were held in                                          so

theorems respecting prime numbers are founded, and to which,
of consequence, the disquisitions of Gauss are equally to be
referred.
  Euler's demonstration, which has been generally adopted
by other writers, is exceedingly simple   convincing, but                  .#
does not appear capable        of being extended to meet the case
of composite   divisors,   without a very complicated and operose
process.    Such a   process    is sketched in the concluding para
graph of Part IV. chap.               Legendre's Théorie; but the

       HEdrawing represents an apparatus for producing a
     rapid succession of shocks when used with the galvanic

the magnetic battery; but I am not aware that anything of the
same kind has been applied to the ordinary galvanic battery.

    In proposition 1, a plane front within a crystal being given,
 the two lines of vibration are investigated.
    In proposition 2 it is shown that the product of the cosines
 of the inclinations of one of the axes of elasticity to the two
 lines of vibration, is to the same for either other axis of ela
 sticity in a constant ratio for the same crystal; and the two
 lines of vibration are proved to be perpendicular to each
 other.
    In proposition 3, a line of vibration being given, the front
 to which it belongs is deterinined; and it is proved that there
is only one such, and consequently any line of vibration has
but one other line conjugate to                                    it.
     In  proposition                 4,
                           certain relations are instituted between
the   positions            of,

   “Having thus briefly explained the necessity of reforming the
characters of the different groups of the Order Ruminantia, as they
are at present constituted, and the nature and value of the principles
which I propose to employ for that purpose, I shall at once proceed
to their practical application, confidently anticipating that their
employment will remove the most serious objections which exist
against the present distribution of the order, and place our knowledge
of these interesting animals, in point of scientific accuracy, precision,
and affinity, on a par with the more generally cultivated departments
of zoology.

   “The      Camelidae form what     Mr. MacLeay would call an aberrant
group; they differ essentially from other Ruminants in the structure
both of the organs of locomotion and of mastication, and their ge
neric distinctions consequently depend upon characters which have
no application to the remaining groups of the order. On the other
hand, the principles of generic distribution which subsist among the
rest of the Ruminantia appear to furnish negative characters only
when applied to the Camelidae; but though necessarily expressed
negatively, the absence of lachrymal, inguinal, and interdigital sinuses
forms, in reality, positive and substantial characters, and as such, as
well as for the sake of uniformity, should be introduced into the de
finition of these, as well as of other genera, in which they unavoid

by the practical working of the machine. That he might not occupy
the time of the Section too long, it would suffice at present to say,
that in it a small set of wind-mill vanes, something like the ventilators
placed in our windows, were presented to the wind by a common
vane, let the direction of the wind blow how it might: the aérial
current as it passed set these vanes into rapid motion, and a train of
wheels and pinions reduced the motion, which was thence communi
cated to a pencil traversing vertically, and pressing against an up
right cylinder, which formed the support of the instrument, and that

desirable—such,        for instance, as bridle rods, or other means known
to practical mechanics, and,        he was sure, well known to Mr. Osler.
Mr. Osler replied, that many methods of supporting this part of the
apparatus had been tried and laid aside, as not answering; among
the rest, bridle rods.
    Professor Powell then made a communication “On the Dispersion
of Light.' The object of this communication is to state the progress
of the inquiry into the subject of dispersion since the last meeting of
the Association.        On that occasion, the author laid before the Phy
sical Section the results of his observations for determining the re
fractive indices of the standard rays                       for    28

     *   A brief but
                 animated discussion between the author and Mr. Henwood
followed the  reading of this paper: the former insisting that water was the
medium of transporting heat in the earth; the latter inquiring why, then,
the lower and less permeable rock (granite) was at the same depth colder
than slate, and why the water occurring in the slate, if coming from below,
was not seen in the granite through which it must inevitably pass in itsway
upward?

sometimes short notices, of important foreign works, and of the
most interesting papers which appear in foreign Journals and Trans
actions, especially those of Germany, Sweden, Holland, and Russia,
as being probably least accessible to the generality of readers.
Some of our respected correspondents have expressed a wish for
such information; and the diffusion of it may further the objects
which the publication of the Scientific MeMoins is designed to
promote, and may, perhaps, assist in making the best selection of
papers for the future parts of that work, should the sale of the Volume
already published encourage the Editor to continue it.—R. T.

     It is a great pity that the authors, well known to zoologists, have not
employed a more general language, Latin or French, instead of the Swedish
with which the greater number of naturalists are unacquainted.             The
drawings are well executed and coloured with the greatest care from living
specimens so that few can be found to equal them.

and concludes with a comparison of the types according to which the ele
 mentary organs in the stems of Monocotyledons,        Dicotyledons and Acoty

               Mr. Taylor         on the Solubility          of Arsenious Acid.                              485
Twenty-five grains of   the cold solution, evaporated, left 55 gr., rather
less than the proportion deduced from the weight of the undissolved
residue.
   “Exp. 5. In this experiment four ounces of water were kept vio
lently boiling for half an hour; arsenious acid being added, as before,
from a weighed quantity.      89 gr. were dissolved. Hence,
            1000 gr. water dissolved       (89-2)         . . .    445 gr. or about             ...
The         of Exps. 3, 4, and 5, will be the following:
         mean
          1000 gr. of boiling water dissolve . . . . 40-76 gr. or ºr.
The rapidity of boiling will make a considerable difference in the quan
tity dissolved, as will be seen on comparing Exps. 3 and 4. Indeed,
water which boils violently will dissolve as much arsenic in half an
hour as water kept gently boiling will dissolve in an hour. All other
circumstances being equal, the length of time during which the boiling
continues will assuredly make a difference in the quantity of the poison
taken up.
   “ Exp. 6. Arsenious acid, in fine powder, was boiled for several
hours to saturation, in two separate quantities of water. These solu
tions were, after filtration, kept apart; and allowed to stand for sir
months in well-stoppered bottles.      A very abundant crop of octohe
dral crystals, lining the whole interior of the bottle, was deposited in
each case.    After this lapse of time, twenty-five grains of the filtered
solution (A) were evaporated to dryness; and the solid residue weighed
‘7 grain.   Hence,

490     Mr. Warington    on the Action   of Chromic Acid   upon
pense   of the chromic acid of the bichromate of potass, and
that the chromic acid must therefore be divided into two parts,
the first of which, yielding oxygen to the metallic silver, forms
the oxide of that metal, which is directly seized by the se
cond, or undecomposed part of the chromic acid, giving rise
to the crimson crystalline salt or bichromate of silver; while
at the same time the deoxidized chromic acid or protoxide of
chromium of the first part, enters into combination with the
sulphuric acid and the potass of the bichromate of potass, to
form the chrome alum; the sulphuric acid taking no part in the
decomposition, but acting merely as a necessary agent to in
duce the stronger affinities, and to unite with the protoxide of
chromium and the potass as soon as liberated from their re
spective combinations.
   For the perfect success of this experiment care should be
taken that the plate or capsule of silver employed is rendered
perfectly clean, and free from any coating of sulphuret or chlo
ride of that metal.     I have usually, after rubbing the surface
with a little fine   emery   powder, washed it with solution of
ammonia before     bringing  it into contact with the mixed solu
tion, and have always found the action to commence imme
diately. The proportions that appear to afford the most com
plete results are one proportion of the bichromate of potass,
or about 150 grains, dissolved in water, and three or four pro
portions of liquid sulphuric acid, or from 150 to 200 grains
by weight, equal to from 76 to 102 grains by measure.
   The bichromate of silver crystallizes in rhomboidal plates,
having frequently two of the angles opposed to each other
truncated; it has an acid reaction, is slightly soluble in water,
yielding a rich amber yellow solution, which deposits very
dark brown crystals by spontaneous evaporation; these how
ever are crimson by transmitted light, and when rubbed down
in a mortar give a crimson powder.
   The bichromate of silver is also formed whenever an acid
salt of silver is precipitated by the bichromate of potass, and

sulphate of silver; and although the fact of a crystalline pre
cipitate of chromate of silver being sometimes obtained is
mentioned in many of the best works on chemistry, yet the
composition, or a difference in composition from the brown
red precipitate of chromate of silver as it usually occurs, is
never hinted  at.   In making this statement, however,    should

          of the two preceding salts. After this green crust

monia of a pale yellow colour form (this salt has been carefully
examined by Professor Mitscherlich), and lastly bichromate
or chromate of ammonia separates.
   Should it be wished to obtain the double chromate of silver
and ammonia, care should be taken to exclude the air, as
the ammonia rapidly passes off and destroys the object in
view.    I have found that when placed in a partial vacuum
over quicklime, an atmosphere of ammonia is formed around
the solution, while at the same time the lime is gradually
absorbing the watery vapour.

as to recite an examination of a variety of double chromates
formed during that action.
 LXIX.       On the Variation of the Arbitrary Constants in
    Mechanical Problems.      By J. W. LUBBock, Esq., F.R.S.*
THE        general theory of the variation of the arbitrary con
      stants in mechanical problems, with reference to the dif
ferential coefficients of the disturbing function considered as
a function of those coefficients, as hitherto exposed, appears

of the forces the same to the centres of atoms, cannot be true.
This so far clears the way for my own, which the more I ex
amine the more I am convinced is the true one; which also it
is desirable to corroborate. Because my theory is in conformity
with received principles, with the single difference of a change
of direction of the force, near the centre, and because no phae
nomenon can be found in contradiction to its doctrines, it has
everything in               its
                     favour which, previously              adoption,               to   its

    The two following principles comprehend my theory; viz.
 1st. Every atom                       of
                            matter consists             indefinite sphere   of    an                                          of

the centre; and this force acts towards the centre, and                      call                                     is

sphere,         whichin     acts from the centre, and            there called                     is
repulsion. 2nd. The differences and distinctions                           atoms                                of

498   Mr. Exley's Remarks on M. Mossotti's Theory of Physics,
ciples may be assumed, and calculations made to deduce the
phaenomena d priori; but in order that such phaenomena may
agree with those actually observed, we must be guided in such
assumptions by the indications of nature: on this ground                           I
have admitted three classes: 1st. Tenacious atoms, distin
guished into sorts by moderate differences in their absolute
forces and spheres of repulsion. 2nd. Electrical atoms, being
such as have a much less absolute force, say a thousand times
less than the least powerful of the first class.         3rd. AEthereal
atoms, whose absolute forces may be several million times less
than those of the 2nd class, and like the first consisting of
several sorts.      If
                     we suppose a due quantity of each variety
present, it is manifest that the atoms of the first class will at
tract to their spheres of repulsion dense atmospheres of electric
and aethereal atoms, whose centres will be found within the
spheres of repulsion of contiguous atoms: and such a body as
the earth will retain an atmosphere of such matter if present ex
tending several hundred miles, giving rise to such repulsions
as are observed.
   Mr. Babbage has presented Mossotti's theory under a mo
dified form in note A: he says,                 “If
                                               matter be supposed to

tract particles of the other kind according to another law,

502      Mr. Exley's              Remarks on              M. Mossotti's Theory of                           Physics,
   Mr. Babbage, as above stated, has presented the theory in
a modified form, in which the repulsions are regulated by
some given law, and the attraction by some other given law.
First, let there be no central solids, and take two molecules
A and B, and let one of them, A, be plunged into the aether;
it will, as in the former case, attract the centres of aethereal
 atoms into        centre, till just
                    its                  many are concentratedso          are                                  as
                                                                   of its
 equal    inforce         to
                       the molecule                           at
                                              centre: but since the law
 of attraction      different from that
                        is                     repulsion, the actions                                                     of
 the  compound       atom,       any        on
                                      distant atom, will          different.                     be
                                                     A, B,
 And now let the molecule             with      concentrated aether,   its                                                be

                                                        and let the con

         on the Protochloride  and Perovide    of Mercury.     505
   For the examination of this body,     an order   of analysis si
milar to that adopted for white precipitate was pursued.
   A.—148-15 grains of precipitated calomel were boiled for
some minutes with a great excess of water of ammonia, and
the whole thrown on a filter.      The black powder thus ob
tained weighed 141.92 grains corresponding to- 95.79 grains
from 100 of calomel.
   The liquor that had been filtered off was acidulated by
nitric acid and nitrate of silver added in excess; the chloride
of silver precipitated was collected and dried: it weighed
44'44 grains corresponding to 30-0 from 100 of calomel; and
the 300 grains of chloride of silver containing 7.401.         But
calomel consists in 100 parts of
                  Mercury . . . . . . 85' 117
                  Chlorine . . . . . . 14°883
   Therefore we have by this experiment, the black powder
composed of
           Mercury . . . . . 85-117 and 88-85
           Chlorine . . . . .     7-482            7.76
           Other matters . .      3:191            3.39
                                95°790          100'00
   No. 2.-153-36    grains of calomel were boiled with water of
ammonia for a few minutes, and filtered.      The dry dark-gray
powder weighed 146.71 grains, corresponding to 95.66 per
Cent.
   The liquor treated with nitrate of silver gave 44:03 of
chloride of silver, corresponding to 28-71 of chloride per cent.
and which contains 7-08 of chlorine.
   Thus  we obtain,
            Mercury . . . .    85'117    or    88.98
            Chlorine . . . .     7.803          8:15
            Other matters .      2-740          2.87
                               95°660         100'00
   The  mean of these experiments gives,
                    Mercury . . . .     88-91
                    Chlorine . . . .     7'95
                    Other matters . .     3:14
                                        100-00
   B.—As the above method       necessarily  throws the chlorine
and mercury estimate rather too high, the following experi
ment was made, in which the necessary loss produces an op
posite effect:

and an acid solution of protochloride of tin added. The re
duction of the quicksilver took place readily, and large well
formed globules appeared; the metal collected and carefully
dried, weighed 89°39 grains, or 100 of the powder had given
88°18.
   C.—51'42 of the gray powder were dissolved in dilute
aqua regia, and a current of sulphuretted hydrogen in excess
passed through the liquor.     It was found, that owing to free
chlorine, the sulphur precipitated invalidated the result. The
whole was therefore mixed with nitric acid, and boiled until
the sulphuret of mercury was completely decomposed;                                                  the

   It is evident that we have here a body precisely correspond
ing to white precipitate; the mercury, however, being in pro
to-combination.     Water of ammonia acting on calomel, abs
tracts half the chlorine, which is replaced by a corresponding
quantity of ammonia in some form of combination.        We can
accordingly construct two formulae corresponding to white
precipitate; in the first, half the mercury being conserved as
protoxidized and combined with an atom of ammonia: in the
second, that half of the mercury being directly united to ami
dogene. The former theory gives from the formula (Ch 4. Hg)

composed by chloride of tin. There were obtained 43-74 of
mercury corresponding to 83-76 per cent.
   C.—As the constancy of the amount of mercury and am
monia in the preceding results, proved completely that the
loss did not arise from error, but probably from water pre
sent, the following experiment was made to ascertain whether
water existed in such quantity: A small green glass retort was
blown, with a pretty long neck; to it was attached a tube con
taining potash; and the ammoniuret in the retort having been
decomposed by a red heat,                 its
                                  gaseous elements were allowed

     Tis well known that Professor Daniell, to whom we are
    indebted for a knowledge of the properties of this acid
liquid, ultimately came to #. conclusion that it is acetic acid
containing some disoxygenating substance which bestows                                                 its
property           of
               reducing metallic oxides.
    A  few years ago      had occasion
                                   I       examine this acid,     to                                   as

 ofmanganese, and sulphuric acid, and         came     the conclu  I               to
sion that they               all
                      contained formic acid besides acetic acid.

was inferred, were that they                           all
                                    reduced the oxides and salts
of mercury and silver with effervescence, and that they      were                                all
              yielding perfectly well characterised formates

     About the same time M. Leopold Gmelin came                                         by   indepen

I  had drawn     regarding    them,   were the same            the three          in   all
cases,   I could not avoid regarding M. Gmelin's experiments
as  amounting              to
                        verification

   The object of my inquiry is not aldehydic acid. The che
mical world will gladly receive further light respecting that
acid; but I think it will not be difficult to show that it will not
be safe in the mean time to receive lampic acid as          repre                                         its
sentative.

514          Mr. Connell  on the Nature  of Lampic Acid.
quantity of residual liquid in the smaller evaporating basin
was always thrown away as not consisting of condensed va
pour.     From 2 ounces of aether, which required about 24
hours for consumption, rather more than a dram of the con
centrated acid liquid was usually obtained, and the vessels
were washed out with another dram of distilled water, which
was added to the acid liquid, in which state it was employed
in the experiments detailed.
    It is unnecessary to say that the liquid thus obtained pos
sesses powerful acid qualities, reddening vegetable colours
strongly and effervescing briskly with carbonates: and when
we talk of the nature of lampic acid, my understanding of
the expression is that we thereby mean the nature of the acid
thus contained ready formed in the liquid so procured. That
there are other products of an aethereal, oily, or resinous de
scription contained in the liquid there is no doubt; but these
are not acids; and it will be unnecessary to have recourse to
the supposition that they produce or modify the reactions of
the acid which they accompany, if it can be shown that that
acid exerts in its own nature all the characteristic reactions
of the liquid. The examination of these accompanying pro
ducts did not come within the scope of my inquiry either at
present or formerly.
    I. To determine experimentally whether lampic acid re
duces the salts of silver and mercury without effervescence, a
little of the acid was placed in a tube with solution of proto
nitrate of mercury, whilst one end of a narrower tube was fitted
into the larger by means of a cork, and the other extremity
terminated in a small quantity of lime-water.         On applying
heat to the mixture there was brisk      effervescence, precipita
tion of metallic   mercury,  and evolution of elastic fluid which
 speedily made the lime-water very muddy; and on adding
 an acid to the lime-water the muddiness disappeared with ef
 <U+017F>ervescence.
    This experiment was repeated, substituting peroxide of
 mercury for the protonitrate.     Copious effervescence ensued
 as before, and evolution of elastic fluid which made the lime
 water muddy; and there was at first on partial cooling a pre
 cipitation of white saline matter, and on the further applica
 tion of heat this disappeared with precipitation of metallic
 mercury.
     When solution of nitrate of silver was heated with lanpic
 acid until effervescence and precipitation of metallic silver as
 a dark brown powder ensued, and the action was maintained
 by the occasional application of heat, the lime-water into which
 the evolved gas was conducted became very muddy as before.

              Mr. Connell                  on the Nature            of Lampic Acid.                                515
    With oxide of silver and lampic acid there   was, when hea"
was  applied,  the like effervescence and evolution of carbonic
acid, which made lime-water muddy; and after the liquid had
been evaporated away on the sand-bath, the residue was me
tallic silver.
   In these circumstances we cannot hesitate to say that lampic
acid reduces the salts and oxides of mercury and silver with
effervescence and evolution of carbonic acid *.
   This quality, it is unnecessary to state, is a property of
formic acid.    It was also formerly shown that perfectly well
characterised formates of magnesia and of lead may be ob
                                                                                                                          is all
    * Although it is quite true that Professor Daniell does not state on
occasions that lampic acid reduces these salts with effervescence, yet                                             it
equally certain that              he

nesia is highly characteristic, and any one who will prepare
it from lampic acid in the manner formerly pointed out, and
compare it with crystallized formate of magnesia, will at once
see the identity. The properties of the salt of lead are also de
cisive. When the acid liquid was treated in the cold with car
bonate of lead and left some days, the sparingly soluble salt
of lead gradually precipitated from the liquid. This salt was
then dissolved in water by boiling, and the solution filtered
while hot. On cooling characteristic shining spicular crystals
of formate of lead precipitated. The whole salt produced
by saturating the acid with lead was then treated with alco
hol at the temperature of 100° Fahr. to take up any acetate
of lead present; and a portion of the residual salt was heated
with concentrated sulphuric acid. Carbonic acid was evolved
in abundance, and was recognised by                usual properties         its                              of

cury lampic acid is changed into acetic acid. If lampic acid
consists of formic acid with a little acetic acid, it will not re
quire any argument to show that in reducing metallic salts it
is not changed into the last of these acids. In concluding
that it was so changed, M. Liebig referred to an experiment
described by Mr. Daniell, that when it is heated with peroxide
of mercury, a shining micaceous salt is deposited on cooling,
which he considered to be acetate of mercury. This experi
ment I had repeatedly made, and described in my former no
tice; and my impression also then was that the precipitated
salt was entirely acetate of mercury; but the conclusion
which both Professor Daniell and myself had drawn from the
experiment was, not that lampic acid had been changed into
acetic acid, but that the acetic acid thus supposed to combine
with protoxide of mercury existed ready formed in the liquid.
From the researches which                     I
                                     have since made, I entertain
no doubt that the salt thus precipitated is to a great extent
formate of mercury.        It undoubtedly contains in the form of
acetate       all
              the acetic acid which       present is   the liquid; but     in
the fact which was formerly overlooked,             that pure formic  is
acid when heated with peroxide                    of

itbeen entirely acetate of mercury, the acid obtained from it
would simply have dissolved the peroxide of mercury.
  From all these considerations it is manifest that there are
no grounds for supposing that lampic acid when it reduces
the salts of silver or mercury is converted into acetic acid.
     III.
        The last point relates to the atomic weight of this
acid.
   The observations which follow on this subject will, perhaps,
appear to be superfluous to those who may be of opinion that
lampic acid has been shown by sufficiently decisive charac
ters to consist of known acids. The apparent puzzle on this
point has arisen from the foreign substances contained in the
acid liquid disguising the result obtained, as will be suffi
ciently evident from what follows.       I made an analysis of
lampate of barytes, and at first obtained a result identical with
that of Professor Daniell.     The salt was prepared by satura
ting lampic acid with carbonate of barytes, and was once or
twice alternately dissolved in water and evaporated to dryness.
At each successive evaporation it emitted pungent vapours,
and continued a brownish and partially crystallized mass. It
was then reduced to powder and dried in vacuo over sulphuric
acid. 6-8 grains of the salt thus prepared were dissolved in
water and precipitated by sulphate of soda.        The sulphate
of  barytes after  ignition weighed  6:25  grains, equivalent to
4-1017 of barytes. These data would give as the constituents
of the salt

It was then digested in alcohol for some time under the idea
that more of the resinous matter would be taken up; but as
the alcohol had dissolved a little of the salt itself and had not
acquired a deep tint, it was evaporated to dryness and the re
sidue returned to the original mass of the salt. The whole
was again dissolved in water, filtered from a fresh quantity of
resinous matter which separated on the application of heat,
and finally evaporated to dryness. The salt thus obtained,
and which still had a brown colour, was dried in vacuo over
sulphuric acid : 12:34 grains of it thus dried yielded 11.78
grains of sulphate of barytes, which would give the consti
tuents of the salt as

and the atomic weight of lampic acid as 570-7. Thus by the
separation of these successive portions of resinous matter the
apparent atomic weight of the acid had been reduced from
629:4 to 570-7; but it was evident that the salt still contained
impurity both from        its
                          own brown colour and from that          the                of

              some      Mines in Cornwall and Devonshire.              523
metalliferous veins in most of the instances reported, may
have given a rather higher mean temperature than would
have been indicated by experiments confined to rocks at a               di
stance from “lodes.”       Upon the whole, however, I believe
that the results stated in the foregoing table are sufficiently
near the truth, to prove that the ratio in which the tempera
ture, augments in descending into the earth, is greater in
shallow mines than in deep ones.       Moreover, I am persuaded
that we have no means at     present  within our reach to enable
us to arrive at satisfactory conclusions relative to the ratio in
which the temperature of the earth increases at much greater
depths than have yet been attained.
    t clearly appears, from what has been stated, that the con
ducting power of rocks is not the immediate cause of the
high temperature observed in mines; but the facts are quite
consistent with the hypothesis, which                I
                                          have long advocated, of
heat  being  transferred from  greater or less depths towards the
surface, in consequence of the well known tendency of warm
water to ascend through cooler portions of that fluid “; and
the anomalous results obtained at equal depths in different
places, often contiguous to each other, are, I conceive, mainly
to be attributed to the greater or less facilities afforded by
the rocks and veins for the circulation of the water.
   Note.—The experiments in Levant and Consolidated Mines
marked thus : in the table, were made by burying the bulbs
of long thermometers three feet deep in the rocks, and com
pared with other thermometers near them buried only an
inch deep.     Under these circumstances, the former indicated
about 1°4 of temperature more than the latter, proving that
the high temperature was not due to extraneous causes, but
existed in the rock. Such results are, however, only to be
expected in the deepest parts of mines. Indeed, those ob
tained in the upper levels of mines are generally unsatisfac
tory and inconclusive, as it respects the native heat of the
earth at equal depths.

  Report   of the Progress of      Vegetable Physiology     in 1836.      525
a very distinct manner, and a great number              of new data which
he had     already     made known in earlier          writings   have been
treated more at large. In reply to those botanists who are
of opinion that the spiral tubes convey air, because they had
observed that air plainly proceeded from them, Link remarks,
that the intestinal canal of animals is also not always full, but
frequently contains air.
   Gaudichaud º also has again confirmed a phaenomenon,
which had previously been described by various travellers,
and which speaks very determinately for the sap conduction of
the spiral tubes.          For if we cut one of these Liane plants
possessing great spiral tubes, and at a time when the sap is
ascending, a great quantity of sap flows out from the surfaces
of the section; that this sap does really proceed from the aper
tures of the spiral tubes has been observed by myself, and also
by many other persons. Gaudichaud made his experiments on
Cissus hydrophora, a new species which grows in the environs
of Rio de Janeiro. A Liane stem of 15–18 lines in diameter
was cut right through; the surfaces of the section were moist,
no water ran out, excepting a few drops which fell from the
upper surface. A small portion of from 15 to 18 inches was cut
off from the basis of the upper end, and placed in a vertical di
rection, and immediately clear water came out in great quan
tity; various sections from the lower end of the stem exhibited
the same phaenomenon.             The flowing out of the sap however
proceeded more slowly; it just trickled down from both ends,
as soon as the severed portion          of the end was held in a hori
zontal direction. A portion of 15 inches long by from 14 to 15
in diameter was cut off from another stem of the same plant;
this gave two ounces of water. From a second piece of the
same length from the upper end of the stem Gaudichaud ob
tained rather less water; and this diminution in the flow of
water became the more considerable the further the severed
end was situated from the base of the stem.                On the day fol
lowing that on which the stem had been cut, the surface of
the section of the lower end, which was still standing in the
ground, exhibited no efflux of sap: the whole end from 5 to 6
inches below the surface of the section was dry. Gaudichaud
also takes this occasion to mention the causes of the ascent of
the sap in general; he thinks it possible to divide the forces
which cause       this phaenomenon of vegetable life into external
and internal       forces.    To the external forces would belong
atmospheric       pressure, heat, solar light, &c. The internal
forces would       have to be subdivided into nutritive and secretive

526               Prof. Meyen's IReport of the Progress of
forces: to the first would belong the reception of saps and of
gases, the combination of gases with one another, the meta
morphosis of the gases into liquids, the change of fluids into
solid substances; to the latter, on the other hand, would be
long the exhaling of gases, liquids, &c.
   A memoir by Girou de Buzareingues” has attracted espe
cial notice; it treats exclusively of the organs of the motion
of sap in plants. The results of this work are so at variance
with those of              all
                   other vegetable physiologists that we may
perhaps expect       full refutation

and to convey sap; it is further stated to be wound round a
delicate tube, and to be inclosed externally by a membrane,
under which is the fluid; while the inner tube round which
the spiral fibre runs is said to convey air only.
    These are, properly speaking, the results of Girou's obser
vations; he however in this memoir as well as in his preceding
ones never specifies the name of the plants on which he made
this or that observation, and on which the observation might
easily be repeated.      He also never takes notice of the obser
vations of other botanists. Towards the end of the paper Girou
(l.c. p. 245) comes to the conclusion, that a certain circula
tion exists in plants; the sap ascends by means of the inter
cellular passages through the whole plant; it is conveyed by
the adducent vessels from the root to the leaves, where it
 undergoes an elaboration, and it then passes into the vessels
 which carry it off. The sap which is contained in the spiral
 fibre of these vessels may descend to the root, and there in the
 earth serve for the purpose of excretion; but the other sap,
 which runs between the two membranes of the downward
 conveying vessels, is said to flow through the side apertures
 into the intercellular passages, and there mix with the ascend
 ing sap. I am very sorry to say that I could convince my
 self of none of these positions !
     We will examine more specially the position, that the
 spiral fibre is hollow, for although we endeavoured many
  years ago to show that this question was decided in a most
  definite manner, yet many of the most learned phytotomists
  have in these latter years contended for the presence of a ca
  vity in the spiral fibre; not only Mirbel, but also Link in
  his recent work. The latter considers it to be hollow, on ac
  count of some (as it appears) swollen places, as also from                                   its
  appearance       the points

which contain such vessels are a great deal too thick to be
immediately observed without any dissecting. Such a motion
of the resin would place the receptacles nearer to the true
vital sap vessels; and I consider it as highly probable that
they are of an importance much greater than we have hitherto
dared to ascribe to them; for the resinous ducts in the Coniferae,
as well as the gummy ducts in the Cycadeae, form a system,
of itself entire, and perhaps continuous through the whole
plant; and it is exactly in those plants where these resinous
ducts occur that the vital sap-vessels are wanting.         A great
coincidence may also frequently be proved, between the saps
of  the gummy passages and the vital sap-vessels of various
plants, in a chemical point of view.
   Link remarks on the milk vessels of the Euphorbiaceae and
Asclepiadeae, that they stand singly in the stem, are straight
and simple, and appear ramified only in the young stems
where they run out towards the leaves; they were also observed
in shrubby Euphorbia, with spreading branches; sometimes
they keep on their course at some distance from the nerves.
Link further says that they terminate with an obtuse point;
they also exhibit no anastomoses, may at times they appear to
have transverse partitions, but only false ones.       These obser
vations, it is true, do not exactly coincide with those which
I  mentioned in the report for 1835, with a view to refute the
objections of Treviranus. I yet hope to succeed in giving to
many of them quite a different bearing. In no plant is it more
easy to observe than in the leaves of Hoya carnosa that the ra
mified and very thick membranaceous vessels with obtuse ends
traverse the diachyma; these vessels, however, are not milk
sap vessels, but they are ramified cells of the liber, or fibrous
vessels of which hitherto no mention has been made in botanical
writings.
                                 .
             A structure so highly remarkable belongs to the
fibrous vessels (fibrous cells)     the Asclepiadea, and Apocynea,
of which mention has already been made. But nowhere is the
ramification and anastomosis of the vessels of the stem to be
observed more evidently and frequently than in the stem of
the old genus Sarcostemma; here we find the regular and
manifold anastomosing tissue of the milk vessels deposited
immediately before the layer of the cells of the liber, which
exhibit in every respect one and the same structure with those
ramified vessels in the leaves of the Hoya, with the exception
that ramification is wanting in them.           These observations
evidently show in the most certain manner that Mirbel's state

530                Prof. Meyen's Ireport of the Progress of
pearance is quite similar, are to be considered as milk ves
sels, cannot be right.    I have not yet been able to succeed
in  observing  in Ficus elastica the closed ends of the milk
vessels, neither could I see partitions in these vessels; but
I  have seen real anastomoses,     even in Chelidonium majus
 and in many others.
    That the sap in the milk vessels moves had already been
previously confirmed by Link, and it has again been observed
 by him; and he most admirably remarks, that this motion is
 neither effected by the contraction of the vessels, nor by the
 motion of the molecules contained in the sap, since obser
 vation does not show                  it.
    From various travellers" who have remained for some time                                       in

much neglected. The Royal Society of Sciences of Göttingen,
sensible also of the defective state of our knowledge of vege
table glands, has chosen this subject for a prize question,
which I have endeavoured to answer”.
   Griesselich names the oil-bearing glands which occur so
frequently in (not on) the substance of the leaves of the                  La
biatae, pores; a term not particularly to be praised, as it might
cause a confusion of ideas, and, secondly, it must be placed
after those which we already possess.      Together with Guet
tard's denomination (glandes vésiculaires), the name, internal
glands, has been used by many phytotomists; this is very pro
per, and therefore should be retained, for this is the only kind
of compound glands which occur in the cellular tissue of
plants.    Griesselich considers these inner glands as mere re
ceptacles of a secreted substance, a view which is refuted by
the anatomical examination of them. What is said on the
occurrence of internal glands in Labiatae has already been
mentioned by Guettard             f;
                              nay, the latter has written much
more on this subject than will be found in the paper now be
fore us; unfortunately, however, Guettard's memoir has re
mained almost unknown.
    Labiata cultivated in gardens contain, according to Griesse
lich's observations, fewer internal glands than wild species;
this however can only relate to a smaller production of the
 secreted oils; the glands are present in as large a number.
 Guettard had already remarked, that in many of these plants
 we could observe such glands in dried specimens which in a
 fresh state exhibited none.
    Besides these internal glands, we find also external, but
 simple glands, in the Labiatae, which I have mentioned in the
 Göttingen prize essay.
     On the Reception        of   Sap, the Secretion and Nutrition         of
                                       Vegetables.
   Many very interesting experiments have been made on the
 nutrition of vegetables; and it is to be hoped that we may
 soon arrive at definite and generally received views on this
 subject also. Ungerf for one, has given a very complete
 enumeration and comparison of the experiments and views of
 botanists and chemists who have treated on the reception and
 the formation of the nutritive substance in vegetables.    The
 question, in fact,    is,
                      whether the vital principle  the   plant  of               is
 of itself capable  forming the organic substances which serve

532                 Prof. Meyen's Report of the Progress of
to nourish the plant; or whether these nutritive substances are
taken up, at least in their elements, from without.                  Unger
(l.c. p. 136) finally arrives at the conclusion, “that the pro
cess of vegetation is neither able to produce new elementary
substances out of the substances presented to                  nor even                    it,                  to
arrange those already present; from this, however,                    imme                            it
diately follows indirectly, that plants also must necessarily
take     up
          their inorganic substances, such             carbon, hydrogen,     as
oxygen, and nitrogen, from the external world.”
   Jablonski" has once more endeavoured                     prove by ac               to
curate  experiments,     that the  inorganic   substances which plants
contain are received from without.              In order         refute the                  to
well known experiments                            of
                                    Schrader, which were               prove                          to

form alkalies, earths and metals, Jablonski performed similar
 experiments, which afforded the following result. The flowers
of  sulphur, which were also employed                these observations,
       purified                 experiments           digesting them       byin                                 in

 the seeds       of
               various   plants   were  sown,    but   they  attained only
a  very low state              of
                       development, even when they were watered
 with water containing carbonic acid. The Dicotyledones de
veloped slowly their cotyledons, but the plumula exhibited                                                      no
inclination      lengthen itself; and after from three
                       to                                               four                           to

                  Vegetable Physiology             for   the     Year 1836.           533
     Jablonski draws from his experiments the conclusion that
the plants continued to live only so long as the nutritive sub
stances deposited in the albumen or in the cotyledons could
go through the chemical process necessary to vegetable life;
as soon however as their combinations had arrived at a rela
tive chemical neutrality, death was inevitable, and carbonic
acid and water did not appear to be adapted to the sustenance
of the new product from the organic substances.
   From these observations we come immediately to those
which have been made on the reception of various substances
by the roots of plants. Mr. G. Towers” has once more made
some experiments in order to ascertain whether coloured fluids
can be taken up by the roots in their natural state; but nei
ther infusions of log-wood nor of Brazil wood were absorbed
by the plant, and this served to confirm the observations of
Link and other German botanists. Towers employed for
these experiments plants of balsam ; and soon after Ungert
made similar experiments on Lemma minor, which he grew in
tincture of cochineal, with and without an addition of alum, and
in an infusion of log-wood, but he could never observe the
reception of the coloured fluid. The Bibliothèque Universelle
de Génévet gave an extract from Towers's experiments, and
complains that he had paid no attention to the labours of
preceding naturalists, who had proved that plants, even with
their roots in the natural state, did take up coloured fluids.
The observations of De Candolle, sen., are here mentioned,
according to which coloured liquids had penetrated through
the spongioles.     However these imperfect notices of De
Candolle are    contrary  to a vast number of negative observa
tions which   I, among others, have performed yearly. But
already, long before the appearance of De Candolle's Phy

observed coloured liquid imbibed by a Chara.          The obser

experiments that substances perfectly dissolved, as for instance
solutions of salts, even if they are the most deadly poisons,
pass through the cellular tissue of plants.     Towers and Un
ger have also performed various experiments as to this point;
the first watered balsams with a solution of iron in muriatic
acid, and although this had entered the plant, yet even after
sixteen days the plant had not at     suffered.              all
                                                      well known              It   is
that Link had   previously  performed  similar  experiments  with
prussiate        of
              potash and sulphate        iron, and obtained the  of
same results; and Treviranus has, quite without reason,
called     question those results
           in                         Link's experiments; forof                                           I
have also succeeded with    many  experiments     the same kind,             of
in  obtaining similar results.
   Towers placed also several balsams with the roots cut off                             in
                                                                                                          in

 German botanists. Towers concludes from his experiments                          up
that plants       their natural state can take

without injury, which under other circumstances causes death:
this conclusion      however too hasty,
                             is                  Unger's more com       as

opinion that the spongioles          the root are the  of
                                                        organs  which
imbibe the nutritive sap from the soil, and send           forward                 it                     to
the other parts        the plant: they were too imperfectly or
                             of

were dissolved; so soon as on the eighth day they became paler,
and here the decoloration began from the root.            From the
third day these plants were placed in pure water, but the poi
soning was so complete that they began to die as early as the
fifth day.    Repeated experiments showed that even within
twenty-four hours so considerable a quantity of the salt of lead
had been imbibed that sulphuret of ammonia indicated the
presence of the metal by the brown tint.       It was thus proved
that in Lemma not only the little roots imbibe but also the
leaves, and indeed the under surface in as high a degree as
the upper one. This phaenomenon              however,           is,

has been demonstrated               by
                             various experiments. Unger thinks
rather that the foreign substances which are taken               pass                            in
through the cellular partitions than that they mix with the
cellular sap;       the other hand, however, my own experi

balsam and maize with     prussiate     potash, show that the dis
solved substance imbibed mingles with the cellular sap.           But
if  we act with reagents             on
                              such cells, the coloured substances
proceeding from the action are almost            precipitated upon       all

...}
and then   sometimes little air-roots become developed on the
stem. This phaenomenon seems to be very common when the
roots are in a suffering state, or if they cannot properly develop
themselves: thus Jablonski(l.c. p.211) saw the stem of a cabbage
plant which grew in a very imperfect state in purified flowers
of sulphur, send forth several similar air-roots; and I have
noticed it in balsams and in maize, &c. when the roots had
been destroyed in the earth by insects.

exposed to the influence of the sun under water, the disengage
 ment of the oxygen from the divided air-ducts soon ceased; it
 began however anew if the leaves were again placed in their
natural position.
   Dutrochet finally infers from his various experiments that
plants at night absorb the oxygen from the air, and that this
is only an auxiliary respiration, while the true process of re
spiration of vegetables consists in the disengagement and dif
fusion of the oxygen in the interior of the plant caused by the
solar light.
    Morren", who made several experiments in the botanical
garden at Louvaine on the respiration of plants, observed on
 the 18th of May, during the great solar eclipse, that the re
spiration of the green parts of plants, that is the expiration of
oxygen, entirely ceased at that time. We can observe some
thing very similar to this on very warm summer days, when
for instance the respiration of oxygen is very considerable
from the action of solar light, and the sun          once disap          all   at
pears under dark clouds;       have noticed several times how

last ceased more      or
                     less completely.

the mica plates to the thermal pile affects my results; and
that as more dark heat than bright heat is absorbed by mica,
a greater share of the total effect is produced by this cause in
the first case than in the second. Since this secondary effect
is unchanged when the mica plates are perpendicular and
parallel, there appears to be less heat polarized in the first case
than in the second.           In support of this opinion M. Melloni
quotes one of my earliest and rudest experiments, in which the
effect of absorbed heat was abundantly obvious, and which
could form no certain basis of quantitative deductions.
    M. Melloni does not appear to have observed that in my
later quantitative experiments, (which he likewise quotes,) the
supposed cause of error was eliminated by observing the
dynamical effect, or the extreme arc of impulsion of the nee
dle (a method which I borrowed from M. Melloni), and that

the mica      plates    were   only   absorbing    heat during the few
seconds that the arc          impulsion was being observed.

some experiments on the same subject, and                 now take the           I
liberty to give you a short account of the results obtained
from them. It certainly cannot be denied that there exists
some analogy between the peculiar condition of iron and that
of bismuth, but my impression at present                                is is,

aqueous solutions of any oxidized body or any oxyelectrolyte.
You know that such a state of iron is called forth by makin
this metal act the part of the positive electrode of a pile an
closing the circuit in a certain manner.            Now if bismuth be
placed in these very same circumstances, it does not seem to
undergo any change whatever, for it is violently acted upon by
nitric acid (of sp. gr. 1:4) and unites with the oxygen resulting
from the electro-chemical decomposition of water or any other
oxyelectrolyte.    It is particularly the last-mentioned difference
of bearing between the two metals which makes me suspect that
the peculiar condition of iron is not produced by the same
cause which occasions the inactivity of bismuth, that is to say,
that the latter effect is not brought about by a current passing
in a certain direction through bismuth. There is another fact
which seems to speak in favour of this opinion: according to
my experiments, peroxide of lead proves to be the most power

  In no branch of natural history are figures more necessary than in Am
phibiology, and those of the present work from their excellence, being drawn
and coloured after nature, merit approbation.    Most of the numerous and
beautiful drawings, executed in India by order of the Dutch government, by
Reinwardt, Kuhl, van Hasselt, Boie, and Maclot, are to be given in this
work. Great attention will be paid to the anatomical details and natural
history of the serpents, a department hitherto rather neglected.   The form
of the work is that of Temminck's Planches coloriées d’Oiseaur, which
it surpasses as to drawing and colouring, and it may be considered as com
pleting the works of Lacepède, Russel, Neuwied, Bell, Wiegmann, and
others.    Each part contains ten plates, with text, at a moderate price.

BRITISH ASSoCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE:
                 MEETING AT LIVERPOOL.
   Section of Zoology and Botany, September 11–Mr. Gray offered
some remarks on the supposed production of insects by the ex
periments of Mr. Crosse, and referred to two experiments made
by Mr. Children in a manner perfectly identical with those of the
former. The solution of silica was obtained from Mr. Garden, of
Oxford Street, and in one experiment it was sealed up, whilst in
the other it was exposed to the air, but in neither case was there
any appearance of insects. The insects had been very indefinitely de
scribed by Mr. Crosse, some as having six, and others eight legs. It
was no proof that they could not have been produced from the water
used in the experiment because it was boiled, as that would not be
sufficient to destroy the eggs of the insects deposited therein.—The
Rev. Mr. Hope remarked one peculiarity, that no one had given the in
sects a specific name, and that they merely appeared to belong to the
commonest species of Acari.-The Chairman (Mr. W. S. Macleay)
mentioned the circumstance, that the seeds and germs of animals
and vegetables are earlier and more quickly developed in a current of
electricity, and that in          all
                                probability, these favourable circumstances
operated upon the eggs           the insects produced
                                   of                      question.
                                                                  in      was      It
well known that seeds would retain their vitality for                      an
                                                                    indefinite
period  of  time, and there was         reason why any limit should
                                                  no                       put     be
to  the vitality   ofthe eggs      animals—Mr. Gray stated that prussic
                                        of
acid had lately been used for the purpose          destroying insects

                                                                           the
British Museum, particularly those infesting           mummy. Some
                                                              a            the
larvae of the common Musca having been put into the acid, remained
uninjured after two        three daysexposure.—Professor Graham (Univ.
                             or
Edinb.) remarked, that other plants and animals might             kept for be              an
indefinite length       time, when the powers
                        of                                   of
                                                    life were either retained
or  suspended. He also alluded           some curious experiments recently
                                                   to

      Mr. Fairbairne              on   Hot and Cold Blast Cast Iron.                                   557
being constant. In comparing two irons, the greatest care was taken
to subject them as nearly as possible to the same treatment.
   A series of experiments was also made to determine the strength
of hot and cold blast iron at various temperatures, from 32° (the free
zing point) to the boiling point ; for this purpose a cast-iron trough
was employed, in which the bars to be broken were placed and covered
with snow or water (which was kept at the proper temperature by a jet
of steam) as the case required; the weights were then gradually laid
on until fracture took place.
   The strength of bars made red hot was also tried, and contrary to
expectation, they retained their tenacity and power to resist the load
to a considerable extent: the reduction of strength in a bar one inch
square, in a range of temperature from 32° to that of redness was ra
ther more than one-sixth, the deflection being upwards of     inch in a                     l;
bar 2 feet 3 inches long.

    Mr. Fairbairne stated, that all the irons were made       the same ma                        of

                                 the elastic forces.  Dr. Young and Mr.

 lbs. produced a permanent set of an inch square bar. The President
remarked that the calculation as to elastic forces was scarcely to be
confided in. Mr. Fairbairne in answer to another question, stated that
the hot blast iron was the more flexible and better capable of bearing
impact; but that     the results  all
                                   impact had been taken from calcu

the greater part of a sphere two inches in diameter, the colours of
which are brilliant.
   The extreme rapidity with which gases pass through films of wa
ter, has afforded in the hands of the same chemist a good method of
determining the condition of equilibrium and law of the transit of
gases.   A series of papers communicated during the past and present
years to the American Journal of Medical Science, and Journal of the
Franklin Institute, contain a development of these laws. An illus
tration from these researches will give an idea of their result.
   In an atmosphere containing 190 measures of nitrogen gas, a soap
bubble was expanded containing 190 measures of protoxide of nitro
gen. The bubble collapsed with great rapidity, and at the end of
three minutes its contents were found to be 35 measures, the atmo
sphere around it being 341 measures. On analysis it was found that
the constitution of the gas within and without the bubble was iden
tical, one half being the protoxide and the other half being nitrogen.
   By thus measuring and analysing the contents of bubbles and the
atmospheres around them, the general law of equilibrium was proved
to be, that motion only ceased when the chemical composition on both
sides of the barrier had become alike.
 CHLoRosulPHURETS OF LEAD, COPPER, BISMUTH, AND ZINC.
  M. Reimsch, on passing sulphuretted hydrogen into a liquor con
 taining lead and acidulated with muriatic acid, obtained a blood-red
 precipitate, which was collected on a filter, became of a red brown
 colour, and when heated on charcoal with soda gave a globule of
lead.    On leaving the precipitate a longer time in the liquor, and
adding more sulphuretted hydrogen, or on continuing a current of
this gas, the precipitate became black sulphuret. Free muriatic acid
appeared to be requisite to the production of the red-coloured preci
pitate; for a neutral solution of chloride of lead, or salts of lead with
excess of acid treated with sulphuretted hydrogen, always gave the
usual black precipitate. , M. Reimsch satisfied himself that the pro
duction of the red precipitate was always owing to nitric acid contain
ed in the muriatic acid, and consequently to chlorine, and on using
muriatic acid free from nitric acid he obtained a yellow precipitate.
In order to produce the red precipitate, dissolve half a drachm of
neutral acetate of lead in seven ounces of cold distilled water; add to
this solution, constantly agitating, seven drachms of nitromuriatic
acid which has some days been prepared, by mixing two parts of con
centrated muriatic acid with one part of concentrated nitric acid;
pass quickly through the solution a current of sulphuretted hydrogen,
which is to be discontinued as soon as the reddish yellow deposit has
become of a perfect cinnabar red. The yellow precipitate is obtained
by adding to the above-described solution of lead, seven drachms of
muriatic acid free from chlorine, taking care to agitate them well.
The following experiments show the nature of these precipitates.
    The Red Precipitate.—If this be boiled in water, it passes from the
granular state to that of a bulky red-brown powder; this suffers no
further change, and may be dried at 100°Fahr. without altering        its

colour. The filtered solution contains chloride of lead, and gives with
nitrate of silver a copious precipitate of chloride of silver.
    It dissolves perfectly in nitric acid with the disengagement of ni
trous acid, and the separation of a little sulphur.            Nitrate of silver
added to this solution also gives a precipitate of chloride of silver.
    If it be heated by the blow-pipe on charcoal, it fuses, and disen
gages sulphurous acid.          Part of the lead is quickly reduced, whilst the
chloride of lead is volatilized in a white smoke
    When the precipitate, separated from the chloride of lead by ebul
lition, is heated in a glass tube, it becomes black, disengages sulphur
and sulphuretted hydrogen, and then fuses into a brown mass, which
crystallizes on cooling.
     Yellow precipitate.—This behaves in the same way as the red; ex
cept that when the chloride of lead is dissolved by boiling in water, it
is converted into black sulphuret of lead, which when heated in a
glass tube does not disengage either sulphur or sulphuretted hydro
gen.
    These results explain the difference which exists between these two
precipitates.       As by the action of the chlorine or of the aqua regia
upon the sulphuretted hydrogen, hydrochloric acid is produced and sul
phur set free, the latter combines with the sulphuret of lead, formed
 at the same time, to produce sulphuretted sulphuret of lead, analo
 gous to that obtained by adding quintosulphuret of potassium to a so
 lution of lead, and this body combining with the chloride of lead,
 gives the double compound of kermes colour, while the yellow preci
 pitate is merely a compound of sulphuret and chloride of lead, which
 is decomposed by boiling in water.
     According to the experiments of M. Reimsch, copper and bismuth
 appear to form similar combinations.            A solution of copper, acidified
 with    hydrochloric    acid,  gave  with sulphuretted   hydrogen a deep green
 blue    precipitate,  which when washed with water till free from uncom
  bined muriatic acid, and dissolved in nitric acid, gave chloride of sil
  ver on adding the nitrate.         The same effect takes place with precipi
  tated   bismuth;    except   that it cannot be obtained pure, on account of
  the   difficulty of washing             it.

   A portion of this acid was dissolved in alcohol of sp. gr. 1915. This
solution had the following properties: it reddened litmus paper, and
precipitated the following salts; the proto-and persulphate of iron, ni
trate of silver, acetate and subacetate of lead, the chlorides of barium,
lime, and platinum, but not that of magnesium; and sluphate of copper;
the aqueous solution of tannin formed a light precipitate. The aqueous
solution of the acid precipitates the same salts. The solution exposed
to the air evaporated without giving any traces of crystallization.
Another spirituous solution of this acid, saturated with potash, left by
spontaneous evaporation a very bitter white mass, in which no trace
of crystallization could be observed.
   Concentrated sulphuric acid causes this acid to impart a weak violet
tint to water.

given him the means of predicting beforehand, the existence of cer
tain compounds which have since been obtained ; and that he has
also been able, knowing the composition of a body, to arrive without
doubt at the process by means of which it may be obtained. In proof
of the latter, he cites the preparation of oenanthic acid, and that of
the aether of this acid”, which he had been able to predict without any
other data than the composition of the acid, and without any other
guide than the laws laid down in the theory which he had submitted
to the judgement of the Academy.—Comptes Rendus, August, 1837,

                         A NEW ORGANIC ACl D.
   M. Peligot has read to the Academy of Sciences some observations
on cane sugar, and on a new acid derived from the action of alkalies
on sugar of starch.
   It is well known that there exist two distinct varieties of sugar:
one of them is common sugar, extracted from the cane, beet-root, and
the maple; the other occurs in grapes and diabetic urine, and is formed
when starch, lignin, or sugar of milk is treated with dilute sulphuric
acid. It is also known that, influenced by various circumstances, com
mon sugar may be converted into sugar identical with that of starch.
   Among the differences which exist between the two kinds of sugar,
one of the most prominent (says M. Peligot) is in my opinion that
which is observed when these bodies are put in contact with alkaline
bases.
   Common sugar, when added to potash, lime, or barytes, combines
with these bases, and acts towards them the part of a true acidt : by
boiling a mixed solution of barytes and sugar, I obtained by direct
action a crystallized compound of these two bodies; the analysis of
saccharate of barytes, and other analogous salts, proves that the sugar
does not undergo any particular modification : on decomposing the
saccharates by weak acids, the sugar reappears with         its
                                                           usual properties.

               is        different with sugar   starch;

new and very powerful acid, which          formed

perfectly neutral salts. This acid may           be

few seconds the sugar is transformed into acid. The barytic salt is
then dissolved in water, and the acid is precipitated by means of a
solution of subacetate of lead, to be gradually added, in order first to
separate a brown colouring matter which arises during the reaction,
at least when operating in contact with the air. The last precipitate
obtained is colourless, and contains the acid in the state of subsalt;
it may then be separated by the usual means.
    Besides this acid, another non-volatile body is produced, which pos
sesses the property of immediately reducing, when cold, the salts of
silver and of mercury.
   The very easy formation of an acid, by the contact of sugar of starch
or of grapes, with bases (M. Peligot observes), shows how proper it
is to avoid the employment of too much lime in the purification of
the beet-root juice; for although lime does not alter the sugar, it
acts, when in excess, upon the sugar analogous to that of grapes, into
which common sugar is easily converted by the influence of heat, acid,
or fermentation. There are therefore two difficulties to be avoided;
these may be apprehended at the same time, the intervention of
acids which decompose the sugar intended to be extracted, and the
effects of the alkalies which act upon the sugar of starch resulting from
this decomposition.—L'Institut,     Août, 1837.

phuric acid was made to act upon naphthalin, two acids were pro
duced, forming salts with barytes which were distinguished by their
different solubility.     Mr. Faraday considers these acids as formed by
the direct combination of sulphuric acid with naphthalin; this was at
first admitted by     allchemists. More lately, and since the researches

phuric acid, and the hyposulphuric acid formed combines with the mo
dified naphthalin.
   The crystallized sulphonaphthalate of barytes contains an atom of
water, which it does not lose in vacuo; it is slightly soluble in water:
100 parts of water at 60° Fahr. dissolve 1-13 of this salt, and at 222°
Fahr. 476 parts.
   M. Regnault has analysed several other sulphonaphthalates, the
composition of which indicated the same formula as the sulphonaph
thalate of barytes. The oxide of lead forms with sulphonaphthalic
acid a neutral salt and several subsalts; the latter are obtained by
boiling massicot in the neutral solution of sulphonaphthalate;              the
sulphonaphthalate of potash crystallizes in very brilliant spangles:
it contains one atom of water.
   Free sulphonaphthalic acid is obtained by decomposing sulpho
naphthalate of lead by means of sulphuretted hydrogen.             This acid is
extremely soluble in water and in alcohol, and by evaporation it is ob
tained in an irregular crystalline mass, and it is deliquescent in moist
air. Its taste is very sour, astringent, and metallic; it readily fuses,
becomes black, and if the temperature is increased, the smell of
naphthalin begins to be perceptible; when more strongly heated it
swells and leaves a very brilliant and bulky coal. The acid dried in
vacuo contains three atoms of water of crystallization;        it loses part of
this water  by the action of  heat, but it  decomposes    before it is entirely
dissipated.
    Anhydrous sulphuric acid exerts a much more complicated action
upon naphthalin; there are formed two acids producing soluble salts
with barytes, and an insoluble matter. One of these acids is the com
mon sulphonaphthalic acid; the other is a peculiar acid, which is di
stinguished from the first by the greater solubility of            salts.  The                 its

His eldest son, who is no astronomer, and one of his friends, walking

a quarter past 11 and a quarter past 12. From 12h 37" to 3" 26" at
the beginning of the twilight, M.M. Bouvard and Laugier, astrono
