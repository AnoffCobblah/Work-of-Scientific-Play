     2. Herderite occurs imbedded in fluor, in the tin mines
 of Ehrenfriedersdorf, in Saxony. It resembles apatite, with
 which it was formerly confounded, in a remarkable degree;
 particularly some of those named asparagus-stone: such as the
 variety from Zillerthal, in Salzburg, and that from Hof in
 Gastein in the same country, which is found accompanying
 the axotomous iron-ore of Mohs, and still more so certain
 pale greenish-white masses of the same species, which occur,
 though in small quantity, along with the zoisite from the
 Saualpe in Carinthia.         The resemblance among those species
is sufficient to class the herderite in the genus Fluor-haloide of
Mohs, in which it may be henceforth included as the “pris
                                                                            -

II.     Iteply  of Drs. Tiedemann and Gmelin to the Remarks of
    Dr. Prout inserted in the Annals of Philosophy.(Second Series),
    vol. xii. p. 405: Communicated by Thomas Thomson, M.D.
    F.R.S. &c. Itegius Professor of Chemistry in the Universit -
    of Glasgow.
      HE    more satisfied we are of the obligations which the
       doctrine of digestion lies under to Dr. Prout, and the less
intention we had to attack him unjustly, the more do we con
sider it as our duty to discuss the complaints which he has
made, so far as we are concerned,—to defend ourselves, where
we think ourselves in the right, and to acknowledge our mis
takes where we think ourselves in the wrong.
    Dr. Prout’s complaints are the following:
    1. We have led our readers to believe that Dr. Prout denies
the presence of every other free acid in the contents of the sto
mach, except the muriatic; which is not the case.
    Yet we could draw no other conclusion from Prout’s paper*,
than that he denied the presence of every other acid.                 For
    a. He says (page 118), “the experiments above mentioned
seemed to preclude the possibility of the presence of any de
structible acid; and the only known fixed acids likely to be
present were the sulphuric and phosphoric; the muriate of
barytes, however, neither alone nor with the addition of am
monia, produced any immediate precipitate, showing the ab
sence of these two acids in any sensible quantity, and still
further confirming the results as before obtained.”
    b. Now unless the absence of other free acids be taken for
              * Phillips's Annals of Philosophy, vol. viii. p. 117.         -

4.          Drs. Tiedemann and Gmelin in reply to Dr. Prout
granted, how can Prout's method of determining the free mu
riatic acid in the contents of the stomach be considered as an
swering the object in view? When free acetic acid, for exam
ple, is present, the potash employed to saturate the free acid
will not only saturate the free muriatic acid, but also the free
acetic acid. Now as Prout considers his method as quite ac
                                                                                              to all
curate, he must necessarily presuppose the absence of           other
free acids. Indeed Dr. Prout would have had reason               com
                                                                  ad
                                                                                                  in of he
plain      us,  of we had led our readers
                         if                      believe that           to
mitted the presence        any other free acid
                                        of         the liquid      the   in
stomach;-acetic acid, for example (which not the case the                is
paper      which we have alluded). For
                to                            such                 on
                                                      supposition his         a
method would             longer   be   no
                                 accurate;  and we should therefore
have placed him         the situation
                                   in    contradicting himself.
                                                             of
   Dr. Prout,       his remarks upon our treatise, has for the first
                             in
time,      far  so  we know, admitted that he has several times
                             as
found acetic acid along with muriatic acid          the liquid     the       in                    of
stomach.      Thus our observations have been confirmed; and
                                                     determining the         of
                     of as
it follows        consequence, that his method

upon. That the free acetic acid always proceeds from the food,
     we
     cannot believe;                         we
                              have frequently obtained
                                        as                     the                      it   by              di

                                  several volatile acids, particularly
 of acetic acid, we could not estimate this check              the least               as   of
value. For when the        liquid    the  stomach,  together

great.     It  is probably owing to this cause that Prout found
no sal ammoniac in the liquid from the human stomach in two
cases; although the complete absence of this salt from such
liquids is very unlikely *. From these observations it seems
probable that the proof of the presence of free muriatic acid,
which Prout has lately endeavoured to deduce from the cir
cumstance, that when the liquid of the stomach after having
been neutralized with potash was evaporated to dryness, and
the residue exposed to a red heat, this residue did not act
as an alkali but constituted a neutral salt, is not satisfactory.
For a liquid of the stomach which contains no free muriatic
acid, but muriate of soda, muriate of ammonia, and free acetic
acid, must          (if
                   the quantity           of

of  potassium and chloride                of
                                      sodium.
    We are opinion that Dr. Prout himself
                    of                                       his last state          in

   Head and Dunnose in the Isle of Wight, as laid down in the
   Trigonometrical Survey of England; and the Length of a
   Degree perpendicular to the Meridian at the Latitude of
   Beachy Head. By J. Ivory, Esq. M.A. F.R.S.*
THE  investigation of the figure of the earth by measure
  ments of the meridian, has given rise to a question of great
moment.      Although the entire arcs agree very exactly with the
elliptical figure, yet on comparing the parts into which the same
arc is subdivided, the greatest irregularity is found to prevail.
This is so much the case in the arc measured between Dun
nose and Clifton, in England, that the length of a degree is
found to decrease in advancing from south to north, instead
of increasing as the theory requires. To what cause can so
great an anomaly be ascribed 2. In attempting to throw some
light on the irregularities of the English arc, have been led            I
to examine the operations at Beachy Head and Dunnose;
and, reserving the discussion of the original question to a fu
ture occasion, my present intention is to communicate the

and the mean of these, or 60820-5, is the proper rate of con
version in the present instance.   The difference of latitude
between Greenwich and Beachy Head will now be 44' 18";
and if the latitude of Greenwich be taken at 51°28' 39", that
of Beachy Head will be 50°44'21".                             -
   The distance between the parallels of latitude passing
through Beachy Head and Dunnose, as found in the Survey,
is 7376.5 fathoms; which being converted into degrees, at
the rate of 60815 fath. to one degree, gives 7' 16" 7 for the

Dunnose is therefore 50° 37' 4".3.

   But as the azimuths at the extremities of the geodetical line
drawn between the stations are given, we may deduce the
latitude of Dunnose from that of Beachy Head by another
method. Let B and D denote the azimuths, and A and Al the
latitudes, of Beachy Head and Dunnose; then, a and a (1–5)
being the axes of the terrestrial spheroid, the general pro
perty             to every geodetical line, will give this equa
tion in which the square of s is neglected,

the modulus of the common logarithms.      Now, computing by
this rule, we shall find W = 50° 37' 5"-65. This result is as
little different from the former one as can reasonably be ex
pected, considering that the methods of calculation are very
different, and likewise proceed upon experimental data quite
independent of one another.       Both results are confirmed b
actual observation, Capt. Kater having found 50° 37' 5":27 for
the latitude of Dunnose".     We may therefore definitively                         fix
the latitudes of the two stations     below:      as

  Applying this method to the case of Beachy Head and
Dunnose, we have the latitudes as before determined: the
chord between them, or y, is equal to 339897-6" feet, or
56566-3 fathoms: and, with these data, we get, - in the same
spheroid as before,
              -      w = 1° 27 5.78,
which is 18" more than according to the Survey.
   Now the length of a geodetical line drawn from Beachy
Head at right angles to the meridian, and limited by the me
ridian of Dunnose, is 336119+ feet, or 56020 fathoms.      Let
A be the amplitude    of this arc; - then we get, by the usual

  V.       Observations on the Geology of the Hyderabad Country".
THE   country around Hyderabad is composed entirely of
  granite, intersected by quartz, which generally runs north
and south; and by trap, which has no definite direction.
   The hills are generally in ridges. In some instances they
are insulated, of a mamillary form, or abrupt and precipitous.
   The ridges are covered with detached masses of rock, and
frequently (when seen at a little distance) have more the ap
pearance of heaps of loose stones than of solid hills.    The
mamillary hills are almost always devoid of vegetation, having
a smooth surface, with large detached lamellae lying loosely
on their sides, and apparently ready to slide or tumble down
on the slightest impulse into the neighbouring valleys.
   The insulated hills often present on one or more sides a
smooth, perpendicular surface, which makes a very sudden
curve at the top, or undulates, and thus contracts the summit
of the hill.
   Sometimes we find the surface of the granite forming part
of an immense curve, and rising very gently and to a small
height above the surrounding plain. In other instances it is
                                                         -
waved, and presents a great variety of outline.
   Huge blocks of granite are every where strewed over the
country, and are often piled over each other in the valleys, or
on the sides or summits of the hills, giving rise to the most
fantastic shapes, and often closely resembling ruined buildings.
It is not uncommon to see three or four immense masses of
-granite placed above each other, with their surfaces nicely
 adapted, having somewhat the appearance of the ruin of an

   All the granite of Hyderabad is stratified or lamellar. The
strata and lamellae vary in thickness, from less than an inch
to many feet. They have no definite direction or dip; but
are generally curved, sometimes to a small extent horizontal,

   The granite on one side of a small hill, close to that of
Shapoor, near the Beema, has the appearance (when seen at
a little distance) of being columnar; but when it is examined
more closely, it is evident that this appearance arises from the
following circumstance;—The lamellae of the granite are per
pendicular, and had formerly made a very rapid curve at the
top. By the influence of the weather, this curve has been
worn down, and has thus allowed the inferior perpendicular
part of the lamellae to separate a little from each other; and
accordingly, when seen transversely, they closely resemble
columns.                                            -
   The internal structure of the   granite is almost always small
granular". The proportions of          constituent parts vary ex

 ingly when this is the case, we generally find it wearing down
   and becoming disintegrated.
      The trap is found under the forms of greenstone and basalt.
   It is either tabular, massive, or in globular concentric lamellar
  concretions, with occasionally disseminated crystals of augite.
  The globular variety is very easily acted on by the weather, in
  consequence of which it is in many situations completely dis
  integrated and converted into a black soil. In some places,
  where this variety of trap occurs in great abundance, it is worn
  down into small detached globular masses, which are every

above described   will be produced. The same explanation is
to be given  of the origin of those masses which are found                                                       in
sulated in the plains.   I imagine that they rest on the summit
of what were formerly hills, but which are now completely
buried under their own ruins.                                   -
   The peculiar arrangement and structure of the quartz and
trap in the granite of Hyderabad, afford abundant proofs of
the correctness of Mr. Jameson's views of the formation of
                      of simultaneous formation with the rock
veins, viz. that they are
which they traverse.   In the Hyderabad country, we find
quartz and trap under the forms of veins, nodules, and moun
tain masses, sometimes perfectly distinct from the surroundin
granite, in other instances intermingling with    and gradually                       it,

certain proof, and with whose effects we are well acquainted;
but on the other hand have assumed the existence of causes of
which we never had experience, and whose effects we never
witnessed.    Huttonians assume the existence       central fire”,                    of a

had, and shall therefore consider his measurement to have been
correct.
     By the fluctional theoremde marimis et minimis, the calcu
lated angles  appear to be wrong,  and should be 109°28'16",
and  70°31'44";   which must be held to agree with the measure
ment; as no one would pretend to make that more accurate
than to the nearest minute, and the difference is much within
those limits.                                                - 2
   Koenig's paper was read before the Academie des Sciences
at Paris in 1739, and the results are mentioned in their Trans
actions for that year; but as his working is not added,     can                       I
not  compare   mine with his to see where the error lies.
   As it cannot be held unimportant to show that bees build
their cells exactly in the form which, at length, by the dif
ferential calculus, we find to be best; and as I cannot expect
my assertion to be preferred to that of Koenig,-I add the
working at length.
   1st. As of those figures which can be brought together
without leaving any interval, the hexagon is that which has
the greatest number of sides, it is clearly the one which needs
the least materials to inclose a given space.
   2ndly. If a range of hexagonal cells be met by a range
of similar cells, and no space be wasted, each cell must end
either with a three-sided pyramid, or with a plane at right an

        was
         to
                      my intention, in entering on this inquiry,
               ascertain the composition of the ores, the mine
ralogical characters of which have been so ably delineated b
Mr. Haidinger in the preceding paper+. I had
however, but a short way in the investigation, when my pro
gress was arrested by doubts both as to the manner of con
ducting the analyses, and as to the mode of calculating their
                                      I
results. In this uncertainty found it necessary to extend my
original plan, with the view of supplying by my own researches
what appeared to be not sufficiently established by the labours
of other chemists.      I
                        have accordingly divided the essay into
two   parts; attempting   in the first division to ascertain the
atomic weight of manganese, and the composition of the arti
ficial oxides of that metal; and in the second, applying the
facts thus established to illustrate the chemical constitution of
the native oxides described by           Mr. Haidinger.

Regarding 22 as the equivalent of carbonic acid, we have the
   following proportions:—As 84.72: 56-858::22:36:024.
   According to this analysis, 36 may be safely adopted as the
combining proportion of the protoxide of manganese; and
presuming the elements of this compound to be in the ratio of
one equivalent of oxygen to one equivalent of metallic man
ganese, 28 will be the equivalent of the latter.          This result,
with respect to the acid and base, corresponds exactly with
the analysis of Dr. Thomson, as mentioned in his First Prin

equivalent of the protoxide.         I am of opinion that the num
ber assigned by Dr. Thomson is correct, but I am not so cer
tain that the means by which he arrived at this conclusion are
altogether free from objection.         The principle of his method
is  unexceptionable,  especially   if the quantity of the precipitated
sulphate be carefully observed at the same time; but it is es
sential to accuracy that the atomic weight of baryta be per
fectly established.    Dr. Thomson supplied this element in the
inquiry in the following manner. He dissolved 88 parts or one
equivalent of sulphate of potash, and 106 parts, or what he
considered one equivalent, of the chloride of barium in se
parate portions of distilled water, and then mixed the solu
tions together. After the precipitate had subsided, the super
natant liquid was found to contain no trace either of sulphu
ric acid or baryta.     It hence follows, if no error is committed,
that 70 is the true equivalent of barium. But in a recent
number of Poggendorff’s Annalen der Physik und Chemie
(vol. viii. p. 5), Berzelius denies the accuracy of the experi
ment.      He declares that after mixing together the sulphate of
potash and chloride of barium in the proportions mentioned
by Dr. Thomson, 2% per cent of the chloride of barium re
mained in the residual liquid; and on repeating this experi
ment for my own information, I certainly found that the whole
of the baryta was not precipitated.          I wish it to be distinctly
understood, however, that        I   do not   confidently  rely on the
accuracy of my result, having been hitherto unable, from want
 of leisure, to examine the subject with that care which deem   I
necessary before attempting to decide a point in dispute be
 tween chemists, for whose analytical attainments I entertain
 such high respect.      Dr. Thomson will doubtless feel the ne
cessity of verifying his conclusions without delay; since an
error in the atomic weight of barium will at once vitiate an
 extensive series of his most elaborate analyses.         My own ob
 servation, however, combined with the remark of Berzelius,
has induced me in the mean time to secure my own researches
 as much as possible from any uncertainty respecting the atomic
                           I

 tain the composition of the sulphate of manganese            syntheti

 30                   Dr. Turner's    Chemical        Examination
 of manganese.     When it comes in contact with concentrated
 sulphuric acid, an intense heat is instantly evolved; and the
 same phaenomenon is produced, though in a less degree, by
 strong muriatic acid. This oxide is likewise the base of the
 salts which are formed when sulphuric or muriatic acid is
 heated with the peroxide, deutoxide, or red oxide of manga
 nese. . As the accuracy of this statement, as respects sulphuric
 acid, has been denied by an acute chemist and good observer,
 I have been induced to examine the question with considera
 ble care.       I
               mentioned in my Elements of Chemistry, in ex
 plaining the process for procuring oxygen gas by means of
 sulphuric acid and the black oxide of manganese, that the
peroxide loses a whole proportion of oxygen, and is converted
into the protoxide, which unites with the acid, forming a sul
phate of the protoxide of manganese.        The gentleman who
has done me the honour to review that work in the Annals of
 Philosophy, I apprehend Mr. Richard Phillips, has made the
following remark on the preceding passage.      “This statement
is at variance with both Dr.Thomson's and also with the results
of our experiments; for we find that 44 or one atom of peroxide
of manganese yield 4.2 of oxygen, which is so much nearer 4
than 8, that there is no question but that the deutoxide, and
not the protoxide is obtained by the action of sulphuric acid;
that this is the case is further proved by the deep red colour
of the solution of the sulphate, and by                    its
                                             losing that colour,
 as stated       by
               Dr. Thomson, when mixed with sulphurous                                  or
nitrous acid.”
   To decide this point between the reviewer and myself,                              it   is
only necessary     heat the peroxide
                       to                  manganese with con

moist state for twenty-four hours, and then heated in an open
vessel to a moderate red heat, which was insufficient to de
compose the deutoxide, lost only 0.218 per cent by subsequent
exposure to a white heat. The quantity of deutoxide present,
therefore, must have been very minute.          The anhydrous prot
oxide, as already mentioned, always yields the pure red oxide
when heated to redness in the open air. The carbonate, also,
in similar circumstances, is converted into a red oxide con
taining but a very small proportion of the deutoxide. It will
appear from these experiments that it is unsafe in analyses to
heat the precipitated protoxide or carbonate to redness, and
consider the product as the deutoxide; a practice which is
calculated to lead analytical chemists into considerable errors,

who reduced the red oxide to the metallic state by means of
charcoal and a long continued intense heat, the oxygen is only
26.6 per cent. But this estimate, as M. Berthier himself sus
pects, certainly renders the quantity of oxygen too small; for
though, guided by theoretical views,       am disposed to consi              I
der my  own number not     rigidly exact,  yet from the care with
which the experiments were made,          am satisfied their result      I
cannot be far from the truth.
   From this proportion of manganese and oxygen, we may
consider the red oxide a compound either of 80 parts or two
equivalents of the deutoxide and 36 or one equivalent of the
protoxide, as M. Arfwedson supposes, or of 44 parts or one
equivalent of the peroxide and 72 or two equivalents of the
protoxide of manganese.            either           If,      on

    Perovide of    Manganese.—To     procure a pure peroxide of
manganese, a solution of the                   was evaporated to
dryness, and the heat continued until the whole of the salt was
converted into a uniform black mass. It was then reduced to
fine powder, carefully washed with distilled water, and dried
by exposure for several hours to a temperature of 600°F.
On heating a portion of this peroxide to redness in a glass
tube, a little moisture was expelled, which reddened litmus
paper powerfully.       Consequently the peroxide still retained a
little nitric or nitrous acid, which I found it impossible to ex
pel entirely, except by the employment of a temperature bor
dering on a commencing red heat. The peroxide, after ex
posure to that degree of heat, was quite free from acid, but
still retained a trace of moisture.  On exposure to a white heat
it lost only 10-82 per cent of oxygen, whereas had the per
oxide been pure, it should have yielded 12-122 per cent. It
appears therefore that the heat required to expel the last por
tions of the nitric acid, decomposes some of the oxide itself;
and this circumstance induced me not to rely on the analysis
of the artificial peroxide of manganese.
   From my examination of the native peroxide of manganese,
I  conclude with

found filled or nearly filled with water, the cork sound, and

experiments are mentioned, in which vessels with air-tight
glass stoppers were used. In one case the bottle was broken,

cing the phaenomena it exhibits; quoting in conclusion the subjoined
apposite observations by the Father of inductive science: “Men
use commonly to take a prospect of nature, as from a high turret;
and to view her afar off; and are too much taken up with generali
ties. Whereas, if they would resolve to descend and approach
nearer to particulars, and more exactly and considerately look into
things themselves, there might be made a more true and profitable
discovery and comprehension.”

(See Proceedings of the Geological Society, No. 2; or Phil. Mag.

   The Introduction concludes with some remarks on the nature
and difficulties of the research which led to the composition of the
Memoir, and on the theory of the Weald which that research in
duced the author to form. It is here stated that down to the time
of the memoir's being read before the Geological Society, “the
writer was entirely unacquainted with the existence of any attempt
to explain the act of denudation by any other agency than that of
watery flood.”      His own speculations upon the structure of the
country “ had produced a conviction of some other agency be
sides that of water having been called into action, and that that
agency had at the same moment of convulsion formed what are
called the Chalk-basins of London and Hampshire, and in that act
broken up what is now the cavity of the Weald.”         By an extension
of his reading, however, he has found that Mr. Scrope, in his work
on Volcanoes, published in 1825, promulgated a sketch of this theory
of the Weald; and that, at about the same time, Prof. Buckland, in
a paper read before the Geological Society in 1825, and published
in the following year, gave a conjectural explanation of the same
kind.     Ifby these circumstances, Mr. Martin observes, “he has
been   deprived   of the satisfaction of believing himself the first to
promulgate this discovery, he has the pleasure of finding his opi
nions backed by high authority; and is emboldened to carry on the
research to a satisfactory exposition of many of the facts which
bear upon this theory, and are strong presumption, if they do not
amount to a perfect proof, of        truth.”  its

 of the former is every where prolonged by a considerable slope of                                                           .

    “Besides this slope, there is from the bottom of the green-sand a
breadth of from a quarter to half a mile of clay, giving together an
average depth, perhaps of 150 or 200 feet.             At a moderate depth
from the   surface,   this clay is  generally  blue,  running   into layers of
hard blue shale, often impressed with the Cypris faba; and contain

,    “The principal       transversefissures, some of which were destined to
become       river-channels,      have a remarkable correspondence on each
side of the       valley,   particularly   in the chalk, and in several instances
are    directly    opposed    to each   other;   which could not have happened
without a simultaneous action and common consent and continuity
of parts. The direction of a rent would be ruled by the density and
tenacity of the different parts of the stratum; occasionally deviating
from the straight line, it might be lost in one part, and taken up
and carried on by another, giving less resistance. The coincidence
is therefore the more remarkable, and proves not only the continuity
 of the chalk strata at the moment of convulsion, but also their uni
 form density and strength.               Of the valleys thus opposed to each
 other by the continuity of the greater transverse fissures, the most
 remarkable are, the defiles of the Arun in the South, and the Wey
 in the North Downs; the vale of Leatherhead, or the Mole, and
 that of Findon, or the Worthing road; of the Adur and Smitham
 bottom, or the pass of Merstham and Croydon.                       The Ouse is also
 opposed to the Darent, and the Cuckmere to the Medway.
       “But it must not be supposed that this simple transverse fissure is
  the only appearance of displacement exhibited by the chalk strata.
  They have suffered in common with the other rocky strata, that
  adjustment of parts which might be expected from the nature of the
  material on which they rest.                              If
                                                the fissile character of the stony
  strata determine their division in straight and broad lines, it would
   also be the character of the wealden formation to be torn and con
   torted in a manner widely different. For a stratum of clay of great
   thickness, carrying stone barely sufficient to give it stability, would
   tear rather than split in the act of displacement; and such a diver
   gence of the fissures as might be expected in so tenacious a mass,
   can be readily traced in every part of the weald surface. This di
   vergence and laceration has therefore modified the disposition of
   the stony strata still superincumbent upon the clay; and the subsi
    dence, elevation, and contortion consequent thereon, are every
    where visible in the dip and variable bearings of                    their masses.  all

it becomes a  valley with a rivulet; both the valley and the rivulet
enlarge by the accession of other coombs and rivulets, the effects of
the branches of one greater river fissure; and the eye of the observer
may, from any considerable eminence, embrace the courses of these
valleys, as they converge towards some of the river outlets*.”
   The theory is satisfactorily illustrated from the phaenomena ob
 servable in the valley of the river Arun, and in the vale of Green
 hurst. A few pages of concluding observations present some acute
 criticism on the reasoning of the French naturalists on the aera of
 the formation of chalk-basins, &c.; and here occurs a remark on the
geological site of the Thames Tunnel, which, as this analysis has oc
 cupied more space than was originally intended, we shall offer a
reply to in our next Number.

IN  the Philosophical Magazine for November last we offered some
observations      Dr. Fyfe's “Manual
                          on             Chemistry,” without any anof
ticipation that    would  it soon fall  our lot
                                         so                       to

the success which has attended Dr. Fyfe's first work, has stimulated
him     fresh exertion; and we have with

is a compound of two simple acidifiable bodies. The protosulphuret
of iron is rather a scarce substance ; and yet Dr. F. states that it is
employed in the preparation of the sulphate of iron by exposure to air                                                             ;

    Respecting the liquor ferri alkalini of the London Pharmacopoeia
Dr. Fyfe has committed several mistakes. In the first place “It is"
not “much used;” secondly, the solution of carbonate of potash must
not be added to the solution of pernitrate of iron, but the latter to the
former. The following remarks show indeed that Dr. F. is equally
ignorant of the nature of the process, and of the product obtained by                                                            it.

 merely for want of room, for we have still a few observations to make
 with regard to some other metallic compounds.
     Copper, according to Dr. Fyfe, is not an abundant production, and yet
 the county of Cornwall alone produces nearly ten thousand tons annu
 ally. Sulphate of copper according to our authoris “always” procured
 by exposing the natural ore containing sulphur and copper to the air.
 We venture to assert that this salt is never now so prepared, nor do we
 believe that it ever was.      Is Dr. Fyfe aware of the fact, that with few
 exceptions, the ore of copper is a double sulphuret of that metal and
 iron 2 And if a salt were formed from it by the action of air and mois
 ture, it would undoubtedly be the double sulphate of copper and iron,
 which is a well known compound.
    Dr. Fyfe has, we think, entirely mistaken the nature of the pulvis
 antimonialis. He says that “the oxide of antimony and phosphate of
lime enter into union and form a triple phosphate of antimony and
lime.” Now it appears to us that there is not the slightest evidence
of combination existing between the oxide and the phosphate; indeed
of      all

precision with regard to his statements.    We may observe that the
wood-cuts which he has introduced “are few and far between ;” but
their quality is such, that whether intended for use or ornament, we
cannot lament their scarcity.
   Unless Dr. Fyfe writes for medical pupils only, he should be careful
to avoid such terms as aqua potassae and aqua ammonia, which com
mon readers might find it difficult to comprehend.—We cannot omit
to notice the extreme facility with which Dr. Fyfe alters the names
of the various authors whom he quotes:—thus we have Herschell
for Herschel, Allan for Allen, Sommerville for Somerville, Philip                                                        for

for Arago,  Dobereigner  and  Doboreigner        Döbereiner, and many         for
other similar mistakes.   We observe also that Cryophorus          three                                      is
times written  Creophyrus.

 Purificacion and Neiva, there remains no church or public edifice of
importance that has not been either overthrown or materially da
maged.      In the towns of Purificacion and Ibogué, the shock was so
powerful as to throw down many houses constructed of cane, with
thatched roofs.     In Neiva, not only were       the public buildings de  all

   The observations made by the author at Port Bowen, in 1825, on
the diurnal changes of magnetic intensity taking place in the dipping
and horizontal needles, appeared to indicate a rotatory motion of the
polarizing axis of the earth, depending on the relative position of the
sun, as the cause of these changes.   By Captain Foster's remaining
at Spitzbergen during the late northern voyage of discovery, a                               fa
vourable opportunity was afforded him of prosecuting this inquiry.
Instead of making the observations with a single needle, variously
suspended, as had been done at Port Bowen, two were employed;
the one adjusted as a dipping needle, and the other suspended hori
zontally. The relation between the simultaneous intensities of the
two needles could thus be ascertained, and inferences deduced rela
tive to the question, whether a diurnal variation in the dip existed as
one of the causes of the observed phaenomena; or whether, the dip
remaining constant, they were occasioned by a change in the inten
                                                                       -

   #he dipping needle used, was one belonging to the Board of Lon
gitude, and made by Dollond —both this and the horizontal needle
were made in the form of parallelopipedons, each 6 inches long, 0.4
broad, and 0.05 thick. The experiments were continued from the
30th of July to the 9th of August, and were so arranged, that in the
course of two days an observation was made every hour in the four
and-twenty; that      is,part    themof   one day, and another part
                                                in                                               in

lowing manner.      After  being  freely suspended                    a
vested     torsion, the needle was turned somewhat more than 40° out
           of
of the magnetic meridian, and the oscillations counted only when the
arc  ofvibration had decreased       40°. The times

    May      9–A paper was read, entitled “ Approximate Places of
 Double Stars in the Southern Hemisphere, for 1827, as observed at
 Paramatta, N. S. Wales.     By Mr. James Dunlop.”
    After the departure of Sir T. M. Brisbane from the Colony of New
 South Wales, the author, finding himself in the possession of re
 flecting telescopes capable of adding considerably to our knowledge
 of the nebulae and double stars of that portion, resolved to remain,
 for the purpose of making a general survey, of the heavens, from the
 south pole to 30° of south declination.      The dark nights in the
 absence    of the moon were devoted to observations of the nebulae,
  and the  moonlight    to those of double stars, of which however only
 a part could be subjected to exact micrometrical measurement.
  The apparatus employed for this purpose consisted of a 46-inch
 achromatic telescope, equatorially mounted, and furnished with two
 micrometers;–one a parallel-line micrometer, the author's own
 workmanship; the other, a double-image micrometer, on Amici's
 principle.     Those which could not be micrometrically measured,
 had their positions and distances noted by estimation while passing
 the field of the 9-feet reflector, with which they were discovered in
 the sweeps for nebulae, and their places are given as determined in
 the sweeps.
    The author prefaces his catalogue with the details of the microme
 trical measures of about 30 principal Southern double stars, the most
 remarkable of which are a Crucis and a Centauri, the former bear
 ing a great resemblance, both in the magnitudes and the mutual di
 stance of        its
                individuals,     Castor; the latter being star
                                         to                             the first         of

   It follows from these facts that sulphuric acid has the property not
only of dissolving compound bodies without oxidizing them, as Ber
zelius has shown with respect to the metallic cyanurets, but it dis
solves some simple bodies, such as sulphur and selenium, for the
oxides of which it has no affinity, and also tellurium, with the oxide
of which it forms a crystallizable compound.—Ibid.
                  WEGETABLE ALBUMEN AND GELATINE.
    Beccaria discovered, as is well known, a peculiar glutinous prin
ciple in wheat, which is obtained by working the flour in water, and
which he called gluten. Taddei has given an account of two new pe
culiar principles which he supposes he has found in gluten, and which
he has named gliadine and zymome. The other kinds of grain yield no
principle similar to the gluten of Beccaria. But Einhof, in his remark
able analysis of rye, barley and pease, has shown that these seeds
contain a substance analogous to the gluten of wheat, but which dis
solves in water during the manipulation.               Having had occasion to
make some       experiments     on the  gluten  of  Beccaria,  I found that Tad
dei had only given two new names to the known and common prin
ciples of plants, particularly the seeds of the gramineae.
     If the gluten of Beccaria be boiled with alcohol, as long as this
fluid grows turbid on cooling, a considerable portion of the mass is
separated; if water be added to this spirituous solution, and the mix
ture be distilled, the watery fluid remaining in the retort deposits on
cooling a coherent glutinous matter, perfectly resembling gluten.
This is vegetable gelatin, the gluten, of the same nature as the mat
 ter separated, according to Einhof's method, from rye and barley.
The matter insoluble in alcohol, whilst moist is semitransparent, and
so much like animal albumen, that it is impossible to distinguish by
its   appearance only, that        it vegetable albumen, or,
                                         is                          Wahlenbergas

  M. Henri Braconnot. The substance which Proust distinguished as
  caseous oxide, he shows to have no claim to such a title, and proposes
  to call it aposepedine, as being produced by putrefaction. It also ap
  pears to be produced in certain diseases. The properties which
 Proust has assigned to caseic acid, belong, according to M. Braconnot,
 to various contaminating substances, none of which have any title to
 be considered as a particular acid. The substances present are free
 acetic acid; aposepedine; animal matter, soluble in water and insoluble
 in alcohol (ozmazome); animal matter, soluble in both water and
 alcohol; a yellow, acrid, fluid oil; a brown resin; acetate and muriate
                                                      -
 of potash, and traces of acetate of ammonia.
    On examining the fatty matter of cheese, Braconnot found it to
 consist of margarate of lime with margaric and oleic acids; the butter
 having undergone the same kind of change during the fermentation
 of cheese, as that produced when it is saponified by the action of al
 kalies or other bodies.—Ann. de Chim. xxxvi. p. 159.

    A short time since some labourers employed in collecting flints

   3. Sand, three to four feet, with boulders of granite, porphyry,
       slate, &c.
   4. Upper chalk, forming the sea-shore.
   The bone was imbedded in the sand No. 3, lying beneath the
shingle bed and upon the chalk. Vast quantities of the teeth of the
horse, and a few of a species of ox, and of the elephant (E. primi
genius), have lately been discovered in the calcareous bed.

from other trials, appear to exist in the mineral pretty constantly in
this proportion. The nitric solution was precipitated by ammonia,
and the residuum after drying indicated 48-7 grs. of metallic iron.
   I afterwards repeated my examination with greater care in the
following manner. Twenty-five grs. were dissolved in dilute nitric
acid. This solution was boiled for some time with an excess of soda,
and deposited 35 grs. of the peroxide of iron. The supernatant                                                       li

             Meteorological Observations for May 1828.                                                   79
    General Observations.—The state of the weather this month has been
changeable, except in the second week, and showery, with several frosty
mornings, and intervals of hot sunshine; but upon the whole it has been a
fine growing month for the corn and vegetation, with mild nights in ge
neral. The hoar frosts in the mornings of the 6th, 7th, 9th and 10th, and
the cold blighting winds on several subsequent days, have much injured the
late bloom of the wall and other fruit trees, and caused a great part of
the fruit that was set to fall off. The vines will not be so prolific this year
 as they have been for two or three years past. The grass fields in this
neighbourhood have been much improved by the recent showers, and from
their fine appearance a good crop may be expected: the grass in several
fields is already cut.
    The chaffers were first observed here in the evening of the 6th, and have
 been unusually numerous, having been seen on the wing every fine day
 was observed in the
      vivid,       its

                                                                        disjoined

                                                                    of              its                  Its

 after the evening twilight.
   In  the night   ofthe 15th there was thunder, and sheet-lightning the fol
 lowing might for several hours, after very warm day: thunder and light
                                                            a

 degrees higher than the mean                 of
                                      May for the last twelve years.
    The atmospheric and meteoric phanomena that have come within our
 observations this month, are one lunar and two solar halos, three meteors,
 thunder and lightning twice; and six gales          wind,    days   of        or

THE    occurrence of the same geognostic
  districts considered to be of the same        formation though
                                                                       circumstances,    in
situated  very remotely   from each  other, exhibiting  even in the
beds least developed, a repetition of the most minute particu
lars, presents a phaenomenon that cannot but attract the at
tention of naturalists; and appears to point out, that causes,
simple, but powerful and general, have concurred in produ
cing the several strata deposited in each successive epoch.
     hese reflections havefollowed from a discovery I have made
in the environs of Paris, of a substance which, in itself, is com
paratively of little importance: but it is precisely because the
beds in which it is found are so feebly and irregularly developed
as scarcely to be entitled to rank as a formation, and because
this substance, occurring in small nodules, is possessed of cha
racters not very important when taken separately, that we are
struck with         its
                  appearance         many places situated widely
                                            in   so

cobalt, it assumes the fine blue colour which denotes alumina.
   It dissolves almost entirely in caustic potash; and this so
lution affords by nitric acid a precipitate which is redissolved
by an excess of acid. This last solution is precipitated by
ammonia and by barytes.
   These experiments sufficiently prove the presence of water,
alumina, and sulphuric acid, and also the absence of silica.

of the atmosphere; it was not possible,  consequently, that they
should be found at the surface of the globe, but probable that
they might exist in the interior: and allowing this hypothesis,
it became easy to account for volcanic fires, by exposure of
the metals of earths and alkalies to air and water; and to ex
plain, not only the formation of lavas, but likewise that of ba
salts and many other crystalline rocks, from the slow cooling
of the products of combustion or oxidation of the newly-dis
covered substances.
     I developed   this opinion in a paper on the decomposition
of the   earths, published     in 1808; and since 1812              have en            I

up in the ladle, it appeared that the disengagement of heat
was partly owing to the peroxidation of the protoxide of iron,
and to the combination of the alkali of the nitre with the earthy
basis of the lava; for where the nitre had melted, the colour
had changed from olive to brown. This conclusion was still
further proved by the circumstance that chlorate of potash
                                                                                                                   a so

to descend; and the effect was not transient, for a violent ca

again ascending the mountain.

found the appearance of the lava considerably changed; the
bocca from which it issued on the 5th of December was closed,
and the current now flowed quietly and without noise from a
chasm in the cooled lava about three hundred feet lower down.
The heat was evidently less intense. I repeated my experi

ver and platinum to the fused lava: they were not at               changed    all

entirely covered with white, yellow, and reddish saline sub

  violent explosion. I need not say that when I was standing
  on the edge of the crater witnessing this phaenomenon, the
  wind was blowing strongly from me: without this circumstance
  it would have been dangerous to have stood on the edge of
  the crater; and whenever from the loudness of the thunder
  the eruption promised to be violent, I always ran as far as pos
  sible from the seat of danger.
     As soon as the eruption had taken place, the ashes and
  stones which rolled down the crater seemed to fill up the aper
  ture, so that it appeared as if the ignited and elastic matter
  were discharged laterally; and the interior of the crater as
  sumed the same appearance as before.
         I
       shall now offer some observations on the theory of these
 phaenomena.                   It    almost demonstrable that none of
                                    appears
  the chemical causes          anciently   assigned for volcanic fires can
  be true.       Amongst      these,  the combustion of mineral coal is
  one of the most current; but it seems wholly inadequate to
  account for the phaenomena.                However large a stratum of
  pit-coal,            its
                  combustion under the surface could never produce
  violent and extensive heat; for the production                         carbonic          of
  acid gas, when there was                      no
                                        free circulation         air, must tend      of
  constantly          impede the process: and

94     Prof. Hare's Rationale on the Difficulty of separating
  existence of such alloys of the metals of the earths as may burn
 into lava in the interior, the whole phaenomena may be easily
 explained from the action of the water of the sea and air on
 those metals; nor is there any fact or any of the circumstances
 which       I
            have mentioned in the preceding part of this paper,
 which cannot be easily explained according to that hypothesis.
 For almost all the volcanoes in the old world of considerable
magnitude are near, or at no considerable distance from the
 sea: and if it be assumed that the first eruptions are produced
 by the action of sea water upon the metals of the earths, and
 that considerable cavities are left by the oxidated metals thrown
 out as lava, the results of their action are such as might be an
ticipated; for after the first eruptions, the oxidations which
produce the subsequent ones may take place in the caverns
below the surface; and when the sea is distant, as in the vol
canoes of South America, they may be supplied with water
from great subterranean lakes; as Humboldt states that some
of them throw up quantities of fish.
    On the hypothesis of a chemical cause for volcanic fires, and
reasoning from known facts, there appears to me no other ade
quate source than the oxidation of the metals which form the
bases of the earths and alkalies; but it must not be denied that
considerations derived from thermometrical experiments on
the temperature of mines and of sources of hot water, render
it probable that the interior of the globe possesses a very high
temperature: and the hypothesis of the nucleus of the globe
being composed of fluid matter, offers a still more simple so
lution of the phaenomena of volcanic fires than that which has
been just developed.
    Whatever opinion may be ultimately formed or adopted on
                  I
this subject, hope that these inquiries on the actual products
of a volcano in eruption will not be without interest for the
Royal Society.

parated (their surfaces remaining parallel) with a velocity as
great as that of the blast, a column of air must meanwhile be
interposed 64 times greater than that which would escape
from the tube during the interim. Consequently, if                    the air           all

                                         the tube; and yet the air can

On the Composition      of the  Ores  of Manganese      described by Mr.
                               Haidinger.
Method     of Analysis—PURE             fragments of the ores were
                                 carefully selected, reduced to fine
powder in a mortar of agate, and washed with distilled water.
Some of the ores yielded nothing to the action of water; but
from some of them, especially from those of Ihlefeld, minute
quantities of the muriate and sulphate of lime, and sometimes
of soda, were separated by the action of water. It is the ac
cidental presence of the muriates which gives rise to the dis
engagement of chlorine when sulphuric acid is added to some
of the native oxides of manganese, and which induced Mr.
Macmullin to regard chloric acid as a constituent of these ores.
For the correction of this error we are indebted to Mr. Richard
Phillips", with whose observation my own experiments cor
respond;—none of the native oxides yield a trace of chlorine
on the addition of sulphuric acid, provided the muriates have
been previously removed by washing.
   The ores, before being submitted to analysis, were dried at
212°F., by which means they were brought to the same degree
of dryness which they possessed before being washed. The
water naturally contained in them was ascertained in every
instance by heating a known quantity of the ore to redness,
and collecting the water in a tube filled with fragments of the
chloride of calcium.
   The quantity of oxygen was in most cases ascertained both
by bringing the ore to the state of red oxide by exposure to a
white heat, and by converting it into the protoxide by means
of heat and hydrogen gas. When performed with the pre
cautions stated in the first part of this communication, either
of these methods may be relied on with confidence; but the
first is more convenient in general practice, because it requires
less time and a more simple apparatus.              The latter is some
times   very troublesome,    owing   to the difficulty  with which some
of the ores of manganese, the native peroxide for example, are

from the ores             by
                   heat, was examined with test paper, but was
always found quite free from alkaline        acid reaction. The     or
absence     of
             carbonates was ascertained        the entire want           by                           of
effervescence         on

98                 Dr. Turner's Chemical Examination
is free from siliceous earth, lime, baryta, and every other im
purity.    It is the purest native oxide of manganese which has
fallen under my notice.       Its powder has a uniform brown tint,
         I
and have been unable to observe in it any tendency to pass
into the peroxide by absorbing oxygen from the air. After
exposure to the air for six months, during which it was fre
 quently moistened with distilled water, it underwent no change
 of weight. Cold sulphuric acid acts very feebly on this oxide.
 M. Gmelin” of Heidelberg states that it is not dissolved at all
                                             I
 by this acid in the cold, and was at first of the same opinion:
 but by employing a considerable quantity of the oxide, and
 agitating the mixture frequently, the acid does acquire a red
 tint in the course of two or three days.        In this respect man
 ganite agrees with the peroxide; but differs from           the other               all
 species, which communicate            red coloura     cold sulphurie     to
 acid with much greater facility.

parts or two equivalents of the deutoxide of manganese, and

    The grey oxide from Undenaes in West Gothland, analysed
by Arfwedson, is a similar compound.

heat the loss is only 0.65 per cent, indicating 0-215 of oxygen.
When dissolved in muriatic acid, a small quantity of silica is
left, amounting to 0:337 per cent; and on adding sulphuric
acid to the solution, a little sulphate of baryta subsides, indi
cating 0-111 per cent of the pure earth.                Hausmannite is ac

   This oxide is manifestly an anhydrous red oxide of manga
nese. . The small quantity of oxygen lost at a white heat is
probably owing to the admixture of a little deutoxide or per
oxide, combined with the baryta.
   From some preliminary experiments on hausmannite, M.
Gmelin of Heidelberg” inferred that it is a pretty pure red
oxide, an inference which entirely agrees with the result of
the preceding analysis.       This is the only chemical examination
of hausmannite by other chemists, which I have met with.
The material for my analysis was part of a specimen from
Ihlefeld, for which   I am indebted to the kindness of Professor
Stromeyer.
   Analysis of Pyrolusite, or the Prismatic Manganese-ore.—
The following analysis was made with a compact columnar
variety from Elgersburg, which has a specific gravity of 494,
and the individuals of which have a parallel direction. With
sulphuric acid it does not yield a trace of chlorine; and
the only impurities which       I  could discover in it are silica and
baryta, the former amounting to 0.513, and the latter to 0.532
per cent.
               * Leonhard's    Handbuch     der Oryktognosia.
                                                                      The

                  of the Orides of Manganese.                                    101
   The quantity of water was determined as usual by means of
the chloride of calcium, and amounted to 1-12 per cent.
   On exposing 23-746 grains of this oxide to a white heat,
the loss proved to be 3-064 grains or 12.90 per cent.         Sub
tracting 1-12 for water, there remain 11-78 as the loss of
oxygen.
   Accordingly, 100 parts of the pyrolusite were resolved into
               Red oxide.........                      ...

Now, omitting the water, baryta, and silica as accidental im
purities, the remaining 97-835 parts lose 11.78 parts, or 12:04
per cent of oxygen in being converted into the red oxide. On
the supposition that pyrolusite is composed of one equivalent
of manganese and two equivalents of oxygen, it should lose in
passing into the state of red oxide exactly 12:122 per cent of
oxygen, a quantity which corresponds closely with the result
of analysis. It is therefore an anhydrous peroxide of man
ganese.
  I  have analysed another columnar variety of pyrolusite,
which has a density of 4-819, and of which the individuals ra
diate from a common centre.                   I
                                    brought it with me from Ger
many, and believed it to be from Ihlefeld, as the ticket indi
cated; but Mr. Haidinger, after carefully inspecting several
large cabinets in Germany, has been unable to discover any
similar specimen which is known to have been found in that
place.    Its
            locality therefore    doubtful.

102            Dr. Turner's      Chemical Examination
Subtracting 2784 as impurities, there remain 97.214 parts,
which lose 11:599, or 11:931 per cent, of oxygen in being.
converted into the red oxide. It is therefore an anhydrous
peroxide, most probably containing an admixture of some
other oxide.         -               -            -
    Analysis of Psilomelane, or the Uncleavable Manganese-ore.
-This mineral when reduced to powder has a brownish-black
colour.    With sulphuric acid it does not emit any odour of
chlorine.    It dissolves completely in muriatic acid, excepting
a small quantity of silica which amounts to 0.26 per cent; and
the only substances which          I   could detect in the solution are
baryta and the oxide of manganese. Though this ore has been
placed by mineralogists among the oxides of iron, under the
names of Black Hematite and Black Iron-ore, pure fragments
of it do not contain a trace of that metal.
    When heated to redness psilomelane gives out 6.216 per
cent of water. The diminution in weight occasioned by ex
posure to a white heat is 13:58 per cent; and on subtracting
6216 for water, there remains 7:364 as the loss in oxygen.
    To ascertain the quantity of baryta 30.028 grains of the mi
neral were dissolved in muriatic acid, and the baryta precipi
tated by means of the sulphate of soda, a considerable excess
of muriatic acid being allowed to remain in the liquid, to pre
vent any manganese from adhering to the precipitate. The
sulphate of baryta, after exposure to a red heat, amounted to
7,434 grains, equivalent, according to the atomic numbers of
Dr. Thomson, to 4:914 grains, or 16:365 per cent of pure
baryta.
    According to this analysis, 100 parts of psilomelane have
yielded of

    The precise atomic constitution of psilomelane is not made
apparent by this analysis; and, indeed, the result is of such a
nature as to leave no doubt of this mineral containing more
 than one oxide of manganese.             For it follows, from the quan
 tity of oxygen expelled by heat, that a considerable part of
 the manganese must be in the form of peroxide; but it is
 equally clear that the whole of it cannot be in that state, be
 cause 69-795 parts of red oxide require 9.627 instead of 7.364
 parts of oxygen to constitute the peroxide. On perceiving
                                                                    this

                     of a given    Surface on another given Surface.                                          105
 establish a law by which a determinate point of the second
 surface is to correspond to every point of the first. This will
 have been effected if                 T
                            and U have been made equal to two
 functions of t and u. These functions will cease to be arbi
 trary as soon as they are required to satisfy certain conditions.
 As X, Y, Z next become likewise functions of t and u, these
 functions must, therefore, besides satisfying the conditions re
 quired by the nature of the second surface, also fulfill those of
 the representation.
    The problem of the Royal Society of Sciences prescribes
 that the representation shall be similar to the object repre
  sented in the smallest parts.   It therefore, first required     is,                                         to
 find      an
           analytical expression for this condition.  Let     sup                                        us

portionality takes place, and the second condition is already

The differential equation                           w   = d tº + du” =                     0 gives these two
integrals
                        t --         iu    =    const.,           t   -i         u   =   const.
and in like manner the two integrals of the equation <U+017F> =
d T*-i-d U* = 0, are the following T-Fi U = const.,  U=                                                T–i
const. The two general solutions of the problem are ac
cordingly
              I. T+i U = f(t+iu),                                 T-i U = f'(t—iu)
              II. T-Fi U = f(t—iu),                               T-i U = f'(t+iu).
This result   may be thus expressed:       signifying an arbitrary
function, the real part of f(x + iy) is to be taken for a, and the
                                                                            f
imaginary part divided by i for y or for —y.
   If  the functional characteristics ®, 4' are taken in the same
signification which they have in article 7, and if we put
                    4 (a     + iy) = *-i-in, p'(z—iy) = #–in
          ;
where and m will be clearly real functions                                                   of   w   and y, we
have by the first solution

   The ratio of increase or the scale is consequently constant
throughout, and the whole representation similar to the surface
represented. For every other function f, it may be easily
proved that the scale cannot be constant, and that the simila
rity can only take place in the smallest part.        the places                    If
are  given  which are to correspond  in the representation   to a
determinate number of given points of the first plane, we may
easily determine by the common method of interpolation the
simplest algebraical function f, which will fulfill those condi

XVII.      Analysis of two new Mineral Substances, consisting of
     Bi-seleniuret of zinc and Sulphuret of Mercury, found at
     Culebras in Mexico.   By Professor DEL Rio".
       step of the traveller in this Republic discovers to
EACH
  him something new. Mr. Joseph Manuel Herrera, in an
excursion to Culebras, near the mining district of El Doctor,
found a mineral resembling cinnabar, accompanied by metallic
quicksilver, in the limestone which overlies the red sandstone
(arenisca rowa), and he gave me a few small specimens of this
substance.     Some considerable time afterwards Col. Robinson
gave me an additional quantity, informing me at the same
time that Dr. Magos had obtained two ounces and a half of
quicksilver from sixteen ounces of the ore.
   Under the blowpipe the red ore burns with a beautiful
violet-coloured flame, accompanied by much smoke of a most
offensive smell, resembling that of rotten cabbage: the resi
due is a grayish-white earthy matter.
   Intimately admixed with the red mineral is another sub
stance so strongly resembling light gray silver ore, that I ac
knowledge that           I
                     mistook                 it,
                                      first, for this ore
                                                    at        silver.                  of
My only doubt            on
                      the subject arose from the consideration
that gray silver ore and cinnabar are never found together.
It differs, however, from gray silver
der when scraped, and                 ...  yielding blacker pow

are observed       as

letter, in which          I
                       shall confine myself to the correction of
 some of the errors into which Mons. de Montbret has fallen,
 and to rebutting the conclusions drawn by this writer and
 Mons. Brué against the accuracy of my measurements.
    The principal objection raised against the great elevation
 which I have attributed to certain peaks of the Peruvian Andes,
 situated between the 14th and 17th parallels of south latitude,
 consists in an assumption, that if the geographical position in
 which my astronomical observations have placed these moun
tains be correct, they must be easily seen from the coasts of
the Pacific Ocean, and could not have hitherto escaped the
 attention of the navigators frequenting the ports of Peru situ
ated in or near the same latitude.
    To meet this inference,             I
                                   take the liberty of annexing an
 extract from a letter, which, in my own justification,           have              I
judged it necessary to address to Mons. Coquebert de Mont
bret, in reply to his observations:—
    “The great chain of the Andes, between the 14th and 20th
parallels of southern latitude, is divided into two longitudinal
and parallel ridges, or Cordilleras (the name by which they
are designated by the Creole population of Peru). These two
cordilleras are separated by a very extensive interalpine valley,
the mean elevation of which is 12,600 feet;             southern porits
tion  is traversed

plains      Chiquitos and Moxos, and the confluents

 empty themselves into the lake         Titicaca, and into the river

accuracy of my observations as that conveyed in the paper of
the latter; since a reference even to the old and inaccurate map
of South America, by Olmedilla de la Cruz, or to the incorrect
compilation of Alcedo, must have rendered evident to the
merest tyro in geographical science, the physical impossibility
of descrying an eminence no more than 24,200 British feet
above the level of the ocean, from a distance which exceeds
                                                                    -

Sorata, from the midst of a group of snow-capped pinnacles,
some of which attain an elevation of 23,000 feet. The Nevado
of Sorata is situated to the east of the large Indian village of the
same name, and is elevated 25,200 feet above the level of the
sea, or 12,450 feet above the waters of the lake of Titicaca:—
as deduced from a trigonometrical measurement taken from
the shores of the lake, and from a determination (made at a
less distant station) of the height of that portion of the sum

the water would not penetrate glass,              had reduced the ques

vessels through the “cork and                       all

    It may      beconcluded from recorded experiments, that well
fitted   glass   stoppers  (by the bye, every chemist knows such

                     obtained       will confine the vapour

will also prevent the water from entering. When mercury

not exist in cork. My explanation is this; cork is elastic, and
by the pressure of the sea is readily condensed, and conse
quently much diminished in bulk, first that part out of the
bottle where the sides are not protected by the neck, and then
gradually the remaining length until the cork, separated en
tirely from the glass, affords a free passage for the water, un
less the sealing or wrapper be of such a tenacious and ductile
nature as to adhere to the glass and the cork so as to fill up the
space that would otherwise be left, and yet not yield com
pletely to the pressure; if it be brittle, it either separates from
the glass, or cracks, or both, allowing a free passage to the
water. Even pitch when cooled in the deep water would be
very brittle and crack or separate from the bottle readily, and
it would resume       former ductility and appearance upon re
                            its

      my paper published                    in

only        on
         the two following assumptions. First, that the method
employed was adopted         random and without any preliminary
                                       at
inquiry, and was intended          include every possible case; and
                                             to

other acid except the muriatic acid,           the stomachs      inani                    of

from my paper,             I,  interested individual, can scarcely,
                                  as    an

say    least, that
           at        never intended that such inferences should
                         I
 be drawn, nor was aware that any thing had been stated                                         to

   With respect                    these assumptions     may      said,                  be

 I think it more    frequently happens that some salt containing a
 combustible acid, e.g. the acetate of soda, is actually secreted;
and that this, by being decomposed by the free muriatic acid,
gives origin to the apparent presence of frae acetic acid.
     In conclusion, it may be observed that, during the long
period that my attention has been turned to this interesting
 subject, a great many curious and most important facts have
 come to my knowledge: in some of these I have been an
 ticipated by Messrs. T. and G.; while others appear to have

chemical ignorance, because they failed to point out what pro

charging them with denying, generally, the existence of every
thing else that did not happen to fall within the limits of their
own observation;–charges which these gentlemen, from not
 sufficiently attending to the general character of my brief
announcement,        have inadvertently brought against me under
very similar circumstances.
 XXI.     On the vitrified Fort of Dunnochgoil, in the Isle of Bute.
                  By SAMUEL SHARPE, Esq. F.G.S."
THE        fort is on a rocky point at the south-west corner of
       the Isle of Bute, perhaps the point nearest to the Isle of
Arran. It is at some distance from trees, habitations, and
higher ground.
    There remains now little more than the ground-plan, which
may be traced by the vitrified foundations; but at one part the
wall is more than a foot high, built of rough stones not much
larger than bricks, and by vitrifaction formed into one solid
mass, much like the slag of a furnace.                            -
    The   parts  can best be described       by  reference to the follow
ing figure.
    From q there is a gradual ascent to the outer chamber
 efgh, which appears to have been surrounded on two sides
the patient smelt strongly of vinegar; the saliva and fluids occasionally
ejected from the stomach contained also the same acid in abundance, as
apparently did the perspirable fluid; for the whole body exhaled a strong
odour somewhat like sour milk: during this time the urine was strongly
alkalescent. In another anomalous case, I have seen the blood itself strongly
acid; the acid was of a combustible nature, but from peculiar circumstances
it was not satisfactorily proved to be vinegar, though this was probably the
case.

pressure of the spring, acting on the lever at L, is not coun
teracted by the hand of the operator.
    Suppose that while the bulb of this instrument, filled with
water or mercury, is within a bell glass, containing a gas, the
lever be pressed towards the handle, the valve is consequently
drawn back so as to open the orifice of the apex of the bulb,
and at the same time the piston descends below an aperture
A in the chamber. The liquid in the bulb will now of course
run out, and be replaced by gas, which is securely included,
as soon as the pressure of the spring is allowed to push the
piston beyond the lateral aperture in the chamber, and the
valve into the orifice O, in the apex of the bulb.
    The gas thus included may be transferred to any vessel,                                        in
 verted over mercury or water, by depressing the orifice of the
 bulb below that of the vessel, and moving the lever L, so as
 to open the aperture A in the chamber, and the orifice of the
 bulb simultaneously.
     The bulk of gas, included by the volumeter, will always be
 the same; but the quantity will be as the density of the gas
 into which it may be introduced.        Hence in order to measure
 a  gas  accurately,  the liquid,  whether water, or mercury, over
 which it   may  be  confined,  should be of the same height within,
 as without. This is      especially  important, in the case of mer
  cury, which being nearly fourteen times heavier than water,
 affects the density of a gas materially, even when             surface             its
  within the    containing   vessel does not deviate    sensibly  from
  the level of its surface without.

water of a pneumatic cistern, the air being allowed to escape,
and the valve then to shut itself under
the water, on lifting the vessel it comes
up full of the liquid, and will remain
so, if the lower orifice be ever so little
below the surface of the water in the
cistern. Thus situated, it may be filled
with hydrogen, proceeding by a tube,
from a self-regulating reservoir. If the
apex A be then placed under any ves
sel, inverted duly in the usual way, the
gas will pass into it as soon as the valve
is lifted.
   Volumes of atmospheric air are taken
by the same instrument, simply by low
ering it into the liquid of the cistern,
placing the apex under the vessel into
which it is to be transferred, and lifting
the valve: or preferably by filling it
with water, and emptying it in some
place out of doors where the atmo
sphere may be supposed sufficiently
pure, and afterwards transferring the air
thus obtained, as above described, by
opening the valve while the apex is within the vessel, in which
the mixture is to be made.      In this case, while carrying the
volumeter forth and    back,  the orifice must be closed.   This
object is best effected by a piece of sheet metal, or pane of
glass.
  It isnecessary that the water, the atmosphere, and the gases
should be at the same temperature during this process.
                 III.   Sliding Rod Gas Measure.
  The construction of this instrument differs from that of my
sliding rod eudiometers, in having a valve which is opened and
shut by a spring and lever, acting upon a rod passing through
a collar of leathers.    By means of this valve, any gas, drawn
into the  receiver, is included so as to be free from the possi
bility of loss, during       its
                            transfer from one vessel      another.   to

   The following is an engraving of the barometer-gauge eudio
meter for explosive mixtures. R is a glass receiver. Within
the receiver near W is an arc of platina, by the ignition of
which the gas is inflamed. C is a cock with three orifices,
either of which may be made to communicate with the re
ceiver, according to the position of the lever L. More than
one of the orifices cannot be open at once, but  allmay     at

side the receiver, with which    itcommunicates through the
pipe  P, and the valve cock V,   by means  ofwhich the commu

   The receiver is a stout glass tube, which tapers from two
inches, in diameter, internally, to one inch; being open at the
larger end, at the smaller end closed.    This form was adopted
as combining   strength, to resist explosions, with a capacity to
hold larger quantities of gas than have heretofore been ex
ploded in eudiometers.    It must be evident that the larger the
quantities  of gas operated  with, the less upon the whole will
be the influence of any  minute leakage, or error in measure
ment.
    The tube is cemented at the larger end into a brass fer
 rule, which is screwed into a casting of the same metal,                                   fur
nished with iron feet. Into the same casting, a brass plug
screws, through which are inserted stout wires, one of them
insulated, for producing galvanic ignition, in an arc of platina
wire, as already described in the case of my other eudiome
ters *.
    With the gauge-tube, is associated a scale divided into 450
equal parts. Instead of inhaling successively due portions of
hydrogen and atmospheric air, as heretofore described, I have
found it better to mix them previously in known volumes, by
means of the volumeters, described in the preceding articles.
Having by the aid of one of those instruments made a mixture
of one part of hydrogen, with two of atmospheric air, it fol
lows, that if 300 measures be taken by a sliding-rod eudiome
ter, or other adequate means, there will be a mixture, in the
quantity so taken, of 200 parts of atmospheric air, and 100 of
hydrogen.      In case equal volumes of these aeriform fluids be
mixed into one bell-glass, 200 measures would contain 100 of
each.     This mode of procuring such mixtures, is preferable
from          its
           saving trouble, and lessening the chances       error               of            in
the   measurement;   and because the   gaseous fluids become more
thoroughly blended,—a result which does not follow their ad
mixture       immediately
                    as        might          as

          —P.           STRUVE          communicated           the result of his
         "T.M vations and measurements of the apparent distance be
                                                                                  obser
tween the body and the ring of Saturn : from which it appears that he
is decidedly of opinion that the body of Saturn is not in the centre of
the ring.    From a mean of 15 measurements, he makes the apparent
distance on the left side equal to 11"-272, and on the right side equal
to 11"-390: the difference is 0"-215. The probable error of these mean
measurements he considers equal to 0"-024. M. Struve adds some
slight corrections to his former measurements of the diameters, &c.
of Jupiter, of Saturn, and of the Ring; which he has deduced from a
more accurate determination of the value of his micrometer.
   The next communication was from Mr. Prinsep of Benares, giving
an account of two eclipses which he had observed at that place in
the course of the preceding year. The first was a solar eclipse on
April 26, 1827. The commencement was not observed; but during
the course of the eclipse a number of micrometrical measurements
were taken by means of the five horizontal wires of a Troughton's
18-inch circle: and he states the end of the eclipse to have taken
place at 20° 3" 7",5 mean time at Benares. Mr. Prinsep then adds,
“At the period marked as the end of the eclipse, the sun's disc was
clear of the moon : but, for 10 or 15 seconds later, I remarked, as it
were, a stretching of the sun's edge toward the point which the moon
had just quitted. This was apparently the effect of refraction by the
moon's atmosphere.” The end of this eclipse was also observed by
Mr. Walter Ewer at Cawnpore, at 19" 56m 3,5 mean time at that
place. The second eclipse, alluded to by Mr. Prinsep, was of the
Moon, on November 3, 1827. It was observed in the same manner
as the solar eclipse above mentioned. The following is the result of
his observations, stated in mean time :                                 h m     s

    Mr. Rumker of Paramatta, in New South Wales, communicated
the result of several series of observations in which he had been en
gaged at the Observatory there. They contained, 1st. The determina
tion of the solstice in December 1826, June 1827, and December
 1827. In deducing the results, he notices the insufficiency of De
lambre's formula for the Reduction to the Meridian in cases of great
altitude: and suggests an alteration when the sun culminates near
the zenith. 2nd. Observations on the inferior conjunction of Venus in
December 1826. 3rd. Observations of moon-culminating stars during
parts of the years 1826 and 1827. 4th. Places of some of the fixed
stars in the southern hemisphere.       5th. A Catalogue of stars with
which the great comet of 1825 was compared.       6th. Corrected obser
vations of the place of the said comet.     7th. A determination of the
latitude of the Observatory by reflection with the mural circle.
   The next communication was from Mr. Curnin of Bombay, giving
a more accurate account of his observations        of moon-culminating
stars at that Observatory, during the year 1825: from a mean of                                       all

the distance should be about 39°4 inches: and so in proportion.
   In order to adjust a pendulum of this kind, it must be placed on the
agate planes, and the number of vibrations determined in the usual
manner; beginning, for the sake of regularity, with the knife-edge A;
then inverting the pendulum, and determining the number of vibrations
with the knife-edge B. In these preliminary experiments it is not ne
cessary to extend the observations beyond one coincidence; neither is
it requisite to apply any other correction than for the arc of vibration,

                 NEW ASTRONOMICAL           EPHEMERIS.
WEthe    have to congratulate the public on the appearance of one of
            most useful publications in practical astronomy that has
ever yet been formed.       It is an Ephemeris arranged in an entirely
new manner, computed        on an entirely new principle, and adapted to
the present advanced state of that important science.
   Our readers are aware that, for the last fifty years, the celebrated
Bode conducted the Berlin Ephemeris with great credit to himself,
and with great advantage to astronomy. This work, inferior to none
on the subject, contained annually a vast variety of valuable informa
                                                                    tion,

tion, which would probably have perished, had it not been for the
interest and zeal that Bode took in everything relating to astronomy.
Notwithstanding the rapid strides which the science has made on the
Continent, little or no alteration however was made in the usual co
lumns of this annual publication during Bode's life-time; but on
his death M. Encke, who has been appointed to succeed him, de
termined on re-modelling the work altogether, and on adapting                                                         it.

    The present, however, forms a new aera in the science; and some
thing may now perhaps be done to place astronomy (as it ought to
be) on a better footing in this country. And since oeconomy is the
order of the day, and has in fact been publicly declared to be one of
the causes of the dissolution of the Board of Longitude, we would
propose to follow up that system, by getting rid also of the whole of
the expense incurred in forming the Nautical Almanac, and placing
it in totally different hands. For, the computers of the Berlin Ephe

    One of my first efforts was directed to that most valuable instru

so very materially, as to be able to furnish one capable of effecting as
complete an exhaustion as the most perfect form of the instrument
hitherto devised, and, at the same time, nearly as simple and as cheap
as           its
        most imperfect form.          mentioned my views       I the subject                                      on                        to

and it is surprising to observe how much of this earth the ammonia
is capable of uniting with : the evolution of hydrogen is similar to
 that with potash. When aluminum is heated to dull redness, and
 exposed to a current of chlorine, it inflames and is converted into
 chloride, which sublimes as fast as it is formed.—Ibid.

*  Arseniuret of Aluminum.—Arsenic réduced to powder and heated
to redness with aluminum, combines with it; the inflammation is less
vivid than with the preceding combustibles. The compound is a
powder of a deep gray colour, which by rubbing acquires a dull
metallic appearance, and when exposed to the air it exhales a faint
smell of arseniuretted hydrogen; when cold, the disengagement

slow, but it is much accelerated by heat.
   Telluret of Aluminum.—When the powder of tellurium was put
into a tube with aluminum, much heat was excited, and the mixture
was thrown with explosion out of the tube; this inconvenience is
avoided by not powdering the tellurium.     The product is a metal
line, brittle, black frit, which when exposed to the air emits an in
tolerable odour of telluretted hydrogen; and when thrown into wa
ter it evolves the same gas with rapidity: the water at first be
comes of a red colour, afterwards brown, and eventually opake, on
account of the interposed reduced tellurium : the telluret of alu
minum appears to decompose in water with much greater facility
than the sulphuret of the same metal.—Ibid.

crystalline matter is deposited; and there remains a stratum of a
greenish transparent substance, which is unalterable by exposure to
the air, and readily soluble in water: the solution reddens litmus
paper slightly; an excess of acid renders it purple, and eventually
blackens it.     Nitric acid when diluted and cold dissolves and
forms a colourless solution with corydalin; but when heated it be
comes of a red colour, which, when the solution is concentrated, be
comes of a blood-red colour. This action is so strong, that by the
aid of heat the smallest quantity of corydalin may be discovered in
a fluid. Muriatic acid forms with this alkali an uncrystallizable
salt; acetic acid is still more difficult of combination with it than
sulphuric acid; but it forms a crystalline salt, which may be redis
solved a second time in water and crystallized.      Tannin is one of
the most sensible tests of corydalin, as for                       all

29 to 30 francs for the same weight.
     The gooseberries are to be bruised and fermented; the alcohol is
to be separated by distillation; the residuum is to be pressed to ex

immediately,” he observes, “the compound obtained by Serullas.
But Serullas, to whom we are indebted for a great many interesting
experiments on this compound, says, that there is formed simultane
ously, iodate of soda, iodide of sodium, and hydriodide of carbon; but
I have not found the slightest trace of iodate of soda. On decom
posing the substance obtained by Serullas by means of copper, iron,
and mercury, I obtained no hydrogen, nor any other kind of gas, but
only a combination of iodine and carbon. We should therefore con
sider this substance as a compound of carbon and iodine formed in
 the following manner t—When the two alcoholic solutions are mixed,
the iodine combines with the sodium ; and the oxygen set free, unites
 to the hydrogen of the alcohol to form water; whilst the carbon of
 the alcohol (the latter being considered as a compound of water and
 olefiant gas) combines with another portion of the iodine to produce
 the iodide of carbon.
    “This iodide of carbon, distilled with corrosive sublimate, yields a
 liquid analogous to that which Serullas obtained by employing dry
 chloride of phosphorus.     It is also a compound of carbon and iodine;
 so that we now know two combinations of iodine and carbon, and
 one with carburetted hydrogen, discovered by Faraday, which is dis
 tinguished from the two others by            chemical properties and crystal

     We must therefore repeat in our justification that we object to con
tinue a  controversy, when it is degenerating from a philosophical                                 in
quiry into a personal dispute. We should not have inserted Mr. H.'s
last letter, had we observed that, instead of giving any reply to the
objections brought by a 3, and F.R.S. against his charge of failure
in Lagrange's method, he had passed them by in silence, and aimed
at taking up ne ground. We submit, however, that the fair course of
discussion absolutely requires that he should dispose of the objections,
either by admitting their validity, or by refuting them, before he can
have a claim further to occupy our pages on this subject. With his
suggestion respecting the names of his opponents we cannot com
ply: nor are names of any consequence in such discussions. As to the
letter of Veritas, it does not appear to contain anything by which
knowledge may be advanced, or our readers interested.—Ed.

162       Mr. R. Brown     on the Eristence   of active Molecules
 nucleus of the Ovulum, the point which is universally the seat
 of the future Embryo, was very generally brought into contact
 with the terminations of the probable channels of fecundation;
 these being either the surface of the placenta, the extremity of
 the descending processes of the style, or more rarely, a part
 of the surface of the umbilical cord. It also appeared, how
 ever, from some of the facts noticed in the same Essay, that
 there were cases in which the Particles contained in the grains
 of pollen could hardly be conveyed to that point of the ovulum
 through the vessels or cellular tissue of the ovarium; and the
 knowledge of these cases, as well as of the structure and
 economy of the antherae in Asclepiadea, had led me to doubt             |
 the correctness of observations made by Stiles and Gleichen
 upwards of sixty years ago, as well as of some very recent
 statements, respecting the mode of action of the pollen in the
 process of impregnation.

    It was not until late in the autumn of 1826 that could at
 tend to this subject; and the season was too far advanced to
 enable me to pursue the investigation.        Finding, however, in
 one of the few  plants then  examined,    the figure of the particles
 contained in the   grains of  pollen  clearly  discernible, and that
figure not spherical but oblong,      I expected, with some confi
dence, to meet with plants in other respects more favourable
                                                                         |
to the inquiry, in which these particles, from peculiarity of
form, might be traced through their whole course: and thus,
perhaps, the question determined whether they in any case
reach the apex of the ovulum, or whether their direct action
is limited to other parts of the female organ.
    My inquiry on this point was commenced in June 1827,
and the first plant examined proved in some respects remark
ably well adapted to the object in view.
    This plant was Clarckia pulchella, of which the grains of
pollen, taken from antherae full grown, but before bursting, were
filled with particles or granules of unusually large size, vary
ing from nearly rºboth to about 3 tºoth of an inch in length,
and of a figure between cylindrical and oblong, perhaps
slightly flattened, and having rounded and equal extremities.
While examining the form of these particles immersed in wa
      I
ter, observed many of them very evidently in motion; their
                          i.
motion consisting not only of a change of place in the fluid, ma
nifested by alterations in their relative positions, but also not
unfrequently of a change of form in the particle itself; a con
traction or curvature            place repeatedly about the middle
of one  side, accompanied    by   a corresponding swelling or con
vexity on the opposite side of the particle. In a few               in
stances the particle was seen to turn on       its
                                                 longer axis. These
motions were such    as   satisfy
                          to       me, after frequently  repeated ob

ful examination lessened my confidence                   this supposition;    in

164          Mr. R. Brown        on the Existence                 of active Molecules
In      a great proportion        of these plants             I
                                                also remarked the same
reduction of the larger particles, and a corresponding increase
of the molecules after the bursting of the antherae: the mole
cule, of apparently uniform size and form, being then always
present; and in some cases indeed, no other particles were
observed, either in this or in any earlier stage of the secreting
organ.
    In many plants belonging to several different families, but
especially to Gramineae, the membrane of the grain of pollen
is so transparent that the motion of the larger particles within
the entire grain was distinctly visible; and it was manifest also
at the more transparent angles, and in some cases even in the
body of the grain in Onagraria.                                              -
    In Asclepiadea, strictly so called, the mass of pollen filling
each cell of the anthera is in no stage separable into distinct
grains; but within,          its
                             tessellated             or
                                             cellular membrane          filled               is
with   spherical    particles,   commonly                     of
                                                 two sizes. Both these
kinds      particles when immersed
             of                              water are generally seen

vivid motion; but the apparent motions                  the larger particle
                                                                     of

bers, and in evident motion, along with a few of the larger
particles, whose motions were much less manifest, and in some
cases not observable".
     In this stage of the investigation having found, as I be
lieved, a peculiar character in the motions of the particles of
pollen in water, it occurred to me to appeal to this peculiarity
as a test in certain families of Cryptogamous plants, namely
Mosses, and the genus Equisetum, in which the existence of
sexual organs had not been universally admitted.
     In the supposed stamina of both these families, namely, in
 the cylindrical antherae or pollen of Mosses, and on the sur
 face of the four spathulate bodies surrounding the naked
 ovulum, as it may be considered, of Equisetum, I found mi
 nute spherical particles, apparently of the same size with the
 molecule described in Onagrariae, and having equally vivid
 motion on immersion in water; and this motion was still ob
 servable in specimens both of Mosses and of Equiseta, which
 had been dried upwards of one hundred years.
      The very unexpected fact of seeming vitality retained by
  these minute particles so long after the death of the plant,
 would not perhaps have materially lessened my confidence in
 the supposed peculiarity.                                  I
                                 But at the same time observed,
 that on bruising the ovula or seeds of Equisetum, which at
 first happened accidentally, I so greatly increased the number
 of moving particles, that the source of the added quantity
 could not be doubted.                       I
                               found also that on bruising first the
 floral leaves of Mosses, and then                          all
                                                       those plants,

                                                                                     in of
  thatI   readily obtained similar particles, not      equal quan
  tity indeed, but equally      motion.    Myinsupposed   test   the                                   of
 male organ was therefore necessarily abandoned.
      Reflecting       on      all

    My manner of estimating the absolute magnitude and uni
formity in size of the molecules, found in the various bodies
submitted to examination, was by placing them on a micro
meter divided to five thousandths of an inch, the lines of which
were very distinct; or more rarely on one divided to ten
 thousandths, with fainter lines, not readily visible without the
application of plumbago, as employed by Dr. Wollaston, but
which in my subject was inadmissible.
    The results so obtained can only be regarded as approxi
mations, on which perhaps, for an obvious reason, much re
liance will not be placed.          From the number and degree of
accordance of my observations, however, I am upon the whole
disposed to believe the simple molecule to be of uniform size,
though as existing in various substances and examined in cir
cumstances more or less favourable, it is necessary to state
that      its
         diameter appeared            vary from Trºgoth
                                                      to        goºgoth                               to

 I   shall not      present enter into additional details, nor shall

 follow them to the nucleus of the ovulum itself.            My en
  deavours, however, to trace them through the tissue of the
  style, in plants well suited for this investigation, both from the
  size and form of the particles, and the development of the fe
 male parts, particularly Onagrariae, was not attended with
 success; and neither in this nor in any other tribe examined,
 have I ever been able to find them in any part of the female
 organ, except the stigma.        Even in those families in which
 I  have   supposed  the ovulum to be naked, namely, Cycadeae
 and   Coniferae,        I
                    am inclined to think that the direct action of
 these particles, or of the pollen containing them, is exerted
 rather on the orifice of the proper membrane than on the apex
 of the included nucleus; an opinion which is in part founded
 on the partial withering confined to one side of the orifice of
 that membrane in the larch,-an appearance which I have re
 marked for several years.

 duced at our leisure, and the stars afterwards inserted among
 the others in their proper places.                                              -
     Amongst the micrometers hitherto used, none answers this
 purpose; for those in which the field of view is illuminated,
 weaken the effect of the telescope too much; and if illumi
 nated lines are employed, either these, or the faint stars when
 approaching near them, will disappear.                  This led me to the
 idea that the difficulty might be removed, if it were possible
 to illuminate at pleasure thin divided cross bars in the dark
 field of view.
    The beautiful discovery of Professor Gauss (Astr. Nachr.
 No. 43), that the diaphragm of a telescope may be seen by
 means of another, fixed in               axis, afforded me the means
                                                       its

is moved until a brighter observed star passes the illuminated
micrometer; and the difference is then read off. It is clear
that this method is to be applied to very small stars only, as
it requires more time than the direct observation on the illu
minated bars.
   Although we have thus described the essential parts of the
construction and use of this micrometer, we hope that those
who are engaged in revising the maps of the heavens will still

  (a piece of very smooth ivory would be preferable), on which
  a rectangular net-work has been cut by means of a dividing
  engine, and which is then filed out so that nothing remains
  but the small bars represented in the figure. These bars, of
  the breadth of a division of the micrometer, must contract in
  breadth towards the back part, in order to appear clearly de
  fined in every position of the eye. The divisions are cut
 pretty deep, in order to be easily seen by a small portion of
 light. The reading off is facilitated by a dot placed at every
 fifth division.

      That the telescope should have an equatorial motion, and be
  provided with an apparatus for minute changes of the axis, is
  clear from the preceding description.

  together with their comparison with meridian observations,
  in order to give some idea of the degree of accuracy which may
  be attained by single readings off.

      The telescope used is one by Fraunhofer, of 34" aperture,
  42" focal length, and magnifying 23 times: observations -with
  a sweeper would be somewhat more uncertain *.
      As the scale which has been adopted in the maps, does not
  well admit of greater accuracy than 0,5 in the position of the
  stars, no sensible error can arise from this method of observing,
  even with a sweeper.                  By the former methods, errors amount

     Addition.—It may be desirable to mention, that the micro
meter-apparatus here described may be made use of also as
an achromatic microscope, if the object to be viewed is brought
into the focus of the small object-glass instead of the micro
meter-plane.       But it will be necessary, for the purpose of illu
minating it and of rendering it more commodious, to give to
the whole a more convenient construction. The small object
glass might (as shown in fig. 2.) be screwed into a tube which
could be clamped to the telescope, and should in such case
have two incisions in the focus of the small object-glass, in
order to receive the frame holding the object which is to be
viewed.      Although this object may not be perfectly in the

   Imust apologize for having mentioned a subject which is
not astronomical, on account of its intimate connexion with
the preceding part of this paper.

XXIX.       Comparison  of a Formula representing the Velocity of
   Sound,   with  Capt. Parry and Lieut. Foster's Experiments
   on that   Subject at Port Bowen; with some Remarks on the
   Ellipticity of the Earth.  By W.M. GALBRAITH, Esq. A.M.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
       Gentlemen,
INp. the  first volume of the New Series of the
      837, I have given two formulae to determine  the velocity
                                                                      Phil. Mag,
of sound. It would be more       convenient, however, to adapt
that for the  temperature by  Fahrenheit's thermometer to zero
of that scale, and it becomes
V=(102,4225+ 0.1 108t)(1 +
                           ###)(10.2739– 0.0188 cos 2x)
                      + w cos ?.
 This gives the velocity in English feet, when the English ba
rometer and Fahrenheit's thermometer are used.
    By a comparison of this formula adapted to the centigrade
thermometer,     I found an almost perfect accordance with Dr.
 Moll's experiments. I also found that the effect of wind on
the 27th of June 1823 was about 19 feet,-half the difference
 between the velocities, as determined from each extremity of
the base. Indeed there can be little doubt that the velocity
 of sound is affected by that of the wind at the time. Dr. Gre
gory of Woolwich, in a series of experiments on sound de
tailed in the first volume of the Transactions of the Cambridge
Philosophical Society”, expressly states that the wind increases
or diminishes the velocity of sound according as it blows in
the same or in an opposite direction;—a conclusion which
might almost d priori have been anticipated.         The only diffi
        is,

       Now this is very nearly true in the usual state of the atmo

    I have been able to make, it seems, however, in                present                                      its

   It will be recollected that the gauge of the barometer-gauge
eudiometer is graduated into 450 degrees.       It is expedient to
commence this      experiment   with the  mercury   at 50 degrees,
which leaves 400 parts in the spheroid, and allows room for
the expansion which takes place in the beginning of the pro

find    the results to harmonize with each other, and with those
obtained by my other instruments.
   Upon the wire W, which passes through the stuffing box
into the cavity of the spheroid, a copper hood is supported,
which is just large enough to cover the cap containing the
phosphorus.     By this contrivance the phosphorus may be

meter, a communication between the inside of the receiver of
this instrument and the globe G, may be easily opened or
suspended at pleasure.                             -- - -      ..   . .
    The screw S serves to open or close a perforation which
communicates with the cavity of the receiver. .       .   . . .. . . .
    Suppose the receiver R to be occupied by lime-water as
represented in the figure.        Place the pedestal B over the
hole in the air-pump plate, which the rim of the pedestal is
ground to fit. On working the pump, the air of the receiver
above the lime-water is drawn out through the valve at the
bottom of the pipe p. Of course the air in the globe follows
it through the pipe, which leads from it into the receiver.
Having exhausted the globe and receiver, if the screw S be
so loosened as to allow the atmosphere to enter the receiver,
and press upon the surface of the lime-water while the globe
remains exhausted, the lime-water will of course rise into and
fill the globe. Should the receiver under these circumstances
be again exhausted, while by means of the flexible pipe D a
communication with the barometer-gauge eudiometer is ef
fected, the pressure of the gas in the eudiometer being greater
than that of the rare medium of the exhausted receiver        R,-it
follows that this gas will press into the globe and cause a por
tion of the lime-water to descend into the receiver. In this
way, suppose 100 measures, by the barometer-gauge, taken
from the eudiometer.       The valve-cock may then be closed,
and the screw S relaxed so as to admit the atmosphere.            The
lime-water will rise into the globe until the pressure of the
gas therein be nearly equal to that of the atmosphere.             By
agitating the globe, the carbonic acid will combine with the
lime in the water. When this object is effected, the residual gas
may be allowed to re-enter the eudiometer, where the quan
tity of it may be measured, and consequently the extent of
the absorption known.       It is not necessary that the apparatus
should remain     upon the air-pump    plate during the whole pro
cess.    By  means of the valve which covers the perforation in
the pedestal, in which the pipe P is inserted, the exhaustion
may be sustained during the removal of the receiver from the
air-pump to any part of the laboratory where it may be con
venient to connect it with the eudiometer.                            -
    I have  designated  this instrument as a carbonicometer in
my text-book, to avoid circumlocution.         It may however be
more properly called a washer of gas, than a measurer of car
bonic acid. Hence the term gasilotor would be more appro
priate. The employment of new names may appear pedantic
to some readers, but is really necessary, in order to avoid te
dious, and, at times, almost unintelligible circumlocution.

XXXIII.         On Measurements on the Earth's Surface perpendi

        so many laborious researches undertaken to deter
AFTER
  mine the figure of the earth, the opinions of philosophers
 upon that point are still very unsettled.       In proof of this it
  will be sufficient to cite what is advanced in the latest memoir
 on this subject, in which it is said that the compression ºn is
                                                                                           li

 adopted, because it is the mean between gig and a #g, the
 mits between which the ellipticity is generally supposed to be
 comprisedt.      There is at least great prudence in this pro
 cedure; for at the same time that the particular ellipticity is
 pitched upon which is nearly the best fitted to reconcile all
 the phaenomena with the measurements of the Survey, there is
 no risk incurred that the truth, when it can no longer be dis
 puted, will fall beyond the boundaries mentioned. In the
 Numbers of this Journal for May and June last, the elliptical
elements of the earth are deduced from the five most esteemed
 measurements of meridional arcs in our possession; and it is
 fully proved that the elements found represent the five                                   di
 stances on the meridian with great accuracy.         As far as our
present knowledge extends, we are therefore entitled to infer
 that the terrestrial meridians are equal ellipses of a known ex
centricity, and the earth itself an elliptical spheroid having a
known compression at the poles.

going conclusion, or to correct                     it,

 of the arc drawn from Dover perpendicular to the meridian
 of Greenwich, is 50634 fathoms”.                    I   consider the foot of this
 arc as the first station in the formula (B), and Dover as the
 second station.         Hence, m = 90°; W = 50° 7' 45"-6.                      As the
   iven distance is not a chord, but an arc on the earth's surface,
 we shall find 3 by reducing the given length, taken as an arc
 of the earth's equator, to degrees: therefore 3 =
 = 49' 53".8. The formula (B) will now give us the longi
                                                                     #         x 3600'<U+017F>

 As we have no azimuth either at Dover or Dunkirk, we must
apply the formula (A). The two latitudes are,

 General Roy makes the distance from Dover to Dunkirk equal

the mode of calculation in the Survey, this length is not a chord,

    In order to confirm the result obtained at Beachy Head,
I  shall add a similar instance taken from the New Survey. At
the station of Fairlightt, the angle between the meridian.
and Blancnez, was found 85° 36' 36"-73 = m; the latitude of
Blancnez is 50° 55'29":36 = x. The arc on the earth's sur
                   x 3600"=      41' 31".51.     The formula (B) will now
give us the difference of longitude of the two stations equal to
 1° 5'33"-42.        According to the Survey, the length of the per
pendicular arc at Blancnez is 41998.66 fathoms; and the
amplitude of this arc, computed from the difference of longi
tude, is 41' 19":58; and hence, by proportion, the perpendi
cular degree is 60976 fathoms.              Now, at the latitude of Blanc
nez, a perpendicular degree     -- - on the surface of the spheroid is-
60974°5 fathoms.
    It   appears that the perpendicular degrees at Beachy Head
and at Blancnez on the French coast, agree very exactly with
the elliptical spheroid deduced from the meridional arcs. The
 coincidence of the curvature of the earth's surface with the
 same spheroid in this region, may likewise beinferred from the
calculation of the difference of longitude between Greenwich
                                                       j,
and Paris, which brings out a result so near the quantity ob
tained by direct observation. Let us next inquire how the case
will stand at a very distant part of the globe. Colonel Lamb
ton has made in India a measurement precisely similar to that
at Beachy Head and Dunnose in the                                  Survey. The

this value of 3, and the values of m and N noted above, the

to 48'57":05. From this we get 47' 47":03, for the amplitude
of the perpendicular arc at Carangooly, and 60866 fathoms,
for the perpendicular degree, very little different from 608652,
the length on the surface of the spheroid at the latitude of
Carangooly.                                                          -

multiply the thousandth part of the approximate height by the
double sum 2 (t+t') of the detached thermometers; the cor
rection will be either positive or negative, according as t +t is
itself either positive or negative.
   The second and last correction, that for the latitude and
the diminution of weight, is obtained by taking, in table D,
the number which corresponds vertically to the latitude, and
horizontally to the approximate height: this correction, which
can never exceed 28 metres, is always added.
   In those very rare cases where the lower station is itself con
siderably elevated above the sea, it will be necessary to apply
a small correction to be found in table E.
   In order to understand the calculation of a height by means
                                                   F.
of these tables, and those prefixed and appended, let us sup
pose that in latitude =44° we had at the                  of the sea, the
barometer = 30.04 English inches, temperature of the instru
ment =22°5 centigrade, and of the air =22°.                 At the top of
a  mountain,    the barometer =26-57          English  inches,  tempera
ture of the instrument =17:5, and of the air = 17°.
   In order to obtain the equivalents of the English inches in
millimetres, search in table A; where the number of millime
tres corresponding to 30'04 inches observed at the sea will
be 763, and that of 26'57 observed on the mountain will be
675. Having obtained these equivalents, the calculation pro
ceeds:                                    Mill.    Metres.

             a fourth example, we will consider the represen
                  of the surface of an ellipsoid of revolution in
a plane.   Let a and b be the two principal semiaxes of the el
lipsoid, so that we may put a = a cost sin u, y=a sint sin u,
z = b cos u. We shall then have
                w    =    a”   sin uºd tº +(a cos          u”-H bº        sin    u")   duº

and the differential formula                     w   = 0   gives,     if        we   put for brevity
v(1           #)      =    s   (b   being supposed             3    a),

XXXVI.          On the Influence of the Air in determining the Cry
     stallization of Saline Solutions. By Thomas GRAHAM, Esq.
     A.M. F.R.S. E.”
THE  phaenomenon referred to has long been known, and
  popularly exhibited in the case of Glauber's salt, without
any adequate explanation. A phial or flask is filled with a
boiling saturated solution of sulphate of soda or Glauber's
                                                                   by
                 is its
salt, and       mouth immediately stopped               cork,        piece
                                                                      a             or  a
of bladder       tied  tightly  over           it,
                                         while still hot. The    solution,
thus protected from the atmosphere, generally cools without
crystallizing, although          contains
                                    it        great excessa      salt, and         of
continues    entirely   liquid  for hours and even     days.    But upon
withdrawing the stopper,             puncturing the bladder, and ad

                                                        much heat. The
crystallization was attributed         the  pressure

                               was shown that the same phaenomenon

occurred, when air was admitted                solution already subject

culation  among      chemists,        generally
                                         it   is allowed that        satis              no

XXXVI.        On the Influence of the Air in determining the Cry
   stallization of Saline Solutions.  By Thomas GRAHAM, Esq.
     A.M. F.R.S. E.”
THE  phaenomenon referred to has long been known, and
  popularly exhibited in the case of Glauber's salt, without
any adequate explanation. A phial or flask is filled with a
boiling saturated solution of sulphate of soda or Glauber's
                                                                        by
               is its
salt, and      mouth immediately stopped                cork,        piecea             or  a
of bladder      tied  tightly  over                it,
                                        while still hot. The    solution,
thus protected from the atmosphere, generally cools without
crystallizing, although         contains it  great excess     a salt, and              of
continues   entirely   liquid  for hours and even     days.    But upon
withdrawing the stopper,            puncturing the bladder, and ad
                                              or
mitting air       the solution,
                    to                   immediately resolved into
                                                 it   is                                              a
spongy crystalline mass, with the evolution            much heat. The    of
crystallization was attributed        the  pressureto   the atmosphere       of
suddenly admitted, till was shown that the same phaenomenon
                                     it
occurred, when                air

the supposed agency           solid particles floating
                                of                          the air, and          in

was supposed that the contact                      of
                                        gaseous molecules themselves
might determine crystallization,           well    solid particles. But

although the phaenomenon has been the subject                 much spe             of
culation  among     chemists,        generally
                                            it  allowed that

216      Mr. Graham           on the Influence            of the Air in determining
the receiver long before the upper part had fallen to the tem
perature of the atmosphere.        In such cases, crystallization
beginning on the surface of the mercury, advanced slowly and
regularly through the solution. Above, there always remained
a portion of the solution too, weak to crystallize, being im
poverished by the dense formation of crystals below.           It was
also necessary to clean the lower and external part of the
receivers, when placed in the trough, from any adhering so
lution, as a communication of saline matter was sometimes
formed between the solution in the receiver and the atmo
sphere without. When these precautions were attended                                                     to,

 cal, formed of 5 joints, the basal one is very small, and thin;
 the second, third and fourth, each gradually larger and thicker:
 the fifth is nearly of the same height, but rather larger in dia
 meter, and the upper part is divided into 5 articulating sur
 faces, each marked with five radiating grooves, and finely cre
 nated on the margin. The pelvic plate small, wedge-shaped;
 the outer edge is pentangular, outer sides very short. The
 first and second set of costals are broad and nearly equal;
 the scapulars are as thick as the costals in the centre, and
 shelving on each side; the arms, two from each scapular, com
 pressed, each furnished with a double series of thin jointed
 filiform tentacula, the first joints of the arm are similar to the
 first costals, and the joints of the appendages are thin and
 compressed, similar to those in the arms of Comatula.

       HIS  work, we believe, is the first attempt that has been made
        to give a popular, and at the same time a comprehensive view
 of the new science of electro-magnetism. The notices of this
 science given in some of our elementary works on natural philoso
 phy and chemistry, are necessarily brief and partial; and Professor
 Cumming's translation of Demontferrand's Manuel d'Electricité Dy
 namique, is adapted chiefly to the use of those who are accustomed
to mathematical expressions. The writer of this “Popular Sketch"
 therefore, deserves commendation for having thus endeavoured to
 make this beautiful and interesting department of
                                                              knowl;  ranc *

branch of popular science. The prefatory outlines of electricity
and magnetism are drawn up in a satisfactory manner; and the
Sketch of Electro-Magnetism itself, gives a clear and connected de
tail of the principal observations and results of experiment, of which
the science at present consists, with an account of the various ex
periments themselves, and directions for their performance.                       At
the close of the work is given a description of a series of apparatus
for exhibiting the most striking phaenomena of electro-magnetism,
illustrated by three engravings in outline, by Turrell.
    There can be no doubt but that a second edition of this useful                                            lit
tle work will be called for; and when such is the case, we hope it will
be carefully revised prior to republication; for there are some inaccu
racies in construction and language, and also in the occasional allu
sions to the objects of chemistry and other sciences connected with
the subjects it explains, which, although they do not interfere with
the main utility of the work, are yet likely to mislead the student
in several minor, but still important points. We think, also, that it
would be preferable to incorporate the description of the electro
magnetical instruments with the body of the work, giving each in
                    in its
 strument in         proper place,          illustrating
                                                       as    certain part      a the                     of

ni's experiments, we do not happen to be acquainted, nor do we
know by whom they have been repeated in this country, except
Mrs. Somerville. But we think the precision with which that lady
has described her own researches, evinces,—even if it does not al
together preclude the idea that the needles &c. employed by her
were previously devoid of magnetism, that the morerefrangible rays
have a power of increasing, if not of imparting, magnetism; and that
white light does not possess, this power *. The fact of the increase
of magnetism in steel by exposure to certain varieties of coloured
light, is nearly as important with respect to the solar influence in
the production or regulation of terrestrial magnetism, as that of
 itsbeing induced                   by

     § 2. Range of the old-red-conglomerates through Caithness, and on
 the shores of the Murray Firth, &c.—These rocks are stated to appear
 in several unconnected masses on the north coast, between Cape
 Wrath and Port Skerry; and from the latter place they range into
 the interior, and rise into a mountain-chain (the highest parts reach
 ing the elevation of 3500 feet), which is continued to the granite of
 the Ord of Caithness. Their range parallel to the shores of the Murray
 Firth, is also given with many details. They are stated to be deve
 loped upon an enormous scale, and sometimes to form two distinct
 chains of broken mountains, resting unconformably upon the primary
strata. On the south-eastern shores of the Murray Firth they gra
 dually thin off; and finally disappear near Cullen bay, in Banfshire.
     § 3. On the general structure of Caithness.-After                an account of
the external appearance of the county, the authors describe in great
detail two coast-sections. The first, commencing with the old con
 glomerates of Port Skerry, which rest immediately upon the gra
 nite, exhibits the successive deposits in ascending order, and termi
nates with the newer red-sandstone on the shores of the Pentland
 Firth. The second section exhibited on the east coast, commences
 with the newer red-sandstone, and passing through                     the interme    all
 diate deposits, finally exposes the old conglomerate system                      part             in

character and relations. There are some difficulties arising out of the
peculiar modifications of the quartz-rock, which sometimes cannot be
distinguished, mineralogically, from that of the unconformable red
sandstone and conglomerate series.         The authors have, however, no

   $7. Conclusion.—The deposits previously described are here compared
with the corresponding formations of England.—1. The old-red-con
glomerates are, from their mineralogical character and position, iden
tified with the old-red-sandstone of English geologists.-2. The great
central deposit, containing the ichthyolites, does not appear to be
perfectly identical with any formation hitherto described.          It seems
in some measure to occupy the place of the coal-formation. Many
parts of it resemble grauwacke in mineralogical character; and from
 its enormous development,         can hardly it    compared with the cop  be

   The author describes and gives engravings of two species of these
fossils, with comparative sections of the recent Zamia and Cycas.
   1. In the larger species, which he calls Cycadeoidea megalophylla,
the bases of the leaves are two inches long, and have nearly the form
and size of those of the Zamia horrida. The trunk is short, and has
a deep central cavity, like the interior of a bird's nest,-in which a
 number of siliceous plates intersect one another, and form an irre
gular plexus, unlike any vegetable structure, but resembling the
coarse cellular appearance that is common in fossil wood.                   Nearer
the circumference there appear distinct organic radiations, disposed
in an insulated circle, like that in the trunk of a recent Zamia, but
differing, in that it is much broader, and placed nearer the circumfer
ence of the stem.        The larger plates of this circle are made up of
smaller   plates,  almost invisible to the naked eye.         Between this radi
ating circle and the outer case or leaf stalks, is a narrow band, com
posed of a minutely cellular, and nearly amorphous substance, but
analogous in structure and position to a much broader band that is
exterior to the radiating circle of the recent Zamia.
   2. In the second and smaller species (Cycadeoidea microphylla),
the bases of the leaves are about an inch in length, but small and
numerous, much like those of the Xanthorrhaea, or Gum Plant, of New
 South Wales. The trunk is more elongated, and the cavity at the
summit less deep, whilst the transverse section exhibits the same irre
gular net-work at the centre, but near the circumference has two
concentric circles composed of radiating plates; and exterior to each
of these a narrow ring devoid of plates, analogous to the two lami
nated circles within two cellular circles in a recent Cycas.
   In external and internal structure, these plants approach more
closely to the existing family of Cycadea than to any other; and
they supply, from the fossil world, a link to                    fill
                                                          the distant void which
separates the Cycadeae from the nearest existing family, the Coniferae.

   I procured a straight barometer-tube thirty-three inches in length,

Société Linnéenne de Normandie, M. Elie de Beaumont, describing
the environs of Martigues (Bouches du Rhône), mentions the oc
currence of nummulites, in rocks which he refers to the green-sand
formation, and states that the same strata contain, besides Hippu
rites, gryphites, terebratulae, &c. the Cucullea carinata, a fossil
whose analogue also is found in the ferruginous and green-sands of
Saint-Ils, near Castellane (Basses Alpes), the barns of Bellevue,
near Uchaux (Vaucluse), at Brousseval, near Vassy (Haute Marne),
and at the mountain of St. Catharine, near Rouen: they also con
tain a trochus, or Pleurotoma, and a Melania, or Phasianella, whose
analogues exist in the green-sand of England and Normandy.       Fol
lowing up these strata, he found at Gignac, gryphites, Cuculleae,
and Spatangus, known to belong to the green-sand; and near Pen
nes, on the road to Marseille, Milliolites, Spatangus, Cucullea, Tri
gonia, Pecten (Pecten quinque-costatus), equally known to belong
to the green-sand.
    Mr. De la Beche, in a late examination of the environs of Nice
and of the neighbouring coast, also found an abundance of nummu
lites in rocks which he refers to the green-sand; in this case they
are sometimes mixed in the same beds with gryphites, and consti
tute a subordinate portion of a formation in which are discovered
Ostrea carinata, turrilites, inoceramus, ammonites, nautili, terebra
tula, dolium, echinites, &c.
    This nummulitic green-sand, which cannot be referred to any
member of the tertiary series, the calcaire grossier for instance,
though this latter contains both nummulites and green grains, is a
rock very extensively distributed over the Alps; of the calcareous
portion of which it constitutes a considerable part, forming the
summits of many lofty mountains.

   In a late communication from Dr. Jaeger of Stutgard, to Mr. Mantell
of Lewes, the learned Professor states that he has discovered in the
Keuper-sandstein   the remains of two species, if not genera, of herbi
vorous  reptiles : the one having lateral teeth of a cylindrical, and
the other of a cubical form; the latter possessing lateral eminences
somewhat similar to the teeth of the Iguanodon. Dr. J. expresses                              his
intention    publishing figures and descriptions
            of                                        these interesting  of

              Meteorological Observations for                           July           1828.                 239
    At half-past 8 o'clock in the evening of the 3rd instant, the clouds as
sumed a black electrical aspect, and the lightning and thunder gradually
 came on as they united by means of crossing currents of wind from S.W.
by W. and S.E.      From that time till sunrise the following morning, when
the S.E. wind ceased to blow, the lightning was almost incessant, the
flashes frequently amounting to 12 or 15 in a minute, and the streams of
 electric fluid presented themselves in almost every geometrical form, ac
 companied with light showers of rain at intervals. So much lightning
from the passing clouds has not been observed here at any time since the
night of the 28th of July 1814, when it was nearly similar in appearance
for the same space of time. In the nights of the 7th and 8th we had vivid
sheet lightning, and lightning and thunder in the afternoon of the 14th,
which were produced by means of two winds crossing at right angles, and
the consequent inosculation of the clouds. From the 26th of June to the
 18th of July, the summer cockchafers were very numerous during the even
ing twilight: and for two or three years past a great number of the species
of the Melolontha solstitialis has also appeared in the evenings of June and
July, and are considerably smaller than those that generally come in May.
   The mean temperature of the external         this month   air
                                                              about one degree      is
and  a  half higher than the mean      July for the last twelve years.

observations this month, are one lunar and nine solar halos, one meteor,

    N the first volume of the Trigonometrical Survey, a method
     is given for finding the difference of longitude of two sta
 tions lying nearly in the same parallel of latitude, without as

which the base is equal to the arc 8,      the two sides to the                  .#

opposite to the base 3 is not sensibly different from w, the
difference of longitude, when the two latitudes are nearly

are equal.  In order to prove this, it is to be observed that

        even the correct expression of the difference of longi
tude, which we have here investigated, has a disadvantage
that makes it improper to be applied in practice; namely, the
result is always affected with the sum of the errors of the two
azimuths, which is likewise heightened by the divisor of the for
mula. In the instance of Beachy Head and Dunnose, we have
             x = 50°44'21",         m = 96° 55' 58"

I have ventured    advance                           call for
some notice from  me, which  shall study    make     brief
                                                        I                          to                                 as
possible.
        With regardthe attractionto  spheroids, the usual groundof
of the dispute    shifted.   The controversy has hitherto been
                            is
confined    the lawto  attraction that   of      nature; namely,                       in

                                                                                                                 when

246        Mr. Ivory in       reply to the Bulletin des Sciences,
when the exponent of the attractive force is —2; but on the
present occasion, the author brings forward the case when the
exponent of the attractive force is negative and greater than 2.
I have    no inclination to enter the lists on this new ground;
      I
and am persuaded that whoever will read attentively what is
written in the Bulletin, will not blame Laplace for departin
from the great generality aimed at in the third book of the
Mécanique Céleste, and in his later writings confining his theory
to the single case of an attraction inversely proportional to the
square of the distance.
   In p. 155, the author proceeds to animadvert on what he
calls my new principle of Hydrostatics, which he says has not
yet been refuted by any geometer “d'une manière vraiment sci
entifique.”   Great was my astonishment on perusing what the
author has written, to find that it does not affect in any re
spect what I have published concerning the equilibrium of a
planet in a fluid state. This part of the Bulletin is mostly
taken up with two demonstrations of the general equation of
the level surfaces, or the surfaces of equal pressure, in a fluid
mass in equilibrio.     Now I have nothing to object to these de
monstrations.      Applied  to the case of a homogeneous planet,
the meaning of the equation is this: The equilibrium of the
 planet requires that it be possible to divide the whole fluid
 mass into any number of strata separated by surfaces of equal
pressure, which, beginning at a point within the planet, extend
 to the outer surface, and are included one within another”.
 My solution of the problem is so far from being inconsistent
 with the general equation, or with the equivalent property of
 the level surfaces, that it is the only general method that has
 yet been found for rendering the existence of these surfaces
 demonstrative and certain +.
    In the usual theory, and particularly in the theory delivered
 in the Mécanique Céleste, it is affirmed that the perpendicu
 larity of gravity to the outer surface is      that       all
                                                         necessary    is                      to
 insure the existence         of
                          the interior level surfaces,  their gradual
 decreasing, and final concurrence          point.

XLIV.      On the Construction and Arrangement of the New Berlin
         Astronomical Ephemeris.    By Professor ENckE*.
       E      observe   the bodies of our solar system not from the
         central    point   of their motions, but from a point on the
 surface of the earth which has a double motion about this cen
 tral point. It would therefore be desirable to learn by the
 ephemerides the position of the heavenly bodies with respect
 to three points;–the centres of the sun, and the earth, and the
 place on the terrestrial surface for which the ephemerides are
 calculated.       The peculiar modifications however, applicable
 to every  body     in our system, are such as to leave no more than
 two  points    for each of them, for which the more accurate data
 are requisite.       For the planets which are more distant, and
 which are less      regularly   observed throughout the whole year,
the reduction from the centre of the earth to a definite point of
 its surface      is   so
                      simple, that nothing      required is           to
                                                              facilitate the
calculation; and for the sun and the moon, the relations                 the          to
centre       of
              the whole     system   disappear,  being   implied   with re
gard   to the former, and unnecessary for the latter, whose course
is  referred only          the earth.

hours of the forenoon of the civil day following the one cor
responding to the given hours of the astronomical day. All
longitudes, latitudes, right ascensions and declinations, refer
to the true or apparent equinox, and the true or apparent po
sition of the different planets, for which Mr. Bessel's determina
tions of the nutation and obliquity of the ecliptic have been
throughout applied. All data have been calculated from the
tables without neglecting any one correction, and have been
given exactly as resulting from the tables. A main object of
these ephemerides has been to save to the astronomer the
trouble of the tedious immediate calculations from the tables.
   The almanac contains, besides the chronological part and
the explanation of the signs, four principal sections; viz.
1. Ephemerides of the sun and moon.       2. Ephemerides of the
planets and their satellites. 3. Positions of the stars. 4. Phae
nomena and objects of observations.
      For      the sun and the moon every month has six pages, which
for the facility of reference have been separately marked with
Roman figures, I–VI. The first page contains the data neces
sary in solar observations.    Their epoch    therefore, the ap            is,

250      Prof. Encke on      the Construction   and Arrangement
kindness to communicate to me. The columns of the time of
transit and semidiameter of the sun are taken from Bessel's
tables. The calculations have been most rigorously executed,
 and the latitude has been duly taken into consideration in the
 right ascensions and declinations.            We may therefore hope,
 that, should even new tables of the sun be published before
 1830, the calculated positions will not greatly deviate from the
                           -
 true   OneS.
     The following four       pages  III–VI.    contain the positions of
 the moon.       The odd ones       III. and V. contain the longitude
 and   latitude,  and the      right  ascension and declination, of the
 moon for      every    mean noon and midnight at Berlin.           The
 present arrangement of these columns, in which the data for
 noon are not separated from those for midnight, as was hitherto
 usually done, appeared to be more convenient for taking the
 differences. On the opposite pages IV. and VI. are contained
 in the first place for the same epochs the horizontal equatorial
 parallax of the moon which supplies the place of the distance,
 and the diameter as seen from the centre of the earth.            Next
 follow the three columns which refer to the moment of the
 moon's culmination at Berlin; viz. the mean time of the moon's
  superior or inferior culmination, with the right ascension and
 declination corresponding to that moment, likewise referred
 to the centre of the earth. The upper and lower culminations
  are distinguished by the letters O and U.
     The two last columns give the times of the sun and moon's
  rising and setting, designated by the letters A and U. Below
  the odd pages    III.   and V. are placed the changes of the moon
  by mean time; below the even ones, the times of perigee and
                                                                        -
  apogee.
     The columns contained on the even pages are intended to
  facilitate the calculation of the apparent place affected by
  parallax; this will be treated of more in detail in another
  place. For this reason the apparently misplaced times of the
  sun's setting have been here inserted.           Those times have be
  sides for astronomers no other essential        importance,  except as
  far as the   visibility  of other    heavenly  bodies is dependent  on
  them. The moments of the sun and moon's setting are, as always
  where there is no particular mention, given in mean time.
     All the calculations for the moon have been deduced from
  Burckhardt's tables, from which the later ones of Damoiseau
  do not appear ever to deviate considerably. The accuracy of
  the tables of Burckhardt having been much confirmed of late
 years (in the opinion of a very competent judge), they have as
  yet been preferred to the others founded more on theory.

duration is added in order to reduce to the same form the mo
ments in which no eclipse takes place. The calculation has been
executed by M. Wolfers from Delambre's latest tables of the
satellites. However well founded M. Hansen's remark re
specting the incorrectness of the table of equation C for the
first satellite may be, yet it was preferred to retain this table
unchanged, partly because some other corrections in the pre
face likewise require amendments, partly because it is doubtful
whether Delambre has not compared the observations with
tables which contained the same small deviations.         At any
rate the difference will seldom amount to 1" for the first satel
lite, and for all the others it will always be within this limit.
The last page of this section contains the elements for the geo
centric form of the ring of Saturn, with the explanation of the
notation.   For the node and inclination, Bessel's paper in the
Astron. Jahrbuch for 1829, and for the dimensions of Saturn's
ring, the measurements of Struve in the Astron. Nachr. v.
                                   -
No. 97, have been used.
  The following section contains the places of the pole star,
8 Urs. Min. .# of Bessel's 45 stars, after the model of the
excellent auxiliary tables of Prof. Schumacher, with this only
difference, that the inferior culminations of the two polar stars
have not been given. The apparent places refer to the time
of culmination at Berlin, and the asterisk denotes that in that
place not ten, as everywhere else, but eleven sidereal days are
to be taken.
   The mean places on which these positions are founded are
enumerated together in the beginning. Their comparison with
the corresponding numbers in the auxiliary tables for 1827,
has shown that there is a small deviation in some of those stars
only, which Bessel has not introduced into his fundamental
catalogue, probably owing to a differently assumed proper
motion. They are          founded   all               on
                                      M. Bessel's latest determi
nations. The calculation has been performed with great care
 by  M. Dannemann.
    The daily aberrations for the polar stars are given below
for the culminations. Its values for the other stars are       be                    to

the stars occulted, taken from Baily's Catalogue, and so ex

We   thus obtain the specific gravity free from capillary action,

  can be made, so much the better; even using, perhaps, for the
  shorter columns the mere capillary elevations.
     In transparent liquors, we may make the one pair of co
  lumns A and W to be depressions under the surfaces of the
  liquids contained in glass cisterns; which may be effected by
, immersing the instrument with the hole previously stopped to
  confine the air. The depths of the depressions, when                                                         in
  creased respectively by r and y, should, like the former co
lumns, be inversely as the specific gravities of the liquids.
Consequently the required specific gravity becomes
                             W 4-r
                                        -       ºw   -   ºr
                                                              -       W –-    w
                             A+    y            a —      y            A     + a   *
which, as the numbers may be larger, is likely to be more ac
curate than the former. For in this case we obtain the spe
cific gravity by dividing the sum of the elevation and depres
sion of the water by the sum of those of the other fluid.
    There is still another case in which   the columns may                  all                                be
depressions, and which obviously makes the specific gravity

268   Mr. Graham's              Account   of the Formation of Alcoates.
employed in the arts and in medicine.  I believe, however, that,
by the excise laws as they at present exist, no rectifier of
spirits is permitted to concentrate alcohol beyond a certain
strength.   Licensed apothecaries alone are allowed to prepare
and sell absolute alcohol *.
   Alcohol may be concentrated in a close vessel with quick
lime, without exhausting; but the process goes on much more
slowly, at least at the temperature of the air. The experiment
was tried at a high temperature, by heating in a water-bath a
large bottle with a very wide mouth, containing a quantity of
alcohol at the bottom, and quicklime suspended over it in a
linen-bag. When the water-bath attained the temperature of
 150°, the bottle was corked, and the bath prevented from be
coming hotter. Much of the lime was very quickly converted
into hydrate, and the alcohol considerably concentrated.        But
the process is troublesome, and much inferior to that in which
the air-pump is employed.
    In the place of quicklime, sulphuric acid cannot be sub
stituted in the foregoing process as an absorbing liquid, from
a remarkable property which it possesses.          It is capable of
absorbing the vapour of absolute alcohol, in the same manner
 as it absorbs the vapour of water.    I was led to make this ob
 servation from a consideration of the phaenomena which at
 tend the mixing of alcohol and sulphuric acid. Nearly as
 much heat is evolved as if water had been added to the acid,
 even although absolute alcohol be employed.        Alcohol is also
 retained by the acid when heated to 500° or 600°, or at a tem
 perature when the alcohol would be decidedly in the state of
 vapour, which indicates the possibility of the same relation
 between sulphuric acid and alcohol vapour, that subsists be
 tween water and those gases which it detains in the liquid
 state, such as ammoniacal gas, when they would naturally as
 sume the elastic form.       But besides merely detaining such
 gases, water can condense and absorb them.         Sulphuric acid,
 besides  merely   detaining alcohol-vapour, might   therefore con
 dense and absorb           it.
     As alcohol, like water, occasions cold              by   its
                                                     evaporation,           it

servation of this fact to attempt the formation of analogous
compounds of alcohol and salts, to which           I now proceed.
   These solid compounds of salts and alcohol, which are de
finite and imperfectly crystallizable, may be denominated Alco
ates, a designation which is not unexceptionable, but ap
peared to me preferable to the name Vinates, as there is a
sulpho-vinous acid; or to any other name that might have been
imposed upon them.
   The alcoates which       I succeeded in forming are not nu
merous.     They were formed simply by dissolving the salts,
previously rendered anhydrous, in absolute alcohol, with the
assistance of heat.     On cooling, the alcoates were deposited
in the solid state. The crystallization was generally confused,
but in some cases crystalline forms appeared of a singular de
scription.   The crystals are transparent, decidedly soft, and
easily fusible by heat in their alcohol of crystallization, which
is generally considerable, amounting in one instance to nearly
three-fourths of the weight of the crystals.
                I.  Alcoate  of Chloride of Calcium.
   Pure muriate of lime was dried as much as possible on a
sand-bath of the temperature of 600° or 700°, and then slowly
heated to redness, and retained for some time at that tempera
ture. The dry chloride of calcium thus obtained dissolves in
absolute alcohol at 60° with great facility, and with the pro
duction of much heat, sometimes occasioning the boiling of the
solution. The quantity of chloride taken up increases with the
temperature; and at 173°, the boiling point of alcohol, 10 parts
alcohol dissolve 7 parts chloride of calcium. This solution is
thick and viscid, but perfectly transparent, provided the chlo
ride be pure. It boils at 195°, alcoholic as well as aqueous
solutions boiling at higher temperatures than the pure liquids.
The viscidity of the solution of chloride of calcium increases
greatly as it cools.   Bright crystalline stars soon appear on the
surface and on the sides of the vessel, which have been moist
ened by the solution. The solution, however strong, never
crystallizes instantaneously, but gradually, in thin transparent
and colourless plates, the forms of which cannot be made out,
except on the surface of the solution and sides of the vessel.-
To obtain the alcoate in a state of absolute purity, it is neces
sary to form a solution so weak, that, while hot, it will pass
through thin filtering paper; and afterwards to concentrate
the filtered solution by heat. A solution of one part chloride
of calcium in five parts alcohol passes through the filter. It
is remarkable that the most distinct crystalline forms are not
                        -

        Mr. Graham's     Account        of the Formation of Alcoates.                  271
obtained from the slow crystallization of comparatively weak
solutions; but in solutions which have been fully saturated, or
nearly so, at the boiling temperature.    In the former case, the
crystalline plates are large, but confused, and nothing but an
gles can be made out; while in the latter, the forms, under
which the plates appear on the surface of the solution, and to
the greater advantage, on the sides of the vessel, are generally
distinct. These plates are always small, often beautiful, and
delicately striated; and they always present the form of isos
celes triangles. In general, four of these triangular figures are
grouped with their apices together; and if similar, they form
a square.     But, as more frequently happens, the opposite pairs
of  triangles  only are similar; and the figure presented is a
rectangular parallelogram, divided by two diagonal lines into
four triangles. The resolution of the rectangle into triangular
figures is rendered perceptible by the discontinuance of the
striae, and the formation of clear diagonal lines, which have
a beautiful effect. These crystals cannot be removed from
the phial in which they are formed without injury, from their
               i.
softness. Exposed to the air, they speedily deliquesce from the
absorption of hygrometric moisture. The heat of the hand is
sufficient to       them.   The whole of the alcohol is expelled
by a heat amounting to 250°, and pure chloride of calcium
remains, which emits nothing else upon being heated to red
IneSS.
     A quantity of this
                     alcoate was dried, first by strong pressure
between many folds of linen, and then by pressure between
folds of blotting paper. The alcoate, carefully dried in this
way, had a white appearance much resembling bleached wax,
and was soft, but without tenacity.
   Ten grains were heated in a glass capsule,       the whole             till              of

    In  the solution of chloride of calcium, no crystallization
takes   place  at the temperature of 50°, when the alcohol ex
ceeds the    proportion   of 10 parts to 4 parts of the dry salt.
But the solution crystallizes readily when further concen
trated.    A solution saturated at 170°, and which consisted of
10 parts alcohol and 7 parts chloride of calcium, or nearly
the atomic proportions of the alcoate, crystallized slowly upon
cooling, forming crystals upon the surface of the liquid and
sides of the phial, of great regularity and beauty.        The whole
crystallized during a cold night, leaving no mother-liquor
                                                      -
whatever.
    The injurious effect of the presence of water, in the forma
tion of this alcoate, was evident in alcohol of the specific gra
vity 0-798, in which the contaminating water did not amount
to 1 per cent. A solution of chloride of calcium in alcohol of
this strength did not crystallize readily, and the crystals even
tually deposited were small and ill-formed.          Chloride of cal

frosts are less severe upon hills than upon the neighbouring
plains: and it is consistent with my own observations, that the
leaves of the vine, the walnut-tree, and the succulent shoots of
Dahlias and potatoes, are often destroyed by frosts in the shel
tered valleys, on nights when they are perfectly untouched upon
the surrounding eminences.”      The diminution of temperature
which is  produced   upon the surface of radiating bodies during
the night is communicated by slow degrees to the surrounding
 atmosphere; and if the process goes on for any considerable
period, moisture and probably other matters are not only de
posited upon them, but are precipitated in the air itself, af
 fecting more or less the feelings of every one within     range,                                its

 to acquire any colour: the alcoholic solutions deposited a yel
 low-coloured substance upon cooling. The whole of the so
 lutions were mixed together and diluted by about twice their
 amount of water; an immediate yellow-coloured precipitate
 fell down: on the application of heat the precipitate melted,
 and floated upon the surface of the water; it was ascertained
that this substance became solid at 110° Fahrenheit: it was
thus removed, and after being dried between the folds of                          fil

-      At the pass of Kattra, near the summit of the second range of hills,
    a friable variegated sandstone appears, in which thin laminae of sand
    stone alternate with red clay, resembling the red marle of England,
    both reposing on slaty marle coloured by chlorite, which rests, appa
    rently, on massive horizontal strata, resembling clay-slate or grau
    wacke.                                                           -
       At the bottom of the cataract of Billohi, 398 feet in height, argilla
    ceous sandstone was found, tinged deeply by red oxide of iron, and
    containing disseminated mica, on which reposed a siliceous sand
    stone   of a   more compact texture.
        Greenish white arenaceous sandstone not quite so compact was
    found at the cataract of Bauti, 420 feet below the summit, varying
    in colour as it ascended : and twenty-four miles further westward, at
    the cataract of Kenti, and at a depth of 272 feet, as well as at the ca
    taracts of Chachye and of the Tonse river, sandstone of the same
    general character was observed rising to the surface.
        The sandstone of Simmereah is sometimes ferruginous, at others
    slaty, and interspersed with mica; in the neighbourhood of Hathee it
    is succeeded by what the author considers as the equivalent of the
    lias-limestone.             º
        At  Birsingpur,   in the bed of a small river, is a stratum of red marle
    or sandstone, containing laminae of calc-spar; at Sohawel the red
     marle underlies the limestone above mentioned; and at Nagound in
    the bed of the Omeron river, the lower and central beds of limestone
     are exposed to view, containing fragments of fossil wood, stems of
     ferns,—and, as the author states, the gryphite which is characteristic
     of this formation in Europe.
        This limestone appears also at Hatta and Narsinghagarh reposing
     on red marle, and in the latter situation is tinged green by chlorite.
     At Patteriya, where the limestone comes into contact with trap, the
     strata assume in some places the form of chert.
         The aspect of this limestone is dull and earthy;          stratification ho

     rizontal    or nearly so, and always conformable             the red marle

     which  it  reposes.

         Between the pass     of  Patteriya and Saugor, the author met with
      other rock than trap, generally       in

   The thigh-bone, measured in length, gave only one foot six inches,
but is very thick. The bones of the leg are of similar dimensions,
                                                                     -
but perhaps a little more slender.
   It had been conjectured that the animal to which these remains be
longed, was amphibious, and perhaps of the crocodile family; and
the conjecture appeared to Dr. Logan to be justified by the great
length and flatness of the head (judging from the single specimen of
:
the cranial bone), and the shortness of the limbs. It was also sup
posed that the animal, when alive, must have measured five and twenty
      around the body, and about one hundred and thirty feet in
 ength.
   #. Extract was read of a letter from his Grace the Duke of Buck
ingham, to Professor Buckland, V.P.G.S. dated at Naples, 3rd April,
1828, giving an account of certain phaenomena, which attended the
late eruption of Vesuvius. The author states that the Solfaterra was
in no degree affected by the eruption.
   A Letter was read from Charles Stokes, Esq.F.G.S. F.R.S. to W. J.
Broderip, Esq. Sec. G.S. explanatory of three drawings of Echini, re
presenting,    1. A specimen of Galeorites albo-galerus (Lam.), from
the chalk, in which the plates of the mouth, consisting of five pairs, are
preserved in situ;—2. A Cidaris, also from the chalk, in which por
tions of the plates of the mouth and the teeth are visible : they are
displaced, but exhibit a system quite analogous to that of the recent
cidaris;–and, 3. A Cidaris from Stonesfield, in which the anal plates
are in the best preservation.
   At the close of this Meeting, which terminated the Session, the
Society adjourned till Friday Evening, the 7th of November; when
they will meet at their Apartments in Somerset House.

to stars of a certain magnitude or colour; nor are they dependent
upon any particular age of the moon.       Most of them have furnished
but solitary instances of peculiarity; viz. Spica Virginis, y Libra,
 132 Tauri, a Cancri, A. Aquarii, 249 Aquarii, 187 Sagittarii, y Tauri,
p Leonis, p Geminorum, 3 Cancri, and 3 Piscium. One, Regulus, af
fords three, whilst to Aldebaran we are indebted for no less than
twenty instances of anomaly.
   On reference to the list, the anomaly alluded to, it will be seen,
stands not upon the testimony of a single individual, but is supported
frequently by the evidence of a second, and sometimes even of a third
person ; occasionally they are co-observers at the same station; at
other times they are at different parts of the same city; whilst in some
instances, they are separated by a very considerable distance.        On
the other hand, the conflicting testimonies, where we should least ex
pect to find them, are perplexing; a circumstance which together
with the vague manner in which the observations are frequently re
corded, and the habit, which in many instances unfortunately pre
vailed, namely, of observing the immersion and emersion of the same
star, on the same occasion, with different telescopes, and the almost
constant omission to register, if the moon's dark limb, was or was not
yisible, enable us, Mr. South says, to do little more than to state,
with some appearance of probability, what are not the causes of the
phaenomena.
  The hypotheses advanced as explanatory of the phaenomena                      in ques
tion, are then stated: viz. A lively imagination on the part of the ob
server:-A spurious disc given to the moon's image by the instrument
of observation —A lunar atmosphere —Irradiation —And lastly,
different refrangibilities to which the rays from the moon and star
are liable, arising from their differences of colour.
    As unfavourable to the first hypothesis, which would refer the
phaenomenon to a lively imagination on the part of the observer,
Mr. South advances the fact, that “more than sixty instances of ano
maly stand attested by such men as Messier, Troughton, Bouvard,
Arago and Mathieu ; and that it is rather too much to suppose, that
 all
 of      them are liable   to the imputation, which such              an
                                                                    hypothesis

              CHLORINE           IN BLACK OxIDE OF MANGANESE.
  N a former number of the Phil. Mag. and Annals I have noticed
1  a paper published by Mr. MacMullen in the Institution Journal,
the object of which was to prove that the native black oxide of man
ganese contains chloric acid.    In my remarks I supposed I had
proved that the source of chlorine was chloride of lime, which I
found in      all

statements; the correctness of the first two I admit; the third and
fourth are as destitute of accuracy as the fifth, which is as follows:
—“I threw down a pure carbonate from a pure muriate of manga
nese, obtained by Faraday's process. This was dried and partially
decomposed by heating in an oven; with diluted sulphuric acid it
gave also the smell of chlorine.”
    “From these experiments,” continues Mr. Johnston, “we may
legitimately conclude, first, that Mr. MacMullen was correct as to
the fact of the emission of chlorine from the native oxide, which
Mr. Phillips has called in question, for it is given                 artificial           off     by
oxides, into which             no

with water, especially if hot; chromic acid is removed, and green
oxide of chrome remains.    Chromate of chromium is decomposed
in the same manner.
   If chromate of ammonia be heated gradually to the point of de
composition, the salt is decomposed suddenly, pure deutoxide re
mains, which dissolves readily in concentrated acid. This oxide
has been mistaken for a combination of protoxide and chromic acid.
If at the moment of decomposition the temperature be suddenly
raised, a luminous appearance is produced. Chromic acid dissolves
the hydrate or the carbonate of chrome readily, and a dark brown
solution is produced, which when evaporated leaves a brittle resi
nous-looking mass, which is deliquescent and soluble in alcohol.

                            PREPARATION OF TITANIC ACID.
    The following is the method recommended by M. H. Rose:–
 Pulverize and wash titaniferous iron, expose it in a porcelain tube
to the action of dry sulphuretted hydrogen gas, at a very high tem
perature. The oxide of iron is reduced and converted into sul
phuret, whilst the titanic acid suffers no change: the product when
cold is to be digested in concentrated muriatic acid; much sulphu
retted hydrogen is given out, and sulphur is deposited; this mixing
with the titanic acid, which the heat has rendered insoluble in the
muriatic acid, the acid becomes grey. The acid is to be washed,
dried and ignited, to expel the sulphur.
      If
       the operation were to terminate here, the titanic acid would
still contain some iron, and become red by calcination. The reason
of this         is,
              that the sulphuret       iron formed being
                                                of               considerable
                                                                          in
quantity, agglutimates             by
                             heat with the titanic acid, and prevents the
centre      the mass from being perfectly attacked
            of                                                      by

hydrogen.       On this account the operation must not             continued   be
until water ceases            disengaged, which would render
                              to   be                                    very       it

is the newer process less complicated and expensive, but I have
never yet found tartaric acid free from lime, and this base remains
combined with the titanic acid. If during the treatment of the tita
niferous iron by the sulphuretted hydrogen the heat is not very
strong, the titanic acid obtained will render the washings milky, and
will partly pass through the filter; but this will not occur if the
                                                                 -

   Hydrogen gas does not succeed so well as sulphuretted hydrogen:
the oxide is indeed reduced, but the titanic acid obtained by this
process is always ferruginous. Muriatic acid does not give a better

result.
   The time occupied in the operation now described may be short
ened by fusing the titaniferous iron with sulphur in an earthen cru
cible.   The mass is to be treated with concentrated muriatic acid,
which removes much of the iron; but some remains with the titanic
acid, and nearly as much as in rutile; by treating this impure acid
with sulphuretted hydrogen as above described, it is obtained pure
at one operation.—Annales de Chimie, xxxviii. 133.
    ARTIFICIAL FORMATION OF UREA.        BY M. F. WOHLER.
  M. Wohler has already shown, that when cyanogen is made to
act upon solution of ammonia, there are obtained, besides several
 other products, oxalic acid, and a white crystalline substance, which
 occurs also whenever the attempt is made to combine cyanic acid
 with ammonia by double decomposition. On prosecuting his in
 quiries, M.W. found that by the combination of cyanic acid with
 ammonia, urea was formed; this is a remarkable fact, as offering the
 artificial formation of organic matter, and even animal matter, by
 means of inorganic principles.
    The white crystalline substance is most readily obtained by de
 composing cyanate of silver by a solution of muriate of ammonia,
 or cyanate of lead by liquid ammonia; it is colourless, transparent,
 and crystallizes in the form of small rectangular quadrilateral prisms
without any distinguishable pyramids.          Neither potash nor lime
evolves any trace of ammonia from this substance. Acids do not, as
with the cyanates, disengage either carbonic or cyanic acid: it does
 not, like the cyanates, precipitate the salts of lead and silver; it is
 therefore evident that it contains neither ammonia nor cyanic acid.
 Most acids have no marked action on this substance, but the nitric
acid when added to a concentrated solution gives a precipitate in
the form of brilliant scales.    These crystals are extremely acid, and
were at first supposed to be a peculiar acid, but when decomposed
by bases, nitrates of those bases were obtained; and by alcohol,
the white crystalline matter was obtained unchanged in        its  proper
ties: these    properties, when  compared   with those  of   pure urea ob
tained from urine, indicated that this substance,     or   cyanate  of  am
              absolutely identical with urea;
                                                                    º
monia,                                               conclusion which
                                                                          of is

Proust, Prout, and others. M. Wohler. states some facts with re
spect to   urea (and also with regardto this artificial substance,)
                                                                          le

he says have not been previously noticed. When natural or artifi
cial urea is decomposed by heat, there is produced, besides a large
quantity of carbonate of ammonia, towards the end of the operation
a smell of cyanic acid resembling that of acetic acid, precisely as
occurs during the distillation of cyanate of mercury or uric acid,
and especially urate of mercury. By the distillation of urea, a
white substance is also obtained, the properties of which
                                                        -

examination.
  If  cyanate of ammonia be similar to urea, then the composition
of the former as obtained by calculation should resemble that of
the latter; assuming one atom of water in cyanate of ammonia, as
in     all
        ammoniacal salts which contain any, and adopting Prout's
analysis       of

 earth made in the ecliptic during each revolution of the spot; hence
 the real time of each respective revolution, and also the real time of

These formulas show clearly the relation that subsists be
tween the temperature and the latent heat, and     what                                                in               man
ner both these quantities are derived from the volume.                                                                     Both
the expressions are significant, and represent what actually
takes place    nature, in  long     the postulateso    which they     as                               on

absurd to contend                   #.
                             the numerical results obtained in
some extreme   cases, that the formulas are consonant to fact
in no case whatever;                I
                         say, the formulas, for the argument ap
plies equally to both. Suppose that the original volume is
reduced to a very small space, or to a point; then, according
to the centigrade scale,
                          r = —266°7,                       i =   — 100°.
Now these numbers are either both true, or neither of them
is so; and the latter may be affirmed, since it is very impro
bable, that a law, which has been verified only for a small part
of the thermometrical scale, will continue to hold good without
limit; it is even certain that it will not. Next let us suppose
that the volume of air has decreased to half      original quan                  its
tity; then,                 133°,  =                              =
                                        to —50°.

There     good reason
           is              think that these numbers are not far
from the  truth;  but   would      rash
                                   it                  be
                                            affirm that they agree    to
exactly with the phaenomenon; for there              proof,     least       is   no              at
I am not aware       any,     of

Dr.    Ferguson,     who observes in his History of the Marsh
Poison, “that the rarifying heat of the sun dispels the miasms
which create fevers and violent diseases, and that it is only
during the cooler temperature of the night, that they acquire
body, concentration, and power.”
    Now surely any miasmatous effluvia liberated from ex
posed vegeto-animal or other matters by the rays of the sun,
must exist in the atmosphere as much if not more during the
day-season than in the night; for it is more than probable that
nothing is given up by the ground after sun-set. How is it then,
 we may ask, that the great potency of malaria at night, and
 itscomparative harmlessness during the day,have                 constantly        so
forced themselves upon our notice?                    not because the air

                                need scarcely say that their influence
 in  generating   fever is as notorious as any of the best established
 facts on this    subject;    and the progress of the sun upwards
 being a remedy for the morning mists, and the day altogether
 for those of the night, seems to confirm the opinion, that a
 watery and moist atmosphere is the active conductor or repo
 sitory of malaria; and that when the former is dissipated, the
 latter is checked in                     its
                              progress; when the one             entirely                        is                  di

from malaria ensue upon the temperature                       place reaching  of  a

the foregoing observations, if they shall be found correct, to
wards the attainment of that desirable end, the protection of
mankind against the injurious impregnations of the air.
    As regards the prevention of the rise of miasms from the
ground, I fear we have too little controul over the powerful
agency of the rays of the sun to adopt successfully any plan
with reference to this head. The solar influence is too great and
too general to enable us to obstruct the emanation of various
 effluvia from the soil: nevertheless, much may be done by re
moving as far as possible from the surface of the ground any
thing likely to afford them; and although our endeavours on
this point must be very inefficient, they may be more success
ful and beneficial if directed to obviate those conditions which,
as we have seen, have such a considerable effect in rendering
active the noxious properties of malaria; viz. 1st, by prevent
ing the dissipation of caloric through a still atmosphere;
 and, 2ndly, by promoting those aérial currents which tend so
much to dilute and carry off any deposition which may ensue
 from that process.
    In order to accomplish the former of these indications, we
 must use every means in our power to diminish the radiation
 of heat from the ground after sun-set, or to remove as far as
 possible from the circle of           operation, its   attaining during   by
 the night-season some moderate elevation, interspersed here
 and there with lofty trees, and hedges          inclosures, and placed
                                                                     or

though the principle upon which they act has not been
perly understood, and consequently they have never been
employed to the best advantage for this purpose. Dr. Mac
 culloch relates a very important case, where a superintendant
 engaged in directing the cutting of wood in Africa, erected
 thirty earthen furnaces on the spot where his men were em
 ployed, lighting them every day. Before this, he had always
  from forty to                of his workmen sick; when in a
  short time they were reduced to twelve, then to four, and
 finally to one. Napoleon adopted the same expedient very
 largely, and with success, when his armies were occupied in
 the very worst district of Italy”.    Knowing the principle of
                                                                  331
                                                                  pro
their   operation,    I should recommend them to be lighted at
sun-set, and to be allowed to burn until sun-rise, having a re
gard to their position as pointed out in the foregoing remarks.
 Where large numbers of human beings are congregated to
gether, as in armies, camps, &c., and where their situation at
night is too often determined by other circumstances than sa
lubrity, the value of these observations, with the knowledge of
the principles which should direct their application, cannot but
be very apparent.
    It will be easily seen, from what has already been said, that
fires as defences against malaria will be much more necessary
during the nocturnal period than at any other; and even at
this season, when the wind is blowing strongly and the night is
overcast, they will not be so much required as when the air is
clear and still.—It is not my intention to speak here of those
various extraneous circumstances which render the body more
 susceptible of injurious influences at night than during the
day, -such as bodily and mental exhaustion, sleep and dimi
nished temperature; nevertheless they are well worthy of our
serious regard, as cooperating powerfully with noxious mias
mata in producing a state of disease.

               III. Alcoate of the Nitrate of Lime.
   Nitrate of lime may be obtained anhydrous with much
greater facility than nitrate of magnesia, as, after being dried
on the sand-bath, it may be heated in a glass-capsule by the
spirit-lamp without decomposition, although it partially fuses.
Boiling alcohol saturated with this salt formed a solution,
which became very viscid on cooling, and remained without
crystallizing for a whole day.      But during a frosty night it
was resolved into an  amorphous     solid, slightly moist, but with
out   any  appearance  of  crystallization.    This substance was
carefully dried in the usual way.
   14.8 grains were reduced by heat to 8:8 grains.       This gives
6 grains alcohol to 8.8 grains nitrate of lime.        The atomic
weight of anhydrous nitrate of lime is 10:25.        Now,
                     8°8 : 6 : : 10°25 : 6'98.
   In another case, 15-6 grains were reduced to 9-2, which
gives 6-4 alcohol to 9:2 nitrate of lime.   But,
                    9°2: 6'4 : : 10:25: 7°13.
This approaches 7-1875, or two and a half equivalent propor
tions of alcohol.    The composition of the alcoate of nitrate of
lime would be     represented on this view, by
           Two atoms nitrate of lime............ 20:5
            Five atoms alcohol....................              14-375

   In another strong alcoholic solution of nitrate of lime, a few
irregular crystals were deposited; but the quantity was not
sufficient to admit of examination, although they proved that
this alcoate is capable of crystallizing.
            IV.   Alcoate        of Protochloride of Manganese.
   The protochloride of manganese, dried in a glass-tube, at a
red heat, was light, friable, and of a reddish colour. Alcohol
dissolved a very large quantity of              it.
                                         When the solution was
made   at   high temperature, the alcoate crystallized readily
            a

               V. Alcoate of Chloride of Žinc.
  Alcohol dissolves chloride of zinc with great facility, and
the solution when filtered is of a light amber colour. This
solution may be concentrated to a very great extent without
injury, and becomes so viscid when cold, that it may be                                 in
verted without flowing perceptibly.       It is not till so concen
trated that it begins to deposit crystals, which are small and
independent, but apparently of no regular shape.            A viscid
solution, in which crystals formed, was found to be composed
of 20 parts chloride of zinc, and 7 parts alcohol. The small
proportion of alcohol is astonishing; yet no more alcohol was
given out when the chloride was heated nearly to redness, and
began to volatilize; nor did a portion of the chloride thus
heated take - fire when exposed directly to the flame of a
 candle.
   The crystalline matter was dried with difficulty by pressure
in blotting paper. When dry, it possessed the usual waxy
softness of the alcoates, and was of a yellowish colour. Heated,
it entered into a state of semifusion, and gave off         alcohol.      its
Nine grains alcoate were reduced                    by

            of to                                               7-65

table acids soluble in alcohol.
   It is probable that many more alcoates of salts may be
formed, particularly of the metallic chlorides.  The great ob
stacle to their formation is the difficulty, and frequently the
impossibility, of rendering the salts perfectly anhydrous, be
fore their solution in alcohol is attempted.

                                          º
of   the same class as the hydrates and alcoates. But there is
an oxide, classed by Dr. Thomson in his System of Chemistry,
with water and other neutral and unsalifiable oxides, the ha
bitudes of which with certain salts are exceedingly remarkable,
and have been looked upon as anomalous, but on which the
established properties of                 and alcoates appear to me
to throw some    light.     I refer to the deutoxide of azote or mi
trous gas., 100 volumes pure water are capable of absorbing
only 5 volumes of this gas, according to the experiments of
Dr. Henry. But Dr. Priestley and Sir H. Davy ascertained
that certain metallic salts, particularly the protosalts of iron,
are capable of absorbing this gas in large quantities; and again
emit the greater part of it unaltered, on being heated.             That
the absorption of deutoxide of azote by these salts, is not de
pendent upon the oxygen of their bases, or the water which
they contain,       have proved in two ways, in the case of pro

          Sir,
       substance of the following communication was in
THE
  serted in the Times newspaper of the 4th of October; but
as   it   seems desirable that phaenomena        of this kind should be
permanently recorded,                I
                                shall feel obliged by your giving it a
place in the Philosophical Magazine.
   On the 29th of September last, Professor Moll and myself,
being at Chesfield Lodge near Stevenage, observed at 8° 35"
mean time, a zone or luminous belt extending itself in the
heavens from the eastern to the western horizon.                 The light
of the zone was white, uniform or nearly so, and surpassing
much in intensity that of the milky-way.              Its breadth (nearly
equal throughout) was about three-fourths of the distance
from 8 to y Aquilae, or 3° 45'. The edges of the belt appeared
perfectly well defined and equally luminous with the middle,
and       its
           transparency was such that the stars were distinctly
seen   through       it.
   The observations made             the moment were, that the belt
                                             at
covered the     Pleiades,    and  appeared           equally distant from
                                                                 to   be

two-fifths of the interval between these stars.             Professor Moll
observed that         its
                       edges   were  upon       and    Ophiuchi.

down, near the western horizon, this luminou Szone suffered
a   very remarkable inflexion towards the north, and soon

great circle, meeting the horizon about the E.N.E. and W.
 by   S.points.     The altitude        the centreof     the most elevated of
 part appears        tohave been about 72°,             that     must have so          it

    At        8h
            42" mean time, the belt began                 fade slowly from  to
 the east towards the       west,  and             22" no trace
                                                        at       9"     was                 of   it
 perceptible.           light during the whole time appeared per
                       Its
 fectly steady and without any coruscations.
    There was much wind from the S.E. The stars were un
 usually bright. The height            the barometer was 29:12 inches,

LIX. A        Letter to William Morgan, Esq. F.R.S. on the Ex
      perience of the Equitable Society. By A CoRRESPONDENT.
           Dear Sir,
H AVING       unfortunately failed, on some former occasions, of
      fully comprehending the meaning of your expressions, I
earnestly intreat your attention to a few remarks on your late
statement of the Experience of the Equitable Society, in order
that you may correct, if possible, the exaggerated conclu
sions which appear to me to be fairly deducible from the num
bers that you have published; for      have no doubt that you   I
will unite with me in sincerely deprecating the dangerous con
sequences, that would result from the hasty adoption of these
conclusions in the practice of life assurance, although they
may still be very useful as cautions deserving the attention of
the granters of annuities.
   Your table, lately published, stands thus:
                                                                                That        is,

340              A    Letter to              William Morgan, Esq. F.R.S.,
86 only. The mean of the numbers here computed is 187:
and nearly in the proportion of 86 or 87 to 137 does the ex
pectation of life, as exhibited by this table, exceed the estimate
of the Northampton table: a result not materially differing
from the proportion of 2 to 3, which you assign.
   2. But a more remarkable peculiarity of the decrements, or
rather the decremental quotients, derived from your table, is
the regularity which is observable in their progress after the
period of middle life; each of the numbers, which express
them, being precisely or very nearly the half of the preceding
                                     -                     -            -                               l
number.              Thus, disregarding fractions, we have                                              # = 67             for
69,
         º=       34,   #           =        17, and
                                                                #. = 8 for 85, which is equiva
lent to      7   at   87%.
   3. We may therefore continue this series with perfect con
fidence, until the whole number of lives is exhausted, taking
the annual decrement at 95,4, at 105,4, and at 115,1, which
may be supposed to be a sufficient age for the termination                                                                  of
our computations.

for this expression gives us, from 25 to 85, (512, 256,) 128,
64, 82, 16,           8; and if we wish to modify the formula, we                                                  may
make it more generally                                ==         = a”, and y =              b       – ca. ;      so that
the computation might be adapted to the earlier ages, if we
had sufficient documents for the purpose.
    5. We might at once form a table of mortality from the
quotients thus computed, proceeding downwards from a single
life at the age of 115; but it will be much more convenient, and
perhaps equally accurate, to employ the method of fluxions.

    7.  It  is obvious that, according to this formula, the value
of z can never       become wholly extinct, and that a population
may be imagined great enough to have an individual living at
any given age: but notwithstanding Mr. Gompertz's ingenious
speculations on patriarchal longevity, it can scarcely be ad
mitted that the analogy is sufficiently strong to justify such
a conclusion respecting more modern times; to say nothin
of the population of the whole world as a limit which woul
require to be considered.
    8. The results of the formula are exhibited in the following
table, in which they are compared with Mr. Babbage's table
of the Equitable Experience, with the Carlisle table, and with
the table published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1826.

    9.  I  am at a loss to understand how you will be able to
reconcile the numbers of the first column of this table, with
the opinion that “the experience of the Equitable Office con
firms the accuracy of the Northampton table,” which is re
presented by the fourth column, on the supposition that a
given number of individuals about 55 is to be compared. From

LXI.      Notice of the Geological Features of a Route from Madras
     to Bellary, in April and May 1822.      By Capt. W. CULLEN,
     of the East India Company's Artillery service”.
 I    BEG to submit to the Society an attempt to describe the
     geological features of a route which I lately passed over
from Madras to Bellary.        It accompanies a small collection
of   specimens   of the prevalent rocks, and a barometrical sec
                                           I
tion, which combined will, hope, assist in affording some idea
of the nature of the tracts in question.
    The high road to Bellary was followed as far as Cuddapah;
but from thence going north, by Chinnoor Nundialpett Poon
namila to Iddamacul, my route, from the last-mentioned vil
lage, lay nearly west by Giddeloor, over the Nulla Mulla range
of hills by the Nundi Kunnuwi Ghautt, by Banaganapilly,
Piaplee, and Gootty, to Bellary.       A great proportion of this
route   must,  in favourable weather,   be as beautiful in point of
scenery, as it is rich in geological interest; but at the period
of my passing (the latter end of April and beginning of May),
the excessive heat had checked                      all
                                      vegetation, and afforded but
little inducement for excursions       quest     mineralogical spe

cimens.
   Referring the route       Arrowsmith's large map, which

sufficiently correct for the present purpose,    will     observed   it       be
to offer    obvious distribution into five portions, each
                 an                                          them                       of

which places are on the same level, about 900 feet above the
sea... I was much disappointed in the height of the Nulla
Mulla range, which, at the point where I crossed, did not at
tain an elevation of 1800 feet above the sea, and of little more,
therefore, than 800 feet above the plains on either side.
    The route across the plain, between the Nulla Mulla range
and the table land at Banaganapilly, is nearly level, and about
800 feet above the sea; but the general declination of this
plain appears to be from the Kistnah to the Pennar.
    From Banaganapilly to Jeldroogum the ascent along the
valley is pretty considerable, being 400 feet in about twenty
Iniles, or 20 feet per mile.
    The table land, commencing two or three miles west of                           Jel
droogum, and extending to Piaplee, a distance of eight or ten
miles, is between 1700 and 1800 feet above the sea *; and
Colonel Lanabton has already stated that to be the mean height
of the country between Gootty and Bellary+.
    Although granitic have been mentioned as the prevailing
rocks in the first division, none of them were seen in situ till
about the thirty-seventh mile, in the bed of the river at the
village of Nellatoor.        The whole of the previous flat being a
loose   sandy   soil,  entirely  free from rocky masses, and even al
most so of    fragments,     with the exception of some stony swells

ever, that            all

    The blocks forming these latter have rolled appearance,a

of Naggery, and which continuing near to the left of the road
as far as Woramallipett, then stretch off to the west, till they
are lost in the prolongation of the Tripetty range. The pe
culiar features of the granite are very marked and conspicuous
in the whole of this western mass of hills, exhibiting itself on
their slope, in those great bare masses of rock, which are so
familiar to most people in this country, and on their summits
in enormous detached rugged piles and fragments. But what
contributes most powerfully to the interest of this part of the
route are these singular courses or dykes of trap rocks, which
 may be observed crossing the country, without experiencing
 the smallest deviation or interruption in their course from the
granitic barriers, which seem to oppose themselves on                hands            all
to   their progress.

    The western approach to    these hills, for one mile and a
half or two miles from their bases, was thickly strewed with
nodules of several varieties of sandstone, the most common of
which were of rather a close fine grain, sometimes so much so
as hardly to be distinguished from quartz or hornstone. The
finer-grained varieties were of different shades of red or brown,
but generally of a light colour. There was also great abun
dance of a very coarse variety, composed of rounded pebbles,
and fragments of quartz of              sizes,                   all

The granites of this division were generally of a light colour,
shadesof white and of a coarse texture; the darker varieties,
however, inclining to brown or red, being, I think, the finer
grained.
    The quartz and felspar were by far the most abundant consti
tuents, and gave the colour to the rock; the hornblende, which
was of a dark green, being very irregularly and sparingly dis
tributed.     There seemed to be little or no mica.
    The texture of the trap was very uniform, and of a fine
grain, composed distinctly of hornblende, and greenish white
felspar.
    The porphyritic variety, alluded to near Curcumbaddy,
contained irregular crystals of felspar, of from one-tenth to
five-tenths of an inch in diameter, of the same colour as the
 felspar of the basis.
    The transition of clay-slate is very sudden and complete.
 The low hills immediately at the back of Curcumbaddy con
 sist of a compact quartzose sandstone, or hornstone, but the
 clay-slate may be observed in contact with                   within 100it,

   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
       Gentlemen,
INlast, an article which appears in your Journal for September
           Mr. Galbraith expresses himself much astonished at
the difference between the value of the earth's ellipticity which
he has obtained, and a result at which I had arrived.        I think
that   any  person    who reads   my   paper on this subject will see
the ground on which such a difference might have been looked
for; but for those who do not, a single line may serve to point
out the state of the case. Mr. Galbraith's calculations pro
ceed on the assumption that the earth is known to be an el
lipsoid: mine, on the supposition that this is not known. It
is manifest that to satisfy the observed curvatures in different
places we shall have different proportions of the axes, accord
ingly as the meridian is supposed to be an ellipse, or to be
some other figure.                                             -
    I  am by no means disposed to consider his hypothesis to be
better founded than mine: but more pressing employments
 compel me at present to abstain from the discussion of this
 “much-vexed ” topic, to which he so obligingly invites me.
                              I am, Gentlemen, yours, &c.

 LXIII.      On   Mr. Dalby's Method of finding the Difference of
    Longitude     between    two Points of a Geodetical Line on a
    Spheroid, from the Latitude of those Points and the Azimuths
    of the geodetical Line at the same. By Dr. TIARKs, F.R.S. &c.
 THE        ingenious
        deducing, the
                        method first suggested by Mr. Dalby, of
                         difference of longitude between any two
 points on a spheroid, from the latitude of these points and the
 inclination of the geodetical line connecting them to their me
 ridians at these points, is founded on a remarkable property
 of spheroidical triangles formed by geodetical lines, which may
 generally be thus enunciated: The sum of the three angles of
 any spheroidical triangle formed by geodetical lines is a func
 tion of the latitudes of the angular points and their differences
 of longitude only, and is altogether independent of the excen
 tricity of the spheroid. This sum, accordingly, is the same as
                                                                   the

                                                                  --
Dr. Tiarks       on the Longitudes    of the Trigonometrical                    Survey, 365
the sum of the three angles of a spherical triangle whose
angular points have the same relative situation to a particu
lar diameter, which is considered as the polar axis; that is to
say, the same latitudes respectively, and the same differences
in longitude. The particular case of this general proposition
which is employed by Mr. Dalby, is the one in which two of
 the geodetical lines are meridians, and where consequentl
one of the angular points is the pole of the spheroid itself:
 but it will be easily seen, that from the demonstration of the
particular case the truth of the general proposition may be
 immediately derived. The method used in the Trigonometri
 cal Survey requires, that if two points, on a spheroid having
 respectively a certain latitude on meridians forming a certain
 angle are connected by a geodetical line, the sum of the an
 gles of this line with the meridians of the points should be the
 same, whatever the ellipticity of the meridians may be ; and,
  accordingly, that it should be equal to the two angles of the
 spherical triangle the sides of which are the co-latitudes of the
 points, and the inclosed angle the inclination of the two meri
 dians. The inclination of the meridians of the spheroid or
  their difference of longitude is then derived from the two sides
  and the sum of theangles opposite to them: viz. the co-latitudes,
  and the sum of the azimuths.           Mr. Dalby's method was first
  published by General       Roy    in the Phil. Trans. for 1790, in
  his own words and with his own demonstration.                 It would
  appear that this demonstration has not given general satisfac
  tion; for I have observed that the want of success in the ap
                                          is,                                                       all

  hands, has sometimes          least partially been ascribed

   But by the characteristic property of the geodetical line we
have cos l sin m = cos l' sin m'; and it is therefore evident that
p.—m = m/-ul or m+m' = u +pi/, and the sum of the three
angles w-- m +m' = a +P.+R', independent of the ellipticity of
the meridians.                   If
                   we now conceive any three points on the
spheroid connected by geodetical lines, and draw their meri
dians, the comparison of the angles of the three triangles thus
formed, each by two meridians and a geodetical line, with the
analogous ones on the sphere, will immediately prove the ge
neral proposition.

which this rule was derived, is generally ascribed to a Mr. Holdred of
London, who published a tract on the subject in 1820. A similar me
thod, by Mr. Horner of Bath, appeared in the Philosophical Trans
actions for 1819.      It is not given, however, to one individual to ac
complish the work of ages.          For while we do not dispute the origi
mality of either of these authors, we claim the priority of the invention
for a Scotsman of the name of Halbert, (schoolmaster at Auchinleck,)

While Mr. Bonnycastle in his elementary treatise asserted so late
as 1818, that the solution of the irreducible case of cubic equations,
except by means of a table of sines, or by infinite series, had hitherto
baffled the united efforts of the most celebrated mathematicians of
Europe; the rule for solving cubic equations of                 kinds, whether              all

            ROYAL GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF CORNWALL
                 Fifteenth Annual Report of the Council.
   INCE     the last general meeting, an event has taken place which
      cannot but be regarded as most honourable to Cornwall, as well as
gratifying to the Society,+the elevation of our President to the Chair
of the Royal Society. A public meeting of the members of this So
ciety was held for the purpose of congratulating him on that event;
and to the address which was then sent to him (and which has been
already published), he returned the following answer.
   “My dear Sir,                    Eastbourne, December 27th, 1827.
   “Your letter of the   24th, received this morning, has conveyed to me
the most gratifying compliment with which I have ever been honoured;
gratifying in every possible point of view, but most eminently so when
my elevation to the Chair of the Royal Society is stated as reflecting
credit on my native county; in conjunction too with Sir Humphry
Davy, whose celebrity is established over the whole civilized world.
  “I   beg to present my most grateful acknowledgements and thanks
to the members of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall, and I
will immediately communicate to Sir H. Davy, the condolence and well
deserved compliments paid to him, with which I am sure he will be
most highly gratified.
  “I   trust it is quite unnecessary for me to add, that in    all
                                                               situations
and under every circumstance,     it   willbe   equally my pride and my
inclination     toforward the views and  to   promote the interest   ofthe
Cornwall Geological Society.
       Believe me, my dear Sir,
                 Your much obliged and faithful humble Servant,
   To Joseph Carne, Esq.                            DAv1Es GILBERT.”
                                                                   Surely

     Surely it will not be considered presumptuous in the county of
 Cornwall to congratulate herself on the distinguished honour of hav
ing given two successive Presidents to the Royal Society, and the
 more so in the present instance, because of the persuasion that the
 additional duties which will consequently devolve on our President,
 will not, in the smallest degree, diminish his attachment, his zeal, or
 his exertions, in favour of this Society.
     Soon after the last annual meeting of the Society,                     third volume              its
 of  Transactions was published and                       hoped that the communica

                         to                        geological information; and
                                                                  of                                                       it
 may    be  presumed that the interests                                of
                                                       Science are far better served
 by   the promulgation            one well attested fact, than
                                       of                                 the most labo           by

mens of the rocks in the different districts, with a view of placing in
the Museum a complete series of Cornish Geology.
   Within the last week, a proposal has been made to the Society by
Mr. Thomas, who some years ago published a map of one of the
principal mining districts in Cornwall.   He has since surveyed other
parts of the county, and is still proceeding in the work. He offers to
the Society the result of his labours and observations, as he may com
plete them, on condition that the Society will undertake their publi
cation, and allow him one half of the profit. This proposal has been
 so recently made, that the Council have not been able to pay any at
 tention to it; but they recommend it to their successors to ascertain,
 in the first place, whether Mr. Thomas's labours include every thing
 which ought to be comprised in a geological map, and secondly,
 whether it is likely that the sale would defray the expense of publi
cation. The profit, if any, should wholly belong to the meritorious
 individual who has thus devoted his time and abilities to the comple
tion of such a desirable object.     But whatever may be the result of
this proposal, it ought not to interfere, in the smallest degree, with
 the mode already proposed, of proceeding with the geological map
 of Cornwall.
    The Cabinet of the Society, which annually increases in interest
 and importance, has, in the present year, been enriched by various
 donations and purchases of minerals. At the last annual meeting, the
 Council had particularly to notice an extensive collection of speci
 mens presented to the Society by Dr. John Davy: they have now
the pleasure to mention another donation from the same gentleman,
 the particulars of which, as well as of the other donations, will be
 found in the Curator's Report *.
    It was announced at the last annual meeting that arrangements
were in progress for the removal of the Penzance library to a larger
building, and that, in consequence, the room occupied by that Insti
tution would be added to the Museum; of this room the Society will
take possession about Christmas next ; and it is intended to appro
priate it entirely to the geological collection, leaving the present
apartment for the mineralogical collection, which will even now
occupy the greatest part of    it.
    As the copies  of  the laws of the Society have been long since ex
hausted, the Council recommend their revision and republication.

 COMMEMORATION                THE SECOND CENTENARY OF THE BIRTH
                             OF
                             -
                                  DAY OF RAY.
A MEETING               is about to take place in London, which, to judge
        from the name of the gentleman who has consented to take
 the chair, and from the stewards who have undertaken to act on the
 occasion, may be regarded as a national festival in honour of our
 distinguished Naturalist Ray.                Throughout the whole of a long
 and industrious      life,   that   enlightened    observer and systematist de
 voted himself     unceasingly        to the  study  of the works of the Creator,
 whom in those works he learned devoutly to adore.                   His researches
 extended into every branch of Natural History, and in each of these
 he excelled.        His labours were deservedly esteemed by his con
 temporaries, and continued to receive from succeeding writers the
 attention to which their intrinsic value entitled them : to them
 Linnaeus himself was deeply indebted, and Cuvier, the first of the
 Zoologists of the nineteenth century, does not hesitate to avow his
 obligations to our illustrious countryman, who laboured in the same
 vineyard during the seventeenth. The admiration and gratitude of
 every Naturalist, to what branch soever of the science his attention
 may be more particularly directed, are justly due to Ray, and are
 indeed on      all
                  occasions most freely tendered. How well                     merited he
 them will readily          be illustrated      byeven    brief enumeration
                                                               a                             of  a
few only        those numerous and valuable productions which we owe
               of
to  his observation, his study, and his research.
    Ray has been pronounced                by
                                            Cuvier         the first true Systema
                                                          to   be
tist of   the Animal Kingdom, and the principal guide                         of
                                                                          Linnaeus               in
this department        of Nature.       To him chiefly the Zoologist         indebted
                                                                                   is
for the excellent “Ornithology” and “Ichthyology” which pass
under the name         of  Willughby. The notes collected by both were,
after the decease       of   the latter, digested and arranged                    by
                                                                            Ray, who
revised and methodized the              whole,  and  gave           to
                                                              the works the form
in  which they were presented              to
                                            the world.    Both these productions
are well known, and are still justly esteemed; the Ichthyology
especially, the principles first applied               which have been adopted

posthumous publications               of  Ray, the Synopsis Methodica Avium,

  Ray was born on the 29th of November 1628. The two hun
dredth anniversary of his birth-day is now rapidly approaching. It
will be celebrated in a manner worthy of the man and of the occasion.
The cultivators of Natural Science in each of its various branches
are anxious to take a share in the commemoration       of the event.

 AGENCY OF CARBONIC           ACID IN DECOMPOSING WATER          BY THE
                             CONTACT OF I RON.
    Dr. Marshall Hall has lately investigated the supposed decompo
 sition of water by the contact of iron, and finds that it does not occur
 without the presence of carbonic acid, and consequently that it is not
 derived either from the agency of light, electricity, or the relative
 quantities of metal and water, as has been supposed. The following
 is extracted from Dr. Hall's paper on the subject, contained in the
 Institution Journal   forJuly last. “That this phaenomenon (of the
 decomposition  of water)     not dependent upon the agency
                             is                                  of light,

it.

                                                       SOLAR SPOTS.                       -
   Having determined the time of the revolution of the maculae so
lares under our last month's Meteorological Report, and minutely
observed and noted for some years past their formation, as well as
the mutations which they have undergone, independently of their
apparent augmentation in approaching to, and linear contraction in
receding from the sun's centre, we shall now make a few concise
remarks thereon, and prove the sphericity of the sun by the com
parative time of their apparent motion upon the diametrical divi
sions of his disc. We formerly pointed out the mutability of the
nuclei and umbrae, or penumbrae of the large maculae, or black spots;
yet they appear to have a fixed position at their bases, and evidently
increase in height, divide into several distinct spots in the same um
bra, and the matter of their composition sometimes appears like a
dark thick fluid, with a smoky substance proceeding from                     de                              it,
taching itself from, and moving          contrary direction

   The various positions which the lines of their direction assume
across the sun's disk in the different months of the year, are caused
by the angle which the sun's equator makes with the plane of the
ecliptic, and the annual motion of the earth round the sun, which
alter the observer's place with respect to the position of the spots.
   It may be remarked that since Scheiner and Galileo first observed
the solar maculae in 1611 and 1612, there appears but little differ
ence in the descriptive observations of succeeding observers in re
gard to their colour, motions, mutations, and in the general appear
ances of their formation, increase, separation, reunion, decrease
and final disappearance; the differences in their opinions are chiefly
as to their situation, and the nature of their composition.     Much
more may be said on this interesting subject, but we shall close our
remarks for the present.
                       THE PLANET VENUS.
  This interesting planet was so bright on the meridian in the morn
ing of the 16th Sept. when her natural appearance through a tele
scope was nearly similar to the moon about two days after the            be
ginning of her last quarter, as to enable us to take the following ob
servations:—Her apparent distance from the sun's nearest limb at
9h 2" 3 A.M. apparent time, was 43° 55' 30"+ sun's semidiameter
15' 56" = 44°11'26", in time less than the sun's AR 2, 56m 46°.
Her true meridional altitude at 9" 2" 3 A.M. was 53° 44' 30",
which subtracted from 90°, leaves for her zenith distance South,
36° 15' 30", and her reduced North declination 14° 31' 32" added
thereto, gives the latitude of this place 50° 47' 2" North, which is
only half a mile less than the true latitude. Similar observations
on Venus on the following morning were equally successful.
  This planet will have arrived at her greatest western elongation
on the 7th of October, and may be seen throughout the month in
clear weather with the naked eye in the day-time, but to greater
advantage through a telescope when on the meridian between nine
and ten in the morning, subtending an angle from the sun's centre
of from 43° 35' to 40° 26'. The angular distance of Venus from
the sun may, with a little practice, be taken with a sextant while
she moves in that part of her orbit next to the earth, and 38 de
grees from the sun, till she arrives at her greatest western elonga
tion; also while passing from her greatest eastern elongation to
within 38 degrees of her inferior conjunction.

             journeys to Ferrybridge, in company with the Rev.
            Bulmer,  have furnished me with some observations on
the geology of that neighbourhood, which but for many en
gagements      I should some time since have had the honour of
presenting to the Society.         Several years have passed since                         I
examined the      range  of magnesian     limestone from Doncaster to
 Ferrybridge, and possessed myself of the general facts relating
to the composition and succession of the several beds asso
 ciated with        My attention was again awakened

       in organic remains.
   7. Yellow or purple sand and sandstone used for moulding
       at the iron-works.
  Beneath are the shales and sandstones of the West Riding
coal district.
    My remarks will be confined to the limestone and red marl
formations, and to the diluvial and alluvial accumulations
 which cover them.
   No. 6.—The yellow magnesian limestone is in this country
a fine-grained rather powdery rock, never indurated to mar
morean hardness as at Roche Abbey, nor composed of granu
lar rhomboidal crystals as in the southern part of Notting
hamshire.       It exhibits in one of the Weldon quarries a re
markable course of siliceous nodules, of an irregular oval figure,
lying in one continuous bed of stone, like a layer of flints in
a bed of chalk.        No organic body is connected with them.
When accidentally thrown into the limekiln they suffer fusion
on the surface, in consequence of the lime which surrounds
them, and become coated with porcelain or solid transparent
glass. In this quarry the hollow sparry concretions so com
mon in the magnesian limestone                   lie
                                            layers     the upper part

of the rock.            §.
                      fossils are seen here;  but between this place
and    Ferrybridge,    Mr. Richardson collected          considerable a
number.
   On the road from Ferrybridge             Pontefract, and near
                                                   to                                        to
the latter place, the magnesian limestone has been cut through
    the road, and exhibits the hollow balls                      of
                                                      calcareous spar

covered towards Knottingley by the other members of the
magnesian formation. . But there seems to be a considerable
fault or dislocation in the valley of the Aire, which depresses
the beds on the north side of that river; so that they have
their outcrops further toward the west.
     The fossils which I have observed in this rock in this neigh
bourhood, are the following:
     Avinus obscurus Min. Conch. of various magnitude, common.
     Cardium........ N.S. one specimen.

 404        Mr.   J.    Phillips's Geological Observations made
 stone to be nearly pure carbonate of lime, with a very small
 proportion of carbonate of magnesia.
    Vertical joints ranging N. and S. and nearly E. and W.
 cross each other, and divide the rock from top to bottom into
 vast rhomboidal prisms. The spaces left between their smooth
 sides are of different widths, and filled with various materials.
 The narrow fissures of this kind are sometimes nearly empty,
 or only partially occupied by soft fine clay introduced by
 water, and laid against the faces of stone: the wider ones are
 sometimes ten inches across, and filled by a confused assem
 blage of pebbles and clay, exactly similar to the general dilu
 vial covering which is spread over the surface of the neigh
 bouring country.
    We must therefore suppose that at the time of the deluge
 these fissures were open in their full width, and admitted the
diluvial debris. Their extreme regularity and parallelism, and
the correspondence of their opposite faces, leaves no room for
 the supposition that they owe their existence to convulsions
within the earth. Condensation of volume, in consequence of
the process of induration, seems decidedly indicated by                the    all
appearances.
    The quarrymen           Brotherton sometimes meet with little
                                 at
irregular cavities, called guts            or
                                        brashes,     the limestone, which
                                                            in
are more     or less distinctly connected with the vertical joints;
and sometimes these cavities are filled with clay                with clay
and   pebbles,    exactly   like those            in
                                               the fissures           or or
                                                                 “seams”
themselves.    Evidently, therefore, the brashes have been filled
with pebbles from the seams,               these from the surface; and
                                            as
both   at the same    time,   viz. the  deluge.

                exactly as in the red deer.
              Palmated portion of the horn, agreeing closely with
                that of the red deer.
     Both   specimens   smoother and rather smaller than in the
 red deer.
              Phalangial bone.
              Part of the radius.
             Upper part of a metatarsal bone.
    The pebbles were numerous and various, and of different
 sizes, but none exceeded five inches in diameter. Those most
 easily recognised belonged to the following rocks:—
    Dark mountain limestone.
    Cherty sandstone, such as is dug near Leeds.
    Sandstone with Producta hemispha-rica, such as is found near
        Ripley and Harrogate.
    Red sandstone of the carboniferous limestone series.
    Clay and sand of different colours enveloping the bones.
    The limestone quarries of Knottingley and Brotherton ex
 hibit another phaenomenon, of great interest to the geologist,
and well known to the workmen from the loss and disappoint
ment which it occasions:—I mean those masses of red and
white clay called “horses” ”, which range through the quarries,
some twenty, and some a hundred yards in length, and from
a few feet to many yards in breadth.          On first viewing these
“red horses,” we are apt to imagine that they fill wide fis
sures in the rock, produced by ordinary dislocations, which
uplift the strata on one side above those on the other: but
this is not the case. They are indeed uniformly situated at
the convergence of opposite declinations: but these are some
times unaccompanied by any fracture in the upper beds; and
the open space below, instead of being an ordinary fissure
with parallel sides, widens greatly downwards like a wedge.
In consequence of this peculiarity, the red horses do not           al
ways reach the surface of the limestone; and the workmen,
after removing the upper beds of that rock, find with extreme
vexation that they cover a subterranean mass of red clay. By
tracing the course of one of these wedge-shaped dykes, we
perceive that for some distance the limestone walls of the fis
sure are separate, and the red clay reaches to the diluvial
covering; but further on, the limestone walls approximate,

while the outward layers are unchanged: but sometimes the
whole mass of wood is filled with stony particles, while the
bark remains soft and pliable.      One specimen shows the cen
tral wood petrified, the external layers decayed away, and the
bark externally coated with pyritous carbonate of lime. Blue
phosphate of iron, so common in alluvial deposits, colours some
of the fragments of wood. The bark and soft wood and nut
shells burn with a brilliant and continued light; even the                                   fi

          OBITUARY:—MR. John ATKINSON, F.L.S. &c.
   Mr. John Atkinson was the sixth son of the late Rev. Miles Atkin
son, B.A. vicar of Rippax, and incumbent of St. Paul's, Leeds.   He
received his education at the Grammar School of Leeds, and at the
age of fourteen became a pupil of that eminent surgeon the late
Mr. Hey. Under such a preceptor, and aided by his own enthusiastic
devotion to his profession, he could not fail in acquiring that eminence
to which he subsequently attained. But it was as a Naturalist that
Mr. Atkinson was most known to the world. It is interesting to trace
the apparently accidental circumstances by which the mind is directed
to pursuits for which it appears to have been peculiarly formed.           A
severe illness took Mr. Atkinson from Leeds to the retired village of
Rippax, his father's vicarage : here, an admirer of the beauties of na
ture, his attention was attracted to her details; and he became en
gaged in the study of the kindred sciences of Botany and Entomology
with that ardour which characterized                    all
                                             his pursuits. For some time
 he laboured with           no
                          other book then Berkenhout's Synopsis, and
acquired    an intimate  knowledge     plants from studying them

                     of                                      his profession, in
he  made    an acquaintance with several eminent Naturalists.        He de
voted the summer recesses                to

  The merit of originating the Yorkshire Horticultural Society belongs
to Mr. Atkinson.     In the year 1820 he, with a very few supporters,
held the first  meetings   in a small room at Kirkstall, and for some
years, as       its
             treasurer, the Society was mainly indebted     him for                                        to                  its
existence. Helived      see the Society enrol amongst

398           Meteorological Observations                           for      September 1828.
   General Observations.—The weather this month has been generally plea.
sant, dry, and warm for the season.      In the evening of the 4th instant we
had lightning and several claps of thunder, occasioned by a wind spring
ing up suddenly from the North, and meeting an upper current from the
South, accompanied with a light shower of rain, which is said to have been
very heavy at Fareham, Portsdown, and Havant; and the lightning killed
one man in Farlington Marsh while in the act of pitching hay, the iron
prongs of the fork having, it is supposed, attracted the electric fluid : it
also played vividly about the ships' masts in Portsmouth Harbour, but
without doing any injury. Sheet lightning occurred in the evening of the
8th, and was followed by a thunder-storm and copious rain about 2 o'clock
in the morning, with a strong gale from S.W. This storm it is reported
had a more awful appearance in many parts of the country northward.
   In the evening of the 12th, sheet lightning was observed in the eastern
horizon from 8 till 10 o'clock; also the following evening, when it ter
minated in a thunder-storm.       The 14th was a very cold day and night,
with a N.E. gale. In the evenings of the 19th, 23rd, and 24th, large lunar
halos appeared, with paraselenae on each side         and      degrees distantof,             23
from, the moon's centre.
   The last brood           of
                      swallows departed from this place         S.E. direction                in
                                                                                              a

two weeks and two days.
   The mean temperature                         of

gree warmer than the mean                        of
                                   September for many years past.
   The atmospheric and meteoric phaenomena that have come within our
observations this month, are six paraselenae, four lunar and three solar halos,
forty meteors; lightning                   on
                                                                                                         on on

                             on                       wind,     days         of
                                                                         which                    or
they have prevailed, namely, two from the North-east, one from the East,
one from the West, and five from the South-west.

412          Prof. Encke on               the    Calculations requisite
moon have been calculated from the differences of a and 2,
which had already been calculated in examining the correct
ness of the tabular values.   In general the limit of accuracy
may be taken at 0.1.      But with regard to the 8 in the places
of the  greatest changes,  especially in the three first months,
errors of 0.3 may occur, arising from the circumstance of
these calculations having in the beginning only been made for
the upper culmination.     Greater deviations, if any should be
found, must have been introduced by misprints.
   In deducing the places for the single values of r from the
culminations, it appears unnecessary to go further than to se
cond differences.
   The tables for calculating the parallaxes for every value of
r will, however, considering the quick change of 8, not be of
the most convenient form if made with double entries; and
I  have likewise in this case found more convenience in the
method so frequently and successfully applied by Gauss, of
avoiding the double entry by a table of single entry and a
short logarithmic calculation.
    As the moon’s place is only known to O'ºl of a degree, the
parallaxes are only required to be known to 0-01, in order to
be quite sure that by them no other error shall be introduced.
It will for this purpose be sufficient to have logarithms with
only four places of decimals, which everybody may easily com
pile. Ten duodecimo leaves thus contain to the most conve
nient extent the numbers, the trigonometrical functions, and
Gauss's auxiliary tables for addition and subtraction.
    The form which I have chosen is this: For every r from
 15° to 9h I have calculated for all values of r from 10" to 10"
within the limits of r = 53' and r = 62' 10" :

the occultation.
   If N. sin (n-3) > r,  no occultation takes place: the moon
passes to the north of the star if sin 7–8, is positive, to the
south if sin (1–3) is negative.  For the place of the star's dis

   Among the various values of r, it is most advantageous to
take the one which lies nearest to the true conjunction of the
star with the moon in right ascension.        The choice of this
value is facilitated by the consideration, that for positive values
of r the apparent right ascension is smaller than the true one;

The calculations for the Ephemeris may be facilitated by some
auxiliary tables.
 . With this view         I
                      have calculated by interpolation the posi
tion of the moon for every third lunar hour. This table, while
it increases the safety, reduces besides the calculation of the
rising and, setting of the moon, every one of which would
otherwise have required a separate calculation, to a mere
copying of figures.    For if we write the table from which we
take for any given  declination the semidiurnal arc of the moon,
in such a manner that the lunar hours of the form 3n are                                    al
Ways taken  separately, and the excess of the semidiurnal arc
above these lunar hours is converted by the mean motion of
    moon into mean time, we have without any further cor
the
ºction the times of rising and setting, more accurately than
they are ever required            for

4.18          Mr. Dalton              on the     Height     of the Aurora
table for occultations of stars, is a table which contains the
time in which the moon is above, and the sun below the
horizon.
     The times of rising and setting of both these heavenly bodies
 being placed opposite to each other, this is likewise only copy
 ing of numbers.
     A third auxiliary table contains the stars which within the
 largest possible limits may be occulted.       For this purpose I
 sought for the beginning, middle, and end of the year, the de
  clination which the moon has for every 5° of right ascension,
  and took in all the stars which are 40' further north, and
  1° 40' further south, than the northernmost and southernmost
  limits of those zones.
      By means of these tables the decision of the possibility of
  an occultation is in general so much facilitated, that besides
  the 130 occultations given in the book, only two were calcu
  lated in which the moon remained distant somewhat more than
  2', the limit    which had proposed
                     to              I        myself           to

“About 8 P.M., a luminous arch appeared very brilliant; the
outside of the curve seemed a little south of the zenith.  The
eastern end tapered to a point above the horizon; the western
end was broader, and lost in a cloud which rested on the
mountain.     It disappeared about 10 o'clock.”
    At Whitehaven, one hundred miles from Edinburgh, and a
few miles more to the westward, a minute description of the
phaenomenon was given in one of the newspapers of that place,
by Mr. Holden, lecturer on astronomy, who happened to be

  they appeared there, and might have been adopted with very
  little error, it should seem, for that at Edinburgh or any one
  of the intervening places, except as to the altitude of the sum
  mit of the arch.        “A   most magnificent meteor was observed
  here between 8 and 9 o'clock.             The appearance was that of
  a luminous    arch,  stretching    quite   across the heavens.        Its                  di
  rection was that of the magnetic east and west, intersecting
  the magnetic meridian at right angles.             At the same time a
  splendid light was observable in the northern horizon.                  This
  meteor was similar in some particulars to one which appeared
  a few years ago.” [Query in 1819 PJ, “The arch itself ap
  peared like two frustums of cones, with the less extremity in
  the horizon, and their bases meeting in the zenith. The
  densest parts of the bow were those near the horizon, and the
  west end the denser of the two.”
      The phaenomenon was seen at Lancaster, twenty miles S.
  of Kendal, and 130 miles S. of Edinburgh; it was described
  in the next Lancaster Gazette, but without being specific as
  to the altitude of the centre of the arch. Inquiry having been
  made of an intelligent medical gentleman who had seen                                 it,    he
  described the luminous arch              asextending from east          west         to

   at 50°, he was still more certain it was too low.
      The aurora was seen at Manchester, as has been stated;
   but it does not appear to have attracted much attention at this
   place.    I have not been able to trace any account- of the phae
   nomena having been seen further south.
      These are all the material observations                            I

  from which it must        appear   that the    descriptions   every where
  given evidently apply to the same luminous arch.              In proceed
  ing from north to south we find the arch gradually advancing
  in altitude, always crossing the meridian to the south of the
  zenith, till we arrive about Kendal, at which place it crossed
  nearly in the zenith, and when at Warrington                  culminating     its
  was   to the north      of
                         the zenith.           further remarkable, that

                     to                     calculate the height

  the same     meridian,       all

  Lnfortunately, the Edinburgh and Hawick observations                                             do
  not harmonize together: however, those                Jedburgh, place

                                   rather   perhaps,    that they had not
 been    cotemporary     with each other and the rest            the obser       of

                                                   is
 at  Edinburgh considerably too high.
      In this uncertainty we may                 be

vations were nearly cotemporary, and made                    the same part on
of   the arch, the altitude         Whitehaven being 75° from the

usual  appearances  of the aurora borealis, or streamers distant
in the north. The observations are insufficient for calculating
the height.   I find in my journal the aurora was noticed at
Manchester that evening, but no particulars are given.      Mr.
Longmire mentions a similar arch seen at Kendal and Dublin
on the 17th of April the same year. An aurora was seen in
London at the same time. (Annals of Phil. vol.       400.)                                 iii.   p.

Philosophy.)
   Gosport.—In the same volume of Annals, page 395, there
is an account of the same aurora as seen at Gosport Obser
vatory, Hampshire, on that evening, by Dr. Burney.         The
following is an extract: “On the 17th instant, at 7 P.M. a
light about 30° on either side of the magnetic north point ap
peared in the shape of a luminous arch whose apex was 18°
above the horizon.”     He then describes several beams of the
common aurora which successively appeared and traversed
about for a time chiefly within the arch, and then vanished and
were succeeded by others. After which, he adds: “Soon
after this (9 o'clock) the luminous arch in the northern hemi
sphere entirely disappeared, and some haze collected near the
horizon.”
  Gosport and Keswick are very nearly under the same mag
netic meridian,            and 265 miles distant.              Newton-Stewart       is
N.W. by W.      of Keswick, distant about sixty-five miles, but
only thirty-five miles in a meridional direction.  Now I ima
                                                                             §.
gine it will be allowed that an extraordinary luminous arch
seen at Newton-Stewart       to cross the meridian a few degrees
south of the   zenith,  and to continue from 8 to near 9
nearly in that position, must have been the arch seen at Kes
wick at the same time to cross the meridian in like manner
from east to west, and to pass nearly through the zenith. It
may well be supposed, then, that this arch crossing through
the zenith at Keswick would have a very diminished altitude
if seen at Gosport, 265 miles south. From the account have                   I
extracted, it appears that a luminous arch was seen there at
the same time it was seen at the other places, and crossing the
meridian at right angles, only                 as its
                                      altitude 18° from the north,
             being     the zenith,       Keswick,

    LXX.        On the Fitting-up of Microscopes for the Eramination
        of  Opaque   Objects requiring high powers ; and on the Con
        struction of a Focimeter.    By Mr. G. DAKIN.
        To   the Editors              of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
             Gentlemen,                                                                                          -
    AS       microscopes are now fitted up by the opticians, a nu
           merous and beautiful class of objects is entirely lost to ob
    servers; viz. those opaque objects which require a high power.
    My single microscope, which I had purposely fitted up with
    the highest powers both opaque and transparent, is almost
    useless for this purpose, as the highest opaque eye-piece is
    1-6th of an inch focus.                         I
                                       have seen the scales of the diamond
    beetle as an opaque object through a lens which I think Dr.
    Goring said was i-60th of an inch focus. He has certainly car
    ried it quite to the maximum, as there was rather a want of light
    and distinctness, which                         I
                                       attribute in a great measure to the
    best part of the speculum being lost by the introduction of
    the deep convex cup which holds the lens; nevertheless the
    beautiful lines on the scales were plainly to be seen, even with
    this high power.                  I
                            have made the whole of my transparent eye
    pieces answer as opaque ones, in which the lenses are placed
    on the outsides of the speculums; consequently the whole of
    the central and best part of the speculum is brought into
    action. Opticians seem to forget that the light which is thrown
    on the speculum is already condensed, and that such large
    ones are not necessary, unless it be to compensate for the
                                                                                            on up

These equations express the condition that two vertical planes,
one at each station, intersect in the chord joining the stations.
As the investigation is merely elementary, it may be omitted.
The two equations, although very simple, are alone sufficient
for the solution of the problem, since the excentricity and the
difference of longitude are the only unknown quantities they
contain.   In order to simplify, shall put w = sin A-sin                        I                                                              A';

 434         Mr. Ivory         on the Longitudes                  of the Trigonometrical Survey.
        With the data at Beachy Head and Dunnose, and making
  :      = -00324, I have deduced these values of w, viz.
                           w = 1° 26' 58/.3
                           w = 1  27 0 °8
 These results approach near the true quantity, but they do
 not agree, which shows that there is some inconsistency in
 the observed quantities.                          If
                               we add 0"-6 to the difference of
 latitude, the formulas will give results very nearly equal to
                                                             -
 one another and to the true quantity.   Thus, making
                     x = 50° 44' 21".8
                     x = 50      37    4-7,
        I have       found               a    =    1             27         3 '8
                                         w    =    1             27         7 °2,
and the mean of these values almost coincides with the exact
quantity.                                              -
   What has now been said is decisive of this question. The
equations to which the problem has been reduced, which are
rigorously exact, prove that the excentricity has an influence
on the difference of longitude, however minute that difference
may be, and however difficult to bring it to an exact valua
tion.   The investigation we have employed is drawn from the
principles of elementary geometry.       We have advanced no
vague reasoning about the well-known properties of spheroidi
cal triangles and geodetical lines, in a case where, in fact,
there is neither any such triangle nor any such line.
        If
      we combine the two equations (A) so as to exterminate
the excentricity, we shall obtain the following equation; viz.
                                              cos 2.7                        COS 2.

many circumstances which it would have been of consequence
to record; but daily marches of from fifteen to twenty miles
in the hottest season of the year, may of themselves be deemed
an             for those, as well as other inaccuracies that may,
perhaps, Thereafter be discovered.            I

    The altitudes, in the section which accompanies this paper,
 are deduced from barometrical observations, regularly made
 throughout the march.       Observations of the maximum and
 minimum    heights of the column of mercury were taken daily
 at each  stage,  and the mean of these was generally used in
the calculations. Corresponding observations were obligingly
 furnished to me by Mr. Goldingham from the observatory;
from a comparison with which, and with another series of ob
 servations made by Major Beckett at Bellary, the altitudes of
the several stations have been determined.
    In former instances, most of the approximate altitudes which
I  have had opportunities of ascertaining in different parts of
the peninsula, have been deduced solely from my own obser
vations, a mode originating in some degree in necessity, and
subsequently adhered     to,
                           partly from the same cause, but partly
also from choice, from      desire
                            a          ascertain how far such ap
                                         to
proximations might     bedepended upon.
    Few or   no  barometrical observations were        that period
                                                            at
regularly made    atany  of the inland stations under this Presi
dency; and the stations where such records were kept were                   so
remote from each other,        as
                              well      from my routes,

   Colonel Lambton’s base line near Gooty is nearly 1200 feet

the interval between that station and Bellary; an inference to

The gravity at the equator is to the centrifugal force as
1 to a sº-33, and the ellipticity gºs; not g;T, as according to
  . Simpson: the difference is not much.
   And as we know from observations with the pendulum that
the ellipticity is less, the polar section of the earth is not an
exact ellipse, and the usual reduction of the observed latitude
(tan A = (1 —        tane”) not strictly correct.

       elongated spines or calcaria, disposed in pairs. (Latr.)

       perior incumbent on the inferior; the latter hyaline; the
      former very narrow, and usually fenestrate. (Latr.)

 Obs. The caterpillars of the Sesiae gnaw out the interior of
      vegetables, and make themselves a more or less solid co
      coon therein, composed of the detached and pulverized
         ortions, which they agglutinate, and connect together

                 perfect

   Ochsenheimer         very  justly observes that the term Sesia,

more correctly spelt Setia, since the genitive of the original

species    of this genus.      Stephens separates those which occur

second those of Trochilium, Scop. and Ægeria, Fab.        Och
senheimer comprehends the whole in the two former genera;
but two out of the six species which he places under Macro
glossa, namely S. Fuciformis and, Bombyliformis, Stephens
arranges with his Sesiae.      Latreille observes (Nouv. Dict.
d'Hist. Nat. xxxi. 105.), that “Scopoli separated from the
Sphinges, properly so called, certain species which have the
abdomen terminated by a tuft, and of them he formed his
genus Macroglossum. Other naturalists united them to the
Šesiae.  Fabricius, in his Systema Glossatorum”, comprehends
under the latter generic name only those species (i.e. the Ma
croglossa of Scopoli); our Sesiae being considered by him as
forming the genus Ageria. M. Ochsenheimer, in his work on
the Lepidoptera of Europe, has, with reason, rejected this ar
rangement, and in that respect          opinion and mine coin his
cide.”—Latr.            l.   c.

     Dr. Thomson has found reason to adopt                        an idea, suggested
some years ago        by Dr. Prout, that the numbers which express
the atomic weight of bodies are multiples by a whole number
of the atomic weight of hydrogen; and his favourite object,
visible in almost every page, is to prove the coincidence to be
perfect. In this attempt he has been so successful, that the
correspondence between his hypothesis and the result of his
experiments is startlingly precise. As the accuracy of his re
sults, which, if true, are very important, can be duly estimated
only by an analyst of extensive experience, we looked forward
with impatience to hear the opinion of Berzelius.                 His opi
nion has at length reached us; and as it is expressed in lan
guage extremely strong and extremely unusual, we think it
necessary to employ his own words.                We have accordingly
translated a few      passages    from the Yahres-Bericht for 1827
(Woehler's Translation).
    “This work belongs to those few productions from which
science will derive no advantage whatever.               Much of the ex
perimental part, even of the fundamental experiments, appears
to have been made at the writing-desk; and the greatest civi
lity which his contemporaries can show                      its
                                                      author,        forget  is   to
that  it was ever published.” (page 77.)

                                            In       this analysis, Thom
son states that the oxide              of
                                     zinc was    precipitated        carbo        by
nate   of soda, and that 18:125 grains                  of

     zinc yielded     8grains        anhydrous neutral carbonate
zinc.      Inthis fundamental analysis are two errors;–errors
such   a nature    as   it   difficult
                             is             commit, and which appear
                                                 to
to  prove that the results were invented. Some one had told
 Thomson that his whole work was                       of
                                                little value, because,                      in
the fundamental experiment, the zinc was precipitated                   car            by
bonate      ofsoda     the cold.
                      in              To this privately communicated
remark, Thomson openly replied, That                               he
                                                            had supposed

 fore omitted details; but          he found this opinion erroneous,

it  became necessary         publish

 of carbonate of zinc dried at the temperature of 212°Fahr.
 As this carbonate, when heated to redness, yielded 20:37 of
 oxide, it was anhydrous and neutral. The filtered solution
  was boiled, and the oxide of zinc which subsided, after being
  collected and ignited, weighed 4:54 grains. The solution was
  then evaporated to dryness in a porcelain vessel, and the salt
  again dissolved in water; when some oxide of zinc remained,
  which, when dried at a red heat, weighed 0.431. The solution
  was then again evaporated to dryness, and the residue ignited;
  and on being dissolved in water a little silicate of zinc was
  left, which after decomposition yielded 0.22 grains of oxide of
  zinc. To the remaining alkaline solution, after being neutra
  lized by muriatic acid, a few drops of hydro-sulphuret of am
  monia were added, which threw down a quantity of sulphuret
  corresponding to 0-65 grains of oxide of zinc. All these five
  portions together make up the sum of 26-211 grains, the weight
  of five atoms of oxide of zinc.; so that 5:245 is the weight of
  one atom. Thomson, on this occasion, does not appear to
  have reflected on the fact, that neutral carbonate of zinc is
  never obtained by precipitation from an alkaline carbonate;
  and he has left this difficult point unexplained. The reason why
  all the oxide of zinc contained in a solution cannot be precipi
  tated in the cold,           is,
                        that portion        adissolved     the form
                                                                is              in                   of  bi

                                         oxide which loses        carbonic               its
 acid, subsides      the form

                                       subcarbonate.  a    We have seen
in    the experiments        Boussingault, that even the sesquicar

to inquire; but we know Dr. Thomson to be devotedly at

it became soon blended with the milky way, and ceased to
be distinguishable. The belt seemed exactly similar to a ray
of the northern light, except that not the least corruscation
was to be observed.    Its position could- not be much out of
the  magnetic equator.

science, philosophy and poetry, went hand in hand. The people were
taught every thing; Natural History was diffused; and they have
handed down for our use a stock of names which no other language
can equal.
   It may perhaps remain doubtful whether the old English names are
not too much forgotten to be revived, and whether it is not now, in
many cases, as easy to establish the foreign names.          Still there would
remain much that might be familiarized to the English scholar by the
use of his native language.              -

           HERICART DE THURY,            on 13th of October last, read a no
       • tice to the Academy of Sciences respecting the discovery of a
 mass of meteoric iron existing at Caille, near Grasse, department du Var.
 In August last, M. Brard sent from Fréjus a specimen of the mass in
question, with respect to the origin of which he did not decide. The
examination made by the author caused him to suspect that it might
be meteoric iron, and he therefore wrote to M. Brard to beg that he
would go to the place, in order to determine the nature of the moun
tain on which it was discovered; to examine the mass of supposed
meteoric iron ; and to collect from the inhabitants           the information         all
which they could give him. The following              extracted from the acis
                 at by

saturate the acid it contained; an insoluble salt was formed, which
being separated by the filter was found to be gallate of magnesia, but

     The solution again evaporated to dryness on a salt-water bath yielded
a brown extract, which attracted moisture slightly. This extract being
digested in cold alcohol, the resin and emetin were dissolved, and the
other substances remained unacted upon : the solution after filtration
was evaporated in a similar way, a dark-coloured extract obtained,
which being treated with hot water the emetin was dissolved and the
 resin separated.

   General Observations.—This month to the 27th was generally fine, dry,
and mild for the season; but the last four days, though remarkably fine,
were cold, and the mights frosty.     This wintry change was brought on by
a dry land-wind from the North-east.      The first hoar-frost that occurred
this autumn was early in the morning of the 3rd instant; it was accom
panied by a fog, and followed in the day by a large solar halo, whose pris
matic colours were well defined.     In the night     the 5th much rain fell
                                                   of
here, with a gale from the South.    From 8 o'clock till midnight of the 6th,
there was sheet lightning, which terminated with thunder and rain. Distant
thunder was also heard in the morning of the 7th.      In the evening of the
21st a thick fog appeared, and was succeeded by one of the heaviest dews
we ever remembered to have fallen, it being measurable from the rain
8 auge.
   The mean temperature of the external air this month, is half a degree
higher than the mean of October for many years past.
                                                            so its
   Spring water did not come to     maximum temperature till the beginning
of the month, and     eontinued it  nearly throughout.
   The atmospheric and meteoric phaenomena that have come within our
observations this month, are one solar halo; eighteen meteors; lightning
and thunder on two different days; and seven gales            wind; namely,                                 of
one from the North-east, one from the South, two from the South-west,
and three from the West.
