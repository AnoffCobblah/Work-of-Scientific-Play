I. A Comparison of Rowland's Thermometers with the Paris
   Standard, and a Reduction of his Value of the Mechanical
   Equivalent of Heat to the Hydrogen Scale. By Dr. WILLIAM
   S. DAY, Columbia University, New York".
                         1. INTRODUCTION.
THE object        of the investigation described here was to
       compare Professor Rowland's thermometers with the
hydrogen scale of the International Bureau and to reduce his
value of the mechanical equivalent accordingly.
   The mechanical equivalent of heat, as it has been defined
 until recently, is, in the C.G.S. system, the value of J in the
 equation
                             J = dW
                                   dº ’
 where dW is the number of ergs required, when expended
 in heat, to raise the temperature of one gram of water dtº C.
 on the absolute scale. The use of the expression “mechanical
 equivalent” in its old sense will be adhered to in this paper
 for the sake of uniformity with Rowland's paper. #.
 quantity,  ºy,   differs at different temperatures on account of
 the variation of the specific heat of water.
    Rowland's measurement of the mechanical equivalent in
 1877–78 (Proc. Am. Acad. xv. p. 75, 1879) still remains as
       -         * Communicated by Prof. J. S. Ames.

2              Dr. W. S. Day on a Comparison of
probably the best one in which the heat was produced by the
expenditure of mechanical energy. Within the last few
years, however, a number of other determinations have been
made by electrical methods, and these have given values
differing somewhat from Rowland's. The chief ones of these
electrical determinations are those of E. H. Griffiths (Phil.
Trans. 184A, p. 361, 1893), and of Schuster and Gannon
 (Phil. Trans, 186 A, p. 415, 1895). The following table,
taken from Schuster and Gannon's paper, gives some com
parative values. The unit is foot-pounds at Greenwich
(g=981-17 cm./sec.”), and the temperature scale is that of the
Paris nitrogen thermometer.

   The measurement of the quantity    y depends not only on
the measurement of dW, but also on the scale of temperature
used in measuring dt’. In Rowland’s experiments this
quantity was measured on the absolute scale, as determined
by means of the air-thermometer. It was the object of the
comparisons described here to compare this absolute scale, as
represented by Rowland's thermometers, with the hydrogen
scale of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures,
at Sèvres, near Paris. For this purpose there were secured
three Tonnelot thermometers that had been studied at the
International Bureau, and compared with the standards of
the Bureau at several points of the scale. These three ther
mometers were compared with three of Rowland's thermo
meters used in his mechanical equivalent experiment. The
difference between Rowland's absolute scale and the Paris
hydrogen scale was thus determined, and the corresponding
corrections to the value of the mechanical equivalent were
calculated. The general result is contained in Table IX. on
page 25.
                    2. THERMOMETERs USED.
   Rowland's value of the mechanical equivalent is the result
of fourteen experiments, each of which was made with some
one of four different thermometers in the calorimeter.         In
thirteen of these he used three thermometers made by Baudin
in 1876–77, and in one he used a thermometer made by
Welsh in 1853, and called, in Rowland's paper, the Kew
standard. This thermometer belongs to the University of

                                                                                   wn
           Rowland's Thermometers with the Paris Standard.                         o
  Pennsylvania, and was not available for this comparison.
  The three Baudin thermometers were numbered 6163, 6165,
  and 6166. Of these, 6163 was used in eight experiments,
  6.165 in one experiment, and 6166 in four experiments.
  6166 was also compared by Joule with one of his own ther
 mometers. (Rowland, Proc. Am. Acad. xvi. p. 38, 1880.)
 The three Tonnelot thermometers were numbered 11800,
 11801, and 11811, and were made between November 1895
and January 1896. A complete study of these was made by
the International Bureau, including a comparison at several
º          with the standards of the Bureau which had previously
  een compared with the hydrogen thermometer. Two of the
thermometers, 11800 and 11811, were broken during their
first transportation to America, but through the liberality and
kindness of the International Bureau and of M. Guillaume,
they were repaired by the maker, and a completely new study
of them was made. These Tonnelot thermometers were made
of French “verre dur,” with transparent stems, and were
divided into tenths of a degree.
    The Baudin thermometers were divided into millimetres.
The centimetre marks were numbered, and corresponded in
a rough way to degrees.                       The following table gives the
 dimensions and other data concerning fhese six thermo
 meters : —

4             Dr. W. S. Day on a Comparison of
          3. MANNER OF USING THE THERMOMETERs.
   In comparing these various thermometers, it was necessary
to use them in the way in which they were originally used
when they were standardized. The #. thermometers
had to be used in the manner described by Guillaume in his
“Thermométrie de Précision,’ and in the printed notice that
came with the thermometers from the International Bureau.
Rowland’s thermometers were used in a different way when
they were originally compared with the air-thermometer,
The chief points of difference are in the corrections for
internal and external pressure, and in the manner of taking
and using the zero point. The present method as used at
the International Bureau is to determine the pressure-coeffi
cients, as they are called, by means of which any variation in
the external pressure from the standard 760 millim., due to
a change in barometric pressure, or to immersing the thermo
meter in a liquid, and any internal hydrostatic pressure of
the mercury on the bulb, due to the thermometer not being
horizontal, can be taken account of and the proper corrections
applied. There are two pressure-coefficients, the external and
the internal. The external pressure-coefficient is generally
denoted by the letter S., and gives the fraction of a degree
the reading of the thermometer is changed by a change in the
external pressure of 1 millim. of mercury. The internal
pressure-coefficient 3, can be calculated for French hard
glass by adding the quantity 0:0000154 to the external
coefficient. This quantity depends on the elastic constants of
mercury and of glass. . It is generally a small fraction, 10 per
cent. or less, of the whole pressure-coefficient. It differs, of
course, for different kinds of glass, but this difference is a still
smaller fraction of the whole pressure-coefficient.
   The zero point is always calculated from the zero taken
immediately after each reading of temperature, before the
zero has had time to change.
   Rowland's thermometers were originally used in quite a
different way.    In his comparisons, the vertical position was
considered as the normal one, and the thermometers were
always used in that position. Changes in external pressure
were not taken account of except when they were caused b
the pressure of water in the comparison-tank. The ther
mometers, when not in use, remained at a temperature of 18°
to 20°C., the temperature of the room. The zero points
were taken at the beginning of a series of comparisons. In
taking the zeros, the thermometers were immersed in ice for
an hour or two before the reading was taken, and then the
                                                                     H

       Rowland's Thermometers with the Paris Standard.              5
 comparisons were made at successively higher temperatures.
 In order to reduce the readings of his thermometers to the
 air-thermometer, Rowland found by calibration the apparent
 volume occupied by the mercury corresponding to each
 division-line on the stem.       He assumed that the temperature
on the air-thermometer was a function of the second degree
of this volume. He made a number of comparisons between
his thermometers and the air-thermometer, and, by the
method of least squares, found the equation connecting the
temperature and volume. From this he constructed a table
for each thermometer giving the air-thermometer temperature
corresponding to each centimetre on the stem. These tables
are given on pp. 115–116 of his paper on the mechanical
equivalent, and are reproduced here in Table II. The correc
tions to reduce the air-thermometer temperature to the absolute
scale are deduced from the experiments of Thomson and Joule,
and are given here as Rowland gives them on p. 114 of his
paper (Table III.).

   In making these comparisons it would have been theoreti
cally better to have used the Baudin thermometers vertically
and the Tonnelot thermometers horizontally, or at least both
thermometers vertically. But in order to make it possible to
remove the Tonnelot thermometers easily and quickly from
the comparison-tank in order to take the zeros, and also in
order that the readings of the thermometers might be made
with a micrometer telescope, it was decided to make the
comparisons with the thermometers in a horizontal position
as otherwise there would have been serious mechanical
difficulties in the construction of the tank. This made it
necessary to apply a pressure-correction to the Baudin ther
mometers to make the readings what they would have been
if the thermometers had been vertical ; but this correction
could be applied with considerable accuracy by measuring
the pressure-coefficients.
   In carrying out these comparisons it was found necessary
to construct several pieces of apparatus. As some of these
differed a little from any that had been used before, it will be
necessary to give a short description of them.
                      a. Pressure Apparatus.
   The pressure-coefficients were determined in a manner
practically identical with that described by Guillaume in his
Thermometrie de Précision, p. 104. Matters were so arranged
that the thermometer could be subjected alternately to a
pressure of 5 or 6 centim. of mercury, and then to the atmo
spheric pressure of 76 centim. The change in pressure was
read by means of a mercury manometer, and the change in
the reading of the thermometer was also noted.         The method
of taking the readings will be described later.

8              Dr. W. S. Day on a Comparison of
                     b. Micrometer Telescope.
   The thermometers in the comparison-tank and in the zero
tank were always read by means of a micrometer telescope.
The micrometer was not an eyepiece micrometer, but there
were cross-hairs in the field of view, and the whole telesco
was moved parallel to itself by the micrometer motion. The
telescope was so constructed à: it could be used to read the
horizontal thermometers in the comparison-tank, or the
vertical thermometers in the zero tank.        In reading vertical
thermometers the telescope was fastened to an upright frame,
consisting of two vertical steel bars. It then became in effect
a cathetometer. In all cases care was taken by means of
levels and plumb-lines to have the axis of the telescope per
pendicular to the thermometers. The telescope magnified
about ten or eleven times.
                       c. Comparison-Tank.
   The comparison-tank was devised to fulfil the following
requirements:—
   1. The thermometers must be easily removed for the pur
pose of taking zeros.
   2. They must remain at a practically constant temperature
for four or five minutes.
   3. They must be easily and quickly read by means of a
micrometer telescope sliding on ways above the tank.
   4. The supports on which the thermometers rest must be
so solid and firmly fastened to the ways on which the telescope
slides that there will be no possibility of any accidental relative
motion of the telescope and the thermometer.
   To fulfil the first requirement it was decided to have a
horizontal tank, as explained farther back. The tank was
made of sheet copper in the form of a rectangular box
92 centim. long, 21 centim. wide, and 23 centim. deep. A
section of it is represented in fig. 1, and a cross-section in
fig. 2. The top consisted of a movable lid made of a brass
casting. This lid had a flange that was planed on the under
side so as to fit a planed brass rim forming the top of the
sides of the tank. A piece of sheet indiarubber formed a
packing between the two parts, to prevent the escape of water.
After the lid had been placed in position, it could be screwed
down tightly by means of a number of C-clamps placed
around the sides.     The lid was made in the form of a frame
holding a piece of plate-glass, which was a window through
which the thermometers could be read. This window was
about 1.5 centim. from the stems of the thermometers.

1()     -     Dr. W. S. Day on a Comparison of
    In order to fulfil the second requirement the tank was
placed inside a larger wooden box whose walls were .*.
where about 5 centim. from the sides of the tank, and the
              Fig. 2.—Comparison-Tank (cross-section).
intervening space was filled with cotton-wool. .This protected
the tank very well, except at the top, from too rapid a gain or
loss of heat from the air when this was at a different tempera
ture from that of the tank. The layer of cotton did not
 extend quite up to the top of the tank. The non-conducting
layer above this point had to be easily removed to allow
the removal of the lid. A covering of felt was therefore con
 structed about 2 centim. thick, which extended over all the
 parts of the tank not protected by the cotton, except the glass
window. This had to be exposed, at least in part, to allow
of reading the thermometers. In order still further to pro
 tect the thermometers from any change of temperature, the
 bulbs were placed inside a brass box, as shown in the sections.
 This box was 10.5 centim. long, 8 centim. wide, and 5 centim.
deep. It was so constructed i. two lids on the top and two
on the bottom could be opened or closed from the outside of
the tank. While the water was being stirred, in the manner

       Rowland’s Thermometers with the Paris Standard.           11
to be described presently, this box was kept open. As soon
as the water had attained to a uniform temperature, and
everything was ready to make a comparison, the stirring was
stopped, and the lids of the box were closed. The bulbs were
thus shut off completely from any convection currents, and
in this manner the thermometers could be kept at a constant
temperature for a considerable time.         The water was stirred
by three paddle-wheels operated by means of a crank on the
outside of the box.
     In order to heat the water in the tank to bring it to any
 desired temperature, a brass tube ran along it from end to
end near the bottom.          This did not communicate with the
 water of the tank, but opened into the air at each end. Steam
 was passed into it º the water reached the temperature
 desired.
     Fastened to the lid of the tank were upright brass posts
 which held the ways on which the micrometer telescope slid.
  The telescope had freedom to move in two horizontal directions
  at right angles to each other, so that it could be placed quickly
  over any part of the tank, and used to read any thermometer
  at any part of its scale. The thermometers rested on little
  brass beams which were fastened to the brass rim of the tank.
   As this rim was clamped securely to the brass lid which
   carried the ways, the fourth requirement was secured. When
   the tank was full of water and the lid on, the thermometer
   bulbs were about 5:7 centim. below the surface of the water.
                              d. Zero Tank.
       In taking the zero points of thermometers in the ordinary
    tank it is necessary to plunge the thermometer down into the
    ice until the zero division is a good deal below the surface, so
    as to make sure that the stem is all at the temperature of 0°C.
    When a reading is made, the thermometer is raised until the
    zero point is just visible. When this is done, not º is the
    stem apt to become covered with water in films, and drops,
    which make it difficult to read the position of the mercury
    thread, but it is also apt to become covered with dew when
    the laboratory room, as is usual in this country, is at a
    temperature of from 16° to 20° C. When the zero point is
    near the bulb there is also, it seems probable, some danger
    that a little warm water may trickle down the stem of the
    thermometer and find its way to the bulb in sufficient quantity
    to make a difference of several thousandths of a degree. In
    order to do away with these difficulties it was decided to have
    the stem immersed in the ice for some distance above the
    zero point, and to read the thermometer through a tube which

 12          Dr. W. S. Day on a Comparison of
                         Fig. 3.-Zero-Tank.

                          T
should reach from the side of the tank to the part of the stem
where the zero point actually was.      A device was therefore
made use of which is represented in fig. 3.       The ice was
contained in a cylindrical tin-lined copper tank 33-5 centim.

        Rowland’s Thermometers with the Paris Standard.            13
high and 15.2 centim. in diameter. At the bottom there was
an opening through which the excess of water could be drawn
off. At a distance of 7 centim. from the top of the tank two
openings 2 centim. in diameter were made, one on each side
of the tank. To these there was fitted, in a manner that it is
not necessary to describe, but so that it could be readily
detached, a tube of hard rubber or ebonite 2 centim. in
diameter. This ebonite tube extended horizontally across the
 tank from one side to the other, except that at the centre of it
 there was a little brass piece that held a sort of drum with
 drum-heads of pure sheet rubber. These were perforated
 with small circular holes in the centre, and a thermometer
  could be inserted perpendicularly through them both. . When
  in position the whole tank could be filled with ice and water,
  and very little if any water escaped through the joints. As
  represented in the drawing, the two rubber diaphragms, or
  drum-heads, were 3.7 centim. apart, and a portion of the
   thermometer-stem of that length was therefore not exposed to
   the ice. This portion of the stem, however, must have been
   within 0°1 of 0°C., because when the bulb of a small ther
   mometer which could detect a difference of 0°1 was placed
   in the air in the centre of this ebonite tube, and left there a
    short time, it indicated a temperature of 0°C. . There was
    also no dew deposited on the stem unless there happened to
    be a draught of air blowing through the room, as happened in
    one or two cases.
        In using the tank the ice was broken up into very fine
    ". by means of a wooden            mallet, in a zinc-lined wooden
       ox and transferred by a tin scoop to the zero tank. Ordinary
     distilled water was poured on it, and it was packed down closely.
     The thermometer was then placed in position, and the tank
     was filled to the brim with ice. The actual zero point was
      º observed in          the middle of the tube.      The water in
     the ice was also generally kept at about the same height.
     The actual height of the water was measured by means of a
     vertical glass tube placed alongside the tank, and communi
     cating with the outlet tube at the bottom. A brass frame,
     not represented in the drawing, was fastened to the tank to
      support the thermometer.
          he ice used was made artificially out of filtered Baltimore
      city water. Clear pieces were chosen, and it was found to
     be very pure by testing the water melted from it for ammonia,
     and for dissolved substances in general by measuring its
     electrical conductivity. The depression of the freezing-point
     caused by impurities in the ice must have been less than
     09.001 C.

 14            Dr. W. S. Day on a Comparison of
                    5. PRESSURE CoEFFICIENTs.
                 a. Eaterior Pressure Coefficients.
    In measuring the exterior pressure-coefficient, precautions
were taken, following Guillaume, to have the thermometer
bulb practically surrounded by a large mass of water which
was at a temperature several degrees cooler than that of the
room. The water in this grew warmer continuously, and
with great uniformity. This prevented errors due to a falling
meniscus, as readings were not taken immediately after the
  ressure and the reading of the thermometer were reduced.
!.         were taken alternately at atmospheric pressure and
at a pressure of 5–10 centim. of mercury. The average of
the pair at the high pressure of one atmosphere was compared
with the intervening reading at a low pressure. Ten or
twenty observations of this kind were made for each thermo
meter and the results averaged. In this way the pressure
coefficient in centimetres on the stem was found.          As the
bores of the thermometer-tubes were not very uniform in
diameter, this was reduced to degrees centigrade by means
of Rowland's tables.                       -
   The observations are given in Table IV. p. 15.
   The results are as follows:–
             For Baudin 6163, 8–0°.000274,
             For Baudin 6165, 8.- 0°.000296,
             For Baudin 6166, 8, -0°.000318.
                b. Interior Pressure Coefficients.
   In getting the interior pressure-coefficient, the International
Bureau, as mentioned before, calculates it from the external
 ressure-coefficient.     When the thermometer is made of
}.       hard glass, the internal coefficient is connected with
the external by the equation             -
                      B, = 8.4-0°0000154,
where the unit of measurement is degrees centigrade per
millimetre of mercury pressure. Part of this difference
depends on the cubical compression of mercury, and part on
the elastic constants of the glass. The Baudin thermometers
were not made of French hard glass, but it is probable that
this difference would not be significantly changed by this
fact. The same value has therefore been used. This gives
for the three thermometers the following values for the
internal pressure-coefficients:—
             For Baudin 6163, 8–0°.000290,
             For Baudin 6165, 8,-0°.000311,
             For Baudin 6166,       8, -0°.000334.

            6. MANNER OF MAKING THE COMPARISONs.
  In comparing a Tonnelot with one of the Baudin thermo
meters, the Baudin was placed first in ice for two or three
hours. Its zero point was then read by means of the
micrometer telescope three or four times in succession, and
the average taken as the reading. In the meantime the
water in the comparison-tank having been cooled to about
10° or lower, the Baudin and one of the Tonnelot ther
mometers were placed in the tank. The top of the tank
was put on, and while the box containing the bulbs remained
open, the water was thoroughly stirred. As long as the
temperature of the water in the tank was lower than that of
the room, it of course rose very slowly while the stirring
went on. This sufficed to make the icº, always
reach any given temperature below that of the room with a
rising meniscus. As soon as the water was thoroughly

18             Dr. W. S. Day on a Comparison of
mixed the stirring was stopped, and the inner box imme
diately closed. A micrometer reading of the mercury thread
on one of the thermometers was then taken quickly, the
telescope shifted quickly to the other thermometer, and a
reading taken of it. A second reading of both thermometers
was also taken. Of course the first readings were the most
reliable, but when there was no delay there was hardly ever
any appreciable change of temperature observed on reading
the second time, except sometimes at the extreme temperature
of 40°. The second reading was taken more as a check on
the first, to make sure there was no error in reading. Having
made this observation at a certain temperature, the inner
box was opened, the water stirred up again, and another
comparison made in the same way. This would be, of course,
at a slightly higher temperature. These readings at two
neighbouring temperatures were averaged and the average
regarded as one reading. When the temperature was higher
than that of the room, the only difference made was that
steam was passed into the heating-tube just before a reading
was taken.      The water was stirred, and the thermometers
were brought to the position in which they were read with a
rising meniscus, and not with a falling one. This was made
very sure by observing one of the thermometers through the
telescope while the heating - and stirring was going on.
Having made two observations at neighbouring temperatures,
the top of the tank was taken off, the Tonnelot thermometer
removed, and its zero determined.        The Tonnelot thermo
meter was then replaced, the top of the tank put on, the
water heated, and a comparison made in the same way at
the next temperature. It was not possible conveniently to
make comparisons at many points in one day. The intention
was therefore to take observations roughly at 10°, 20°, 30°,
and 40°. This was only approximately carried out, as it
sometimes became convenient, for a good many reasons, to
use temperatures intermediate to these.
                     7. CoMPARISONs MADE.
   A number of comparisons were made between the Tonnelot
thermometers taken in pairs, between the Tonnelot and
 Baudin thermometers, and between the Baudin thermometers.
The results of these comparisons are given in Tables W. and
VII. The comparisons may seem to be rather few in
number, but it was not thought worth while to make any
more, considering all the circumstances. It must be remem
 bered that the readings of the thermometers were made
 micrometrically, so that the errors in reading are exceedingly

      Rowland’s Thermometers with the Paris Standard.     19
small. Such large experimental errors as there are must be
probably in connexion with the position of the zero. Row
land always read his thermometers with the naked eye, and
although this was the only practicable way of using them

20              Dr. W. S. Day on a Comparison of
in his experiment, the fact must be considered in making any
comparisons between his thermometers and any others.
   Two comparisons were made between Tonnelot 11801 and
Tonnelot 11811, and three between Tonnelot 11800 and
Tonnelot 11811. In one of the latter comparisons, that of
21 April the thermometer 11811 became accidentally heated up
to 30° before a reading at 20° was taken, and for this reason, on
 account of the recovery of the zero being in progress while the
comparison was being made, it was thought probable that some
 irregularity would be shown. This proved to be the case,
 although it is not certain that the irregularity was due to the
 overheating. There were also other disturbing influences
 that made it seem probable at the time that the comparison
 would not be reliable. . The comparison, however, was re
 jected. In comparing the Tonnelot thermometers, they were
 always placed in ice for some hours before a comparison was
 begun, in case the first temperatures used were lower than
 the temperature to which the thermometer had been exposed
 for some time previously, so that the recovery of the zero
 might have a chance to proceed as far as possible before the
 comparisons were begun. The results of the comparisons of
 the Tonnelot thermometers with each other are given in
 Table W.

     The two comparisons of each pair seemed to agree so well
 that without taking any further time to make more comparisons,
 it was decided that they represented substantially the difference
 between the thermometers. From these comparisons smooth
 correction-curves were drawn, so that the readings of the
 thermometers 11800 and 11811 could be reduced to those
 of 1180). These corrections, however, are small, amountin
 in mos cases to only a few thousandths of a degree.

        Rowland’s Thermometers with the Paris Standard.                 23
 table of these corrections, deduced from the smooth curves,
 is given in Table VI., p. 20.
    Next a series of comparisons was made between each
 Tonnelot thermometer and each Baudin.              The results of these
 comparisons are given in Table VII., p. 21. The readings
 of the Tonnelot thermometers were reduced to the hydrogen
 Scale, applying all the corrections supplied by the International
 Bureau, and the corrections mentioned in the last paragraph,
required to reduce the readings to those of Tonnelot 11801.
Tonnelot 11801 was chosen for this purpose because it was
the one which had not been broken.                 Each of these com
parisons gave a correction-curve, the ordinates of which
represented the corrections that must be applied to the
readings of the Baudin thermometers, when reduced to the
absolute scale, to reduce them to the hydrogen scale, as
represented by the Tonnelot thermometers. From these
three     curves for each        Baudin      thermometer there        was
deduced an average correction-curve for each. The ordinates
of this final smooth curve for each Baudin thermometer
are given in Table VIII.              As there were three thermo

24            Dr. W. S. Day on a Comparison of
meters of each kind, there were nine possible comparisons.
These nine were all made, and finally an additional one on
26th April, 1897, between Tonnelot 11801 and Baudin
6163.       hen this was made, the Baudin thermometer had
not yet recovered its zero from a depression caused by frequent
use up to within six days of the time of the comparison. Its
correction-curve therefore differed from the others, but in
the way one would expect on account of this depression.
It was, however, rejected. The corrections given in Table VIII.
were finally used to calculate the changes to be made in
Rowland’s value of the mechanical equivalent to reduce it to
the Paris hydrogen scale.
    In order to get a further check on the comparisons, the
three Baudin thermometers were placed in the tank at the
same time, and compared together. Without going into
the details here, it may be said that these comparisons
verified the results, so far as it was possible, of the other
comparisons.
     8. CALCULATION OF THE EFFECT ON Rowland’s VALUE
          oF THE MECHANICAL EQUIVALENT OF HEAT.
    In order to estimate the effect of these corrections to the
 Baudin thermometers on the value of the mechanical equi
 valent of heat, the experiments made by Rowland with each
 thermometer were considered separately. Rowland has a
 table on p. 192 of his paper, giving the mechanical equivalent
 in kilogramme-metres at Baltimore, each value calculated from
 a rise of 10° in temperature, as deduced from each of his
 experiments. From this table the mean value of the
 mechanical equivalent at each temperature was calculated, as
 obtained by each thermometer separately. Rowland’s value
 was deduced from an equation of the form
                              J _W.
                                T 100
 where W is a certain number of ergs, found by experiment,
 required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water 10° C.
 J at 12°, for example, was calculated from the value of W in
 going from 7° to 17°C. That is
                          J12– W_
                                179–70'
 If C1, and Ci are the corrections found for the readings of
 the Baudin thermometer to reduce them to the hydrogen
 scale, these corrections applied to the value of Ji, will

     Rowland's Thermometers with the Paris Standard.                                 25
give the corrected value of Jis, which shall be called J'a.
This gives
         J',•=                      W                __W

   This conversion factor, Pig, was calculated similarly for
each degree of the scale where it was necessary, and for each
thermometer, and the corresponding value of J’ calculated.
Then, taking account of the number of observations on each
thermometer used in getting the average value of J, these
corrected values were averaged for each degree at which
observations were made. The resulting values are given in
Table IX. These values were plotted, and a smooth curve

                      witH THE PARIs NITRogeS THERMoMETER.
           Before the comparisons described here were made, one of
       Rowland's thermometers had already been compared indirectly
       with the Paris nitrogen thermometer. In the summer of

       Rowland's Thermometers with the Paris Standard.         27
1879, Joule himself made a comparison of Rowland's thermo
meter, Baudin 6166, with his own thermometer, and the
results were published by Rowland (Proc. Am. Acad. vol. xvi.
p. 38, 1880–81). In 1892–94, Schuster made a comparison
of Joule's thermometer with a Tonnelot that had              been
standardized at the International Bureau, and he reduced the
indications of the Joule thermometer to the Paris nitrogen
scale (Schuster, Phil. Mag. vol. xxxix. p. 477, 1895). These
two comparisons should give a means of reducing the
indications of Rowland's hermometer to the Paris nitrogen
or hydrogen scale.          The present writer has made an
examination of the comparisons of Schuster and of Joule,
and, by means of a     º        method, the results obtained by
 Schuster's indirect comparison were compared with those
 obtained from the present series. The curves drawn are
 shown in fig. 5.      The notation used is intended to be
 suggestive of the meaning of the curves.

     The ordinates of the curve marked TRA-TA, give the
  difference between the air-thermometer and the absolute scale,
 as used by Rowland. The ordinates of the curve Ts—Tu
  represent the difference between the nitrogen and the hydrogen
  scale, according to Chappuis. The ordinates of the curve
 Ta-Taº, which is not shown in fig. 5, represent the difference
  between the hydrogen scale and Rowland's absolute scale

 28      Rowland's Thermometers and the Paris Standard.
 according to Baudin 6166, as given by the present series of
 comparisons (see Table VIII.). In order to get the ordinates
 of the curve (TN—TRA)t, which represents the difference
 between the Paris nitrogen scale and Rowland’s air-thermo
 meter scale according to Baudin 6166 and the Tonnelot
 thermometers, the ordinates of the curves were added, as
 represented by the following equation :-
        (Th -TA, )— (TRA-Taus) + (TN –TH) =(TN— TRA) T.
     In a similar manner the curve T-TRA is the smooth curve
 which represents approximately the differences found by
 Joule between his thermometer and Rowland's air-thermo
 meter, according to Baudin 6166. The curve T —Ts, which
is a straight line, is taken to represent the difference between
Joule's thermometer and the Paris nitrogen thermometer,
according to the comparisons of Schuster. Schuster does not
give this curve, but merely its slope. If the points found by
#.line
       experiments are plotted on section-paper, the straight
                  (T-Ts)=0°.0024 Ts-0°009,
which has the slope he gives, seems most nearly to represent
the average of the points. The final curve (TN—Tax), is
found by subtracting ordinates as represented by the equation
               (T1-TRA) — (T, —TN)=(TN-TRA).
As shown in fig. 5, this curve is not very unlike the curve
 (TN—TRA).T. The maxima are near 20° in both, and the
difference between the two is about 0°-01, which is not very
great in view of the ignorance as to how Joule made his
comparisons, and the chances of a weak point in so long
a chain.
                         10. CONCLUSION.
    These comparisons do not explain the discrepancy between
Rowland's value of the mechanical equivalent of heat and
the higher values found by recent experimenters using
electrical methods. They seem to show, however, that the
discrepancy is not one of thermometry. It is probable,
therefore, that it is due to some error in the measurement of
energy in Rowland’s experiments, or to a similar error in the
electrical experiments. In Griffiths’ measurement of electrical
energy expended in heat, the square of the electromotive
force enters as a factor in the value of J. This makes any
error in the measurement of this quantity have double the

       On the Conductivity of the Hot Gases from Flames.     29
 effect on the value obtained for J.   An error in the standard
 of electromotive force of about I'o per cent. would therefore
 suffice to account for the entire difference between Rowland’s
 results and Griffiths’.
    The most interesting result of the present comparisons is
that Rowland’s corrected curve shows the same rate of change
in the specific heat of water with the temperature between
15° and 25° that Griffiths' does, as can be seen at a glance by
an inspection of the curves as drawn in fig. 4. This fact also
suggests the possibility of the difference being due to an
error in the standards used, rather than in the experiments
themselves.
   A short abstract of the results of these comparisons was
published in the Johns Hopkins University Circular for June
1897, giving the corrected values of the mechanical equi
valent of heat. There was a slight error in the values as
published, owing to the use of an incorrect method of reducing
the readings of Rowland’s Baudin thermometers. The error
was not discovered until after the abstract had been published.
This incorrect abstract was reproduced in the Philosophical
Magazine for August 1897.
     he author wishes to express his appreciation of Professor
Rowland's kindness in allowing the use of his thermometers
for these comparisons, and his obligation to Professor Rowland
and Professor Ames for their frequent aid and advice in the
course of the work.
   Although the general plan of the apparatus described here
is the author's, he wishes to express his deep sense of obliga
tion to Dr. W. T. Mather, at that time Fellow of Johns
Hopkins University, for his aid at almost every step in the
mechanical details of its design and construction.
II. On the Conductivity of the Hot Gases from Flames.
   By J. A. McCLELLAND, M.A., Cavendish Laboratory,
   Cambridge *.
   T is well known that a charged body loses its charge when
      a flame is brought near it, even if there is not actual
contact with the flame but only with the hot gases coming
from it.
   The subject of the conductivity of flames has been studied
by many experimenters, and an account of their results is
given in Wiedemann's Lehre von der Elecktricität, vol. 4B,
and in a later paper by Arrhenius (Wied. Ann. xlii. 1891).
    In the following paper the nature of the conductivity not
               * Communicated by Prof. J. J. Thomson.

30        Mr. J. A. McClelland on the Conductivity of
in the flame itself but in the gases taken from the flame has
been investigated : here the conditions are simpler and the
nature of the electrodes used is not so important. For
papers on this part of the subject see Giese, Wied. Ann. xvii.
1882, xxxviii. 1889.
   The method used in the experiments is simple; the gas is
drawn along a brass tube inside which is placed an insulated
terminal which can be raised to any required potential, and
the conductivity of the gas passing this terminal is measured
by the rate of fall of potential of the terminal as given by an
electrometer. For experiments on conductivity inside a
flame a sensitive galvanometer may be used, but when one is
dealing with the conducting gas drawn from the flame the
conductivity is too small to permit the use of a galvanometer.
The electrometer method enables us to work with the gas at
distances from the flame convenient for the experiments.
          1. The Relation between the Current and the
                      Electromotive Force.
   To determine the manner in which the current through
the conducting gas depends on the E.M.F., the arrangement
in fig. 1 was used. A is a metal tube 3.7 cm. in diameter
                              Fig. 1.
             EARTH
                        FLAME
with a funnel attached to it.    Beneath this funnel an ordinary
rose bunsen-burner is placed and regulated to give a steady
flame. The products of combustion pass up the tube A with
a velocity constant at each point as soon as the tube has
attained a steady temperature, and the bunsen-burner is
large enough to ensure that the stream of conducting gas is
as nearly as possible the same at all points in a horizontal
section of the tube.    B is a brass rod 10 cm. long and 5 cm.
diameter, placed in the axis of A and insulated by an ebonite
plug C. It is connected to one pair of º of an
electrometer E.    A is connected to earth, and the two pairs

 Ohm’s law, but that the current tends to a maximum value
which is not increased when the E.M.F. is further increased.
   This is the form of curve we should expect to get if we
regard the conductivity of the gas as due to its ionization
in the flame, so that we have a number of positively and
negatively charged ions in the gas passing the electrode B.
If the terminal B be positive, then the negatively charged
carriers are deflected to it and give up their charge, causing
the observed leakage of the charge from B.        If we suppose
that one of these carriers of electricity moves with a velocity
of v centimetres per second under an electromotive force of
1 volt per centimetre, and that the stream of carriers takes a
time t to pass along the length of the electrode B, the carriers
inside a radius p will be discharged to B, where p is given by

   Therefore if q be the º          carried by the carriers of one

   The current is therefore proportional to the E.M.F. until
p=ri (the radius of A), when all the carriers are discharged
to B.
   We have neglected in this calculation the rate at which
the positive and negative carriers are recombining; as we go
up the tube the recombination diminishes the conductivity, so
that a large E.M.F., by discharging the carriers sooner to B
increases slightly the current, so that, the curves do not
become perfectly flat at the point where the E.M.F. is
sufficient to discharge all the carriers before they pass the
electrode.
   In curve II. the maximum current is reached for a smaller
E.M.F. than in I., because the velocity of the stream is less
and the carriers take a longer time to pass the electrode.

 maximum value of the current has been reached for an

34       Mr. J. A. McClelland on the Conductivity of
we raise the potential of B the leak from C diminishes until,
when the potential of B is high enough to give the maximum
leak from it, we get no leakage from C. All the carriers
have been discharged before they pass B, and the gas above
it possesses no conductivity. The maximum rate of leak
from B is the same whether it is charged positively or nega
 tively, showing that equal amounts of positive and negative
electricity are carried by the ions.
    We can calculate the amount of electricity on the carriers
of one sign per unit volume of the gas from the flame. A
terminal placed in the axis of a cylinder through which the
 gas was moving and joined to a capacity (including that of
 the quadrants of the electrometer) of 280 C.G.S. units fell in
 potential at the rate of 5 volts per second, which corresponds
 to ; electrostatic units of charge per second. We know that
 the gas in a cross-section of 3 sq. cm. around the terminal
 was discharged, and the velocity of the stream of gas past the
 terminal was 130 cm. per second, so that the charge per unit
 volume was , electrostatic unit.       If each carrier has the
 atomic charge, the number in unit volume is of the order
 109. Or the ratio of the number of charged carriers to the
 number of molecules is of the order 10-14.       These numbers
 refer to the conducting gas at a point about 17 cm. from the
 flame; closer to the flame the number of dissociated atoms is,
 of course, much greater, and the number falls away rapidly
 as the gas moves away further from the flame.
                  2. Recombination of the Ions.
    We can measure the rate at which the positive and nega
 tive ions recombine by determining the conductivity of the
 gas at different times after it is drawn away from the flame.
 To do this, the gas from the flame passes up a cylindrical
tube which is connected to earth, and an insulated metal rod
is lowered into the tube from the top and placed in its axis.
 This rod is connected to a pair of quadrants of an electrometer,
and charged to a potential high enough to ensure that all the
 carriers are discharged in a short distance after reaching the
lower end of the rod. By lowering the rod further and
further into the tube, and measuring the rate of leak in each
 position, we get the conductivity at different distances from
the flame. By measuring the temperature at different points
 of the tube, and therefore knowing the relative velocities of
the current of gas at these points, we can express the con
 ductivity of the gas in terms of the time since it left the
flame. The following table shows the result of an experi
ment :—

    Curve IV, a is plotted from the above numbers, and shows

    The rate at which the conductivity falls away evidently
  diminishes with the conductivity. If n be the number of
  ions per unit volume at any time, and if we assume that

  get the curve b.

36       Mr. J. A. McClelland on the Conductivity of
   The two curves agree approximately, which would show
that the rate of recombination of the ions is proportional to
the square of the number present in the dissociated gas. We
should expect the conductivity to fall off in this way, as the
number of collisions between positive and negative carriers
will be proportional to the square of the number present, and
each collision means a definite loss of conductivity. The
curve a must diverge considerably from the curve b nearer to
the flame, since b if continued back would give an infinite
conductivity before the flame is reached. The rate of recom
bination closer to the flame would not seem to be as rapid as
it should be if it continued to be proportional to the square
of the number of ions.
   In the experiment from which the above curve is drawn
the absolute velocity of the current of gas up the tube was
not determined, so that the time is only expressed in arbitrary
units. In another experiment, however, where a wider tube
was being used, and the velocity of the current up it was
measured by a wind-gauge and found to be 130 cm. per
second, the conductivity fell to half its value between two
points 17 cm. and 27 cm. distant from the flame. The con
ductivity thus fell to half its value in <U+017F>º of a second. Of
course the rate of loss of conductivity rapidly diminishes with
the conductivity, so that for electrometer determinations it is
quite convenient to work with the gas more than 1 second
after it has been drawn away from the flame.
     3. Velocity of Carriers under an Electromotive Force.
    We can easily determine the velocity with which the
positively and negatively charged ions travel under an electric
 force. The apparatus shown in fig. 5 was used.
    A is a cylindrical tube '85 cm. radius, with two terminals
 B and C placed one above the other in the axis of the tube—
each 6-5 cm. long and 2 cm. radius. These terminals are
insulated and supported by ebonite plugs. To prevent the
insulation of the ebonite being spoiled by moisture depositing
on its surface, it is convenient to shape the ebonite as shown
in the figure, so that the insulating surface is not exposed
directly to the current of the gas.
    A piece of tubing T. leads from A to an ordinary water
 pump P connected to the water-mains. The pump is con
 nected by a glass tube as shown with a large glass vessel V,
 which is fitted with the two tubes a and b–a just passing
 through the cork, and b going to the bottom of V. The
 water and air from the pump enter by c, and the tap in a
 can easily be set so that the vessel remains about half full of

                    the Hot Gases from Flames.                  37
water, the water escaping by b and the air by a. It is kept
so during an experiment; then by closing a, and taking the
time in which the level of the water in V sinks through a
                                 Fig. 5.
                                                    CELLS
short distance, and knowing the cross-section of V, we get
the volume of air drawn through A in a given time. Knowing
the cross-section of A, and also the temperature inside it at
any point, we get the velocity of the current of gas through
A at that point. The temperature is determined by pulling
out the plug of ebonite and inserting a thermometer.
   A is connected to earth and C is charged by storage-cells,
and the rate of leak measured as described previously. C is
charged sufficiently high to ensure that the gas is completely
discharged in passing it. The rate of leak of C is thus
determined (1) when B is connected to earth, (2) when B is
charged to such a potential that the rate of leak from C is
about halved.      These two determinations enable us to calcu
 late the velocity of the carriers. The carriers of opposite sign
to B in a part of the cross-section of the tube are discharged
to B; the area thus discharged is given, as we have seen
above, by

38        Mr. J. A. McClelland on the Conductivity of
when B is to earth, and when it is charged to potential V;
t is equal to the length of the terminal B divided by the
velocity of the current past it which we measure. . The
velocity v of the carrier under an electric force of 1 volt per
centimetre is therefore given by the above equation.
    In practice W is made such as to diminish the rate of leak
from C by about one half. . We can check, the value of r
thus calculated by finding what value of V is just sufficient to
give no conductivity at É.
    This method gave the velocity of the carrier,
                         ’2 cm. per second,
 under a potential gradient of one volt per centimetre. A
 large number of experiments were made, and the results of
 different determinations agreed to less than 10 per cent. The
 velocity of the stream past the terminal B was varied between
 15 and 30 cm. per second in the different determinations, and
 the potential of B varied from 1 to 4 volts.
     Another set of determinations of the velocity of the carrier
 was made with a large cylindrical tube of 4 cm. radius, in
 which were placed two terminals, B and C (as in the previous
 case), the lower one (B) being 43 cm. iong and 4 cm. radius.
 This tube was placed above the flame, and the velocity of the
 stream of gas up it was measured with a wind-gauge which
 fitted into the tube. A determination with the apparatus
 gave the following numbers:—                             -
     Leakage from C :
      200 divisions in 11 seconds when B is at zero potential,
      200 ,         ,, 18 ,         when B is at 40 volts potential.
     The velocity of the stream past the terminal B was 122 cm.
 per second.
     This gives the velocity of the carrier to be
                        "22 cm. per second.
     The determinations with the two sets of apparatus agreed
  as closely as could be expected from the nature of the
  experiments.
     All the above determinations of velocity of the carrier
  were made in the gas soon after leaving the flame and when
  its temperature was about 200°C.           his is important, as
 appears from some work later on.
      his velocity is much less than that found for the carrier of
 electricity in the case of a gas which has been exposed to
  Röntgen rays. (See Rutherford, Phil. Mag. Nov. 1897.)
     If we regard the charge on the carrier as unalterable, we

must assume that in our case the charged carrier has joined
on to it a number of uncharged particles which increase
its mass without increasing the charge, thus lowering its
velocity under an electric force. We have not data enough
to determine the size of the carrier even if we assume that it
carries the atomic charge, as the carrier is so small that the
equations of viscous motion do not apply.

    4. Difference of Velocity between Positive and Negative
                             Carriers.
   As we have seen, the above method of determining the
velocity of the carrier under an electric force gave results
which did not vary in a number of determinations by more
than 10 per cent.
   These determinations seemed to point to a difference in the
velocity of the positive and negative carriers; and a large
number of experiments were made to settle the point.
   The velocities of the positive and negative carriers were
determined alternately a number of times by charging the
terminals alternately
described above.
                        º          and positively in the method
                      As the method involves the ratio of two
rates of leak in the same direction in determining each
velocity, any want of symmetry in the deflexions of the
electrometer is eliminated.       The results showed that the
velocity of the negative carrier was about 15 per cent. greater
than that of the positive carrier.
   The following experiment would be easily explained by the
negative carrier having a greater velocity than the positive.
The gas from the flame is drawn up a tube A connected to
earth, and through a metal box B which is insulated and filled
with a loose plug of glass wool. B is joined to a pair of
quadrants of an electrometer, the other pair being to earth.
 In the tube is a terminal C, which can be joined to one pole
of an alternating circuit, the other pole being earthed. The
positive and negative carriers, passing through the glass wool,
 give up their charge to it.
   When C is to earth the box B gets a small negative charge;
 we always do get a small negative charge from the gas from
 a Bunsen flame. (Kelvin, “Nature, April 22nd, 1897.)
   When now the terminal C is joined to the alternating
 E.M.F., if the negative carriers move faster than the positive,
 and the intensity and frequency of the E.M.F. be such that
 not all the carriers of both signs are discharged, we get more
 negative carriers discharged than positive, and the box B gets
 an excess of positive.

40        Mr. J. A. McClelland on the Conductivity of
   In the experiment the electrometer showed a positive
charge rising rapidly to a value at which it remained
constant.    This was because the conducting gas         i.".
caused a discharge to A, and equilibrium was produced when
the discharge was equal to the gain of positive electricity
from the carriers.

   This experiment is difficult to explain except on the theory
that the negative carrier moves faster than the positive under
the same force. As the charges of the positive and negative
carriers are probably the same, the positive carrier must have
more uncharged particles attached to it.
            5. Change in the Velocity of the Carrier.
   In all the experiments described above on the velocity
with which the carrier moves under an electric force, the
experiments were made on the gas at a short interval after it
left the flame and when its temperature was always well over
100° C. Further experiments showed that this velocity does
not remain constant, but falls away rapidly when the gas
has cooled down at a distance from the flame. The gas is
drawn up a tube with a number of terminals placed along
this axis at different distances from the flame, so that the
velocity of the carrier can be determined at each of these
points. Knowing the velocity of the current of gas up the
tube, we know the time which has elapsed since it left
the flame; and the temperature can be . by inserting
thermometers.                                           -

                       the Hot Gases from Flames.                        41
   The following table shows the result of an experiment:—

                                                      to          flame.

  At terminal C ......   •04     ,       105          1            14.5
   Evidently for some distance from the flame the velocity of
the carrier was very little altered, and then began to rapidly
diminish. This diminution of velocity seems to depend prin
cipally on the cooling of the gas, and would point to a rapid
condensation on the charged carrier of some uncharged body
greatly increasing its mass.
   To test whether a similar falling away of the velocity would
occur in the case of a flame which burns without the production
of water-vapour, a CO flame was tried; and a similar dimi
nution of velocity was found.
   The velocity of the carrier in the CO flame was found to be
                               "16 cm. per second,
under an electric force of 1 volt per cm., and at a distance of
30 cm. from the flame, where the temperature was 55°, this
velocity had fallen to
                              '03 cm. per second.
    Some other experiments are in progress to investigate more
fully this falling away of the velocity of the carrier.
                6. Discharging Power of Fine Gauze.
    When the velocity of the carrier under an electric force has
 diminished at a distance from the flame, it can pass through
 gauze without being discharged much easier than if the gauze
 is placed closer to the flame.
    In one experiment a charged terminal placed in the tube, at
 a distance of about 35 cm. from the flame, leaked at the rate of
 50 scale-divisions in 30 sec. One layer of fine gauze placed
 in the tube just below this terminal, and therefore at a point
 where the velocity of the carrier was small, scarcely diminished
 the rate of leak. The same gauze when placed 10 cm. from
 the flame reduced the leak from the same terminal to 50 divi
 sions in 75 seconds.

  42                  Prof. R. A. Lehfeldt on the
      This means even a greater difference in the discharging
   power of the gauze in the two positions than the above
   numbers indicate, because in the second position the loss of
  conductivity by recombination while passing up the tube is
   less than in the first case.
      The difference in the discharging-power of the gauze is
   explained by the fact that when the carrier has a smaller
   velocity under an electric force fewer of the carriers come
   into contact with the gauze by diffusion. It can be shown
   that for such a gas, when enclosed between parallel planes or
   in a cylinder, the ratio of conductivity at time t to the initial
   conductivity varies as e-", where r is the velocity of the
   carrier under 1 volt per cm. (See Townsend, Phil Mag.
   May 1898) Hence we see that when r is smaller fewer of
  the carriers are discharged by diffusion as the gas comes up
   to the gauze and passes through the meshes.
      In conclusion, I wish to thank Prof. Thomson for his
  valuable criticisms and suggestions.
  III. On the Properties of Liquid Mirtures. – Part II. By R. A.
      LEHFELDT, Professor of Physics at the E. London Technical
      College”.              -
   IN     a previous article (Phil. Mag. (5) vol. xl. p. 398) an
         attempt was made to follow out the consequences of a
  certain thermodynamic relation between the composition of a
  liquid mixture, and that of the vapour in equilibrium with it,
  and the saturation pressure of the system. Experiments
  were there described on mixtures of benzene with ethyl and
   methyl acetates in which a small fraction of each mixture was
-
  distilled, as nearly as possible at a constant temperature, and
   the distillate analysed ; these led to an empirical expression
   connecting the composition of liquid and vapour. Experi
   ments were afterwards made to determine the vapour-pressure
   of similar mixtures by the dynamic method, but they led to
   unsatisfactory results owing to decomposition of the esters
   on prolonged boiling. I was able to resume the work in
   1897, and then chose more stable compounds to work on,
   viz., benzene and toluene mixed with carbon tetrachloride, as
   types of normal organic compounds, and benzene and toluene
   mixed with ethyl alcohol, as type of a so-called “associated "
   liquid. The experiments to be described here were carried
   out at the Davy-Faraday laboratory, which the managers of
   the Royal Institution very obligingly placed at my service.
      * Communicated by the Physical Society: read March 11, 1898.

                  Properties of Liquid Mictures.               43
    Two other papers on the same subject, which appeared
about the same time as my earlier one, call for some notice.
These are by C. E. Linebarger (Journ. of Amer. Chem. Soc.
vol. xvii.) and by M. Margules (Wien. Ber. vol. civ.).
    Linebarger made measurements of the vapour-pressures of
certain liquid mixtures, and of the way in which the two
components shared the pressure between them. He did not
attempt to relate his results to the deductions of thermo
dynamics, but merely to obtain empirical generalizations.
The method he adopted is at first sight a very promising one,
as it allows of the determination of both total and partial
 pressures in the same experiment; it consisted in drawing a
 measured volume of air through the liquid mixture, and
 analysing by combustion the vapour which the air carried
 away with it. The method has been applied successfully to
 find the vapour-pressure of aqueous solutions of low volatility,
 but it is not so suitable to the present case, as in Linebarger's
 experiments the vapour-pressure was sometimes as high as
 300 mm., and the inaccuracies of it appear to increase out of
  º           to the pressure to be measured. Linebarger tested
  his apparatus by preliminary measurements of pure liquids:
  finding for instance, for ethyl iodide 199 mm. against Reg
 mault’s 206, and for chloroform 290-1 against 301:1. This
  he calls a “most excellent correspondence.” I tried the
  method before reading the account of his results, and found
  similar discrepancies of one or two per cent., so that it can
  evidently not be regarded as satisfactorily worked out as yet.
  It has also the disadvantage of being so slow that it is
  impossible to get numerous data. I have, therefore, pre
  ferred to revert to the better known methods, and nearly
  all the observations mentioned below were taken by the
  “dynamic ’’ method.
       inebarger gives an empirical result which may be con
  sidered along with the observations contained in this paper :
  that strictly normal liquids, such as benzene and toluene,
   have in mixtures a partial pressure simply proportional to the
   molecular percentage of them present in the liquid. It is
   important, as on it Linebarger bases a rule for determining
   the molecular complexity of liquids. To this point we shall
   have to revert.
      Margules's paper consists only of deductions from the pre
   vious experiments of others; but it includes a theorem given
   in my paper (loc. cit.) as well as several others; and in an
   appendix mentions that all these results have been forestalled
   in the very systematic thermodynamical studies of Duhem—

 44               Prof. R. A. Lehfeldt on the
a fact, which I also had overlooked.       Margules's chief new
contribution is, therefore, the empirical formula he proposes
for the relation between composition of liquid and vapour, as
will be mentioned below.
              Measurements of Vapour-Pressure.
   The measurements made form two distinct groups, those of
vapour-pressure and those of composition of vapour, which
were carried out separately, but on material from the same
source, and prepared in identical manner. The materials
were as follows:–
   Benzene.—Kahlbaum's thiophene-free : its boiling-point
was nearly constant, but it was fractionated twice from calcium
chloride, and then stood over sodium. B.p. (corrected and
reduced to 760 mm.)=80°0.            Vapour-pressure at 50°=
210.9 mm. Density =0.8803. A. at 18–13024 by
spectrometer.
    Toluene.—Baird and Tatlock's purest. Fractionated from
calcium chloride and stood over sodium. B.p. (corr. and red.)
= 110°0. Vapour-pressure at 50°=93.0 mm.            Density    º
=0.8667. A. at 18°=14970.
   Carbon Tetrachloride. — Baird and Tatlock. Slightly
yellow when obtained ; on fractional distillation it became
colourless, and on redistilling the best fraction nearly the
whole came over within 0°1. B.p. 76°-6 (corr. and red.).
Vapour-pressure at 50°=310.2 mm. Density           *=    1:5979.
a, at 18°=1:46.18.
   Ethyl Alcohol.—Baird and Tatlock’s “absolute.”      Digested
on a water-bath with lime and baryta till a yellow colour
appeared ; then distilled with special care to avoid moisture.
B.p. (corr. and red.)=78°3. Vapour-pressure at 50°=219.5
mm. Density     *=0.1929.       pºp at 18°= 13622.
   The density is not so low as it should be according to
Mendeléef; but it is probable that if a purer alcohol had been
obtained it would have absorbed some moisture in the course
of the inevitable manipulation of the mixtures.      Distillation
from sodium was also tried, but did not give any better
results.
   To measure the vapour-pressure of the mixtures, the
dynamic method was adopted. The most interesting part of

                   Properties of Liquid Mirtures.            45
the apparatus is shown in the accompanying sketch (fig. 1);
it consists of a boiling-tube A about 15 cm. x 3, closed at the
top by a cork with two holes. ...Through one passed the ther
mometer—a short one with milk glass scale 40° to 60° in , ;
its bulb was surrounded with a little
cotton-wool, and an end of the wool                Fig. 1.
hung down into the liquid, so that the            -N
 bulb was always moist; if that is the            B
 case, and the stem does not touch the side
 of the boiling-tube, the readings are very             \–
 trustworthy. Through the cork there
 passed also a tube B, about 9 mm. wide,
 surrounded by a short condenser, bent
 at right angles above, and leading to (1)
 a mercury manometer, (2) a T-piece, of
 which the vertical limb passed into a
 winchester, serving as a reservoir of air,
 and containing a little strong sulphuric
 acid; and the further limb a glass tap.
 The necks of the boiling-tube and of the
 winchester were surrounded by a short
 piece of wide rubber tubing each, and
 the corks drowned in mercury; the only
  other joints in the apparatus were the two
  rubber tubing joints of the manometer
 and the glass tap ; it could be made ab
 solutely air-tight without trouble. On
 the far side of the glass tap was placed a
  T-piece leading to a hand air-pump on
  one side, and on the other into the atmo
  sphere, through a long capillary glass tube which served to
  reduce the flow of air : the pressure in the apparatus could
  thus be adjusted with any degree of nicety. The boiling-tube
  contained about 10 to 15 grams of liquid mixture, previously
  made up by weighing, and a piece of pumice-stone weighted
  with copper wire, to make the ebullition steady ; although the
  thermometer was surrounded by vapour, its readings were
  never constant unless the liquid was boiling freely. Heat
  Was *. by means of a water-bath, consisting of a two
  litre beaker, heated over a sand-tray, with a small flame;
  this was provided with a stirrer and thermometer, and kept
  three or four degrees above the temperature at which the
  mixture boiled.
     An experiment consisted in weighing out a mixture, taking
  its refractive index by the Pulfric    º placing in
  the boiling-tube, and after adjusting temperature and pres

 46                 Prof. R. A. Lehfeldt on the
 sures, taking eight observations at temperatures rising from
 45° to 55°, and then falling to 45° again, and taking the
 refractive index of the residue : the refractive index was
 throughout used as a means of analysis (as in the previous
 paper, J. v.), and it showed that no appreciable change of
 composition took place during the experiments.
    The instruments used were the following:—(i.) A catheto
 meter (by Fuess) to read the manobarometer with. Its scale
 was taken as correct; and since readings were only taken to
 one-tenth of a millimetre, no difficulty was encountered.
 Pressures were in all cases corrected for temperature of the
 mercury, and reduced to sea-level in lat. 45°.
    (ii.) Five thermometers, of which the most important were
 “A” of range 40° to 60° in , used for the boiling-tube, and
 “B” of range —5° to +35° in , used for the refractometer,
 both by C. E. Müller. Their errors, which were very small,
 were determined by comparison with the standards of the
 Reichsanstalt, nos. 7346 and 7347, belonging to the Davy
 Faraday laboratory.
    (iii.) Pulfrich refractometer of the old pattern (by Max
 Wolz).     Measurements of the refractive indices of alcohol
 (1.36), carbon tetrachloride (1:46), and benzene (1.50) were
taken by it and a small Schmidt and Haensch spectrometer.
The values given by Pulfrich's table were thus found to be
too low by 0.00620 for alcohol, 0-00613 for carbon tetra
chloride, and 000615 for benzene. Accordingly 0.0062 was
added to the number from the table in each case.      Measure
ments of the refractive index of the mixtures were always
taken as near to 18° as possible (though unfortunately in the
summer the room rose frequently to 21°): the temperature
coefficients were interpolated from the known coefficients of
the pure substances (this involves very little error as the
coefficients only vary from 0-00040 for alcohol to 0.00064
for benzene), and the readings reduced to the standard
temperature.
   An accuracy of the order 1 in 1000 was aimed at in the
various measurements; but of course the final results are
hardly reliable to that extent. To take a typical case, the
saturation-pressure to be measured might be about 250 mm.:
there is of course no difficulty whatever in reading the height
of the mercury-column to one thousandth of that (3 mm.).
The corresponding temperature needs to be known to about
alo degree, since 19 would make about 10 mm. difference in
pressure. The thermometer was read to º, by eye with
certainty; and when the apparatus was in good working order,
it kept constant to that extent. Again, to change the vapour

pressure by Tºro (temperature constant) would need a change
usually as great as who or more in the composition; this
would correspond to about 2' of arc on the refractometer—a
quantity very easily observed. The composition of the
mixture might alter by escape of the vapour past the con
denser; this would be discovered by a comparison of the
refractive index before and after the boiling—as a matter of
fact, the change rarely exceeded 2'; further, it would neces
sarily alter as some of the substance was present in the form
of vapour, but the weight of vapour in the apparatus could not
have exceeded 2km of the weight of liquid, and as the com
 position of the vapour is never 30 per cent. different from that
of the liquid, the evaporation of that quantity could not alter
the composition of the remainder more than about sho. The
 degree of accuracy thus anticipated appears to have been
 realized except in a few unfavourable cases, as will be seen
 from the following observation, which is given as a spe
 cimen, and to show the mode of reduction adopted.

in the tables below. I have only been able to find one earlier
observation on the same mixtures: from Regnault's experi
 ments * on mixtures of alcohol and benzene at higher and
 lower temperatures one finds by interpolation pro-391 mm.
 for a mixture in equal volumes of the liquids, whilst the value
 from my curve is 393 mm. It is satisfactory to find this
 confirmation, slight as it is, because the alcohol mixtures are
 the least certain, on account of the inevitable presence of
 traces of water.
     The difference between the alcohol curves and those of the
 normal liquids is most marked; for while mixtures of carbon
 tetrachloride and benzene, or carbon tetrachloride and toluene,
 have a vapour-pressure never very different to that which
 would be obtained by interpolation from the pressures of the

pure substances, both mixtures containing alcohol show a
maximum—a very flat one. In the case of alcohol and benzene
it occurs at about 40 per cent. (molecular) of alcohol, and is
406 mm., being 406/(271+220) = 83 per cent. of the sum of
the pressures of the pure substances; while for alcohol and
toluene it is at about 74 per cent of alcohol, and has the value
249 mm., which is 249/(93+220)=80 per cent. of the sum
of the pressures.                                                  -
   With regard to the variation of pressure with temperature,
we may, as already remarked, regard log p as linear in tower
a few degrees. But the value of O(log p)/ot for the pure
substances varies somewhat ; this is partly due to the fact that
50° is a different fraction of the critical temperature in each
case; it diminishes as the “reduced " temperature rises, and
consequently has a higher value for toluene at 50° than for
benzene or carbon tetrachloride at the same temperature.
Alcohol, though its critical point is the lowest of the four,
has the highest value of the coefficient—a marked instance of
its exceptional behaviour. The numbers are :—
                                                   O(log p)/Öt.

   The coefficients found for the mixtures are necessarily (on
account of the small range of temperature) less reliable than
the vapour-pressures themselves: they are in all cases nearly
those that would be calculated by interpolation from the coeffi
cients of the pure substances, even when the vapour-pressure
curve shows a maximum, i. e. they are additive. The differ
ences from the additive values are not greater than the
probable errors of experiment. I have included the values of
the coefficients in the tables, but lay no stress on them.

   The method used was essentially the same as that described
in the previous paper, to distil a little of a mixture and
analyse the distillate. The apparatus was, however, arranged
so that the distillate could be drawn off by a tap as required ;
it is shown in fig. 3. It consisted of a boiling-tube, fitted
 and heated as before ; but with the delivery-tube E E bent
 round to a condenser F. The condenser was provided with a
 tap G for drawing off the distillate, and a tube which con
 nected to the pressure-gauge, reservoir, and air-pump arranged
 as before. The condenser was designed so as to permit of
 the use of a freezing-mixture in the bell-jar J by which it
 was surrounded; a good many experiments showed, however,
 that it made no difference to the result whether ice and salt
 or only cold water was used in J.; so water was used for
 greater convenience. To make the apparatus air-tight, a
crucible full of mercury was placed round G, since obviously
it was not permissible to lubricate that tap. It is essential to
the success of the experiment that no back-condensation
should occur, but that the vapour should be collected exactly
in the condition it is produced ; so the delivery-tube before
the bend must be at least 50°, if the evaporation is taking
place at that temperature. This condition was secured by a
very simple device : an incandescent lamp with the ordinary
conical shade was lowered as close as possible over the water
bath, and a cloth hung round the whole ; the electrical
                                E 2

52                   Prof. R. A. Lehfeldt on the
heating was then sufficient to keep the top of the apparatus
at least as hot as the small flame kept the bottom, and at the
same time provided an excellent light to read the thermo
meters by. About 30 c.c. of mixture was placed in the
tube ; the temperature of the bath adjusted to between 51°
and 52°, and then the pressure lowered till the liquid boiled
tranquilly at as near as possible 50°; as the distillation pro
ceeded, the thermometer of course tended to rise ; this was
corrected by an occasional stroke of the pump as required.
Three lots of about 1 c.c. each were usually distilled, and
examined separately by the Pulfrich refractometer; from 5
to 10 minutes being required to distil 1 c.c.
    In order to interpret the results it was first needful to
 construct tables of the refractive index of the mixtures used ;
 the refractive index is far from additive in any of the four
 cases, and cannot be satisfactorily expressed by the parabolic
 formula used in Part I. for mixtures of benzene with methyl
 and ethyl acetates; it is therefore worth while to record the
 results by a short extract from the tables used, which were
 themselves derived from a smoothed curve based on experi
 ment.

    It is difficult to say what is the degree of accuracy of these
 results, but certainly less than the accuracy of the vapour
 pressure measurements, chiefly because some of the condensed
 vapour clings to the condensing-tube, and it is not certain
 that what is collected quite fairly represents the whole.
    These results are also expressed by the curves on fig. 4.
 Considering first, then, two pairs of normal liquids, we see
 that the relation log t-log k + r log q, where k and r are
 constants, satisfactorily represents fié phenomena. That is
 the relation proposed in the previous paper for mixtures of
 benzene with methyl and ethyl acetates, and in all these cases
 it appears to be correct within the limits of error of experi
 ment. But Margules has quite rightly pointed out (loc. cit.
 p. 1266) that when r < 1 (as it usually             i.   the equation leads
 to infinite values of op<U+017F>o; when g- 0 or {= 1, i.e., the
 vapour-pressure curve would start and end vertically. That
 deduction I had overlooked, and it is obvious from the curves
 on fig. 2 that the vapour-pressure curve does not behave
in that way. The relation given cannot therefore hold

     throughout; still the experiments show it to be a remarkably
     good empirical rule for mixtures which do not contain a very
    small proportion of either component, extending in the case of
    carbon tetrachloride-benzene mixtures from 8 to 91 per cent.

        These relations are intended as a solution of the differential
    equation (11) in the foregoing paper. , Margules proposes
    a more complicated solution, which satisfies the condition that
    for dilute solutions the lowering of the vapour-pressure of the
    other component (the solvent) should be normal, i.e. according
    to van 't Hoff and Raoult's rule. It is doubtless possible to
    represent the experimental results that way by , using a
    sufficient number of arbitrary constants; but I have not
    thought it worth while to do so, as it is complicated, and
    seems to go rather beyond what the experimental data justify.

   With regard to the other mixtures, alcohol with benzene
and toluene, the diagram shows the relations between log f and
log q to be very far from linear. I have not attempted to
find an equation to these curves, and will only make one or
two remarks as to their character. They are not drawn
directly from the experimental results on the composition of
the distillate, because when the percentage of alcohol is very
great or very small the observations lose considerably in
accuracy; but on calculating the partial pressures, from the
observed composition of the vapour, and the total pressure,
smoothed curves could be drawn, the reliability of which is
enhanced by the fact that their end points (vapour-pressure
of the pure substances) are fixed. From these smoothed
curves of partial pressure the compositions were calculated
afresh, and it is the numbers so obtained that are represented
by the curves on fig. 4. The crosses on that figure stand
for the immediate results of observation, and it will be
noticed that they are regular enough in the middle parts of
the curves but not at the ends.
   At the maxima of vapour-pressure the composition of the
liquid and the vapour must be the same. That is shown, con
sequently, by the intersection of the curves with the line
log q = log t. The points of intersection form the most
reliable measure of the position of the maxima. They give
                               log q.       2.        3.    |

Since, however, the relation between q and s (or between &
and m) has not so far been expressed successfully by an
equation, it is not possible to integrate the differential equa
tion in order to compare it with experiment. This is true
even for the mixtures of benzene and toluene with carbon
tetrachloride, since the empirical equations, quoted above,
do not extend through the whole range of q, and therefore
the arbitrary constant in the integral equation cannot be
determined. We are reduced therefore to the very rough
process of comparing the differential equation itself with
experiment, by measuring the slope of the vapour-pressure
curves at various points. The relation log t-log k + r log
. logs=|log Bk/A + r log q gives o(logs)/ö(log q) =r, an

   Whether the disagreement is due to the difficulty of treating

to the approximations in the theory, I am at present unable
to say.

   It has already been mentioned that Linebarger states the
conclusion that the partial pressure of benzene and toluene in
mixtures is simply proportional to the molecular percentage
present; this conclusion appears to be only roughly true.
According to the results expressed by the curves on fig. 2
no such simple relation holds; the partial pressures of these
hydrocarbons being as far from linear as that of the carbon
tetrachloride with which they are mixed.
   Linebarger proceeds to apply his conclusion to determine
the molecular weight of acetic acid, in mixtures of the acid
with benzene and toluene.
   For in any mixture the partial pressure of the hydrocarbon
p, divided by the º of the pure liquid Tº gives, accord
ing to this rule, the true molecular fraction of hydrocarbon
present, say, 1–3, whilst 1–3 is that calculated from the
formulae C. He (or C.Hs) and CH3COOH, or
                          1–3 =ph/Th;

where x' is the true ratio of the number of molecules of acetic
acid to molecules of hydrocarbon. If this be divided into the

ratio x calculated from the formulae, the quotient will give
thé degree of aggregation of the molecules of acetic acid in the
solution. In this way Linebarger found molecular weights
which steadily increased with the concentration of the acid,
and by extrapolation found 240 for the molecular weight of
the pure liquid at 35°. My results for alcohol do not, how
ever, at all confirm the accuracy of the methoi. On drawing
smooth curves of purtial pressure from the observations
given in the tables above, and treating them in the way just
indicated, we get

   It will be seen that the two series disagree altogether, and
 that neither leads to any reasonable value for the aggregation
of pure alcohol. I can only conclude that the partial pressure
 of the hydrocarbon vapour is not necessarily linear in mixtures,
and that therefore the rule proposed by Linebarger for deter
 mining the molecular       §       of liquids is not correct.
    Further theoretical conclusions would not, I think, be
 justified at the present time on account of the small amount
 of material accumulated by experiment.

   An excellent summary of the early work on pyrometry is
given by Barus in his elaborate paper “On the Thermo
Electric Measurement of High Temperatures” ”, published in
1889, so that it will only be necessary here to consider briefly
the present condition of high-temperature measurement.

   The ultimate standard of temperature is afforded by the
air-thermometer; nearly all other instruments are referred to
this either directly or indirectly. Apart from the air-thermo
meter, which is not well adapted for ordinary use, there are
two systems of pyrometry suitable for exact measurements of
temperature. One of these, which depends on the change

junction is heated ; its early use is associated with the names
of Becquerel (1826) and Tait (1873), while more recently it
has been employed by H. Le Chatelier, Barus, and Roberts
Austen. The thermo-couples in general use consist of platinum
and platinum alloyed with about 10 per cent. of either
iridium or rhodium, the former alloy having been first used by
Tait, the latter by Le Chatelier.
    The platinum-resistance pyrometer, or platinum thermo
meter, as it is often called, appears to be capable of affording
 more accurate results than i. thermo-couple especially up
 to about 600°. This mainly arises from the fact that the
 measurement of a resistance can be made with a greater
 degree of accuracy than the measurement of the extremely
small E.M.F. produced by the thermo-couple. Moreover,
 the whole of the coil of wire in the resistance-pyrometer is in
 the region the temperature of which is to be measured ; hence
 the indications do not depend, as do those of the thermo
 couple, on the absolute uniformity of composition of the
 platinum wire employed. At higher temperatures, however,
 the resistance-pyrometer is more seriously affected than is the
 thermo-couple by the difficulty of securing good insulation,
 and by the difficulty of obtaining uniformity and constancy
 of the temperature to be measured ; although the difficulty
 of insulation has been practically overcome by Callendar's
 use of mica supports. The resistance-pyrometer, there
 fore, although it may be capable of affording more accurate
 results than the thermo-couple, is much less convenient for
 use at high temperatures.      The latter, consisting of two thin
 wires which may be inserted into a small protecting tube of
 fireclay or porcelain, can be used to measure the temperatures
  of very small enclosures, and its relatively small lag renders
  it suitable for obtaining autographic temperature records.
     The present research was begun with the object of modi
 fying the Roberts-Austen pyrometer, in order that it might
  be used to obtain large-scale temperature records having as
  high a degree of accuracy as possible. It was intended to
  study the degree of constancy which could be obtained in the
  indications of the thermo-couple ; to make observations of
  the melting-points of several metals by means of a thermo
  couple; and to calibrate the couple by means of the porcelain

air-thermometer. The present paper describes the Roberts
Austen recording pyrometer, and the changes which have
been made in view of the above objects, together with the
precautions which should be observed in order to avoid errors
in the use of the thermo-couple. It also contains an account
of the results that have been obtained, and the bearing of
these results on the theory of the thermo-couple.
            The Roberts-Austen Recording Pyrometer.
   The thermo-couple has been used in pyrometry in two
ways:—(1) by measuring the E.M.F. of the heated couple by
a null method, and (2) by observing the deflexion of a gal
vanometer to which it is connected.
   In the recording pyrometer of Roberts-Austen + the latter
method is adopted ; the thermo-couple is connected to a
galvanometer the deflexion of which is recorded on a moving
photographic plate. The resistance of the galvanometer is
sufficiently large to render changes in the resistance of the
thermo-couple unimportant, and as the instrument is calibrated
directly by observations of known melting or boiling tempera
tures, it is not necessary to assume any definite relation be
tween the current and the deflexion of the galvanometer.
This form of pyrometer is extremely convenient and useful,
and the photographic records taken by its aid of the cooling
of an alloy of two or more metals frequently show small evo
lutions of heat which could not easily be detected by direct
observation. These evolutions of heat, even when extremely
small, are of great importance in studying the constitution of
alloys. A few records obtained in this way are given in
fig. 2, which is a reproduction of a photographic plate
on which several records have been taken in succession.
Three of these, B, C, and D, represent the cooling of alloys of
copper and tint containing respectively 50, 55, and 45 per
cent. of copper.
   In these alloys, most of the halts in the cooling-curves
represent the solidification of eutectic alloys. The curves A
and Z represent the cooling and solidification of aluminium
and of zinc, and the known melting-points of these metals
have enabled a temperature-scale to be constructed for use
with the other records.                               -
   In this form of recording pyrometer the accuracy of the
record depends on the constancy of the galvanometer, as well
as on that of the thermo-couple itself, so that another element

64         Mr. A. Stansfield on some Improvements in
of uncertainty is introduced into the results. In addition to
this, the deflexion of the galvanometer for the highest tem
perature to be measured must be limited to the width of the
photographic plate employed if the zero of the scale is to be
recorded on the same plate. In measuring high temperatures,
therefore, the sensibility of the galvanometer must be small,
and consequently the record will be on a small scale.
    For general use, these disadvantages are quite outweighed
by the fact that the whole record of the cooling of an alloy
can be obtained in one curve, but for special purposes, such
as obtaining accurate measurements of melting- or boiling
points, and investigating the exact shape of the “cooling
curve” of a metal or alloy at the temperature of freezing or
of other molecular change, a modification of the method
becomes necessary. In order to obtain large-scale records of
these changes, Roberts-Austen employed a more sensitive
galvanometer, its zero position being adjusted by trial until
the spot of light from its mirror fell upon the photographic
plate when the thermo-couple was at the particular tempera
ture at which a record of the cooling was desired. The zero
position of the enlarged record was often many feet from the
 plate, and, as the galvanometer had to be deflected through a
 large angle, its indications became untrustworthy, and it was
necessary to employ simultaneously a second ordinary
galvanometer to give a measurement of the temperature at
which the enlarged record was taken. The two galvanometers
 were connected in parallel and arranged one behind the
other”, so that they both recorded their deflexion on the same
moving plate. A record taken in this way is given in fig. 3.
    It represents the melting and solidification of an ounce of
pure gold; the thermo-junction was immersed in the molten
gold without any covering, and had therefore scarcely any
lag other than that produced by the galvanometer itself.
The curves A and B were produced by the less sensitive
galvanometer, and the scale on the left has been obtained by
measuring the ordinates of these curves from the datum on the
original plate. The scale for the more sensitive records C and
D is 22 times as great as the other, and it is obtained from
the latter by comparing the slopes of the two records.
    The curves A and C represent the melting, and the curves
B and D the solidification of the gold. The irregularities
in the melting record probably indicate the fall of pieces of
still solid gold into the molten mass. On account of this
irregularity cooling-curves are usually employed, instead of

66        Mr. A. Stansfield on some Improvements in
   The author considered two methods for avoiding the large
deflexion of the sensitive galvanometer and thus rendering its
indications more trustworthy :—(1) that of maintaining the
“cold junction” of the thermo-coupleat some high temperature,
such as the boiling-point of sulphur, thus measuring differences
between two high temperatures; and (2) that of balancing
the greater part of the E.M.F. of the thermo-couple by a
potentiometer method, recording the small remainder by
 means of a sensitive galvanometer on a moving photographic
plate. The latter method was adopted as being much more
convenient and generally applicable.
            The New Form of Recording Pyrometer.
    The Potentiometer.—As the ordinary stretched-wire form
of potentiometer, with sliding contacts, would have been
unsuitable for the purpose, a special instrument was con
structed with plug contacts by means of which any number,
from 1 to 99, of equal units of E.M.F. could be inserted in
the galvanometer circuit.
   The potentiometer, which is shown at B in fig. 1, consists
of four sets of resistance-coils; a, a<U+017F> are sets of nine resistances
of 2 ohms each, and b, b’ of 0.2 ohm each, while c is a set of
 1000 ohm coils which are placed in the battery circuit. The
coils a, b are always in circuit with the galvanometer G and
thermo-couple Te. The battery current flows through the
set of resistances c and through parts of the resistances in a'
and b', and the circuit is completed by the resistances in a
and b which lie between the plugs P, P'.
   The terminals of the resistances in a, a<U+017F> are numbered
0, 10, 20, &c. to the left, and in b, b’ they are numbered
0, 1, 2, &c. to the right, so that the readings opposite the
two plugs give the number of units of E.M.F. in the gal
vanometer circuit. This arrangement, which involves the use
of a larger number of resistance-coils than is usual in
potentiometers, was adopted in order that the resistances of the
galvanometer circuit and of the battery circuit might remain
the same for all positions of the plugs P, P'. The relative
resistances of the coils a, b were carefully measured, and a
table was calculated giving their values in terms of the mean
unit. Changes in the temperature of the potentiometer
should not affect, the E.M.F., included in the galvanometer
circuit, provided that all the coils are at the same temperature.
As it was feared that the high-resistance coils c would become
heated by the passage of the current to a greater degree
than the low-resistance coils, the box B was provided with a
zinc lining and the coils were so arranged they might all be

              the Roberts-Austen Recording Pyrometer.             67
  immersed in paraffin, which could be kept in circulation by
  means of a stirrer. Experiments on the relative resistances
  of the high and low resistance-coils failed to show that any
  change was produced by the passage of the extremely small
  potentiometer current, and the use of the paraffin was,
  therefore, not resorted to.
    The current flowing through the potentiometer is main
  tained by means of a à. cell g with large electrodes, each
  electrode being 20 sq. in. in area. The ë. cell is placed
 in series with a resistance of 2500 ohms.               Under these
 circumstances, as has been shown by S. Skinner *, the current
 produced is remarkably constant, and there is also this
 advantage in the use of the Clark cell, that its E.M.F. when
 producing a current can be easily compared with that of
 standard Clark cells of the usual form.           The use of Clark
 cells for standards has necessitated a large temperature
 correction; but as the cells were placed in a thick wooden
 box D, and their temperature only rose 2 or 3 tenths of a
 degree during the day, the rate of change of temperature
 was sufficiently slow to render this correction fairly legitimate.
 The E.M.F. of the large Clark cell g is compared with that
 of the standards h, h, h by means of the auxiliary potentio
 meter p, which is connected in series with a dry cell j and
 resistance r (the necessary connexions can easily be traced on
 the figure). This potentiometer measures the small difference
 between the E.M.F. across the terminals of the main
 potentiometer and the E.M.F. of each of the standards
 h, h, h. By an arrangement which is not shown in the figure,
the E.M.F. across the terminals of p is obtained in potentio
 meter units, and so the readings on p can be converted into a
 correction to be applied to the readings in B.
    The Galvanometer.—The sensitiveness of the pyrometer
depends on the sensitiveness of the galvanometer and its
constancy of zero. The difficulty of obtaining a sufficiently
sensitive galvanometer was increased by the necessity for
introducing the resistance (20 ohms) of the potentiometer.
In experimenting with sensitive suspended-coil galvanometers,
great difficulty was experienced in finding one which would
return to its zero position after being deflected. This difficulty
was at first attributed to the viscosity of the phosphor-bronze
strip used to suspend the coil, but it was found that the coil
would vibrate when suspended by a silk fibre between the poles
of a permanent magnet, a fact which showed that the coil itself
was magnetic and that the change in zero was largely due to
a change in the direction of the induced magnetism.
     * Phil. Mag. Sept. 1894, p. º:2 Proc. Phys. Soc., Feb. 1895.

68        Mr. A. Stansfield on some Improvements in
   A galvanometer, designed to be as free as possible from this
defect, was made by Dr. Muirhead; the coil was shuttle
shaped, instead of being hollow as in the ordinary form, and
was suspended by a strip at the top; the connexion at the
bottom was made by a fine spiral. This instrument returned
to its zero-reading fairly well after small deflexions, but for
large deflexions it was less reliable than the older form ;
it was, moreover, much more susceptible to vibrations, a fact
which greatly reduced its usefulness, as it was impossible to
obtain a reasonably smooth photographic record of its readings.
All the records shown were obtained by the open-coil galva
nometer.
    The Recording 4/7 aratus, shown at H in fig. 1, consists
of a photographic plate I, mounted on a float F, which slowly
rises as water is admitted into the cylinder H. Vertical
glass rods at the sides of the cylinder act as guides to prevent
rotation or lateral movement of the float.          The whole is
covered by a hooi K, which can readily be raised by means
of the pulley and counterpoise. It is supported by a “hole,
slot, and plane,” on the fixed board R, with which it
makes a light-tight joint. A slit S, which forms part of the
hood, permits only horizontal beams of light to reach the
plate; consequently it is possible to have the room fully
illuminated without danger of fogging the plate. The source
of light L is an ordinary glow-lamp enclosed in a wooden box.
A brass tube, with a rectangular diaphragm at the end nearest
the lamp, cuts off all the light except that from a selected piece
of its vertical filament. Light from this filament is reflected
by means of a piane mirror on the galvanometer, and focussed
on the photographic plate by a lens in front of the galvano
meter.
   This method of focussing the light, which was suggested
by Prof. Boys, enabled a fine line of light to be obtained for
recording, notwithstanding the fact that in order to obtain
records on a sufficiently large scale the galvanometer was
placed 16 feet from the photographic plate. This line of
light passing through a horizontal slit immediately in front
of the plate produces a square spot on the plate. The glow
lamp is very convenient for ordinary work, but the light is
insufficient for taking rapid records, and it becomes necessary,
in taking such records, to employ a lime light.
   The Thermo-Couple consists of two wires, one of platinum
and the other of platinum alloyed with 10 per cent. of rhodium
or iridium. The wires are fused together at the end and
inserted for protection into a thin fire-clay tube. Each wire
was insulated from the other, except at the junction, by means

            the Roberts-Austen Recording Pyrometer.           69
of a slip of mica. The free ends of the wires were soldered
to the leads from the recorder, and these “cold junctions *
were kept in ice, or in cold water the temperature of which
was noted. More recently an hypsometer has been used,
as shown at M in the figure, thus keeping the “cold junctions”
at the temperature of boiling water, which has the advantage
of being more constant than the temperature at which cold
water can readily be maintained; the hypsometer also requires
less attention than a “cold junction * involving the use of ice.
The interval of temperature to be measured is also reduced,
and errors in the E.M.F. are decreased in the same pro
portion.
   Method of taking a Record.—The photographic plate is first
placed on the float F, using a red light in the room, and a
cover is placed over the slit to keep out the spot of light.
The galvanometer is short-circuited by the shunt-box e, and
 the thermo-couple, in its clay tube, is placed in the metal or
 alloy, N, which has been melted in a gas-furnace. The flame is
 then either turned out or reduced in size, so that the furnace
 may cool slowly. The plugs P, P are placed in position in
 the potentiometer, and the shunts are gradually removed from
 the galvanometer as the balance is obtained. When the
 galvanometer has its full sensibility, the spot of light travels
 almost across the photographic plate every time that the
 position of P’ is changed in order to maintain the balance as
 the furnace cools down. This change is effected by placing
 another plug immediately to the left of P’ before the latter is
 removed; when it becomes necessary to move the plug P the
 galvanometer is short-circuited. When the metal has cooled
 to the point at which a record is desired, the water-clock is
 started, and the cover removed from the slit to admit the spot
 of light from the galvanometer to the photographic plate.
  As the movement of the spot of light can be seen on a scale
 immediately above the slit, it is easy to follow the progress of
  the experiment without interfering with the record. As the
  metal cools down and the photographic plate rises, successive
  tracks of the spot of light may be obtained on the plate, each
  track corresponding to a particular position of the plugs.
  When the cooling has been carried sufficiently far, the
  galvanometer is disconnected from the thermo-couple and
  short-circuited by a contact-piece at f and a datum-line is
  run on the plate to indicate the zero position of the galvano
  meter.
    It is also necessary

          perature of the “cold junction.”

    Fig. 4 is a reproduction of a record, obtained in this
way, of the solidification or freezing of tin. The metal
was contained in a small clay crucible inside a cast-iron
chamber heated externally, so that very slow and regular
 cooling could be obtained.
    The metal was stirred during the solidification in order to
   romote uniformity of temperature and to prevent surfusion.
   t will be noticed that the temperature remained practically
 constant until the greater part of the metal had solidified.
     Records have also been taken on the same scale of the
 freezing of metals having much higher melting-points, such
 as gold or copper; but the difficulty of obtaining a satisfactory
 curve is greatly increased.
                   Discussion of the Observations.
     In order to discuss the theoretical bearing of the readings
 of the thermo-couples it is necessary to know the temperatures
 to which they correspond. Although measurements of high
 temperatures have been made with the air-thermometer, they
 are not given in the present research. The results of different
 experimenters have nevertheless determined the melting-tem
 peratures of silver, gold, and copper, with an error of probably
 less than 10°; the relative temperatures being known much
 more accurately. For the purposes of the mathematical
 treatment of the results, the melting-temperature determina
 tions of Heycock and Neville may be taken. Although their
 measurements of the melting temperatures of silver, gold, and
 copper depend on a somewhat severe extrapolation of a
 formula, their determinations of the relative melting-points
 of these metals are probably very accurate, and their results
 agree fairly well with those obtained by the direct air-ther
 mometer observations of Holborn and Wien.
     In fig. 5 the results obtained by the author for different
  thermo-couples are plotted in the usual way; the co
  crdinates representing the temperature of the hot junction
  (t), and the observed E.M.F. of the couple (E), the cold
 junction being supposed to be at 0°C.

        also been plotted. An examination of figure 5 shows that
        very serious discrepancies exist between the indications of
        couples having the same nominal composition. Thus the
        thermo-electric power of the 10 per cent. rhodium thermo
        couple of Holborn and Wien was only about 3/5 of that
        obtained by Holman, Lawrence, and Barr ; and the 10 per

        causes of these discrepancies, which are too large to be
        attributed merely to the accidental differences in the per
        centage of rhodium or iridium in the platinum alloy used.
            Two 10 per cent. rhodium alloys were prepared and drawn
         into wires from which the thermo-couples, Nos. 15 and 16,
         were made up with a return wire of pure platinum common to

72        Mr. A. Stansfield on some Improvements in
both. The rhodium used in the composition of No. 15 was
lº    of a commercial sample and was found to contain no
 ess than 30 per cent. of iridium, so that the alloy consisted
of 90 per cent. platinum, 7 per cent. rhodium, and 3 per
cent. iridium ; No. 16, on the other hand, contained 10 per
cent. of pure rhodium. Observations made with these couples
reveal the unexpected fact that, although the 10 per cent.
iridium alloy is rather more powerful than the rhodium alloy,
the partial substitution of iridium for rhodium in the latter
alloy very materially lowers its thermo-electric power when
compared with platinum. This result is of interest, as it
suggests that the change in the thermo-electric power of a
metal depends on the extent to which it is saturated with the
alloying metal ; 10 per cent. of either rhodium or iridium
would more completely saturate the platinum than would
 10 per cent. of a mixture of the two metals, in the same way
 that a single salt more completely saturates a liquid than the
 same weight of a mixture of two salts of equal solubility.
 The curve marked “Barus, 10 per cent. iridium ” was obtained
by adding the mean results obtained by him with couples
 19 and 20, consisting of “hard ” platinum and platinum with
5 per cent. of iridium, to those obtained with couple 27,
consisting of platinum with 5 per cent of iridium and pla
tinum with 10 per cent. of iridium. The use of “hard,” i. e.
impure platinum in these alloys probably accounts in part for
the smallness of the observed thermo-electric power. A com
parison of his couples 22 and 35 shows that the E.M.F. at
930° would have been about 1200 microvolts higher if “soft”
platinum had been used: this, however, does not materially
reduce the difference between his results and those obtained
by the author with couple 13, and it appears probable that
the iridium he employed contained a considerable percentage
of rhodium or other metal of the platinum group.
   Although the curves in fig. 5 differ so widely from one
another in direction, there is a general agreement as regards
their form.    All the curves are convex towards the scale of
temperature and their curvature decreases as the temperature
rises. The 10 per cent. iridium curves are decidedly straighter
in their lower parts than the 10 per cent. rhodium curves, so
that their indications are more nearly proportional to the
temperature.
   The usual method of presenting thermo-couple observations
has been adopted in plotting the curves in fig. 5, but it is
evident that a more critical method is necessary; for although
the uncertainties in the actual temperatures of points would
be quite visible on these curves, the observations themselves

 can be made with an accuracy of about 1 in 10,000. Very
 good results are obtained by plotting the first differential of
 the original curve ; that is a curve the ordinates of which
  represent the values of               <U+017F>    corresponding to the values of t
  indicated by the abscissae.

         This method can only be applied when a number of melting
 or boiling-points have been obtained, so as to enable the value

74        Mr. A. Stansfield on some Improvements in
# to    be found for a sufficiently large number of points.
For rough purposes, these values are obtained by dividing
the difference between the observed E.M.F.'s at two adjacent
melting-points by the difference in the assumed temperatures,
and plotting the result at the mid-point. A more accurate
curve may be obtained by a graphic method which it is
unnecessary to describe here.                    d'E
   In fig. 6, the thermo-electric power or It curve         has
been obtained in this manner from the curve representing
the thermo-electromotive force E of couple No. 11.
   Small errors, either in the assumed temperatures of the
melting-points, or in the observed values of the E.M.F. for
these temperatures, are thrown into prominence by this
method of plotting ; errors of a few tenths of a degree in the
relative observations of the melting-points of tin, bismuth, or
lead, or of one or two degrees in the melting-point of
aluminium, make very distinct breaks in the curve, and
although the observed values of E are all seen to lie closely
on the E.M.F. curve, the calculated values of      º:  show in
some cases a wide divergence from the smooth mean curve.
Thus, for example, the observed melting-point for aluminium
must have been several degrees lower than the assumed
temperature, unless the curve can be admitted to have a
great dip at about 550°. Records of the solidification of the
aluminium employed did not show the steady freezing-tem
perature which is characteristic of a pure metal, and the
author is inclined to attribute the low reading for aluminium
(see Table II., p. 82) to the impurity of the metal rather
than to irregularity of the indications of the thermo-couple.
                 Theory of the Thermo-Couple.
   The practical value of any pyrometer depends largely on
the possibility of expressing, accurately and simply, the
relation between the reading of the pyrometer and the
temperature to which it is exposed. In the case of the
thermo-couple this has been attempted by many experimenters,
partly empirically, and partly from theoretical considerations.
   The simple thermo-couple HACB, consisting of two wires
A and B of different metals or alloys, has its junctions H
and C at temperatures tº and t, respectively; four separate
E.M.F.'s are produced : (1) a true contact E.M.F. at H, and
(2) another at C, due to the difference in the nature of the
two wires (the Peltier E.M.F.), and (3 and 4) an E.M.F. dis

             the Roberts-Austen Recording Pyrometer.          75
tributed along each of the wires A and B, due to the difference
between the temperatures of different parts of the same
wire (the Thomson E.M.F.).

    The observed E.M.F. is, in reality, the algebraic sum of
 the difference between the E.M.F.'s at H and C, and the
 difference between the E.M.F.'s in A and B.
     Lord Kelvin has shown that it is possible, by means of the
 second law of thermo-dynamics, to distinguish between some
 of these constituents of the observed E.M.F., for the thermo
 couple may be regarded as a reversible engine.
     Let a be the “specific heat of electricity” in the metal A,
 that is, the amount of heat (measured in ergs) absorbed by
 the passage of one unit of electricity (or by unit current in
 unit time) through a rise in temperature of one degree ; and
 let a' be the specific heat of electricity in B.
     Let H be the coefficient of the Peltier effect, that is, the
 amount of heat absorbed at the junction by unit current in
 unit time passing from A to B. Then if T be the tempera
  ture of the cold junction, and Tº that of the hot junction,
  measured from the absolute zero, the heat absorbed in the
  wires A and B in unit time by the passage of a current I
  will be I(a —a') (T2-T) if the temperatures T, and Ti are
  nearly equal, so that the values of a and o' may be taken for
  a mean-temperature T.

   No theoretical investigations have as yet determined the
form of p(T), so that it is impossible to obtain, from purely
theoretical considerations, an equation connecting the tem
perature and the electromotive force of the couple.
   Equation (A) does, however, enable us to calculate the values
of the Peltier and the Thomson E.M.F.'s from a series of data
connecting the observed E.M.F. and the temperature of the
thermo-junction, and the results of such a calculation for the
thermo-couple No. 11 are given in fig. 6.
   The contact or Peltier E.M.F. of the thermo-junction is
represented in the equation by T

perature T.
          d'E
   The Tit curve, embodying the results of these calculations,
has been plotted in the figure, the ordinates are measured
from a datum-line placed at a distance below the temperature
scale equal to the E.M.F. across the cold junction; so that its
ordinates from the temperature-scale give the difference
between the E.M.F.'s at the hot and cold junctions. The
difference between this curve and the E.M.F. curve E repre
sents the resultant of the Thomson effects in the two wires.
The curve marked “Thomson E.M.F.” obtained in this way
has been plotted for convenience above the temperature-scale
line, but it must be remembered that this E.M.F. is opposed
in direction to the resultant of the contact E.M.F.'s.
   It will be noticed that the curve representing the contact
E.M.F., or    1%, is practically a straight line.    In fact, the
divergences at 1000° only correspond to an uncertainty of
about 2° in the assumed temperatures.
   If, then, we assume that
                          Tº = Ti,
we obtain by integration E=aT+h log T4 c.
   This equation requires three relations between E and T to
determine the values of the three constants a, b, and c, and
these can be accurately obtained for the temperatures 0°, 100°,
and the boiling-point of sulphur (444°53).

(p. 82), were obtained in this way from the Oct. 1896 results
of couple 11. These temperatures really depend on an extra
polation beyond 445° of the empirical formula given above, a
formula which appears to be correct in the case of this
thermo-couple as far as it has been possible to verify it. The
dotted lines in fig. 6 are the continuations of the curves at
temperatures below 0°. They depend on the assumption
that the formula holds good at these temperatures, and show
that at the absolute zero the E.M.F. would become infinitely
great, and that the contact, E.M.F. would have a negative
 value of about 200 micro-volts: it has been stated * that the
 latter should be zero, as otherwise further cooling could be
 effected by the passage of a current. The             1%    curve for a
 |..."."          thermo-couple, calculated from figures given in
     ewar and Fleming's f paper on thermo-electricity at low
 temperatures, is straight between 100° and 0°, but below this
 temperature it shows a tendency to curve in the direction
 required to reduce its value to nothing at the absolute zero.
      The theoretical simplicity of the formula given above, which
  involves a linear relation between the temperature of a junction
  and the Peltier E.M.F., makes it worth while to consider
  how far this relation is true in the case of other thermo
  couples. In fig. 7, which has been plotted with this object, the
  dotted lines represent the values of         º    and the continuous
   lines those of  1% for the couples 13, 15, and 16, and for the
   couple used by Holman, Lawrence, and Barr.
       None of the curves representing the contact E.M.F. are
   so nearly straight as in the case of couple 11: but all these
   curves are approximately straight, whilst those representing
    the values of  º are all strongly curved.
       This is of great interest in connexion with the parabolic
    formula investigated by Tait. Tait's expression for the
    E.M.F. of a thermo-couple follows from equation (A) if the
    assumption be made that the specific heat of electricity is
     proportional to the absolute temperature; but the parabolic
     formula is really empirical, and depends on the observations
     that the curves representing the values of          º    are approxi
     mately straight in the case of the thermo-couples for which

   The curves which are plotted in fig. 8 are calculated from re
sults given in a paper by K. Noll " on “The Thermo-electricity

which suggests that thermo-electrically there may be two classes
of metals:—(1) the ordinary metals, for which the      º  Cul"WeS
are straight; and (2) the platinum metals, together with a
few other metals such as nickel and cobalt, for which the   1.
curves are straight. A couple composed of one metal from
each class would of course give both lines curved. On the
other hand, it is unlikely that there would be any sharp division
of this kind, and both formulae may be particular cases of
a more general one.                                dE

thermo-couples composed of platinum and platinum alloyed

the parabolic formula to their indications, though this has
been done by several experimenters.

       § 1.   W ITHOUT preface two 95 years' old experiments of
                         Volta's were, one of them shown, and the other
       described. The apparatus used consists of: (a) a Volta
       condenser of two varnished brass plates, of which the lower
        º       is insulated in connexion with the gold leaves of a gold
        eaf electroscope, and the upper plate is connected by a flexible
       wire with the sole plate of the instrument; (b) two circular
       discs, one of copper and the other of zinc, each polished and
       unvarnished.          !".      one in my right hand by a varnished
       glass stem attached to it, while on my left hand I hold the
          * Communicated by the Author, having been read at the meeting of
       the Royal Institution on May 21st, 1897.

                   Contact Electricity of Metals,            83
other, which is kept metallically connected with the sole
plate of the electroscope by a thin flexible wire.
    To commence the experiment I place one disc resting on the
other, and lift the two till the
upper touches a brass knob                     Fig. 1.
connected by a stiff metal wire
with the lower plate of the
Wolta condenser.      I break this
contact and then lift the upper
plate of the condenser; you see
no divergence of the gold leaves.
This proves that no disturbing
electric influence sufficient to
show any perceptible effect
on our gold-leaf electroscope
is present. Now I repeat what
I did, with only this change—
I hold the lower disc with the
upper disc resting on it two
or three centimetres below the
knob. I then with my right
hand lift the upper plate of the
Volta-condenser; you see a very slight divergence between
the shadows of the gold leaves on the screen. I can just see
it by looking direct at the leaves from a distance of about
half a metre. Still holding the lower plate firmly in my left
hand in the same position, and holding the upper plate by
the top of its glass stem in my right, at first resting on the
lower plate I lift it and let it down very rapidly a hundred
 times, so as to produce one hundred cycles of operation—
 break contact between discs, make and break contact between
upper disc and knob, make contact between discs. Lastly,
 I lift the upper plate of the condenser; you see now a great
divergence of the gold leaves, many of you can see it direct
 on the leaves, while all of you can see it by their shadows on
 the screen. Now, keeping the upper plate of the condenser
 still unmoved, I bring a stick of rubbed sealing-wax into the
 neighbourhood of the electroscope; you see i. divergence
 of the leaves is increased. I remove the sealing-wax and
the divergence diminishes to what it was before. This proves
 that the gold leaves diverge in virtue of resinous electricit
 upon them, and therefore that the insulated plate of the
 condenser received resinous electricity from the copper disc.
 If now I interchange the two discs so that the upper is zinc
 and the lower copper, and repeat the experiment, you see
that the rubbed sealing-wax diminishes the divergence as it

84                      Lord Kelvin on
is brought from a distance into the neighbourhood, and that
a glass rod rubbed with silk increases the divergence. Hence
we conclude that in the separation of two discs of copper and
zinc the copper carries away resinous electricity and the zinc
vitreous electricity.
   § 2. Experiment 2.-The same apparatus as in Experi
ment 1, except that the polished zinc and copper discs .
their opposed faces varnished with shellac, and are provided
with wires soldered to them for making metallic connexion
between them when the upper rests on the lower, as shown
in Fig. 2. All operations are the same as in Experiment 1,
                             Fig. 2.
but now with this addition—when the upper disc rests on
the lower, make and break metallic contact by hand as shown
in the diagram. The results are the same as those of Experi
ment 1, except that the quantity of electrification given to
the gold ieaves by a single cycle of operations is generally
greater than in Experiment 1, for this reason: In Experi
ment 1 at the instant of breaking contact between the zinc

                     Contact Electricity of Metals.                 85
  and copper there is generally some degree of inclination
  between the two discs, while at the corresponding instant of
  Experiment 2 they are        º        and only separated by the
  insulating coats of varnish. If great care is taken to keep
 the discs as nearly as possible parallel at the instant of
 separation, the effect of a single separation may be made
 #. in Experiment 1 than in Experiment 2 (see § 3
   elow).
     § 3. An instructive variation of Experiment 1 may be made
 by giving a large inclination, 5*, or 10°, or 20°, of the upper
 plate to the lower, while still in contact and at the instant of
 separation. By operating thus the experiment may be made
 to fail so nearly completely that no divergence of the leaves
 will be observed even after one hundred cycles.
    §4. These two experiments, with the variation described
 in § 3, put it beyond all doubt that Volta's electromotive
 force of contact between two dissimilar metals is a true dis
 covery. It seems to have been made by him about the year
 1801; at all events he exhibited his experiments proving it
 in that year to a Commission of the French Institute
 (Academy of Sciences). It is quite marvellous that the
fundamental experiment (§ 1 above), simple, easy, and sure
as it is", is not generally shown in courses of lectures on elec
tricity to students, and has not been even mentioned or
referred to in any English text-book later than 1845, or at
all events not in any one of a large number in which I have
looked for it, except in the ‘Elementary Treatise on Elec
tricity and Magnetism,’ founded on Joubert’s ‘Traité Éle
mentaire d’ Electricité,” by Foster and Atkinson, 1896
(p. 136). The only other places in which I have seen it
described in the English language are Roget’s article in the
‘Encyclopædia Metropolitana' referred to above ; Tait's
‘Recent Advances in Physical Science,’ 1876; and Professor
Oliver Lodge's most valuable, interesting, and useful account
of all that had been done for knowledge of contact electricity
from its discovery by Volta till 1884, in his Report to the
British Association of that year, ‘On the Seat of the Electro
motive Forces in the Voltaic Cell.'
    § 5. The reason for this unmerited neglect of a great
discovery regarding properties of matter is that it was over
shadowed by an earlier and greater discovery of its author, by
which he was led to the invention of the voltaic pile and crown
of cups, or voltaic battery, or, as it is sometimes called, the
   * Fully and clearly described in Roget's article on “Galvanism,” in
the ‘Encyclopædia Metropolitana, vol. iv. edition 1845, p. 210.

86                       Lord Kelvin on
#. battery.           Knowing, as we now know, both Volta's
  iscoveries, we may describe the earlier most shortly by
saying that the simple experiment (§ 1 above), demonstrating
the later discovery, is liable to fail if a drop of water is
placed on the lower of the two polished plates. It fails if
(see fig. 4 below) the last connexion between the zinc and
copper, when the upper disc is lifted, is by water. It would
not fail (see fig. 6 below) nor be sensibly altered from what
is found with the dry polished metals, if the upper disc were
slightly tilted in the lifting, so as to break the water arc
before the separation between the metals, and secure that the
last connexion is contact of dry metals. To show this to you
more readily than by a Volta condenser with gold-leaf elec
troscope, I shall now use instead my quadrant electrometer
without condenser.
    (1) Holding the copper disc connected with the metal case
of the electrometer in one hand, with my other hand I hold
by a glass handle the zinc disc, which you see is connected
by a fine wire with the insulated quadrants of the electro
meter. I first place the zinc resting on the copper, both
 being polished and dry. You now see the spot of light at
 the point marked O on the scale, which I call the metallic
 zero.   I now lift the zinc disc two or three millimetres from
 resting on the copper, and you see the spot of light travelling
 largely to the right, which proves that vitreous electricity
 has passed from the zinc disc through the connecting wire to
 the insulated quadrants of the electrometer. I lower the zinc
 disc down to rest again on the copper disc ; you see the spot
 of light again comes back to the metallic zero.
    (2) I now raise the zinc disc, and with a little piece of wet
 wood (or a quill pen) place a little mound of water on the
 copper disc, as shown in fig. 3. I bring down the zinc disc
                              Fig. 3.
to touch the top of the little mound of water, keeping it
parallel to the copper disc so that there is no metallic contact

                  Contact Electricity of Metals.            87
 between them (fig. 4); you see that the spot of light moves
 to the left and settles at a point marked E (which I call the
 electrolytic zero of our circumstances), a few scale-divisions
                              Fig. 4.
to the left of the metallic zero.    This motion and settlement
is the simplest modern exhibition of Volta's greatest dis
covery.
   (3) Now that the spot of light has settled, I lift the zinc
disc a millimetre till the water-column is broken, and then
two or three centimetres farther (fig. 5); the spot of light
                                Fig. 5.
does not move, it remains at E. I lower the zinc disc again:
still no motion of the spot of light, not even when the zinc
again touches the little mound of water.
    (4) Now I tilt the zinc disc slightly till it makes a dry
                               Fig. 6.
metallic contact with the copper, as shown in fig. 6; while

88                         Lord Kelvin on   -
the water are still remains unbroken.         You see the spot of
light, at the instant of metallic contact, suddenly leaves E
and moves to the right, and settles quickly at the metallie
zero after a few vibrations through diminishing range.
     (5) Lastly, I break the metallic contact, and hold the zinc
disc again parallel to the copper (fig. 4) with the water con
 nexion still remaining unbroken between them ; the spot of
 light shows no sudden motion; it creeps to the left till, in
 half a minute or three-quarters of a minute, it reaches its
 |...". steady position       on the left. This is the now well
   nown phenomenon (never known to Volta) of the recovery
 of a voltaic cell from electrolytic polarisation after a metallic
 short-circuit.
     § 6. The succession of experiments described in § 5, inter
 preted according to elementary electrostatic law, proves the
 following conclusions:—
      (1) When the dry and polished discs of zinc and copper
 are metallically connected and held parallel, their opposed
  faces are oppositely electrified, the zinc with vitreous elec
  tricity, and the copper with resinous electricity, in quantities
  varying inversely as the distance between them when this is
  small in comparison with the diameter of each.
      (2) The opposed polished faces are non-electrified when       *
  º          portions of the zinc and copper surfaces are connected
    y water, and when there is no metallic connexion between
  them. Or, if not absolutely free from electrification, they
  may be found slightly electrified, zinc resinously or vitreously,
  and copper vitreously or resinously, according to differences
  in respect to cleanness, polish, or scratching or burnishing,
  as explained in § 16 below ; and according to polarisational
  or other difference in the wetted portions of the surfaces.
      If instead of pure water we take a weak solution of common
  salt, or carbonate of soda, or sulphate of zinc or ammonia,
  we find results but little affected by the differences of the
  liquids.
       § 7. But if the polished surface of either the copper or the
  zine is oxidized, or tarnished in any way, notably different
   results are found when the experiments of § 5 are repeated
   with the disc or discs thus altered.
       For example, hold the copper disc, with its polished side
   up, over a slab of hot iron, or a spirit-lamp, or a bunsen
   burner, till you see a perceptible change of colour, due to
   oxidation of the previously polished face. Then allow the
   copper to cool, and 1 epolish a small area near one edge ;
   place a little mound of water upon this area, and operate as
    in § 5 (2), (3). The water connexion between polished zinc
    and polisled copper brings the spot of light to the same elec

                   Contact Electricity of Metals.              89
trolytic zero E as before. But now, when we lift the zinc
disc and break the water connexion, the spot of light moves
to the right, instead of remaining steady as it does when both
the dry opposed surfaces are polished. If next we tarnish
the zinc disc by heat, as we did for the copper disc, and
repeat the experiment with wholly polished copper, and with
the zinc disc oxidized where dry, and polished only where
wet by the water connexion, we find still the same electro
lytic zero E ; but now the spot of light moves to the left
when we lift the zinc disc and break the water connexion.
    § 8. The experiments of § 7, interpreted in connexion with
those of $ 5, prove that there are dry contact voltaic actions
between metallic copper and oxide of copper in contact with
it, and between metallic zinc and oxide of zinc in contact
with it; according to which, dry oxide of copper is resinous
to copper in contact with it, and dry oxide of zinc is resinous
 to zinc in contact with it, just as copper is resinous to zinc in
contact with it. We may verify this conclusion by another
 interesting experiment. Taking, for instance, the oxidized
 copper plate, with a little area polished for contacts, put a
 little mound of copper, instead of the mound of water, on this
 area for contact with the upper plate; and for the upper plate
 take polished copper instead of polished zinc. If we operate
 now as in § 7, the spot of light settles at the metallic zero O
 when the metallic contact is made, instead of at the electro
 lytic zero E, as it did when we had water connexion
 between zinc and copper. But now, just as in § 7, the
 spot of light moves to the right when the contact is broken
 and the upper plate lifted, which proves that vitreous
 electricity flows into the electrometer from the upper plate,
 when its distance from the lower plate is increased after
 breaking the metallic contact. We conclude that when the
 two plates were parallel, and very near one another, and when
 there was metallic connexion between them, vitreous and
 resinous electricities were induced upon the opposed surfaces
  of metallic copper and oxidized copper respectively. This
 statement, ... we know from $ 7 to be also true for zinc
  compared with oxidized zinc, is probably also true for every
  oxidizable metal compared with any one of its possible oxides.
  It is true, as we shall see later (appended paper of 1880–81;
  also Erskine-Murray’s paper referred to in § 15), even for
  platinum in its ordinary condition in our atmosphere of 21
  per cent. oxygen and 79 per cent. nitrogen, voltaically tested
  in comparison with platinum which has been recently kept
  for several minutes or several hours in an atmosphere of pure
  oxygen, or even in an atmosphere of 95 per cent. oxygen
  and 5 per cent. nitrogen.

90                           Lord Kelvin on
    § 9. Hitherto we have had no means of measuring the
 amount of the Volta-contact electric force between dry metals,
 except observation of the degrees of deflexion of the gold
 leaves of an electroscope, or of the spot of light of the quadrant
 electrometer, consequent upon operations performed upon dif
 ferent pairs of metals, with dimensions and distances of motion
 exactly the same, and comparison of these deflexions with the
 steady deflexion from the metallic zero given by polished zinc
 and copper connected conductively with one another by
 water, and connected metallically with the two electrodes of
 an electroscope or electrometer. Kohlrausch, in 1851*,
 devised an apparatus for carrying out this kind of investiga
 tion systematically, and with a good approach to accuracy, by
 aid of a Dellman’s electrometer and a Daniell’s cell, as more
 definite and constant than a zinc-water-copper cell. This
 method of Kohlrausch's for measuring the Volta electromotive
 forces between dry metals “has been employed with modi
 fications by Hankel, by Gerland, by Clifton, by Ayrton and
 Perry, by von Zahn, and by most other experimenters on the
 subject”f. About thirty-seven years ago, in repetitions of
 Volta's fundamental experiment proving contact electricity
 by electroscopic phenomena resulting from change of distance
 between parallel plates of zinc and copper, I found a null
method for measuring electromotive forces due to metallic
contact between dissimilar metals, in terms of the electromotive
force of a Daniell's cell, which is represented diagrammatically
in fig. 7, and in perspective in fig. 8. The two disks are
protected against disturbing influences by a metal sheath.
The lower disk is permanently insulated in a fixed position,
and is kept connected with the insulated pair of quadrants of
a quadrant electrometer. The upper disk is supported by a
metal stem passing through a collar in the top of the sheath, so
that it is kept always parallel to the lower disk and metallically
connected to the sheath, while it can be lifted a few centimetres
at pleasure from an adjustable lowest position in which its
lower face is about half a millimetre or a millimetre above the
upper face of the lower disk. A portion of the wire con
necting the lower plate to the insulated) quadrants of the
electrometer is of polished platinum, and contact between this
and a platinum-tipped wire connected to the slider of a
potential divider is made and broken at pleasure. For
certainty of obtaining good results it is necessary that these

                  Contact Electricity of Metals.              91
contacts should be between clean and dry polished metals,
because if the last connexion on breaking contact is through
semi-moist dust, or oxide, or “dirt" (defined by Lord
Palmerston to be matter in a wrong place), or if it is any
thing other than metallic, vitiating disturbance is produced.
   § 10. To make an experiment, first test the insulation with
the upper plate held up in its highest position, and after that
with it let down to its lowest position, in each case proceeding
thus: Holding by hand the wire connected to the slider, run
the slider to zero, make contact at P, observe on the screen
the position of the spot of light from the electrometer mirror
                              Fig. 7.
for the metallic zero, and then run the slider slowly to the
top of its scale and break contact; the spot of light should
remain steady, or at all events should not lose more than a
Very small percentage of its distance from metallic zero, in
half a minute. Repeat the test with the cell reversed. If the
test is satisfactory with the upper plate high, the insulation
of the insulated quadrants in the electrometer and of the lower
disk in the Volta-condenser is proved good. If after that the
 test is not satisfactory with the upper disk at its lowest, we
 infer that there are vitiating shreds between the two plates,
and we must do what we can to remove them ; or, if necessary,
We must alter the screw-stop at the top so as to increase the

shortest distance between the plates sufficiently to prevent
bridges of shred or dust between them, and so to give good
ºil.            The smaller we make the shortest distance with
perfect enough insulation, the more sensitive is the apparatus
for the measurement of contact electricity performed as
follows:—
    § 11. Run the slider to zero; make and keep made the
contact at P till the spot of light settles at the metallic zero;
break contact at P, and lift the upper plate slightly. (If you
lift it too far, the spot of light may fly out of range.) If the
spot of light moves in the direction showing positive elec
tricity on the insulated quadrants (as it does if the lower
plate is zinc and the upper copper), connect the cell to make
the slider negative (as shown in fig. 7). Repeat the experi
ment with the slider at different points on the scale, until you
find that, with contact P broken, lifting the upper plate
causes no motion of the spot of light. If the compensating
action with the slider at the top of the range is insufficient,
add a second cell; if it is still insufficient, add a third
cell ; if still insufficient, add a fourth *.
     § 12. By this method I made an extended series of experi
ments in the years 1859–61, as stated in a short paper
communicated to Section A of the British Association at its
Swansea meeting in August 1880, which with additions
published in : Nature’ for April 14, 1881, is appended to the
 present article.
     § 13. Quite independently f, M. H. Pellat found the same
method, and made admirable use of it in a series of experi
 ments described in theses presented to the Faculty of
 Sciences in Paris in 1881 i, of which the results, accurate to
    * The only case hitherto tested by any experimenter, so far as known
 to me, in which more than two Daniell cells would be required for the
 compensation, is bright metallic sodium, guarded against oxide by glass,
 in Mr. Erskine-Murray's experiments (§ 18 below), showing volta
 difference of 3:56 volts from his standard gold plate. For direct test
 this would require four Daniell cells on the potential divider. The
 greatest volta-difference of potentia's observed by Pellat was 108 volts,
  for which a Daniell's cell would rather more than suffice.  About 1862 I
 found considerably more than the electromotive force of a single Daniell's
  element required to compensate the Volta electromotive force between
  polished zinc and copper oxidized by heat to a dark purple or slate
  colour.

94                           Lord Kelvin on
a degree of minuteness unknown in previously published
researches on the electrical effects of dry contacts between
metals, constitute in many respects the most important and
most interesting extension of our knowledge of contact
electricity since the times of Volta and Pfaff. One of his
results (I shall have to speak of others later) was that Pfaff
was right in 1829" when he described experiments in which
he found no difference in the Volta-contact-electromotive force
between zinc and copper, whether tested in dry or damp air,
oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carburetted hydrogen, or carbonic
acid, so long as no visible chemical action occurred; and that
De la Rive was not right when he “asserted that there was
no Volta effect in the slightly rarefied air then known as
vacuum”f. Pfaff experimented with varnished plates; Pellat
arrived at the same conclusion with polished unvarnished
  lates of zinc and copper. He found slight variations of the
W. electromotive force due to the nature of the gas sur
rounding the plates, and to differences of its pressure, of
which he says: “Ces variations sont très faibles, par rapport
à la différence de potentiel totale.... Ces variations dansla diffé
rence de potentiel sont toujours en retard sur les changements
de pression. Elles ne paraissent donc pas dépendre directement
de celle-ci, mais bien des modifications qui en résultent dans
la nature de la surface métallique, modifications qui mettent
un certain temps a se produire.” The smallest pressures for
which Pellat made his experiments were from 3 to 4 or 5
centim. of mercury.
    § 14. The same method was used by Mr. J. T. Bottomley
in an investigation by which he demonstrated with minute
accuracy the equality of the Volta-contact-difference measured
in a glass tube exhausted to less than 543 millim. of mercury f
(2% millionths of an atmosphere), and immediately after
in the same tube filled with air to ordinary atmospheric
pressure; and again exhausted and filled with hydrogen to
atmospheric pressure three times in succession ; and again
exhausted and filled to atmospheric pressure with oxygen. In
some cases the electrical test was repeated several times,
while the gas was entering slowly. The actual apparatus
which he used is before you, and in it I think you will see
with interest the little Volta-condenser, with plates of zinc
and copper a little larger than a shilling, the upper hung on

finally perfected by two and a half hours' working at the pump immediately
before the electric testing experiment.

a spiral wire by a long hook carrying also a small globe of
soft iron. Thus you see by aid of an external magnet I can
lift and lower the upper plate without moving the vacuum
tube, which, during the experiments, was kept in connexion
with a Sprengel pump and phosphoric acid drying-tubes.
Mr. Bottomley sums up thus:– “The result of my investiga
tion, so far as it has gone, is that the Volta contact effect, so
long as the plates are clean, is exactly the same in common
air, in a  i.   vacuum, in hydrogen at small and full pressure,
and in oxygen. My apparatus, and the method of working
during these experiments, was so sensitive that I should
 certainly have detected a variation of 1 per cent. in the value
 of the Volta contact effect, if such a variation had presented
 itself”*.                                                -
     § 15. With the same method further researches have been
 carried on by Mr. Erskine Murray, and important and
 interesting results obtained, within the last four years, in the
 Physical Laboratories of the Universities of Glasgow and
 Cambridge. He promises a paper for early communication
 to the Royal Society, and, from a partial copy of it which he
  has already given me, I am able to tell you of some of his
  results.  +..     generally as standard a gilt brass disc which
  he found among the apparatus remaining from my experi
  ments of 1859–61, he measured Volta-differences from it in
  terms of the modern standard one volt.        These differences are
  what we may call the Volta-potentials of the different metallic
  surfaces, or surfaces of metallic oxides, iodides, &c., or
  metallic surfaces altered by cohesion to them of gases or
  vapours, or residues of liquids which had been used for
  washing them; if for simplicity we agree to call the Volta
  potential of the gold, zero. As a rule he began each experi
   ment by polishing the metal plate to be tested on clean glass
   paper or emery-cloth, and then measured its difference of
   potential from the standard gold plate. After that the plate
   was subjected to some particular treatment, such as filing or
   burnishing ; or polishing on leather or paper; or washing
   with water, or alcohol, or turpentine, and leaving it wet or
   drying it; or heating it in air, or exposing it to steam or
   oxygen, or fumes of iodine or sulphuretted hydrogen ; or
   simply leaving it for some time under the influence of the
   atmosphere. The plate as altered by any of these processes
   was then measured for potential against the standard gold.
    Very interesting and instructive results were found ; only of
    one can I speak at present.     Burnishing by rubbing it firmly
    with a rounded steel tool, or by rubbing two plates of the
                  * Brit. Assoc. Report, 1885, pp. 901–3.

 96                            Lord Kelvin on
 same metal together, increased the potential in every case;
 that is to say made the metallic surface more positive if it
 was positive to begin with ; or made it less negative or
 changed it from negative to positive, if it was negative to
 begin with. Thus : —

         sharply by polishing on clean glass
        paper was found . . . . . . . + 70 volt.
      After being burnished with hard steel

      It was then scratched by polishing on
        glass-paper, and its surface potential
        returned to its original value of . . 4. ‘70 volt.
    § 16. This seems to me a most important result. It cannot
 be due to the removal of oxygen, or oxide, or of any other
 substance from the zinc. It demonstrates that change of
arrangement of the molecules at the free surface, such as is
 produced by crushing them together, as it were, by the
burnisher, affects the electric action between the outer surface
of the zinc and the opposed parallel gold plate. it shows
that the potential * in zinc (uniform throughout the homo
   * There has been much of wordy warfare regarding potential in a
metal, but none of the combatants has ever told what he means by the
expression. In fact, the only definition of electric potential hitherto
given has been for vacuum, or air, or other fluid insulator. Conceivable
molecular theories of electricity within a solid or liquid conductor might
admit the term potential at a point in the interior; but the function so
called would vary excessively in intermolecular space, and must have
a definite value for every point, whether of intermolecular space or within
the volume of a molecule, or within the volume of an atom, if the atom
occupies space. It would also vary intensely from point to point in
the aether or air outside the metal at distances from the frontier small or
moderate in comparison with the distance from molecule to molecule in
the metal.
   But when, setting aside our mental microscopic binocular which shows
us atoms and molecules, we deal with the mathematical theory of equi
librium and motion of electricity through metals with outer surfaces
bounded by aether or air or other insulating fluids or solids, we find
it convenient to use a mathematical function of position called potential
in the interior of each metal. This function must, for the case of equi
librium, fulfil the condition that it is of uniform value through each
homogeneous portion of metal. Its value must, as a rule, change gra

    thin surface-layer of a portion of its surface affected by the
    crushing of the burnisher, more by 32 volt than through
   any thin surface-layer of portions of its surface left as polished
   and scratched by glass-paper. The difference of potentials of
   copper and zinc across an interface of contact between them
   is only about 24 times the difference of potential thus proved
   to be produced between the homogeneous interior of the zinc
   and its free surface, by the burnishing. Pellat had found
   that polished metallic surfaces, seemingly clean and free from
  visible contamination of any kind, became more positive by
  rubbing them forcibly with emery-paper, zinc showing the
  greatest effect, which was 23 volt.                 Murray's burnished
  surface of zinc actually fell 32 volt when          ... by polish
  ing on glass-paper.

              They were then burnished by
                 rubbing them forcibly to
                 gether, and again tested sepa
                 rately ; he found . . . .               (a)—-02 volt.

     Rises of Volta-potential of about the same amount were
  produced by burnishing with a steel burnisher copper plates
  which had been polished and scratched in various ways.
 Such experiments as those of Murray with burnishing ought
 to be repeated with hammering or crushing by a Bramah's
 press. Indeed Pellat" suggested that metals treated bodily
 “par le laminage ou le martelage '' (rolling or hammering)
might probably show Volta-electric properties of the same
dually (or abruptly) with every gradual (or abrupt) change of quality of
substance occupying space.
    To illustrate the difficulty and complexity of expression with which I
have struggled, and to justify if possible my ungainly resulting sentence in
the text, consider the case of a crystal of pure metal; suppose, for example,
 an octahedron with truncated corners, all natural faces and facets. In
 all probability Volta-differences of potential would be found between the
 octahedronal and truncational faces. We might arbitrarily define the
uniform interior potential as the potential of the air either near an octa
hedronal face or near a truncational face; or, still arbitramily, we might
 define it as some convenient mean or average related to measurements of
Volta-differences of potential between the different faces.

    § 18. It is interesting to remark that Murray's most
highly burnished zinc differed from his emery-polished copper
(a) by 1-13 volts. This is considerably greater, I believe,
than the highest hitherto recorded Volta-difference between
pure metallic surfaces of zinc and copper.
    By far the greatest Volta-difference between two metallic
surfaces hitherto measured is, I believe, 3-56 volts, which
Murray, in another part of his work, found as the Volta
difference between bright sodium protected by glass and his
standard gold. He had previously found a copper surface
after exposure to iodine vapour to be —-34 relatively to his
standard gold. The difference between this iodized surface
and the bright metallic surface of sodium was therefore 3.90
volts : which is the highest dry Volta-electromotive force
hitherto known.
    § 19. Seebeck's great discovery of thermoelectricity (1821)
was a very important illustration and extension of the twenty
years’ earlier discovery of the contact electricity of dry º
by Volta. It proved independently of all disturbing con
ditions that the difference of potentials between two metals in
contact varies with the temperature of the junction. Thus,
for instance, in the copper-iron arrangement represented in
fig. 9, with its hot junction at 25° and its cold at 15°, the
              J|      ||250              159|

electromotive force tends to produce current from copper
 to iron through hot, and its amount is -00148 volt: that is to
 say, if the circuit is broken at A B the two opposed faces
 A, B, at equal temperatures, present a difference of electric
 potential of -00148 volt, with B positive relatively to A. This
 is not too small a difference to be tested directly by the Volta
 static method, worked by two exactly similar metal discs
 connected to A and B, when they are at their shortest distance
 from one another, and then disconnected from A and B, and
 separated and tested by connexion with a delicate quadrant

                  Contact Electricity of Metals.            99
electrometer. But the test would be difficult, because of the
difficulty of preparing the opposed surfaces of two equal and
similar disks, so as to make them equal in their surface-Volta
potentials within one one-thousandth of a volt, or even to
make their difference of potentials constant during the time of
experiment within one one-thousandth of a volt. There
would, however, be no interest in making the experiment in
this way, because by the electromagnetic method we can with
ease exhibit and measure with great accuracy the difference
of potentials between A and B, by keeping them exactly at
one temperature and connecting them by wires of any kind
with brass or other terminals of a galvanometer of high
enough resistance not to sensibly diminish the difference
of potentials between A and B, provided all the connexions
between metals of different quality except J and K are kept
at one and the same temperature (or pairs of them, properly
chosen, kept at equal temperatures).
   $ 20. Suppose, now, instead of breaking a circuit of two
metals at a place in one of the metals, as A B in copper
in fig. 9, we break it at one of the junctions between the two
metals, as at C' (', I I, fig. 10, C I) represents a movable

 slab of copper which (for $22 below) may be pushed in so as
 to be wholly opposite to II, or at pleasure drawn out to any
 position, still resting on the copper below it as shown in the
 diagram. Calling zero the uniform potential over the sur:
 faces C" CD, the potential at I' I would be about +16 volt
  (according to Murray's * for emery-polished copper and
                                     2

100                -     Lord Kelvin on
iron surfaces) if the temperature at J and throughout the
system is uniform at about 15° C. Keeping now the tem
perature of C C, I' I exactly at 15°, let the temperature of J
be raised to 25°. The difference of potentials between C. C
and I' I would be increased to 16148 volt, supposing 16000
to have been exactly the difference of potentials when the
temperature of J was 15°. This difference of differences of
potentials would be just perceptible on the most delicate
quadrant electrometer connected as indicated in the diagram.
Lastly, raise the temperature of C'C and I' I to exactly 25°,
J being still kept at this temperature : the spot of light of the
electrometer will return exactly to its metallic zero. But,
 would the Volta-difference of potentials between the surfaces
 C' C, I' I remain unchanged, or would it return exactly to its
previous value of 16000, or would it come to some other
 value * We cannot answer this question without experiment.
The proper method, of course, would be to use the metal
sheathed Volta-condenser and compensation (§ 9 above), and
 with it measure the Volta-differences between copper and iron
at different temperatures, the same for the two metals in each
 case. The sheath and everything in it should, in each experi
 ment, be kept at one and the same constant temperature.
 But it would probably be very difficult to get a decisive
answer, because of the uncertainties and time-lags of changes
in the Volta-potential of metallic surfaces with change of
temperature, which, if we may judge from Pellat's and
 Murray's experiments on effects of temperature when the two
 metals are unequally heated, would probably also be found
 when the temperatures of the two metals, kept exactly equal,
 are raised or lowered at the same time.
    § 21. The thermoelectric difference between bismuth and
 antimony is about ten times that between copper and iron for
 temperature differences of ten or twenty degrees on the two
 sides of 20°C., and their Volta-contact difference is exceed
 ingly small (according to Pellat, just one one-hundredth of a
 volt when both their surfaces are strongly scratched by rubbing
 with emery). It would be very interesting, and probably
 instructive, to find how much their Volta-contact difference
 varies with temperature by the method at present suggested.
 The great variations of Volta-surface potentials, found by
 Pellat and Murray, when one of the two metals is heated,
 may have been due to difference of temperatures between the
 two opposed plates with air between them ; and it is possible
 that no such large variation, or that large variation only due
 to changes of cohering gases, may be found when the two
 metals are kept at equal temperatures, and these temperatures
 are varied as in the experiment I am now suggesting.

                    Contact Electricity of Metals.                   101
     $ 22. Peltier's admirable discovery (1834) of cold produced
 where an electric current crosses from bismuth to antimony,
 and heat where it crosses from antimony to bismuth, in a
 circuit of the two metals, with a current maintained through
 it by an independent electromotive force, is highly important
 in theory, or in attempts for theory, of the contact electricity
 of metals.
    From an unsatisfactory “ hypothetical application of Car
 not's principle to the thermodynamics of thermoelectric
 currents I long ago inferred f that probably electricity cross
ing a contact between copper and iron in the direction from
copper to iron would produce cold, and in the contrary
direction heat when the temperature is below 280°C. (the
thermoelectric neutral temperature of copper and iron f), and
I verified this conclusion by experiment $. Hence we see,
looking to fig. 10, if the movable copper plate CD is allowed
to move inwards (in the position shown in the diagram it is
pulled inwards by the wº of the opposed
surfaces of iron and copper), cold will be produced at the
junction J, all the metal being at one temperature to begin
with ; and if we draw out the copper plate CD, heat will be
produced at J. The thermodynamics of this action ||, because it
does not involve unequal temperatures in different parts of the
metals concerned, is a proper subject for unqualified applica
tion of Carnot's law, and has nothing of the unsatisfactoriness
of the thermodynamics of thermoelectric currents, which
essentially involves dissipation of energy by conduction of
heat through metals at different temperatures in different
parts. At present we cannot enter further into thermody
namics than to remark that when the plate CD is drawn out,
the heat produced at J is not the thermal equivalent of the
work done by the drawing out of the copper plate, but in all
probability is very much less than the thermal equivalent.

       § 23. Returning to fig. 9 ; suppose, by electrodes con
   nected to AB and an independent electromotive force, a
   current is kept flowing from copper to iron through one
   junction, and from iron to copper through the other : the
    Peltier heat produced where the current passes from iron to
    copper is manifestly not the thermal equivalent of the work
    done. In fact, if the two junctions be at equal temperatures,
    the amounts of Peltier heat produced and absorbed at the two
   junctions will be equal, and the work done by the independent
    electromotive force will be spent solely in the frictional
    generation of heat.
        § 24. Many recent writers *, overlooking the obvious
    principles of §§ 22, 23, have assumed that the Peltier evolu
    tion of heat is the thermal equivalent of electromotive force
     at the junction. And in consequence much confusion, in
     respect to Volta's contact electricity and its relation to thermo
     electric currents, has largely clouded the views of teachers
     and students. We find over and over again the statement
|    that thermoelectric electromotive force is very much smaller
     than the Volta-contact electromotive force of dry metals.
     The truth is, Volta-electromotive force is found between
     metals all of one temperature, and is reckoned in volts,
     or fractions of a volt, without reference to temperature. If
     it varies with temperature, its variations may be stated in
     fractions of a volt per degree. On the other hand, thermo
     electric electromotive force depends essentially on difference
     of temperature, and is essentially to be reckoned per degree;
     as for example, in fraction of a volt per degree.

        * Perhaps following Clerk Maxwell, or perhaps independently. At all
     events we find the following in his splendid book of 1873: “Hence J II
     represents the electromotive contact force at the junction acting in the
     positive direction. . . . . Hence, the assumption that the potential of a
     metal is to be measured by that of the air in contact with it must be
     erroneous, and the greater part of Volta's electromotive force must be
     sought for, not at the junction of the two metals, but at one or both
     of the surfaces which separate the metals from the air or other medium
     which forms the third element of the circuit.”—“Treatise on Electricity

 with them (for example, the two electrodes of an insulated
 electrometer) when the two metals are separated after having
 been in metallic contact, makes it quite certain that there
 must be electric force in the air or aether in the neighbour
 hood of two opposed surfaces of different metals metallically
 connected. This conclusion I verified about thirty-six years
 ago by experiments described in a letter to Joule, of January 21,
 1862, which he communicated to the Literary and Philoso
 phical Society of Manchester, published in the ‘Proceedings’
 of the Society and in ‘Electrostatics and Magnetism’ (§ 400)
 under the title of “A New Proof of Contact Electricity.”
    § 26. Volta's second fundamental discovery also makes it
 certain that movable pieces of two metals, metallically con
nected, attract one another, except in the particular case when
their free surfaces are Volta-electrically neutral to one another.
This force, properly viewed, is a resultant of chemical affinity
between thin surface-layers of the two metals. And the work
done by it, when they are allowed to approach through any
distance towards contact between any parts of the surfaces, is
the dynamical equivalent of the portion of their heat of com
bination due to the approach towards complete chemical
combination constituted by the diminution of distance between
the two bodies. To fix the ideas, let the metals be two plane
parallel plates of zinc and copper, with distance between them
small in comparison with their diameters, and let us calculate
the amount of the attractive force between them at any distance.
Let V be the difference of potentials of the air or aether very
near the two metallic frontiers, but at distances from these
frontiers amounting at least to several times the distance
from molecule to nearest molecule in either metal (see foot
note on § 16 above).       The electric force in air or aether
between these surfaces will be W/D, if D denotes the distance
between them. Hence (our molecular microscopic binocular
set aside) if p is the electric density of either of the opposed
surfaces, A the area of either of the two, and P the attraction
between them, we have

 at all, to show by direct experiment, at any distance whatever,
 the force of attraction between the disks; as we see from the
 table, at a distance of 1/100 of a centim. it amounts to only
 1/400 of a milligramme-heaviness; and to only 2% grammes
 heaviness at the distance 10-" of a centimetre, which is about
    of the wave-length of ordinary yellow light. At the distances
 10-', 10-", 10-" of a centimetre the calculated forces of attrac

 force is 2 or 3 times the breaking-weight per square centim.

copper polished merely with emery-paper, opposed to zinc polished and
burnished.

106                      Lord Kelvin on
15 times that of zinc. We are therefore quite sure that the
increase of attraction according to the inverse square of the
distance is not continued to such small distances as 107" of
a centimetre ; and at distances less than this the electric
attraction merges into molecular force between the two
metals.
   § 29. Consider, now, a large number of discs of zinc and
copper, each of 1 square centim. area and thickness D, and
polished on both sides. On one side of each disc attach three
very small columns, of length D, of glass or other insulating
material, and place one disc on top of the insulators of
another, zinc and copper alternately, so as to make a       .
insulated pile of the metal discs separated by air spaces eac
equal to the thickness D. If in the building of this pile each
disc is kept metallically connected with the one over which it
is placed while it is being brought into its position, work will
be done upon it by electric attraction to the amount shown in
column 3, and the total work of electric attraction during the
building of the pile will be the amount shown in column 3
multiplied by one less than the number of discs.
   But if each disc, after being metallically connected with the
one on which it is to be placed till it comes within some con
siderable distance—say 300 D, for example, from the disc
over which it is to rest—is then disconnected and kept insu
lated while carried to its position in the pile, no work will be
done on it by electric attraction. And if now, lastly, metallic
connexion is made between all the discs of the pile, currents
pass from each copper to each zinc disc, and heat is generated
to an amount equal to that shown in column 4, multiplied by
 one less than the number of discs; and if this heat is allowed
 to become uniformly diffused through the metals, they rise in
 temperature to the extent shown in column 6.
    All these statements assume that the electric attraction
 increases according to the inverse square of the distance
 between opposed faces of zinc and copper. We have already
 (§ 28) seen that this assumption cannot be extended to such
 small distances as 107" of a centimetre.         We have now
 further proof of this conclusion beyond the possibility of
 doubt, because the large numbers in columns 5 and 6 for
 10 * are enormously greater than any rational estimate we
 can conceive for the heat of combination of equal parts of
 zinc and copper per gramme of the brass formed. (See § 32
 below.)
    § 30. When, on a Friday evening in February 1883–
 fourteen years ago—quoting from an article which had been
 published in Nature” in 1879, I first brought these views

                   Contact Electricity of Metals.                 107
before the Royal Institution, we had no knowledge of the
amount of heat of combination of zinc and copper, nor indeed
of any other two metals. It appeared probable to us, from
Volta's discovery of contact electricity between dry metals,
that there must be some heat of combination; but I could
then only express keenly-felt discontent with our ignorance
of its amount. Now, however, after twenty-seven years'
endurance, I am happily relieved since yesterday by Professor
 Roberts-Austen, who most kindly undertook to              id:  me in
my preparations for this evening, with an investigation on
the heat of combination of copper and zinc, by which he has
 found that the melting together of 30 per cent. of zinc with
 70 per cent. of copper generates about 36 heat-units (gramme
 water-Cent.) per gramme of the brass formed. I am sure
 you will all join with me in hearty thanks to him, both for
 this result and for his further great kindness in letting us now
 See a very beautiful experiment, demonstrating a large amount
 of heat of combination between aluminium and copper, in
 illustration of his mode of experimenting with zinc and copper,
 which could not be so conveniently put before you because
 of the dense white fumes inevitable when zinc is melted in the
  open air.

     § 31. Another method of investigating the heat of combi
  nation of metals, which I have long had in my mind, is to
  compare the heat evolved by the solution of an alloy in an
  acid with the sum of the heats of combination of its two con
  stituents in mixed powders. The former quantity must be
  less than the latter by exactly the amount of the heat of com
  bination. This investigation was undertaken a month ago by
  Mr. Galt in the Physical Laboratory of the University of
   Glasgow, and he has already obtained promising results; but
  many   º difficulties, as was to
  presented themselves, and must be overcome

      |Added Feb. 1898.-By dissolving a gramme of a pow

                                 (i.) 508 zinc with 49.2 copper,
                           and (ii.) 77.4 silver with 22:6 copper.
    The composition stated for the alloy in each case is the
 result of chemical analysis. No. I. was intended to be equal
 parts of zinc and copper (as being approximately the chemi
 cally combining proportions); but the alloy, which resulted
 from melting together equal parts, was found to have 4 per
 cent. more copper than zinc, there having no doubt been con
 siderable loss of the melted zinc by evaporation. No. III.
 turned out on analysis to be, as intended, very nearly in the
 chemically combining proportions of silver and copper.
 No. IV. was intended to be equal parts of silver and copper,
 but analysis showed the deviation from equality stated in the
 table. }. proportions of No. II. were chosen for the sake
 of comparison with Professor Roberts-Austen's result (§ 30),
 and the agreement (34:6 and 36) is much closer than could
 have been expected, considering the great difference of the
 two methods and the great difficulties in the way of obtaining
 exact results which each method presents.
    From a chemical point of view it is interesting to see,
from Mr. Galt's results, how much more, both in the case of
copper and zinc, and copper and silver, the heat of combination
is, when the proportions are approximately the chemically
combining proportions, than when they differ from these pro
portions to the extents found in Alloys II. and IV. Mr. Galt

 intends, in continuance of his investigation, to determine as
 accurately as he can the heats of combination of many different
alloys of zinc and copper and of silver and copper, and so to
 find whether or not it is greatest when the proportions are
 exactly the chemically “combining proportions.” He hopes
also to make similar experiments with bismuth and antimony,
 using aqua regia as solvent.]
    [$ 32. February, 1898–Looking now to column 5 of the
 table of § 27, we see from Professor Roberts-Austen’s result,
 36 thermal units, for the heat of combination of 30 per cent.
 copper with 70 per cent. zinc, and from Galt's 77 thermal
 units for equal parts of copper and zinc, that the law of
 electric action on which the calculations of the tables are
 founded is utterly disproved for discs of metal of one one
 thousand-millionth of a centimetre thickness, with air or aether
 spaces between them of the same thickness, but is not dis
proved for thicknesses of one one-hundred-millionth of a
centimetre.
   Consider now our ideal insulated pile (§ 29) of discs 10-8
of a centimetre thick, with air or aether spaces of the same
thickness between them. Suddenly establish metallic con
nexion between all the discs. The consequent electric
currents will generate 7-4 thermal units, and heat the disks by
79°C. Take again the insulated column with thicknesses
and distances of 10-" of a centimetre ; remove the ideal glass
separators and diminish the distance to 10-" of a centimetre
(the thicknesses of discs being still 10-5 of a centimetre).
Now, with these smaller distances between two opposed areas,
make metallic contact throughout the column by bending the
corners (the discs for convenience being now supposed
square): 74 thermal units will be immediately generated,
and the discs will rise 790° in temperature, and we have a
column of hot brass—perhaps solid, perhaps liquid. This last
statement assumes that the law of electric action, on which
the table is founded, holds for discs 10-% of a centimetre
thick, with aether or air spaces between them of 10-" of a centi
metre. In reality it is probable that the law of electric action
for discs 10-% of a centimentre thick, begins to merge into
more complicated results of intermolecular forces, before
the distance is as small as 10-% of a centimetre.
   Resuming our mental molecular microscopic binocular
(§ 16, footnote), we cannot avoid seeing molecular structures
beginning to be perceptible at distances of the hundred
millionth of a centimetre, and we may consider it as highly
probable that the distance from any point in a molecule of
copper or zinc to the nearest corresponding point of another

     110                      Lord Kelvin on
     molecule is less than one one-hundred-millionth, and greater
     than one one-thousand-millionth of a centimetre.]
        § 33. In all that precedes I have, by frequent repetition of
     the phrase “air or aether,” carefully kept in view the truth
     that the dry Volta contact-electricity of metals is, in the
     main, independent of the character of the insulating medium
     occupying space around and between the metals concerned
     in each experiment, and depends essentially on the chemical
     and physical conditions of molecules of matter in the thin
     surface stratum between the interior homogeneous metal and
     the external space, occupied by aether and dry or moist atmo
     spheric air or any gas or vapour which does not violently
     attack the metal: or by aether with vapours only of mercury
     and glass and platinum and steel and vaseline (caulking the
     glass-stopcocks), as in Bottomley’s experiments (§ 14 above).
        This truth has always seemed to me convincingly demon
     strated by Volta's own experiments, and I have never felt
     that that conviction needed further foundation ; though of
     course I have not considered quite needless or uninstructive
     Pfaff’s and my own and Pellat's repetitions and verifications,
     in different gases at different pressures, and Bottomley’s
     extension of the demonstration to vacuum of 2% millionths of
     an atmosphere. I am now much interested to see by
     Professor Oliver Lodge's report, already referred to (§ 4
     above), that in the Bakerian Lecture to the Royal Society in
      1806", Sir Humphry Davy, who had had contemporaneous
     knowledge of Volta's first and second discoveries, expressed
     himself thus clearly as to the validity of the second : “Before
     the experiments of M. Volta on the electricity excited by mere
     contact of metals were published, I had to a certain extent
      adopted this opinion,” an opinion of Fabroni’s ; “but the
     new fact immediately proved that another power must
     necessarily be concerned, for it was not possible to refer the
     electricity exhibited by the opposition of metallic surfaces to
     any chemical alterations, particularly as the effect is more dis
      tinct in a dry atmosphere, in which even the most oxidizable
     metals do not change, than in a moist one, in which many
      metals undergo oxidation.”
         § 34. It is curious to find, thirty or forty years later, De la
      Rive explaining away Volta’s second discovery by moisture
      in the atmosphere ! Fifty-one years ago, when I first learned
º:ºi  Volta’s second discovery, by buying, in Paris, apparatus by
      which it has ever since been shown in the ordinary lectures
      of my class in the University of Glasgow, I was warned that
      De la Rive had found it wrong, and had proved it to be due
                              # Phil. Trans. 1807,

to oxidation of the zinc by moisture from the air. I soon
tested the value of this warning by the experiments of § 5
above, and a considerable variety of equivalent experiments,
in one of which (real or ideal, I cannot remember which), a
varnished zinc disc, scratched in places and moistened, some
times on the scratched parts and sometimes where the varnish
was complete, was tested in the usual manner by separating
from contact with an unvarnished or varnished copper disc,
with or without metallic connexion when the discs were at
their nearest.
              [S$ 35–40 are added in February 1898.]
      35. Within the last eighteen or twenty years there has
been a tendency among some writers to fall back upon De la
Rive’s old hypothesis, of which there are signs in expressions
quoted by Professor Oliver Lodge in his great and valuable
report of 1884, and in some statements also of Professor
Lodge's own views.
   In what is virtually a continuation of this report in the
Phil. Mag. a year later*, we find the following with
reference to writings of Helmholtz and myself on the con
tact-electricity of metals:—“Both these contact theories, in
explaining the Volta effect, ignore the existence of the
oxidizing medium surrounding the metals. My view explains
the whole effect as the result of this oxygen bath, and of the
chemical strain by it set up.” With views seemingly un
changed, he returned to the subject at the end of 1897 with
the following statement in the printed syllabus of his “Six
Lectures adapted to a Juvenile Auditory, on the Principles of
the Electric Telegraph’’ (Royal Institution, December 28,
1897, January 8, 1898):-
    “Chemical method of producing a current—Voltaic cell—
Two differently oxidizable metals immersed in an oxidizing
liquid and connected by a wire can maintain an electric
current, through the liquid and through the wire, so long
as the circuit is closed. [The same two metals immersed
in a potentially oxidizing gas and connected by a wire, can
maintain an electric force or voltaic difference of potential
in the space between them.]
    “N.B.-No one need try too hard to understand sentences
in brackets.”
    And lastly, after some correspondence which passed between
 us in December, I have to-day (Feb. 14) received from him
   * Prof. O. Lodge “On the Seat of the Electromotive Force in a Voltaic

bath in the experiments of § 2 above with varnished plates of
zinc and copper ? or in Erskine Murray’s experiment, de
scribed in his paper communicated last August to the Royal
Society, in which metallic surfaces, scraped under melted
paraffin so as to remove condensed oxygen or nitrogen from
them, and leave fresh metallic surfaces in contact with a
hydro-carbon, are subjected to the Voltaic experiment 2 or in
Pfaff’s and my own and Pellat’s experiments with different
gases, at ordinary and at low pressures, substituted for air :
or in Bottomley’s high vacuum and hydrogen and oxygen
experiments (§ 14 above) *

ment, shown at the commencement of my lecture (§ 1 above),

 if it had been performed in some locality of the universe a
 thousand kilometres away from any place where there is
 oxygen 2 The insulators may be supposed to be made of
 rock-salt or solid paraffin, so that there may be no oxygen in
 any part of the apparatus. This I say because I understand
 that some anti-Voltaists have explained Bottomley’s experi
 ments by the presence of vapour of silica from the glass,
supplying the supposedly needful oxygen
    § 37. The anti-Voltaists seem to have a superstitious venera
tion for oxygen. Oxygen is entitled to respect because it
constitutes 50 per cent, of all the chemical elements in the
earth’s crust; but this gives it no title for credit as coefficient
with zinc and copper in the dry Volta experiment, when there
is none of it there. Oxygen has more affinity for zinc than
for copper; so has chlorine and so has iodine. It is partially
true that different metals—gold, silver, platinum, copper,
iron, nickel, bismuth, antimony, tin, lead, zinc, aluminium,
sodium—are for dry Volta contact-electricity in the order of
their affinities for oxygen; but it is probably quite as nearly
true that they are in the order of their affinities for sulphur,
or for oxy-sulphion (SO) or for phosphorus or for chlorine
or for bromine. It may or may not be true that metals can
be unambiguously arranged in order of their affinities for
any of these named substances; it is certainly true that they
cannot be definitely and surely arranged in respect to their
dry Volta contact-electricity. Murray's burnishing, performed
on a metal which has been treated with Pellat’s washing with
alcohol and subsequent scratching and polishing with emery,
alters the Volta quality of its surface far more than enough
to change it from below to above several metals polished only
by emery; and, in fact, Pellat had discovered large differences
due to molecular condition without chemical difference, before
Murray extended this fundamental discovery by finding the
effect of burnishing.
   § 38. Returning to Professor Lodge's supposed oxygen
bath (§ 35); if it exists between the zinc and copper plates,
it diminishes or annuls or reverses the phenomenon, to explain
which he invokes its presence (see § 5 above).
   § 39. Many years ago I found that ice, or hot glass,
pressed on opposite sides by polished zinc and copper, pro
duced deviations from the metallic zero of the quadrants of
an electrometer metallically connected with them in the same
direction as if there had been water in place of the ice or hot
glass. From this I inferred that ice and hot glass, both of
which had been previously known to have notable electric
conductivity, acted as electrolytic conductors.
   Phil. Mag. S. 5. Wol. 46. No. 278. July 1898.            I

114                       Lord Kelvin on
   Experiments made by Maclean and Goto in the Physical
Laboratory of the University of Glasgow in 1890", proved
that polished zinc and polished copper, with fumes passing
up between them from the flame of a spirit-lamp 30 centi
metres below, gave, when metallically connected to the
quadrants of an electrometer, deviations from the metallic
zero in the same direction, and of nearly the same amount,
as if cold water had been in place of the flame. This proved
that flame acted as an electrolytic conductor. They also
 found that hot air from a large red-hot soldering bolt, put in
the place of the spirit-lamp, had no such effect; nor had
breathing upon the plates, nor the vapour of hot water, any
effect of the kind. In fact hot air, and either cloudy or clear
steam, act as very excellent insulators ; but there is some
wonderful agency in fumes from a flame, remaining even in
cooled fumes, in virtue of which the electric effect on zinc
and copper is nearly the same as if continuous water, instead
of fumes, were between the plates and in contact with bothf.
   A similar conclusion in respect to air traversed by ultra
violet light was proved by Righi f, Hallwachs $, Elster and
Geitel ||, Branly". The same was proved for ordinary atmo
spheric air, with Röntgen rays traversing it between plates of
zinc and copper, by Mr. Erskine Murray, in an experiment
suggested by Professor J. J. Thomson, and carried out in the
Cavendish Laboratory of the University of Cambridge **.
   § 40. The substitution for ordinary air between zinc and
copper, of ice or hot glass, or of air or gas modified by flame
or by ultra-violet rays, or by Röntgen rays, or by uranium
 (§§ 41, 42 below), gives us, no doubt, what would to some
degree fulfil Professor Lodge's idea of a “potentially-oxidiz
ing” gas, and each one of the six fails wholly or partially to
“maintain electric force or voltaic difference of potential in
the space between them.” In fact, Professor Lodge's brac
keted sentence, so far as it can be understood, would be nearer
the truth if in it “cannot ” were substituted for “can.”      I
hope no reader will consider this sentence too short or sharp.
I am quite sure that Professor Lodge will approve of its tone,
because in his letter to me of the 14th, he says, “In case of
divergence of view it is best to have both aspects stated as

           Continuation of Lecture of May 24, 1897.
   § 41. In conclusion, I bring before you one of the most
wonderful discoveries of the century now approaching its
conclusion, made by the third of three great men, Antoine
Becquerel, Edmond Becquerel, Henri Becquerel— father, son,
and grandson—who by their inventive genius and persevering
labour have worthily contributed to the total of the scientific
work of their time; a total which has rendered the nine
teenth century more memorable than any one of all the
twenty-three centuries of scientific history which preceded it,
excepting the seventeeth century of the Christian era.
   You see this little box which I hold in my right hand, just
as I received it three months ago from my friend Professor
Moissan, who will be here this day week to show you his
isolation of fluorine. It induces electric conductivity in the
air all round it. If I were to show you an experiment
proving this, you might say it is witchcraft. But here is the
witch. You see, when I open the box, a piece of uranium of
about the size of a watch. This production of electric con
ductance in air is only one of many marvels of the “uranium
rays” discovered a year ago by Henri Becquerel, of no other
of which can I now speak to you, except that the wood and
paper of this box, and my hand, are to some degree trans
parent for them.
   I now take the uranium out of its box and lay it on this
horizontal copper plate, fixed to the insulated electrode of the
electrometer. I fix a zinc plate, supported by a metal stem
which is in metallic connexion with the sheath of the elec
trometer, horizontally over the copper plate at a distance of
about one centimetre from the top of the uranium. Look at
the spot of light; it has already settled to ..", nearly the
position which you remember it took when we had a water
arc between the copper and zinc plates, connected as now,
copper to insulated quadrants and zinc to the sheath. I now
lift the uranium, insulating it from the copper plate by three
very small pieces of solid paraffin, so as to touch neither plate,
or, again, to touch the zinc but not the copper. This change
makes but little difference to the spot of light. I tilt the
uranium now to touch the zinc above and the copper below ;
the spot of light comes to the metallic zero as nearly as you
                               I 2

116                         Lord Kelvin on
can see.      I leave it to itself now, resting on its paraffin
supports and not touching the zinc, and the spot of light goes
back to where it was ; showing about three-quarters of a volt
positive.
    § 42. I now take this copper wire, which is metallically
connected with the zinc plate and the sheath of the electro
meter, and bring it to touch the under side of the copper
shelf on which the uranium is supported by its paraffin insu
lators. Instantly the spot of light moves towards the metallic
zero, and after a few vibrations settles there. I break the
 contact; instantly the spot of light begins to return to its
 previous position, where it settles again in less than half a
minute. You see, therefore, that if I re-make and keep made
 the metallic contact between the zinc and copper plates, a
 current is continuously maintained through the connecting
 wire, by which heat is generated and radiated away, or carried
 away by the air, as long as the contact is kept made. What
 is the source of the energy thus produced ? If we took away
 the uranium, and sent cool fumes from a spirit-lamp, or shed
 Röntgen rays or ultra-violet light, between the zinc and
 copper, the results of breaking and making contact would
 be just what you see with uranium. So would they be—
 #. have already, in fact, seen them (§ 5)—without either
   Öntgen rays or ultra-violet light, but with the copper and
 zinc a little closer together and with a drop of water between
 them : and so would they be with dry ice, or with hot glass,
 between and touched by the zinc and copper. In each of
 these six cases we have a source of energy; the well-known
 electro-chemical energy given by the oxidation of zinc in the
 last-mentioned three cases; and the energy drawn upon by
 the cooled fumes, or by the Röntgen rays or ultra-violet light,
 acting in some hitherto unexplained manner, in the three
 other cases. We may conjecture evaporations of metals; we
 have but little confidence in the probability of the idea. Or
  does it depend on metallic carbides mixed among the metallic
  uranium ? I venture on no hypothesis. M. Becquerel has
  given irrefragable proof of the truth of his discovery of
  radiation from uranium of something which we must admit to
  be of the same species as light, and which may be compared
  with phosphorescence. When the energy drawn upon by
  this light is known, then, no doubt, the quasi electrolytic
  phenomena, induced by uranium in air ", which you have
     * Experiments made in the Physical Laboratory of the University of
  Glasgow   §   33 of Kelvin, Beattie, and Smolan, Proc. R. S. E.; also
   Nature, March 11, 1897, and Phil. Mag. March 1898) show this electro
  lytic conductivity to be produced by uranium to nearly the same amount

seen, will be explained by the same dynamical and chemical
principles as those of the previously known electrolytic action
of cooled fumes from a spirit-lamp, and of air traversed by
Röntgen rays or ultra-violet light.
                              APPENDIX +.
          On a Method of Measuring Contact Electricity.
IN my reprint of papers on Electrostatics and Magnetism
(§ 400, of original date, January 1862) I described briefly
this method, in connexion with a new physical principle, for
exhibiting contact electricity by means of copper and zinc
quadrants substituted for the uniform brass quadrants of my
quadrant electrometer. In an extensive series of experiments
which I made in the years 1859–61, I had used the same
method, but with movable disks for the contact electricity,
after the method of Volta, and my own quadrant electrometer
substituted for the gold-leaf electroscope by which Volta
himself obtained his electric indications.
   I was on the point of transmitting to the Royal Society a
paper which I had written describing these experiments, and
which I still have in manuscript, when I found a paper by
Hankel in Poggendorf’s Annalen for January, 1862, in
which results altogether in accordance with my own were
given, and I withheld my paper till I might be able not
merely to describe a new method, but if possible add some
thing to the available information regarding the properties of
matter to be found in Hankel’s paper. I have made many
experiments from time to time since 1861 by the same method,
but have obtained results merely confirmatory of what had
been published by Pfaff in 1820 or 1821, showing the
phenomena of contact electricity to be independent of the
surrounding gas, and agreeing in the main with the numerical
values of the contact differences of different metals which
Hankel had published ; and I have therefore hitherto pub
lished nothing except the slight statements regarding contact
electricity which appear in my ‘Electrostatics and Mag
netism.” As interest has been recently revived in the subject
in common air, oxygen, and carbonic acid; and to about one-third of the
same amount in hydrogen, at ordinary atmospheric pressure; but only to
about a g of this amount in each of these four gases at pressures of two
or three millimetres. There seems every reason to believe that it would
be non-existent in high vacuum, such as that reached by Bottomley in his
                           É
Volta-contact experiments 14 above).

118                       Lord Kelvin on
of contact electricity, the following description of my method
may possibly prove useful to experimenters. . The same
method has been used to very good effect, but with a Bohnen
berger electroscope instead of my quadrant electrometer, in
researches on contact electricity by M. H. Pellat, described
in the Journal de Physique for May 1880.
    The apparatus used in these experiments was designed to
 secure the following conditions:—To support, within a metallic
 sheath, two circular discs of metal about four inches in dia
 meter in such a way that the opposing surfaces should be
 exactly parallel to each other and approximately horizontal,
 and that the distance between them might be varied at
 pleasure from a shortest distance of about one-fiftieth of an
 inch to about a quarter or half an inch. This part of the
 apparatus I have called a “Volta-condenser.” The lower
 plate, which was the insulated one, was fixed on a glass stem
 rising from the centre of a cast-iron sole plate. The upper
 plate was suspended by a chain to the lower end of a brass
 rod sliding through a steadying socket in the upper part of the
  sheath. An adjustable screw on this stem prevents the upper
  plate from being let down to nearer than about one-fiftieth
  of an inch, or whatever shortest distance may be wanted in
  any particular case. A stout brass flange fixed to the lower
  end of this rod bears three screws, one of which S is shown in
  the drawing, by which the upper plate can be adjusted to
  parallelism to the lower plate. The other apparatus used
  consisted of a quadrant electrometer, and in my original
  experiments an ordinary Daniell’s cell, in my later ones a
  gravity Daniell’s cell of the form which I described in
  ‘ Proc. R. S.,’ 1871 (pp. 253–259), with a divider by which
  any integral number of per cents. from 0 to 100 of the electro
  motive force of the cell could be established between any two
  mutually insulated homogeneous metals in the apparatus.
      Connecions.—The insulated plate was connected by a brass
  wire passing through the case of the Volta-condenser to the
  electrode of the insulated pair of quadrants. The upper plate
  was connected to the metal sheath of the Volta-condenser,
  and to the metal case of the electrometer, one pair of quad
  rants of which were also connected to the case.      One of the
  two terminals of the divider, connected to the poles of the
  cell, was connected to the case of the electrometer.     To the
  third terminal (the bar carrying the slider) was attached one
  of the contact wires, which was a length of copper wire
  having soldered to its outer end a short piece of platinum.
  The other contact surface was a similar short piece of platinum
  fixed to the insulated electrode of the electrometer.     Hence
  it will be seen that metallic connexion between the two plates

                  Contact Electricity of Metals.                     119
was effected by putting the divider at zero and bringing into
contact the two pieces of platinum wire.
   Order of Experiment.—The sliding piece of the divider was
put to zero, and contact made and broken, and the upper
plate raised : then the deflexion of the spot of light was
observed. These operations were repeated with the sliding
piece at different numbers on the divider scale, until one was
found at which the make-break and separation caused no
perceptible deflexion. The number thus found on the divider
scale was the percentage of the electromotive force of the
Daniell cell, which was equal to the contact electric difference
of the plates in the Volta-condenser.
   [Addendum, November 23, 1880.-Since the communica
tion of this paper to the British Association, I have found
that a dry platinum disc, kept for some time in dry hydrogen
gas, and then put into its position in dry atmospheric air in
the apparatus for contact electricity, i. positive to
another platinum disc which had not been so treated, but had
simply been left undisturbed in the apparatus. The positive
quality thus produced by the hydrogen diminishes gradually,
and becomes insensible after two or three days.]
   P.S.—On December 24, 1880, one of two platinum plates
in the Volta-condenser was taken out; placed in dried oxygen
gas for forty-five minutes; taken out, carried by hand, and
replaced in the Volta-condenser at 12.30 on that day. It was
then found to be negative to the platinum plate which had
been left undisturbed.     The amount of the difference was
about 33 of a volt. The plates were left undisturbed for
seventeen minutes in the condenser, and were then tested
again, and the difference was found to have fallen to 29 of a
volt. At noon on the 25th they were again tested, and the
difference found to be "18.     The differences had been tested
from time to time since that day, the plates having been left
in the condenser undisturbed in the intervals. The following
table shows the whole series of these results:–

   Mr. Rennie, by whom these experiments were made durin
the recent Christmas holidays, had previously experimente
on a platinum plate which had been made the positive pole in
an electrolytic cell with an electromotive force of one volt,
tending to decompose water acidulated with sulphuric acid :
the other pole being a piece of platinum wire. After the
º had       been one hour under this influence in the electro
 ytic cell he removed it, and dried it by lightly rubbing it
with a piece of linen cloth. He then placed it in the Volta
condenser, and found it to be negative to a platinum plate in
ordinary condition ; the difference observed was 27 of a
volt. This experiment was made on October 21 ; and on
November 8 it was found that the difference had fallen from
’27 to 07. Mr. Rennie also made similar experiments with
the platinum disc made the negative pole in an electrolytic
cell, and found that this rendered the platinum positive to
undisturbed platinum to a degree equal to about 04 of a volt.
The effect of soaking the platinum plate in dry hydrogen gas,
alluded to in my first postscript, ... also was observed by
Mr. Rennie, was found to be about 11 of a volt. Thus in the
case of polarization by hydrogen, as well as in the case of
polarization by oxygen, the effect of exposure to the dry gas
was considerably greater than the effect of electro-plating the
platinum with the gas by the electromotive force of one volt.

 IT is the object of this paper to show that       the positive and
       negative ions, which take part in the conduction of gases
 exposed to Röntgen rays, move with different velocities when
 in the same electric field; to determine the ratio of these
 velocities in several gases; and to consider various phenomena
 which are consequences of or are affected by the difference in
the two values.

  § 12. Remarks.
   The extension of the idea of ionization to the various types
of conduction through gases has enabled us to explain most of
the observed phenomena.
   While in many liquids some ionization occurs at ordinary
temperatures, in gases high temperatures are required, and
it is brought about, in addition, by the action of various
agents upon the cold gas.
   The   º        carriers that exist in the gas due to any of
these causes, and take part in the conduction, are all called
ions, no matter whether in the various cases they may differ
in their structure or properties.
   It is known from the changes in concentration at the two
electrodes that in liquids the two ions do not move with the
same velocity; and this is attributed to a difference in size.
In gases a difference of velocity has not heretofore been
determined.
   A. Schuster (Proc. Roy. Soc. xlvii. p. 553) gives some
reasons for believing that the negative ions in gases move
faster than the positive ones; and J. J. Thomson (Phil. Mag.
Dec. 1895) explains some phenomena in electrodeless tubes
by assuming that the negative ion in oxygen and hydrogen
travels faster than the positive one. Rutherford (Phil. Mag,
Nov. 1897, p. 436), in determining separately the velocities
of the two ions in air for conduction under the influence of
Röntgen rays, did not observe any difference.
   The dependence of the quantitative values obtained in
                                   i
certain determinations (§ 9 and 10) upon the sign of the
electrification used led me to undertake the present investi
gation, in which it is shown that a difference of velocity does
exist, and its amount is determined.
   While methods are not wanting for determining with more
or less accuracy the sum of the two velocities, a reliable method

122 Prof. J. Zeleny on the Ratio of the Velocities of the
for obtaining the two velocities separately has not yet been
devised.
     The method described below deals with the ratio of the two
velocities, which is the quantity under consideration. The
two actual velocities can, if desired, be obtained by means of
this ratio from the value of the sum.
                         § 1. The Method.
     The method employed for determining the ratio of the
velocities of the two ions is based on opposing a stream of
gas to the velocity due to the electric forces.
                               Fig. 1.
     Suppose A and B in fig. 1 to represent two plates made of
 wire gauze, the space between which is exposed to Röntgen
 rays. If the plates are connected to the opposite poles of a
 battery C which maintains a potential-difference of U volts
 between them, then if d is the distance between the plates in
 centimetres, and we suppose for the present a uniform
   Motential gradient, the fall of potential between them is
dt
     volts per centimetre.
     Under the action of this electric force the ions move in
 opposite directions between the plates, and if u is the velocity
 with which a positive ion moves and v that with which a
 negative one moves when the potential gradient is one volt
 per centimetre, then the velocities of the positive and negative
 ions are   “I and   wº  respectively.
     These velocities may be increased either by increasing U or
by decreasing d.

      Two Ions produced in Gases by Röntgen Radiation. 123
   Suppose now a current of gas to move through the plates
from A to B, having in all of its parts a uniform velocity of
H centimetres per second.
   The resulting velocity for theº ions will be H-u              y
and for the negative ones H+ "d
   By properly changing the value of U the positive ions can
be .. to move from A to B, from B to A, or to have a zero
resultant velocity.
   In the last case H = u d'
   By reversing the poles of the battery C the negative ions
can in turn be forced to move against the stream, and a
potential-difference W be found such that now
                                   V
                               - v —; .
                                    d
   Hence it follows that
                            # Y.
   In practice, however, it is impossible to obtain a perfectly
uniform stream of gas, or a uniform potential gradient between
the plates. The potential gradient is changed by the presence
of free charges due to the separation of the two kinds of ions
(§ 11); and the electric force thus varies for different points
between the plates, and it cannot be assumed to be propor
tional at any point to the voltages used on the plates. This
necessitates the experimental determination of the potential
gradient between the plates, as from it is obtained the actual
electric force which acts to bring the ions to either plate.
  Owing to the irregularities in the gas-stream, some ions reach
the plate A while their velocity due to the electric force
is less than the average velocity of the opposing blast; so
that it is not possible to find very accurately when the two
opposed velocities are equal by simply increasing gradually
the electric force, and observing the charges that reach the
plate.
   But the irregularities that exist in the gas-stream are quite
uniform when averaged over a period of time, so that for
different determinations the gas-blast may be considered as
an unknown constant quantity. And for obtaining the ratio
of the two ionic velocities, instead of finding under what
electric forces the two ionic velocities are separately just
equal to that of the blast, it is sufficient to find what electric

    124     Prof. J. Zeleny on the Ratio of the Velocities of the
    forces must be used in the two cases respectively, in order to
    #."   the same charge to the plate, against the same blast, in
    the same time.     The two ionic velocities then bear the same
    relation to that of the gas-stream, and to find the ratio of the
    two velocities for the same electric force it is only necessary
    to take the inverse ratio of the electric forces used in this
    case. Thus, if U is the potential-difference between the plates
    required to force a certain number of positive ions to the
    plate A in a given time against the gas-current, and if V
    must be used to drive the same number of negative ones under
    the same conditions against the same blast, then if U' and V"
    are the experimentally determined potential gradients effec
    tive in bringing the ions to the plate A, in the two cases
    respectively,
                        ul]" = K, and wV"- K,
    where K is a constant depending upon the velocity and nature of
    the blast used, and upon the rate at which the ions are brought
    to the plate.
       Hence

       The ratio  U’ as found experimentally (§ 11) for the appa
                  Wi
    ratus used (§ 2) is nearly equal to V : the ratio of the potentials
    used, the deviation being, for the most part, due to the differ
  |
    ences in the distribution of the free charges in the two cases,
    caused by the difference between the velocity of the two ions.
                           § 2. The Apparatus.
      The apparatus used for carrying out this method was arranged
    as is shown in fig. 2.
       P and Q are two 9 centim. square brass plates.               To
|   openings in their centres are attached the brass tubes R and
    S of 3.6 centim. diameter, which are fastened to the board N
    so that the two plates are parallel and 4 centim. apart. The
    space between the plates is made to form a closed box by
    covering the top and sides by glass plates which are blackened
    uniformly on the inside surfaces with lamp-black for preventing
    the accumulation of static charges.
       K is a wire gauze covering completely the opening in Q,
    and T is an insulated circular wire gauze with 7 meshes per
    centimetre, which is placed in, but does not quite fill, the
    opening in the plate P. The wire that supports it leads
    through the ebonite plug M to a pair of quadrants of the

      Two Ions produced in Gases by Röntgen Radiation. 125
electrometer E, which may be connected to earth by the
key H.
                                       xO
   G is a plug of glass-wool which serves to make more
uniform the stream of gas, and to free it from dust and any
electric charge. The rubber tubes D and F lead to two gas
bags, each of a capacity of about 135 litres. By putting an
excess weight on the bag connected to D the gas is forced
through the apparatus into the second bag. It can then be
forced back and be used over again.
   The induction-coil and the tube are situated in a lead
covered box which is connected to earth, and of which C
represents the upper part.
   The rays from the source () pass through the aluminium
 window A and into the box P Q through its wooden bottom.
 By means of the adjustable lead strips I, the rays can be pre
 vented from impinging upon the plates P and Q, and the
 amount of gas exposed can be regulated. The plate P is
 connected to earth while Q is connected to one pole of the
 storage-battery B, the other pole of which is also to earth.
   When the rays are entering PQ and the ions are travelling
 in opposite directions in the box, the charges they give to P,
 Q, and K are conducted to earth, while those they give to T
 $.".       change its potential, and at an approximately uni
  orm rate so long as this potential is small compared to that
 of Q. When the distribution of the free charges in the gas
 has assumed a steady state, all changes in the potential of T
 are due to ions giving up their charges to it.
    If a stream .# gas is now blown through the apparatus in
 the direction from T to K, the ions moving against the stream
 in the direction from K to T travel slower than before, and
 the potential of T changes less rapidly.

   126 Prof. J. Zeleny on the Ratio of the Velocities of the
      A smaller number of the ions reach the gauze because more
   are lost on the way by recombination, similarly as when the
   ions move slower due to a smaller E.M.F. used.
      In addition, in this case, any accumulation of ions is opposed
   by their motion sidewise out of the current, due to their mutual
   repulsion to those parts where the accumulation is less.
      Again, if the velocity of the ions is but a little more than
   that of the opposed blast, some of the ions which tend to
   move against the gas-stream are blown away by the blast,
   since their presence, if moving in the other direction, would
   decrease the electric force below that sufficient to force the
   ions against the stream.
      When the ions are moving to the gauze T against the gas
   stream, none of them can pass between the meshes of the
   gauze into the tube R, as there is no electric force in that
   direction; but if the ions are moving with the stream, then
   some and even most of them can be blown through the gauze,
   to the wires of which the electric forces tend to draw them.
            § 3. A Form of Tule for Constant Radiation.
      It is of the utmost importance, if accurate work is to be
   done, to have a constant source of the Röntgen rays.
      Among a large number of tubes tried for this purpose one
   type has proved far better than the rest.
      The tubes of this class which I have so far employed have
   maintained a satisfactory constancy, until by prolonged use
   the glass became quite dark from the º sputtered from
   the electrodes.
      The general form of the tubes used is shown in fig. 3.
                                Fig. 3.
      The concave aluminium cathode is situated in the tube BC
   while the anode, made of a sheet of platinum backed by an
   aluminium disk, is situated in the bulb F. The parts back of
   both electrodes are covered by tightly fitting tinfoil. The
   little bulb D contains a small piece of §º which helps to
   maintain a constant vacuum by the state of equilibrium
   between the free and the absorbed gas. With the use of a
ºi

      Two Ions produced in Gases by Röntgen Radiation. 127
good interrupter, which is always a very important factor, a
comparatively uniform emission of rays is obtained, together
with a steady unwavering fluorescence.
    The main advantage of this form appears to lie in the fact
that the cathode is within the contracted part B C, which
during action remains quite free from surface electrification,
so that the flickerings |. to the surface discharges from this
part of the tube are absent.
    It has been found convenient in testing whether a tube is
giving out rays at a uniform rate, to employ two parallel
plates, one of which is connected to a constant source of po
tential and the other of which is connected at the same time
to an electrometer, and to earth through such a high resist
ance as a column of xylol. As rays are allowed to fall between
the two plates, conduction takes place between them, and the
plate that is connected with the electrometer-quadrants assumes
a certain potential such that the leak to earth through the high
resistance is equal to the current between the two plates.
Any variation in the intensity of the radiation is indicated by
al º in the electrometer-reading, so that
by simply watching this it is possible to see the amount and
 nature of the variations in the radiation.       With such an
 arrangement permanently set up one can conveniently com
 pare from time to time the strength of the rays which are
 being used for any purpose; or if an electrometer can be
 spared for this, the relative strength of the rays can be
 directly observed at any instant.
                  § 4. Manipulation and Results.
     In the practical working of the method the readings were
 taken in the following manner:—The pair of quadrants of the
 electrometer, connected with the gauze T, was joined to earth
  by means of the key H. The rays and blast were then
 allowed to run a short time so as to establish a steady state in
 the conducting gas between the two plates. The electrometer
  zero was now read, and the quadrants were disconnected from
  earth. At this instant a stop-watch was started, and a defi
  nite interval afterwards, usually 20 seconds, the rays were
  stopped by cutting off the current from the coil, and, finally,
  the  i.i. was read.                                          -
     The following table shows how, for air, the quantities of
  electricity which reach the gauze in a given time vary when
  the air-stream is kept constant while the potential of Q is
  varied in amount and sign.

     These results are shown graphically in fig. 4, where the
  abscissae represent the voltages used and ordinates the corre
  sponding deflexions obtained.
     At B the potential gradient has increased to such a value
  that the ions are beginning to make their way against the
  main blast of air. That some reach the gauze for points
  between A and B is due to irregularities in the stream of air.
  It is possible also that there are some few ions in a gas that
  travel faster than the majority of the ions.
     Curve I. represents the case when the negative ions, and
  curve II. the case when the positive ions are moving against
  the stream respectively.
     It is seen that the velocity of the positive ions for the same
  potential gradient is less than that of the negative ones, since
  to drive the same quantity to the gauze against the air-current
  a greater potential gradient is required for the positive than
  for the negative ions.
     In air the difference of velocity of the ions is quite large,
  but in some gases it is small or nothing at all,

   -         It appears that in carbonic acid gas the two ions travel
          with almost, if not exactly, the same velocity.
             Curve I. shows how the deflexions increased with the
          voltages used when there was no blast and the gas was at rest,
          and comparing with curve II. the retardation of the ions, due
          to the blast, is made apparent. Curve II. is in fact a displaced
          curve I., the displacement being caused by a decrease in the
          velocity of the ions produced by and equal to the velocity of
          the gas-stream. The electric force necessary to give to the
          ions a velocity equal to the average velocity of the blast is then
       -  obtained from the voltage represented by this displacement
          and from the distance between the plates. Thus, by measuring
          this  º        gradient and the velocity of the blast, the velocity
          of the ions can be determined.        The writer has not, in this    *
          investigation, attempted to develop this method, but it may
          be freer from objections and more accurate in practice than
     -
          methods heretofore used. A single determination made with
          air gave roughly for the velocities of the positive and negative
          ions respectively, 2:1 centim., and 2:6 centim. per second for
          a potential gradient of one volt per centimetre.

necessary not only to find two voltages for which the quantities
of electrification that reach the gauze in a given time are the
same for the two cases, but also to determine what in these
cases are the effective potential gradients producing the
motion against the gas-stream.
   The consideration of the gradients existing in the apparatus
used under these conditions is deferred to § 11, ". the
subject of potential gradients in gas conduction is treated.
It is there shown that although the actual gradients differ
considerably from a uniform gradient between the plates, yet
for the two cases in question the ratio of the effective gradients
is not much different from the ratio of the voltages used on
the charged plate.
   The difference that exists between these two ratios has been
treated as a correction which has to be added to the ratio of
the two voltages used, and which amounts to about 2 per cent.
for the case of air.
   In using curves like those shown in fig. 4 for obtaining
the ratio of the voltages required to give the same deflexion
with the two kinds of ions respectively, the ratio is simply
taken of the abscissae corresponding to two points on the
curves which have equal ordinates, as is indicated by the
dotted lines.                 -
   The place on the curves that is used must be above the
turning-point B of the curves, but must not be so high as to
be near the turn in the curves which appears when the
saturation value of the electric current is approached. In
practice the parts of the curves in the neighbourhood of the
letter C were used, as deemed most favourable for accuracy.
However, in making a determination the values are not best
obtained from     ºil.     Cul"VeS.
   The curves are found simply as a preliminary part of the
operation, so as to be able to tell what are the proper potentials
to employ for the particular gas and blast in question.
 Suppose that in the case shown in fig. 4 it is decided to use
 –60 volts for the potential of the charged plate when the
 negative ions are dealt with ; it is seen that to obtain an
 equal deflexion with the positive ions a voltage between + 72
 volts and +74 volts must be used.       To determine the exact
 value readings are taken, as described, with the plate Q

charged in succession to —60, +72, and + 74 volts, and these
are repeated several times. From the deflexions obtained
when the + 72 and +74 volts were used, the exact voltage
is found by interpolation which would give the same numerical
deflexion as was obtained with the – 60 volts.
   The ratio of the potential values thus found, plus the cor
rection necessary to reduce this to actual potential gradients,
  ives the required value of the ratio of the two ionic velocities.
i.   using different velocities for the gas-blast, determinations
are made by the use of entirely different sets of potential
values.

     § 5. Difference of Velocity shown by Blowing along a
*                        Charged Wire,
   A simple way for showing the difference of velocity for the
two ions in air is to expose to the rays or to blow Rönt
genized air into an aluminium tube which is connected to
earth, and in the axis of which is supported an aluminium
wire that can be charged from a battery.
   During the conduction through the air there is an excess
of ions near the wire and by the wall of the tube, of the
kind that is moving towards these two places respectively.
   If by a proper arrangement a current of air is blown only
along the surface of the wire and out through an insulated
tube filled with glass-wool which is connected to an electro
meter, then when the wire is charged negatively a greater
quantity of positive electrification is blown out into the glass
wool than is obtained of negative when the wire is charged
positively to the same voltage. This shows that the positive
ions are moving across the tube in the electric field with a
smaller velocity than are the negative, since they are more
readily carried away by the same stream of air, blown at right
angles to the electric force (see § 9 and § 10).
         § 6. Difference of Velocity shown by using an
                       Alternating E.M. F.
   Another way to show the difference of velocity of the two
ions produced in air is to use an alternating E.M.F. between
two parallel plates, or between the wire and the tube in the
arrangement described in § 5.
   In the case of the two parallel plates which are connected
to a source of alternating E.M.F., and the space between
which is exposed to the rays, the rapidly alternating electric
force causes the ions to travel back and forth between the
plates over paths whose lengths are determined by the period
of alternation, by the average value of the potential gradient
between the plates, and by the velocity of the ions themselves.
   Those near the plates are brought against the sides ;
but if the velocity of the two ions were the same there
would be no permanent separation of the two kinds, and so
no formation of a free charge anywhere between the plates.
But since the velocity of the negative ions is greater than
that of the positive, these, at each alternation, are brought
to the plates from a greater distance than are the positive,
and there is thus left an excess of positive ions in the

  134    Prof. J. Zeleny on the Ratio of the Velocities of the
  space between the plates. By blowing the air into a tube
 containing glass-wool these are collected, and give a positive
 deflexion on an electrometer connected to the tube.
     If the plates are moved so close together that in the
 excursions which the positive ions make during an alternation
 they travel a distance greater or equal to that between the
  plates, then at every alternation of the E.M.F. all of the ions
 in the space between, both positive and negative, are forced to
 the plates, and a stream of air does not now carry away with
 it any charge.
     The path traversed by a positive ion in the time of an
 alternation is the distance between the plates when a current
 of air just ceases to carry away a charge ; and this can be
 made the basis for a determination of the velocity of this ion.
    § 7. Metals and Air oppositely Charged when exposed to
                          Röntgen Rays.
    The results of various observers differ as to whether metals
 and air which are exposed to Röntgen rays are left charged
 positively, negatively, or not at all.
    Some of this confusion has already been cleared away by
 the fact that when two different metals are dealt with at
 the same time, the effects observed are due, at least approxi
 mately, to a reduction of the charges on the metals due to the
 contact-difference of potential.
    But there still remain those cases where a piece of metal
 is enclosed on all sides by parts made of the same metal. It
is evident that if the metal receives a charge from the
ionized air, this itself must remain electrified with a charge
 of the opposite sign.                               -
    It will be shown that an electrification does take place,
 and that a metal placed in air which is, or recently has
 been, exposed to     º          radiation receives a negative
 charge while the air itself remains positively electrified.
 The cause of this effect will first be pointed out, and then
the arrangement of the apparatus for augmenting it will be
readily understood.
    The difference of velocity of the two ions in air leads us
to believe that they are not of the same size (§ 12), and it
follows that they do not diffuse at the same rate when in a
field of no force, the smaller negative ones diffusing the
faster. Near a boundary the initial uniform distribution
of both ions is disturbed by their impacts against the surface,
during which circumstance something takes place that is at
least externally equivalent to a giving up of the charge to the
surface.    A difference in concentration of the ions is thus

       Two Ions produced in Gases by Röntgen Radiation. 135
 produced between the parts at the boundary and those more
 distant, which causes a diffusion of both kinds of ions towards
 the place of lesser concentration (equations for this kind of
 diffusion are given by Townsend, Phil. Mag., June 1898); and
 this is more rapid for the negative ions than for the positive.
A larger number of negative ions thus impinges upon the metal
and this becomes negatively charged, while the air is left
positive due to the excess of ions of that sign.
    The effects obtained experimentally under ordinary con
ditions are appreciable though small, and to increase them
it must be remembered that the accumulation of each of the
charges tends to counteract further separation, and that
since the effects are due to action at a boundary, an
increase in the surface of the metal will increase the amounts
obtained.
    The arrangement of the apparatus used is shown in fig. 6.
                             Fig. 6.
                                               To E/ectrometer
   LL is an aluminium tube 45 centim. in length and 4 centim.
in diameter. At one end, insulated by E, is the aluminium
cylinder D, which has in its centre a plug of glass-wool S,
and is connected to a pair of quadrants of an electrometer.
A gas-bag is connected, by , means of the tube T, to the
aluminium cylinder A, which is filled with glass-wool to
prevent dust and all stray electrification from entering the
|...".        C is a spiral made out of a 9 centim. wide sheet
of thin aluminium which is wound so that the separate spirals
are 1 millim. to 2 millim. apart. The tube D and the wires
leading to the electrometer are metallically shielded, and
everything except D is connected to earth.
   The rays from the source O pass through the aluminium
window H of the lead box II, then through the tube LL at
B, and are finally all stopped by the lead piece F, which covers
closely that part of the apparatus.
   If now a current of air is blown from the bag through the
apparatus when the rays are not acting, or if the rays are
turned on when there is no air-current, the electrometer
connected to D receives no charge.

136 Prof. J. Zeleny on the Ratio of the Velocities of the
   If, however, the air-blast and the rays are in action at the
same time, the air entering at A becomes partly ionized at
B, and in passing through the spiral C more of the negative
ions strike against and give their charge to the sides of the
spiral because of their greater diffusion-velocity; so that, on
leaving C, the air has a positive electrification due to the
larger number of positive ions present.
   #. passing through the glass-wool S the charges on all of
the remaining ions of both kinds are given up, and the
electrometer shows a positive deflexion.
   The arrangement has the advantages that all the air in
passing through the spiral is near to a boundary, and that no
charge is allowed to collect at the places of separation, since
the metal parts are connected to earth and the charged air is
blown away.
   As the action is allowed to continue the deflexion of the
electrometer increases with the time but with continually
decreasing increments, because of the leakage through the
ionized air on the inside between the tubes L and D caused
by the electric force due to the charge acquired by D.
    The deflexions that are obtained in a given time depend
upon the velocity of the blast : for if this is too slow there
is time while the air is passing through the spiral for all of
the ions of both signs to recombine or to strike the walls of
the spiral, in which case no deflexion is obtained ; and, on
the other hand, if the blast is too rapid there is not time
enough in passing through for the best possible separation of
the ions. Some intermediate value, where all of the negative
ions just manage to reach the spiral, will give the largest
value of the positive deflexion obtained. In a sample case,
 by letting the action continue for six minutes the quadrants
 of the electrometer became charged positively to 2-5 volts.
 The spiral C was then taken out from the apparatus and the
 positive charge now obtained was but a minute portion of the
 former, showing the great advantage of making the air pass
 through the narrow openings.
    There is a searching test, however, for showing that the
 effect under consideration is due to a difference of velocity
 of the ions. It has been shown (§ 4) that in carbonic acid
 gas the velocities of the two ions are very nearly the same.
 With this gas therefore the effect should disappear. Some
 of this gas was accordingly placed into the gas-bag and the
 experiments repeated with the spiral C in position, with the
 result that a small positive deflexion was obtained, but it was
 so very small compared to that with air that it is easily
 attributed to some traces of admixed air in the CO, Experi

      Two Ions produced in Gases by Röntgen Radiation. 137
ments with air just before and just after those tried with
the CO, all gave the large positive deflexions already
mentioned.
   It is evident, since when air was used it came out of
the spiral charged positively, that it must have given a negative
charge to the metal; but this effect has also been obtained
independently by means of the following arrangement :—A
large closed aluminium cylinder, 15 centim. in diameter,
connected to earth, contained in its axis a short insulated
aluminium tube, 3 centim. in diameter, from which an
aluminium strip led to the outside of the large cylinder to an
electrometer connexion. Both cylinders and the wire strip
were made from the same sheet of aluminium. A pencil of
rays allowed to pass through both cylinders surrounded the
inner one with ionized air which gradually gave to it a
negative charge, as was indicated by the connected elec
trometer. A similar arrangement was used with all of the
parts made of zinc, and a negative charge was again obtained
upon the zinc.
   The charge does not continue to increase long, for the
accumulated electrifications tend to counteract further separa
tion. By blowing a gentle stream of air past the central
cylinder, so as to remove the excess of positive electrification
in the neighbourhood of the metal, the charge obtained is
increased.
    § 8. Air charged negatively discharges faster to a surface
                   than when charged positively.
   Rutherford has shown (Phil. Mag. April 1897, p. 246)
that when air, electrified by being blown away from an
electrode in conduction under the action of Röntgen rays, is
allowed to pass through tubes of various materials it loses
its charge more rapidly when this charge is negative than
when it is positive. This result is another consequence of
the difference of velocity of the two ions.
   When the charged particles enter the tube in question the
forces that tend to bring them to the sides of the tube, in
addition to those due to irregularities in the current, are
those of diffusion and of mutual repulsion.
   Since under both of these forces the negative ions move
the faster, it follows that in passing through a given length
of the tube in the same time more of the ions will reach the
walls if they are negative than when they are positive.
   The equation for the motion of a charged gas due to
mutual repulsion is given by Townsend (Phil. Mag. Feb.
 1898, p. 134).

138     Prof. J. Zeleny on the Ratio of the Velocities of the
      § 9. Distribution of Electrification between two Plates.
   When conduction is taking place between two plates,
through air exposed to Röntgen rays, free electrification is
distributed between them : and it is of importance in some
experiments to know the nature of this distribution, and how
it is affected by the difference of velocity of the ions.
   The electrification of the air is due to an excess of ions of
                                                                 *
one sign, and to find directly the way in which this excess is
distributed the following experiments were performed :—
                              Fig. 7.

   In the apparatus used (fig. 7). P and Q are two parallel,
9 centim. square, zinc plates. These are enclosed in a metal
lined box RS, and by means of insulated wires are connected
to the  opposite oles of a battery N, whose middle point is to
earth. C and D are two slits, having a flat opening 2 centim.
by 3 millim., and being made of an imperfect insulating
material with a conductivity a little larger than that of the
conducting air.
   They extend well into the space between the plates, and
are fastened to two slides, A and B, which allow the box with
its plates to move up and down between them by air-tight
joints.   By means of F air can be blown through the slit C
into D, and out through the insulated plug of glass-wool E,
which is connected to a pair of quadrants of an electrometer.
After the air-blast has been going a little time a definite

      Two Ions produced in Gases by Röntgen Radiation.              139
pressure is established in the box RS, and a narrow stream
goes between the two openings C and D, which disturbs but
little the surrounding air. In this way it is possible, by
moving the slits relative to the plates, to carry out the air
from any particular region between the two plates and to
measure its charge.
   As the plates are symmetrically placed and symmetrically
charged relative to the box, which is to earth, the space
between their central portions is in a fairly uniform field
when the plates are close together.
   The source of rays is        .."        so that the radiation passes
through the side of the box RS in a direction perpendicular
to the plane of the figure, and impinges uniformly upon the
air between the plates.
    In taking readings the blast and rays were turned on for a
short time to establish a steady state, and then the electro
 meter quadrants, with the connected glass-wool, were dis
 connected from earth ; and after 30 seconds the rays were
 cut off and the electrometer deflexion read.
    The following Table gives the deflexions obtained in a
 sample case where the plates were 5 centim. apart, and were
 charged to +70.5 volts and —70.5 volts:—

      Two Ions produced in Gases by Röntgen Radiation. 141
   Leaving the voltages on the plates as before, but increasing
the distance between them to 16 centim., which necessarily
sacrifices the uniformity of the field and decreases the potential
gradient, deflexions were obtained which are shown graphically
in fig. 9.
   i<U+017F> is seen from both curves that near each plate there is an
electrification of the opposite sign to that of the plate, and
that the quantity of the electrification falls off rapidly with
the distance from the plates.
   The two oppositely charged layers at the plates exert a
powerful polarization effect, and are able to reduce by a large
part of itself the electric force in the middle between the
  lates, as will be shown in considering the potential gradient
  etween two plates during conduction (§ 11).
   The formation of these free charges at the plates is readily
understood from a general consideration.
   The two kinds of ions, as soon as they are formed by the
rays, are given a resultant motion in opposite directions
through the air by the action of the electric force, and this
motion continues until they reach one of the plates or suffer
recombination. If we consider a narrow layer of air at one
of the plates, some ions of the kind that is moving towards
that plate are entering this layer at one side, and some are
leaving it at the other or plate side. Ions of the opposite
sign, however, are only leaving this layer, as none can enter
from the side bounded by the plate. There are thus two
systems of ions, one of which is moving towards a boundary,
and the other of which is moving away from the same
boundary.
   This motion produces an excess at each plate of the kind
of ions that are moving towards that plate.
   The charge is not primarily due to any accumulation of
the ions, but simply to a separation of the two kinds that are
produced. At other points between the plates the ions may
be equally numerous, but if the two kinds are equally abundant
they produce no resultant effect.
     he formations of the two charges are limited in amount
by  º
by them.
         action of the new electric and diffusion forces produced
  'T.     difference of potential between the plates has a large
effect upon the production of the charges.
    If the ions are moving very slowly the charges exist almost
 entirely at the plates; but as the potential gradient increases
 the charge in the layer increases in amount and the charged
 area itself increases in extent.

142     Prof. J. Zeleny on the Ratio of the Velocities of the
   And as the two ions travel with different velocities for the
same potential gradient there is a greater excess of positive
at the negative plate than there is of negative at the positive
plate. That this is the case is seen by referring to Table IV.,
where it is shown that the amount of positive blown out by
the rapid blast always exceeds the amount of negative
obtained.
   Thus far the rate of ionization has been supposed uniform
for all points between the plates. This would be the case if
the rays acted uniformly upon all of the air between but did
not strike the plates themselves, and under those conditions
the free charges at the plates would be independent of the
kind of metal of which the plates are made.        hen, however,
the rays impinge upon a metal it is known that there is an
increase in the ionization of the gas at the surface which
depends in amount upon the kind and state of the metal used
(Perrin, Comptes Rendus, t. cxxiv. p. 455). This increase in
the ionization at the surface increases the number of the ions
that are moving away from the plate, and as these mingle
with those travelling towards the plate which usually produce
the excess there, this excess is decreased in amount, and in
some instances it is even reversed in sign.
   Again, if the rays are allowed to pass through but a small
central portion of the space between the plates, then the free
charges extend on either side at least from the plate to the
part exposed, for the electric forces bring ions of but one sign
to each of the unexposed portions of the space.
   It is clear from the nature of the polarization that has been
shown by the above experiments to be present, that it has
but a short duration after the electric field which produced it
has been removed.
   Still the following arrangement served to show its existence
directly by obtaining a reverse current. Two parallel, 11
centim. square, insulated, aluminium plates were used, one of
which was connected to a pair of quadrants of an electrometer
and also at first to earth, while the other was connected to
one pole of a battery of cells. A mercury commutator was
constructed by means of which, in rapid succession, the
charged plate could be disconnected from the battery and
connected to earth, and then the earth connexion leading to
the second plate be broken. This was all done in a small
fraction of a second, and the motion of any charges remaining
in the gas after that time would produce an effect upon the
plate connected to the electrometer.
   With the distance between the plates about 10 centim, and

       Two Ions produced in Gases by Röntgen Radiation.     143
the potential of the initially-charged plate at 40 volts, an
effect was obtained which amounted to a deflexion of about
half a volt, and which was always of the sign contrary to
that of the initial charge on the opposite plate, and hence
corresponded to a reverse or polarization current. The two
charges left near the plates without any external electric
force simply move towards each other, ...] so in a direction
opposite to the motion of the same ions during conduction.
If the rays were cut off as soon as the commutator was turned
the electrometer deflexion became permanent, but when the
rays were allowed to continue the charge which the insu
lated plate quickly assumed, due to the polarization, was now
 slowly dissipated by the action of the new ions formed.
     § 10. Dependence of Blowing Methods upon the Velocity
                            of the Blast.
    It is a fact of some importance, and one which has not
 been fully considered by some observers, that in attempting
 to remove moving carriers from any space by a stream of
 gas, the number so obtained may not be dependent so much
 on the total number present as upon the relative velocity of
 the blast to that of the moving carriers.
    Rutherford has shown (Phil. Mag. April 1897) that in
 blowing ionized air along a charged wire which is placed in
 a tube a maximum value is reached for the amount of free
 electrification blown out, as the potential of the wire is
 gradually increased.
    A number of experiments have been made with the ap
 paratus shown in fig. 7, which show how the quantity of
 electrification removed from a plate by a given blast depends
 not only upon the electric field used, but also upon the sign
 of the ions which are being carried out.
     In the case to be considered the plates were placed
  4:1 centim. apart, and the slits were placed as near as pos
  sible to one of the plates, the other of which was always con
  nected to earth. A blast of the same velocity was used
  throughout, and readings were taken of the amounts of
  electrification obtained in a given time as the potential of
  the plate was changed in amount and in sign.

      Two Ions produced in Gases by Röntgen Radiation. 145
   The numbers show in a marked way that the velocity of
the positive ions is less than that of the negative.
   The small deflexion obtained with both plates to earth is
very likely due to a diffusion effect in the narrow slits of the
apparatus, as is explained in § 7.
   The above results are shown graphically in fig. 10.
   It is seen that the electrification blown out at first increases
rapidly with the voltage used, and that it reaches a maximum
which is followed by a rapid decrease.
   The following consideration will show in a general way the
cause of these  'iº      in this particular case:—
   In fig. 11 AD represents a section between the two slits
M and N, of the air which is moving from right to left with
a constant velocity W.
   The ions are forced to cross this moving layer by the action
of the electric force between the plates.
                              Fig.11.

   If u is the velocity of the ions travelling towards the plate
P when in a unit electric field, their velocity in a field F is

blast, i.e. so long as  º A. all

AB moving towards P, and those which cross CD, moving
from P, will be carried by the blast into the slit M. The
nature of the charge carried into M will depend mainly upon
the relative number of the two kinds of ions thus entering
the area AD ; and as CD is very close to the plate the
number coming in from that side is small compared to the
number entering at AB, and so the sign and the amount of
the charge depend for the most part upon the number cross
ing AB. (Exceptions, due to surface ionization; are mentioned
later.) At first the number entering is nearly proportional
to F, and the straight part of the curve from A to B in fig. 10
is obtained.

   The point a moves towards A as F is increased. When
this state is reached, the number of ions crossing AB is, in
our case, still increasing with F, and so the amount obtained
is dependent upon the two opposing actions, i. e. the increase
in the number crossing AB, and the decrease of Air, the area
from which ions can reach the slit. This correponds to the
maximum part B of the curves. When F becomes so large
that a saturation-current is obtained, the number of ions
crossing AB is constant, and as F increases, the number that
reach M is proportional to the decreasing Ar. Since
F. Ar- a constant, the curve representing F and the number
of ions now approaches an hyperbola, as is shown by the part
C of the curves in the figure. Finally, for high values of F,
no matter how many ions enter the blast, none are carried
out. For the sake of brevity, the predominating action has
alone been outlined, and various factors wilich take part have
not been considered, but from what has already been said the
effect of these can be followed.
    For the same velocity of the blast, the nature of the curves
obtained depends also upon the distance between the plates.
 When these were moved nearer together, the saturation
current was obtained while all of the ions crossing AB were
still being blown into M. In that case a curve similar to the
above has a maximum which turns sharply, and is not so
blunt as those in the figure.
    In other cases increased ionization at the metal surface
plays an important part, and this is especially so when the
plates are close together, so that the surface-ionization is
a large part of the total ionization between the plates. Here
complex curves are obtained, due to the opposing and at
 times even predominating influence of this surface-ioniza
 tion. With the rays striking the plates which were close
 together, the sign of the charge blown out was the same
 as that of the plate along which the current of air passed,
 or the reverse of what was obtained above, for here nearly all
 of the ionization was near the metal surfaces.             -
    For a somewhat larger distance the surface-ionization pre
 dominated for the smaller voltages only, and as more ions
 were drawn from the space between the plates by the higher
 voltages the sign of the charge obtained was reversed.
    These facts show in what a radical manner the electrifica
 tion, obtained by means of a current of air, is dependent
 upon the velocity of the blast, upon the velocity and distribu
 tion of the ions, and upon the arrangement of the apparatus.

   It has been shown in $9 how the free electrification is
distributed between two plates between which conduction
is taking place through air, and it is evident that this electri
fication must exert a marked influence upon the electric field
between the plates.
   The variation of the potential between two such plates has
been investigated by means of the following apparatus. A
and B in fig. 12 are the two parallel, 11 cm. square plates
situated above and being perpendicular to the top of the lead
box which contains the induction-coil and the tube.

through the air between the plates, covering a volume indi
cated by the dotted lines.
   The plates are connected to the two poles respectively of a
battery C, whose middle point is to earth.
   To determine the potential at different points between the
plates when the rays are acting, a fine wire, M, of the same
metal as the plates, was used. It was stretched between two
insulated parts R and S of a glass, frame N, as is shown
in the lower figure, and was connected to a pair of quadrants
of an electrometer by means of the wire K. For small
voltages the other pair of quadrants was connected to earth,

   y means of the part E, sliding on the rod D, the wire can
be moved to any part of the field, and its position observed on .

    In taking readings, the wire is simply allowed to remain
in the desired position until it assumes the potential of the
place due to the ions in the air, is is indicated by the elec
trometer deflexion remaining stationary.
    In the following example the plates and wire were made of
aluminium, and the plates were 3 centim, apart and connected
to the opposite poles of two storage-cells the point between
which was to earth.
    The readings obtained are given in Table VI., together
with readings calculated for a uniform gradient such as exists
when the rays are not acting.

    It will be seen that the deviations from the straight poten.
 tial gradient are considerable, and that the fall of potential
 is very rapid at the plates, being greater at the negative plate.
 The reason for this is that the amount of positive electrifica
 tion at the negative plate is greater than that of negative at
 the positive plate, due to the difference in velocity of the two
 ions as has been shown in § 9.

   Thus, by using 6 cells the fall was practically three times
that obtained above with the 2 cells.
   The conditions affecting the amount of free charges at the
plates are necessarily applicable to the changes of potential
resulting from them. These have already been given in $9,
where it will be seen what effect surface-ionization and other
causes have upon the fall of potential near the plates.
   Having obtained the potential curve experimentally, it is
possible to calculate from it the density of the electrification
at the various points between the plates.

     From such values a curve can be plotted showing the

      If V and a (fig. 13) are measured in absolute units, then
  the ordinates of the curve obtained will represent Q, in abso
  lute units of electrification.
      Fig. 14 shows such a curve derived from fig. 13.
      Since the ordinates represent the total quantity of electri
   fication for a unit cross-section between was 0 and w=r, the
  quantity between any two points ar, and as is obtained from
   the difference of the ordinates for these two points, and by
  dividing this by air, the average density between the two
  points is obtained.
      The curve shows that for such small potential gradients as
   that used the free electrification is confined mostly to the
   boundaries, the space between being almost free from any
  charge. As the potential gradient is increased, electrification
  is obtained farther from the plates, and with large voltages

      In the case above (fig. 13) the fall of potential at the

  Taking the number of molecules in 1 c. c. as 10”, the ratio
 of the excess carriers to the total number of molecules is
 given by    º      From calculations based on the current passing
 through a gas during conduction under löntgen radiation, it
 is known that we are able to obtain an ionization that is
 between 100 and 1000 times as large as this ratio; so that,
 by a sufficient separation of the two kinds of ions, it is possible
 to have a fall of potential amounting to more than 100 volts,
 a value comparable to that due possibly to the same cause, at
the electrodes in discharge-tubes.
    In determining the ratio of the velocities of the two ions
by the method described in §1, it is now evident that it was
important to know the potential gradient in the apparatus used
($2) for the conditions under which the readings were taken.

   To determine this, one of the glass side-plates of the box
PQ (fig. 2) was replaced by an ebonite one, which had at its
middle an air-tight horizontally movable slide. This slide
carried the wire used for finding the potential of the different
points in the air-current between the plates. On the inside
end the wire had a loop which occupied a symmetrical position
in the air-stream, while the other end was connected to a pair
 of quadrants of an electrometer.
   Two potentials for the plate Q were found (as in §4),
one positive and the other negative, which with a certain air
blast produced in the same time the same numerical deflexion
of the electrometer connected to the gauze T.
    The gauze was now connected to earth, and the potential
 gradients were determined separately while each of these two
 actions was in progress. In doing this, both pairs of quad
 rants were at first connected to a battery-potential supposed
 to be equal to that of the point in the apparatus º, Was

a sufficient time for a steady state to be reached, the pair of
quadrants connected to the wire was insulated from the

   It is seen that the chief difference between the two gra
dients in the two cases is that when the negative ions are
moving against the stream there is a proportionally greater
fall of potential near the charged plate than for the similar
case with the positive ions.
   The change from the straight gradient is due to the excess
of the ions moving towards the charged plate, and this excess
is greater for the slower-moving positive ions than for the
negative ones; and in both cases, for the same reason, the fall
at the charged plate is less than when the air is at rest.
   Near the plate from which the blast is coming, the curves
are necessarily almost similar, from the nature of the con
dition that brings the same amount of the two ions to the
gauze in the two cases.    Since the ratio of the electric forces
acting in the two cases is actually found from the figures to
be nearly constant for points extending almost to the centre,
and as this includes the most efficient part of the field, it is
not necessary for our purpose to decide just how far out from
the gauze the forces influence practically the number of ions
that reach the gauze.
   The ratio obtained for the two gradients at these places is
nearly, but not quite, equal to the ratio of the potential values
used, and the difference is mainly due to the greater fall of
potential at the charged plate when the negative ions are
moving against the stream, as this leaves proportionally less
to be distributed in that case over the remainder of the space.
The correction calculated from the figures for air amounts to
about 2 per cent., which is to be added to the ratio of the
positive potential used to that of the negative; and as this
correction is chiefly due to the difference of velocity of the
ions, the value obtained for air has been applied to i. other
i. in proportion to the difference of velocity obtained for
them.
                        §12. Remarks.
   From the table on p. 132, § 4, it is seen that for all of the
gases tried, where a difference of velocity for the two ions
exists, with one possible slight exception, the velocity of the
negative ion is the greater. It is also seen that for such
simple gases as O and N the difference is considerable, while
for CO, there is no appreciable difference, a result which
could scarcely be anticipated. It would appear from these
results that some relation exists between the ion and the
charge carried by it which is dependent upon the sign of the
charge, and which varies with the constitution of the ion.
   In contemplating the cause of the difference of velocity of

154      Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Mechanical Forces acting
 the two ions, we must look to the size of the ions and to the
 charges carried by them, for upon these two factors the
 velocity itself depends.
    As to the charges on the two kinds of ions, the simplest
 assumption we can make is that they are equal, for if we
 assume an unequal distribution we are led into a difficulty in
 imagining a process whereby the two charges are distributed
 upon an unequal number of carriers, and so that the charge
 upon each of those of one sign is just a little different from
 that upon those of the other sign.
    We are thus led to suppose, as in liquids, that the observed
 velocity difference is due to an inequality in the size of the
 two ions. Why the two ions, even if they are formed of
 groups of molecules, should in a simple gas be of a different
 size is a question to which definite answers cannot be given
 in the present state of our knowledge, or rather ignorance, of
 the relation between matter and electricity, but is one which
 must be borne in mind in considerations of this relation.
    In conclusion, I desire to express my best thanks to
Prof. J. J. Thomson for many valuable suggestions.

                   carrying an Electric Current.
          To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.
      GENTLEMEN,
THE       subject of the forces acting on a piece of iron carrying
        a current, which is raised by Lord Rayleigh in the
June number of the Philosophical Magazine, is one of so
much interest and importance that I hope the following
 remarks may not be considered superfluous.
    To find the force on the piece of iron, let us begin by con
 sidering the force exerted by the system of the iron and
 currents on an external magnetic system ; this force is equal
 to the force due to the currents calculated by the same rule
as if they were flowing through a non-magnetic substance,
 say copper, plus the magnetic forces due to the magneti
zation induced or permanent in the iron. It follows from
this by the equality of action and reaction that the force
acting on the iron will be a force due to the action of the
magnetic field on the currents through the iron, this force
to be calculated as if the currents were flowing through
copper plus the force due to the magnetic field on the mag
netization in the iron. From this it follows that if A, B, C

      VIII. Mr. Lewis Wright's Criticism of Theories of
                       Microscopic Vision.
         To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.
   GENTLEMEN,
IN the June Number of the        Philosophical Magazine there
      appear what purport to be criticisms by Mr. Lewis           º
Wright upon papers on Microscopic Vision by Professor Abbe,
Lord Rayleigh, and myself. Unfortunately, when writing
these criticisms he had formed an erroneous conception of that
method of resolving light upon which he chiefly comments.
   The present letter is an attempt to substitute a correct pre
sentment of this method of resolving light, and deals necessarily
with the parts of Mr.Wright's paper of which I find it incumbent
on me to take notice on account of their having appeared in the
pages of the Philosophical Magazine. It is not to be inferred
from my silence in regard to the other parts of Mr. Wright's
paper, either that I agree with them, or that I am not sensible
of several observations of value which they contain.
   On p. 481 Mr. Wright explains that he is not qualified to
deal with the theoretical bearings of the subject; and that this
is so is made plain by a mistake which goes to the root of
the matter, and to which he gives expression on p. 484. He
there says “Ask these functions [i. e. circular functions] to
express a given disturbance and many surrounding replicas,
and they will do it. But ask them next to express a limited
disturbance resolved in this manner, and no more, and they
fail; their edge at present is not sharp enough to do that.”
Mr. Wright must be unaware that Fourier proved, some
eighty years ago, that their edge is sharp enough to do it.
And, by a very curious coincidence, it so happens that an
example of their accomplishing this feat is worked out in
detail in the very number of the Philosophical Magazine in
which Mr. Wright's opinion is published. (See the June
number of the Phil. Mag. pp. 534 and 535.)                  -
   In 1896, when I wrote my papers on Microscopic Vision
(see Phil. Mag. for October, November, and December of
that year) I assumed that any reader who would take the
trouble to follow the proof of my fundamental proposition
would be aware that a theorem when proved for any spacing
of equidistant points is thereby proved to be true of the
limiting case when the spacing is infinite, and that this proves
it true for a single point unaccompanied by others. As
Mr. Wright experiences difficulty in understanding a proof
by the mathematical contrivance of introducing replicas, he

             Criticism of Theories of Microscopic Vision.             157
may perhaps find an alternative proof of my fundamental
theorem, which dees not employ replicas, more intelligible.
This proof is given in the Phil. Mag. for April 1897, at p. 273.
It is a proof by the Principle of Reversal, and has the advan
tage of furnishing some additional information.
    It is by no means an easy task to give a description which
will be quite intelligible to the non-mathematical reader, of
an analysis of light which involves the conception of trains of
wavelets infinite in number, each of infinitesimal intensity,
and each occupying the whole of space". But I will endeavour
to do so. And as a first step I shall use throughout this letter
the term warelet wherever what is meant is a wave of infini
tesimal intensity. By thus employing a distinctive name for
this special kind of wave I hope to guard my non-mathematical
readers from some of the misapprehensions into which I regret
to see that Mr. Wright has fallen.
    When an undulation, however complex, is propagated
through a uniform isotropic medium (meaning by undulation,
ware-motion rhich is propapated through the medium by the
exclusive agency of the forces inherent ºn the medium) it is
an established theorem well known to physicists that this
undulation can be resolved into—in other words, may be re
 placed by; or, in other words, is the same physical event as
the simultaneous propagation of systems of concentric spherical
 waves from the several points of the medium, each spherical
 ware decreasing in its intensity as it adrances by the law
 of inverse square, and the systems of concentric waves round
 the several puncta of the medium being of such a kind that
 the medium, if of unlimited extent, would be competent
 to propagate any one of them separately to any distance.
 What the proofs of my first theorem (see Phil. Mag. for
 October 1896, p. 335, and April 1897, p. 273) have added to
 this is that, if the medium be regarded as extended indefinitely,
 any one of these systems of concentric spherical waves can in
 its turn be further resolved into, and legitimately replaced by,
 the propagation forwards of innumerable trains of uniform plane
 warelets, each wavelet being of unlimited extent sideways, and
 the trains of plane wavelets being all of such a kind that the
 medium is competent to propagate forward any one of them
   * The reader, if not a mathematician, may need to be warned that in
 a uniform medium a wave to be plane must be of unlimited extent. It
 can be proved that it is physically impossible for it to exist of limited
 extent. Nevertheless the mathematical physicist can of course picture
 to himself a limited portion of this unlimited plane wave; and he finds it
 |.        to ascertain by the laws of interference, where and when it is
 º in his physical inquiries to use this limited portion, disregarding

  158     Dr. G. Johnstone Stoney on Mr. Lewis Wright's
  by itself without its undergoing change as it advances. The
  additional information which I have referred to above as being
  supplied by the second mode of proof is that these trains of
  plane wavelets advance in all the directions towards which the
  spherical waves travel, and that their intensities, though of
  infinitesimal amount, are proportional to the intensities of the
  light carried in their respective directions by the spherical
  waves. This enables us to trace the distribution of energy
  among the plane wavelet components into which a system of
  spherical waves surrounding a punctum may be resolved ; and
  the knowledge of this distribution is for some purposes of much
  use to the physicist.
     This resolution of a concentric system of spherical waves
  into innumerable plane wavelets furnishes a correct resolution,
  either for the whole of space or for any portion of space cut off,
  not physically but only geometrically, by a closed surface of
  any form, size, and position that may be desired ; as, for
  example, for the space within the thickness of a cover-glass
  (see footnote, p. 157), which we are, for the purposes of this
  resolution, to picture to ourselves as a portion of an infinite
  extent of glass. Moreover, it is an important corollary from
  the foregoing resolution of the undulation surrounding a point
  that any undulation whatever, however compler, in any portion
  of the aether, using the word undulation in the sense above
  defined, may be resolved into, or in other words is the same
  physical event as, the coexistence of innumerable trains of
  plane wavelets traversing that space in all the directions in
  which light advances across it.
     This, which is the theorem enunciated on p. 335 of my
  first paper, is a theorem intimately related to the familiar
  geometrical axiom that a given surface may be resolved into
  —i. e. is identical with the coexistence of         its innume
  rable so-called points; each of these points being of in
  finitesimal extent when compared with the whole area of
  the surface. This relation is more than an analogy; an
  actual physical relationship may be traced. Let us, for
  example, consider the light which advances over the interval
  between the objective field on the stage of a microscope
  and the front lens of its objective. This light may |.
  resolved into innumerable plane-wavelet components tra
  versing the same space in all the directions towards which
  any of the light shines, and extending laterally without limit
  beyond the portion of space which lies between the object and
  the objective. Now, assuming the objective to be optically
  perfect, it can be proved that image a' (that luminous image
  near the back lens of the objective which is seen on removing

           Criticism of Theories of Microscopie Vision.                159
the eyepiece of the microscope and looking down the tube)
sends light to the eye in the same state as if that image were
a luminous surface, into the several points of which are con
centrated the light of the above-mentioned plane-wavelet
components, in such manner that each point of image, a
presents to the eye the same appearance as would the
concentrated light of one of these plane-wavelet components.
Since a point of image ºr transmits to the eye only an
infinitesimal quantity of light, it is too faint to be seen.
It requires a small extent of surface—what I have called
a macula—of this image to furnish light enough to be seen.
Now the smallest visible macula of image a will contain an
infinite number of       º        and therefore presents to the eye
the appearance of the accumulated light of a whole sheaf, an
infinite number, of the trains of wavelets. This example
enables us to see that there is a physical relationship between
 my theorem and the above-mentioned geometrical axiom.
    On p. 487 Mr. Wright supposes that the image of a self
 luminous object “can be only analysed according to the
 Airy method,” i.e. by an analysis of the light from the
 object into spherical waves emitted from its several puncta.
 From what is explained in the preceding paragraphs, it will
 be anticipated that Mr. Wright is here under an entire mis
 apprehension. What happens in the case of the puncta,
 or so-called points, of a self-luminous body, is the following.
 Each punctum is a source of energy supplied through it to
 the aether, and is surrounded by a small region of turmoil, i. e.
 of local disturbance, in the aether *, which turmoil returns some
 of its energy inwards in the form of a reaction against the
 punctum, and expends the rest of its energy outwards in
 starting spherical waves, which thenceforward advance for
 wards under the exclusive control of the forces inherent
 in the medium.        The character and size of the turmoil have
 been studied by Hertz and others. It is not sensible beyond
 a very few wave-lengths from the punctum. The rest of the
 tether, beyond this small volume, is in a state of undulation;
    * A turmoil of some kind must exist wherever there is any mutual
 action between the aether and the non-aether. By aether is to be under
 stood the luminiferous aether, an aether which has a definite texture; and
 by turmoil is to be understood, not disorderly motion, but a motion located
 in one situation, and which does not advance in the way waves do.
    The most remarkable instance in which this turmoil, or locally situated
 motion, in the tether is brought prominently to the notice of microscopists
 is in the phenomenon which is called “optical contact,” which is due to
 “Stokes's layer,” a special kind of turmoil, or local motion, which exists
 in the aether close to the boundary between a rare and dense medium.

       160     Dr. G. Johnstone Stoney on Mr. Lewis Wright's
       that is, the motion in it is such that it travels forward,
       and that its progress is controlled exclusively by the internal
       forces of the medium.     As soon as the motion reaches this
       condition of independence of external agency, it becomes
       resolvable either into the spherical waves employed by Airy,
       which decrease in intensity as they advance, or into the
       plane-wavelet components of my theorem, which advance
       without change. Every deduction which can be worked out
       by the former method of resolution can be worked out by the
       latter; and several others also, on account of the less compli
       cation which the new method of resolution presents to the
       mathematician. This is the reason, and the sole reason, of
       the greater efficiency of the new method in dealing with
       microscopic vision, the adequate investigation of which
       presents more difficulty than the investigation of telescopic
       vision.
          Again, Mr. Wright, on p. 483, imagines that the narrow
       ness of the chink between the object and the front of an
       immersion objective, which, as he       º          may in an
       extreme case be only the 200th of an inch (0-127 of a milli
       metre), makes it “impossible to regard light emitted from
       an object as consisting of uniform plane waves on arriving
       at the surface of such a lens,” except when the illumination
      is of a special kind, which he proceeds to describe. Now,
  *    inasmuch as the turmoil spoken of in the last paragraph
      does not extend to more than a wave-length or two from
      the object, while the interval between object and objective,
      as described by Mr. Wright, is about 300 wave-lengths of
    *  red or 400 wave-lengths of blue light in the oil, glass, &c.
      that are interposed, it follows that nearly all the width of
      this interval lies beyond the region of turmoil and is occupied
      by luminous undulations propagated solely by the internal
      forces of the medium. All such undulations are identical
      with the traversing of the same space by the trains of plane
       wavelets of my theorem, one of these trains advancing in
       every direction towards which a ray of light is directed.
          Moreºver this is independent of how the object is illu
      minated ; so that Mr. Wright is also mistaken in regard to
      the exception which he makes,
         Similarly, when Mr. Wright supposes that the source of
       light illuminating a microscopic object must be distant,
      or must transmit a pencil of light of small angle, in order
      that it may consist of the plane wavelets of my theory, he has
      quite misapprehended the subject. In all cases—whether the
      cone of illumination be large or small, whether diaphragms
:     are used, whether there is a condenser. and whether the con

           Criticism of Theories of Microscopic Vision.      161
denser be good or bad, or in or out of adjustment—in fact,
 whatever the incident light may be, the whole of it can be
resolved into, and may legitimately be replaced by, the undu
lations of plane wavelets of my theory.
    There seems to run through Mr. Wright's paper an
impression that periodic structure in an object has some
peculiar relation to my method of resolution. It has none.
The resolution of light into uniform plane wavelets is just as
available for investigating what the microscope can do upon
the isolated objects met with in Dr. Dallinger’s work referred
 to by Mr. Wright on p. 492, and in determining how the
appearances presented by these objects are to be interpreted,
as it is in dealing with the approximately periodic structures
 which exist on portions of most diatoms. Mr. Wright cannot
 have appreciated the fact that the way in which the plane
 wavelets of my theory form the image of the dots on a diatom,
 is not by any process which averages them all, but by locating
each separately in whatever is its proper position.
    If Mr. Wright will take the trouble of going over his paper,
correcting the mistakes on these and similar fundamental
 points by which he has been misled, he will probably modify
profoundly the views he has entertained with reference to the
resolution of light into plane wavelets, and he will find that
there is not one iota of divergence between what the micro
scopist meets with in actual practice and that which is indi
cated by the true theory when correctly handled.
    Before closing this letter I wish to record my concurrence
with Mr. Wright in the views he has expressed about the
importance of pressing forward the improvement of objectives
in other directions than as regards their aperture, and espe
cially with respect to their freedom from spherical aberration ;
and I may be allowed to add my admiration of the extra
ordinary advance towards perfection which one meets with in
some picked objectives. Mr. Wright speaks of an eyepiece
magnifying 27 times as the highest he uses. He would find
the next of the series of compensating eyepieces, one magni
fying 40 times, of great use in practical microscopic work
with such specially good objectives.
    I may also observe that there is nothing so formidable
as Mr. Wright apprehends in using the apparatus which I
employ for furnishing monochromatic light, and that it is
most instructive to have recourse to it on suitable occasions.
It is of especial service, and at the same time most easy of
application, when direct sunshine is available.    No lenses are
then required.     Reflect the sun's light by a heliostat on to

the first surface of one or of a pair of prisms, which should be
|. with        their edges vertical, and may stand close to the
 heliostat. The light emerges from the prisms as a divergent
beam producing a horizontal spectrum, and one which, if the
microscope is set up at a distance of four or five yards, will
probably be about two feet long and not too bright in the
violet or indigo. If too bright, remove the microscope further
from the prisms, or use unsilvered glass instead of the mirror
of the microscope; if not bright enough, bring it nearer. It
is convenient to place the prisms on a sole-plate supported by
three screws, which make it easy to slope the prisms and thus
raise or lower the spectrum so as to cause it to fall on the
mirror of the microscope. The condenser will then form, by
the light of each wave-length, an image of the sun of convenient
size and coincident with the objects in the field of view.
    These arrangements are extremely simple, and furnish in
the microscope a uniform field of monochromatic light of
exquisite beauty and efficiency; and of any colour that may
be desired by simply shifting the microscope sideways through
the spectrum.

     IX. Equilibrium-Figures formed by Floating Magnets.
                        By R. W. Wood *.
    N attempting to repeat before classes Mayer's well-known
      experiment with the floating magnets, many have doubtless
 been troubled with the lack of perfect symmetry of the figures
 that arises from the unequal magnetization of the needles
 and other minor causes. This is particularly the case when
 more than six or eight needles are used. As the experiment
  roved so suggestive to Lord Kelvin in its relation to the
 |. equilibrium of columnar vortices, and is of such use in
 illustrating the equilibrium of molecules mutually repellant,
 but drawn towards a centre by an outside force, I believe it
 worth while to draw attention to an improvement on the
 original form of the experiment, which I find gives perfectly
 symmetrical figures even when twenty or thirty particles are
 employed. The apparatus that I have used consists of a
 large vertical electromagnet with a shallow glass dish partly
 filled with mercury immediately above, and at a distance of a
 few centimetres from the pole.        Onto the surface of the

more satisfactory than the wet and somewhat fussy experiment
with the corks and needles.
    The photographs illustrating this note were taken directly
from the floating balls by means of a mirror, and indicate very
well the degree of symmetry that can be obtained.
    I have adopted Mayer's notation in lettering them, the
letters a, b, c, d indicating decreasing degrees of stability.       *
The form shown in 4 d is so very unstable that it invariably
 goes over into 4 a before it can be photographed ; accordingly,
 I have reproduced it in ink. Its stability is about that of a
 needle balanced on its point.
    The nature of the field has a good deal to do with the sta
 bility of certain forms. Often to form 6 c requires the exercise
 of the greatest care, while sometimes it will form itself without
 any manipulation.
    A stable hexagon without a central particle, which was
 the form that Lord Kelvin took the most interest in, in con
 nexion with the vortex mouse-mill, I have been unable to
 produce, and so far as I know it has never been produced by
 any one. Mayer figured three arrangements for eight particles,
 but I have only succeeded in forming two, and I doubt if the
 third can exist when the particles are as free to move as are
 the balls on the mercury surface. A little viscosity, such as
 we get when the mercury is not clean, makes all sorts of forms
 stable.
     We can convert 10 a into 10 b by pushing in one of the
 outside balls; and as we go on increasing the number of balls,
  we increase in general the number of possible arrangements.
     It is interesting, when we have a figure of thirty or forty
 particles, to introduce a larger one ; for it immediately ploughs
 its way to the centre, driving its smaller neighbours to the
  left and right, and takes up a position directly over the pole,
  the others then scuttling back into their places with all possible
 haste.
     Possibly some of the phenomena of refraction can be repro
  duced by starting waves on a mercury surface on which a
  50-ball figure floats. If this could be accomplished, it would
  be better than the velvet strip and pair of wheels; but it does
  not seem very promising.

A College Course of Laboratory Experiments in General Physics.
   By S. W. STRAtroN and R. A. MILLIKAN. (Chicago, University
   of Chicago Press, 1898.)
THE      experiments described in this volume are such as would be
      included in an elementary course of accurate physical measure
ments; they involve a knowledge of theory derivable from a first
year course of lectures. The authors give references to works in
which the theory of the experiments may be read, and occasionally
to others which describe practical manipulation. The volume is
consequently supplementary to these text-books, and furnishes
instruction concerning the details of experiment with apparatus
such as is used in the University of Chicago. Only in a few cases
does this apparatus differ greatly from that of other laboratories;
the book may therefore be found useful for British students.-J.L.H.

           Values. By Dr. JAMEs BURGEss (pp. 65, 1898).
DR. GLAish ER in his Report upon Mathematical Tables (Brit.
 Association, 1873, p. 2) cites this integral as a familiar instance
of a function occurring in several distinct subjects, one which is
 of importance in the determination of the probable error in the
 method of least squares, in astronomical refractions, and in the
 theory of heat (see also the reference cited by our author from an
article by Dr. Glaisher in our columns, Phil. Mag. vol. xlii. 1871).
 Todhunter, in his ‘History of the Theory of Probability, p. 486,
 states that Laplace suggested that it would be useful to tabulate
 its values (1783), but Dr. Burgess points out that Euler probably
 discovered it, in a slightly different form, about 17:30.        The
 opening pages (1–5) give an account of previous tables. He then
 gives some formulae available for the computation, which are
 mainly three. Pages 27–65 are entirely taken up with the tables,
 which appear, from a statement on page 25, to have been in hand
 for many years. The limits of t in (1) pages 27–39 are taken
 from t=0 to t=1:250; in (2) pages 40–64, from t= 1.000 to 3000.

        . . Note on Clipperton Atoll. By Rear-Admiral Sir W. J.
 Wharton, K.C.B., F.R.S., Hydrographer to the Admiralty.
    This atoll, 600 miles from North America, in lat. 10° 17' N.,
 long. 109 13 W., possesses a lagoon which is now completely cut

166                        ; Geological Society :-
off from the sea. In this is a perfectly round hole where soundings
of 20 fathoms or more are reported, on the authority of Mr. Arundel,
and even deeper ones on that of the captain of a merchant-vessel.
 On the coral ring there rises a mass of modified trachyte, the subject
of the following communication, about 60 feet in height. The
great depth of the lagoon and the rock-mass on the ring are not
compatible with the origin of the reef by subsidence or outward
growth; and the possible hypothesis is put forth that this reef had
grown on the lip of a volcanic crater, or on an island, such as
Krakatao, in which the interior has been enlarged and deepened by
volcanic explosion.
   2. “A Phosphatized Trachyte from Clipperton Atoll.’              By J. J.
H. Teall, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., W.P.G.S.
   Specimens from the projecting rock described in the preceding
communication are dark brown, white, or cream-coloured.                 The
brown specimens are trachytes, composed of glassy phenocrysts of
sanidine set in a groundmass of microlitic felspars with brown inter
stitial matter.     The light-coloured rocks are more or less altered
trachytes, in some of which the glassy phenocrysts of sanidine may
still be recognized. Analyses of several specimens show that the
rocks all contain varying amounts of phosphoric acid, as indicated
by the following table:–
                                          I        II.      III.

            Loss on ignition......        3-1     12.3      23-()
   The last specimen consists of 95 per cent. of hydrated phosphate
of alumina, with some iron, having thus a composition allied to the
 so-called redonite from Redonda in the West Indies. The progressive
 alteration affects first the groundmass, then the microlitic felspars,
 and lastly the porphyritic crystals of sanidine; and it is probable that
 the change has been effected by solutions of alkaline phosphate and
 other compounds derived from the droppings of sea-birds. A some
 what similar phosphate, shipped from Connétable Island off French
 Guiana, is referred to on the authority of Mr. Player.
    3. ‘The Pliocene Deposits of the East of England.—Part I. The
 Lenham Beds and the Coralline Crag. By F. W. Harmer, Esq.,
 F.G.S.
    From the discussion of lists of fossils, a large number of sections,
 and a series of borings, the author endeavours to establish the             R
 following propositions:—
    I. With regard to the Lenham Beds:–
    (a) That they are older than the Coralline Crag, thirteen out of
 sixty-seven mollusca found in them being characteristic Miocene or
 Italian Lower Pliocene forms unknown or very rare in the latter
 formation.
    (b) These beds had probably been upheaved, consolidated, and
 exposed to denudation before the deposition of the Coralline Crag,

          On the Pliocene Deposits of the East of England.         167
and may have been, as formerly suggested by Prof. E. Ray
Lankester, the source from which the ‘boxstones' found at the
base of the Suffolk Crag have been derived. These boxstones
contain a fauna, not identical with, but of the same general
character as that of Lenham.
    (c) In the interval between the deposition of the Lenham Beds
and the Coralline Crag the sea retired to the north, in consequence
of the upheaval of the southern part of the area, as it did in
Belgium towards the close of the Diestien period.
    (d) The Lenham Beds are most nearly, though not exactly,
represented by the Zone à Terebratula grandis of Belgium, and
possibly by some fossiliferous deposits recently discovered at
Waenrode near Diest, the Coralline Crag corresponding very closely
 with the Belgian Zone à Isocardia cor.
    II. With regard to the Coralline Crag :—
    (a) That the junction of the Crag with the London Clay dips to
 the N.N.E.
    (b) That no satisfactory evidence, either stratigraphical or
 palaeontological, is forthcoming to show that any divisions to be
 observed in this formation at Sutton are persistent at other
 localities; and that species which have been tabulated as charac
 teristic of certain horizons are found also in other-parts of the
 Coralline Crag, and often in the Red Crag as well.
     (c) That there is no evidence of any great subsidence, of deep
 sea conditions, of great changes of climate, or of the operation
 of floating ice during the period. The climate was warmer than
 that of Britain at the present day, more nearly approaching that of
 the Mediterranean or the Azores.
     (d) That, so far from it being possible to separate this Crag into
  eight zones, the twofold division hitherto adopted, into shelly
  incoherent sands and indurated rock, can no longer be maintained,
  the latter being merely an altered condition of the former, as
  proved by the discovery of a section showing the two types passing
  laterally into each other.
     (e) That, with the exception of the base, this Crag forms a con
  sistent and continuous whole, accumulated under similar conditions,
  namely, in the form of submarine banks, piled up by currents in
  sheltered situations like that known as the Turbot Bank off the
   Antrim Coast and those at the south of the Isle of Man, where
   Prof. Herdman’s ‘neritic' deposits occur.
      (f) That the German Ocean was less open to the north during
  the Coralline Crag period than at present, but that it was connected
   with the Atlantic by a channel over some part of the southern
   counties of England.
      III. With regard to the Red Crag —
      That it forms, with the exception of the Chillesford Beds and
   ‘the unfossiliferous sands of the Crag, a continuous sequence of
   deposits arranged horizontally, and not vertically. It was a marginal
   accumulation of a sea slowly retreating to the north and east, as
   shown by the gradually increasing number of northern mollusca met
   with in this direction.

     1. ‘The Eocene Deposits of Devon.                  By Clement Reid, Esq.,
  F.L.S., F.G.S.
     A re-examination of the area around Bovey has led the author to
 think that Mr. Starkie Gardner is probably right in referring the
 supposed Miocene strata to the Bagshot period. Lithologically as
 well as botanically, the deposits in Devon and Dorset agree closely.
 The gravelly deposits beneath the Bovey pipeclays are also shown
 to belong to the same period, and not to be of Cretaceous date.                     This
 correction has already been applied by Mr. H. B. Woodward to a
 large part of the area. The plateau gravels capping Haldon are
 also considered to belong to the Bagshot period, for they correspond
 closely with the Bagshot gravels of Dorset to the east, and of the
 Bovey Basin to the west, and possess peculiarities which distinguish
 them from any Pleistocene Drift.

 with a Note on Holaster altus, Ag.              By A. J. Jukes-Browne, Esq.,
 B.A., F.G.S.
     Although an outlying patch of Chalk in the parish of Widworthy
 was mentioned by Fitton and marked on De La Beche's map, it has
 not yet been described. The tract is about 44 miles south-west of
 Membury, 33 miles east of Honiton, and about 7 miles from the
 coast at Beer Head.
     The quarries at Sutton are almost entirely obscured by vegetation,
 but the following approximate section was obtained from a mason

    Another small outlier of Turonian Chalk occurs at Wilmington,
resting on hard quartziferous limestone with glauconitic grains,
 which yielded fossils indicating its equivalence with the uppermost
Cenomanian beds of the coast-section.                   Below this come other
sandstones, sometimes containing lumps of ‘grizzle,' giving a total
thickness of 40 or 42 feet to these beds on the whole—a much
greater thickness than is ever attained on the coast. A list of
fossils is appended to the paper, and the author discusses the
affinities of Holaster altus, throwing out the suggestion that there
is a gradation from H. Bischaffi through H. altus to H. sub<U+017F>lobosus.
    3. ‘Cone-in-Cone: Additional Facts from Various Countries.”
By W. S. Gresley, Esq., F.G.S.
    Examples of flinty stone in the ‘fire-clay series' of the Ashby
coalfield exhibit “areas of conic structure lying unconformably.”
In the same stratum of shale are large masses of the same flinty

       Palæolithic Implements from the Plateau-Gravels.             169
rock, more or less coated with conic structures, which appear to
have been formed out of layers of shale and ironstone. The
bending-up of the shale above the nodules and down below them,
the close but unconformable covering of Permian breccia, and the
staining of the whole section suggests, if indeed it does not
demonstrate, to the author that the growth of the cone-in-cone
took place subsequently to the deposit of the Permian breccia.
Several American and other examples are described, and a series of
conclusions are appended to the paper.

                             in the Chair.
    Prof. T. RUPERT Jones exhibited and commented upon a series of
large stone-implements, sent to England by Mr. Sidney Ryan, from
the tin-bearing gravels of the Embabaan in Swaziland (South Africa).
They consist of fine-grained quartzite, chert, lydite, siliceous schist,
and quartzites composed of breccia and grit-stones, one of the latter
mylonized. Also some corresponding rock-specimens from the
neighbouring Ingewenyaberg, with a map and section by Mr. S.
Ryan. Some similar implements from the same district, lent by
Mr. Nicol Brown, F.G.S., and some analogous implements of rough
quartzite, from Somaliland, lent by the Rev. R. A. Bullen, F.G.S.,
were also exhibited.
    Prof. H. G. SEELEY exhibited the humerus of a Plesiosaurian in
which the substance of the bone was almost entirely replaced by opal.
He explained that the fossil was from the opal-mines of New South
Wales. Externally there is no indication of its internal condition as
a pseudomorph, and it had been broken to ascertain its commercial
value as opal. It is translucent; of a bluish tint, with a slight red
fire. So far as he was aware, it was the only example of a fossil
bone in this condition ; and he was indebted to Messrs. Hasluck,
the opal-merchants, for the opportunity of placing the specimen
before the Fellows.

as the alleged ‘Eolithic' working; finally it was stained, marked
with glacial striae, and covered with a thin layer of white silica.
   This implement appears to prove that Palaeolithic man lived on
the Kentish plateau before or during the deposit of the plateau

   2. “On the Grouping of some Divisions of Jurassic Time.’ By
S. S. Buckman, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author argues for an arrangement in the division of Jurassic
time based upon the zoological phenomena of the Ammonite-fauna.
He considers that such time-divisions should be related to the duration
of Ammonite-families.       He divides the Jurassic Period into two
epochs—the Eojurassic and the Neojurassic : the former the time
when the Ammonite-families of the Arietidae and their close ally
the Hildoceratidae were dominant; the latter commencing just upon
the extinction of these families, and being the time when the
Stepheoceratidae held chief sway.
    The epochs are subdivided into ages, and the ages again are
divided into hemerae—a hemera being the chronological unit.
Reasons are given for the different subdivisions, and for commencing
the Eojurassic Period with the rotiformis-hemera.
    The Eojurassic Period it is proposed to divide into four ages—the
 Sinemurian, the Pliensbachian, the Toarcian, and the Aalenian.
    During the Sinemurian age, whereof the zoological phenomenon
is the acme and paracme of the Arietidae, was deposited a part of
 the Lower Lias, beginning with the zone of Ammonites Bucklandi and
 ending with that of A.o.eynotus. This age is divided into the following
 seven hemerae, stated in ascending order:-rotiformis, gmuendensis,
 Birchi, Turneri, obtusi, stellaris, oxynoti.
    During the Pliensbachian age, marked by the dominance of
 Deroceratidae and Amaltheidae, was laid down the rest of the
Lower and almost all the Middle Lias.         It includes seven hemerae,
 namely:—raricostati, armati, Jamesoni, Valdani, striati, margaritati,
 spinati.
    During the Toarcian age, when the Dumortieria and a part of
 the Hildoceratidae were prominent, the following strata accu
 mulated :—a small part of the Middle and the whole of the Upper
 Lias, the Cotteswold Sands, the Midford Sands, and a portion of the
 Yeovil Sands. There are ten hemerae :—acuti, falciferi, bifrontis,
 Lilliar, variabilis, striatuli, Struckmanni, dispansi, Dumortierior,
 Moorei.
    During the Aalenian age, when there was a preponderance of
 another portion of the Hildoceratidae which may be known as the
 Ludwigia-group, and of Hammatoceras, the rest of the Yeovil
 Sands and a part of the Inferior Oolite were the accumulated
deposits. This age is divided into the following six hemera :-
aalensis, opaliniformis, scissi, Murchisonor, bradfordensis, concavi.
    Part of the Neojurassic division is separated into two ages.
During the first, the zoological phenomenon is the acme and
paracne of Sonnininae; during the second, the predominance of
Parkinsoniae.

     1. “Note on an Ebbing and Flowing Well at Newton Nottage
  (Glamorganshire). By H. G. Madan, Esq., M.A., F.C.S.
     This well lies in a direct line drawn north and south from the
  church of Newton Nottage to the sea, about 80 yards south
 of the church and 500 yards from the sea. Sand-hills about
 20 or 30 feet high lie between it and the sea. A range of Car
 boniferous Limestone cliffs runs east and west to the north of
 the church, while the same formation crops out in the sea at
 half-tide level. Between the two there is a band of Keuper con–
 glomerate covered in one place at least by 7 feet of brown loamy
 clay with pebbles. At the shore-junction of conglomerate and
 limestone numerous springs occur, and it is in the conglomerate that
 the well is sunk, its bottom being 8 feet above Ordnance datum.
    A series of about forty observations made     at intervals of an
 hour (and in many cases at the intermediate       half-hours), during
 3 consecutive days, enables the author to         construct a curve
 showing the relationship existing between the    rise and fall of the
 tide on the coast and that of the water in the well. The result is
 to establish the existence of a wave in the well of the same
 frequency as the tidal wave, but delayed, or with an establish
 ment of, 3 hours (plus or minus a few minutes).
    The analyses of water taken from the well at its highest and
 lowest show no difference, so that no sea-water enters the well
directly. On the other hand, the slight brackishness of the water
appears to prove the diffusion of a small amount of salt water into
the well.

    This paper gives an account of a recent journey from Adjah
Bippo to the Ankobra Junction in the Gold Coast Colony. A range
of clay-slate hills is succeeded for 6 miles by flat ground in which
diorite was found, and that by a lofty hill in which clay-slate
dipping east occurs. The Teberibie range with reefs of con
glomerate, and a second range with similar reefs were crossed.
    Gold-bearing alluvia are briefly described, and the gold is
supposed to have come from the hills. The Adjah Bippo, Takwa,
and Teberibie formations are considered to be part of a syncline.
Some conclusions are drawn as to the method of formation and
probable auriferous character of the rocks.

 ON THE FUNCTION OF THE CONDENSER IN A RUHMKoRFF's CoIL.
                                BY B. WALTER,
       R. T. MIZUNO has recently described in this Journal” some
          experiments on the influence of the dimensions of the
 primary condenser of a Ruhmkorff's coil on the length of the
 secondary spark; the result of these experiments may be briefly
 stated to be that the most favourable dimensions of the condenser,
 that is those which give the longest spark with a given apparatus,
 are not constant, but greater the stronger is the primary current
 used. In connexion with these investigations Mr. Mizuno has
 raised doubts against the validity of the formula, which I arrived
 at theoretically t,
                                 E. I,
                                    -   V.C,     -
 in which E, is the maximum value of the tension of the secondary,
 I, is the strength of the primary current immediately before
 breaking, L, is the coefficient of self-induction of the primary
 condenser.
    I venture to reply, in the first place, that the fact observed by
 Mr. Mizuno is due to the break-spark increasing with increase of the
 current, so that a larger condenser is necessary in order to suitably
 enfeeble the spark. I have explicitly deduced the formula given
 above on the assumption that the break-spark could be neglected;
 and it is a matter of course that a phenomenon the existence of
 which is entirely due to the occurrence of this spark cannot be
 expressed by that formula.
    I may perhaps be permitted to take this opportunity of insisting
that the above formula does not claim to express an exact mathe
matical relation between the quantities in question, but is rather
only a first approximation to the truth, which with the very com
plicated processes in the induction-coil will always possess a certain
value, the more so that the important quantities I, L, and C, are
contained in it in a simple form, and at any rate with some
approximation.
   A second, but much more complicated approximation is found
in Colley's excellent papert, which is mentioned by Mr. Mizuno,
and Oberbeck S also has shown that my formula may, making
certain limitations, be deduced from the more general one of .

  XIII. Measurement of the Anomalous Changes in the Length
     and Temperature of Iron and Steel during Recalescence.
     By GUSTAF E. SvFDELIUs".
  MY experiments          and researches have been intended to
          contribute to our knowledge of the anomalous changes
  of length in iron and steel while being heated and cooled.
  I have tried to show in what degree §. changes depend
  upon the percentage of carbon, different conditions of heating
  and cooling, hardening and annealing, and I am thus able to
  give some   º              values of the coefficients of expansion
  of different kinds of iron and steel during the interval of
  temperature 0°-800°. Besides these linear measurements, I
  have made a comprehensive series of measurements of tempe
  rature, partly to show in what connexion the anomalous length
 and temperature phenomena stand to each other, and partly
 to determine more closely the temperatures at j. the
 former phenomena take         º        In these researches I have,
 for the most part, only been able to confirm the observations
 already made by others, especially by Prof. Barrett and
 M. Osmond. It is only in regard to the anomalous length
 phenomena which I have found to characterize the tempering
 of hardened steel, that my researches may offer anything new.
     Passing by the historical introduction to my work I will
    * Communicated by Prof. G. F. FitzGerald, F.R.S. M. Swedelius
 published his experiments in Swedish in 1895, but as the paper is inac
cessible to the majority of English readers the Author, by request, made
this summary.
    Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 46. No. 279. Aug. 1898.                O

174 M. G. E. Svedelius on the Changes in the Length and
say a few words in regard to the instruments, materials, and
methods used in my experiments.
   The material for observation has partly consisted of cold
drawn wire from Bofors iron-works containing from 0-9
per cent. to 0.1 per cent. of carbon, with a diameter of
3 millim., and partly of hot-rolled wire from Sandviken
iron-works containing from 1.0 per cent. to 0.1 per cent. of
carbon, with a diameter varying between 5.4 millim. and
5-6 millim.
   All the linear measurements have been taken with a dila
tometer which in principle corresponds to the dilatometer
devised by Prof. Angström”. The iron or steel bar about
4 centim. long, whose changes in length were to be observed,
was fitted in between the two ends of two rather long hori
zontal arms of porcelain A and B, one of which was fixed and
the other movable around a vertical axis. The arms, which were
drawn towards each other by a weak spiral spring C, pressed
against the rod D (see diagram p. 175). The opposite ends of
the arms were allowed to move a mirror K fastened to a torsion
wire H, H. The rod was heated by a Muenches patent burner,
and its temperature was measured by a thermoelectric couple
of platinum and platinum-rhodium alloy and a mirror-gal
vanometer. The readings of the dilatometer and galvanometer
were noted, either each by itself or both at a time, partly by
telescopic observations and partly by photographic recordings.
In the latter case, pencils of light reflected from the mirrors
of the dilatometer and galvanometer fell upon a strip of paper
sensitive to light, which was moved through a dark box with
uniform rapidity. The photographic image thus formed con
sequently described curves whose ordinates reproduced without
interruption every change of length and temperature in
the rods.
   Suitable allowances have been made for the errors of the
dilatometer due to the heating of the arms.            Reproductions
of the longitudinal curves recorded by photography are
annexed to this paper, but they are not corrected, and are
therefore not suited for absolute measurements. They give,
however, a rather good idea of the general expansion and
contraction of the bar.
   Experimental Results.-The curves reproduced in figs. 1–12
are true copies of longitudinal curves of different iron and
steel rods recorded by photography.
   The rods have, where not otherwise stated, before each ex
periment been heated to a bright red heat, and have then been
allowed to cool slowly.

178 M. G. E. Svedelius on the Changes in the Length and
    Of the two curves in fig. 1 the upper represents the changes
in length taking place in a copper rod, and the lower one
those taking place in a Bofors wire containing 0.6 per cent.
 of carbon when it is heated one minute and then left to cool.
 The longitudinal curve for the copper rod shows, both during
 heating and cooling, an even process. The longitudinal curve
 for the steel rod has, on the contrary, two clearly appearing
 jerks, an anomalous contraction during heating at D*, and an
 anomalous expansion during cooling at D’t.
     The effect of the percentage of carbon upon the critical points
 D and D'.—Referring to fig. 2, the longitudinal curves for
 the rods of hard steel (Bofors, 0.9 per cent. carbon), soft
 steel (Bofors, 0.5 per cent. carbon), and soft iron (Bofors,
 0.1 per cent.), show the following:—
     (i.) The contraction at D is considerably less than the ex
 pansion at D'f.
     (ii.) The contraction at D begins just as soon after the com
 mencement of the heating—and consequently at about the
 same degree of heat—in steel and soft iron, but lasts longer the
 smaller the percentage of carbon is.
     The expansion at i. takes place earlier after extinguishing
 the flame, and thus at a higher degree of heat, and is of
 longer duration in soft iron than in steel.
     (iii.) The contraction at D and the expansion at D’are
 greatest in soft steel, and less in hard steel and soft iron.
     The observations made by the aid of a telescope and scale
 show that the anomalous changes of length increase in mag
 nitude with the increase of the percentage of carbon fiom
 0.1 per cent. to 0.6 per cent., that they are of the greatest
 value with 0.6 per cent. of carbon, and decrease thereafter
 with the increasing percentage of carbon from 0.6 per cent.
 to 1-0 per cent. of carbon $.
     (iv.) The contraction at D seems in soft iron to consist of
 two moments D, and D, of which the former begins at a
 lower degree of heat and is of short duration. This is con

 1873, p. 475) and Herr Heim (Unters, ider die Gore'schen       Phanomene,
 1885, p. 81), have found the anomalous change during cooling appear
 most strongly marked in hard steel, weaker in iron containing a low
 percentage of carbon, and absent in very mild iron. I have, however
 not succeeded in finding any iron, except burnt irºn, in which the criticai
 points D and D' have not clearly appeared; on the contrary, they have
 always appeared weaker the first time the samples were heated.

   The expansion at D' seems, in iron with a small percentage
of carbon, to consist of two separate moments, D', and D'1.
In soft steel they partly synchronize and produce the jerk at
D' characteristic of this kind of steel. In hard steel they
have completely synchronized".

The three curves in fig. 3 represent changes in length of one

carbon which was heated to different degrees of temperature
and between each heating was allowed to cool slowly. The
lower one of these curves represents the longitudinal changes
of the rod when the flame was extinguished immediately
before, the middle one at the beginning, and the upper at the
end, of the anomalous contraction at D.

   (v.) The expansion at D' does not appear during the cooling
process unless the contraction at D during the          i.        pro

at D' is less when the rod has only been heated to a degree
of temperature corresponding to the contraction at D than
when the rod is heated to a higher degree of temperature.

—The lower curves in figs. 4 and 5 represent longitudinal
changes in rods of Bofors wire containing 0.1 per cent. and
0.6 per cent. of carbon which were heated for six hours in an
assay-furnace up to temperatures above the fusing-point of
  old, and which thereafter were allowed to cool very slowly.

length in rods containing the same percentage of carbon, but
which have not undergone such long heating.
   These curves show :—
   (vi.) Protracted heating to a high degree of temperature,
followed by slow cooling, diminishes in a large degree the
magnitude of contraction at D and the expansion at D'. The
contraction at D lasts longer after the prolonged heating, and
does not finish in iron containing 0.1 per cent. of carbon
before the flame is extinguished.
   Observations made by the aid of telescope and scale show
that the contraction at D and the expansion at D' decrease

40 times, a couple of minutes each time, being allowed to
cool slowly after each heating, only amounted to 3 of its
magnitude the first time the rod was heated. In a rod of
electrolytic iron the magnitude of the expansion at D' de
creased very rapidly with every renewed
heating; and after the 50th heating no ej
trace either of the critical point D or D' <U+2192>
could be discovered”.      The iron was now Sº
brittle, with coarse crystalline, glossy
fracture, and showed all the qualities
characterizing burnt iron. Neither in
any other burnt iron examined by me
could I discover any critical points,
    Anomalous changes of length in re

tempering hardened Steel.—The upper
curves in figs. 6–11 represent changes
of length in rods hardened in cold water
after being heated to a bright red heat ;
the lower curves represent changes in
length in the same rods after being
allowed to cool slowly after the previous
heating.
   These, and other curves not reproduced
here, show :—
    (vii.) The expansion to the critical
point D does not take place as regularly
in the hardened as in the annealed rods.
The longitudinal curve of the hardened
rod shows irregular jerks which appear
after a few seconds’ heating. In rods con
taining 0.9 per cent. to 0.7 per cent. of
carbon there are two similar jerks or
critical re-tempering points, di and ds : in
rods with a lower percentage of carbon,
one critical re-tempering point d, which
appears clearly when the percentage of
carbon runs up to 0.6 per cent. to 0.4 per
cent., and weaker, if it does not disappear
entirely, when the percentage of carbon
is lower. The two re-tempering-points di
and d, seem to correspond to each other.
  (viii.) The contraction at D begins earlier
in the hardened than in the annealed rod.
   * This confirms the statement long ago made by Prof. Barrett that
in very pure iron the anomalous contraction and expansion could be
“washed out’ as it were by repeated heating and cooling.

   The relation of the critical point D' to the hardening of
Steel-Fig. 12 shows the connexion between the critical
point D' and the hardening-capacity of steel.
   An annealed steel rod of Bofors wire containing 0.9 per
cent. of carbon was heated as usual, and then cold water was
poured over it while it was still lying between the arms of
the dilatometer; this was done first immediately before, and a
second time towards the end of the expansion at D', after
which it was again heated. The phenomena of longitudinal
change here presenting themselves are represented by curves
1, 2, and 3 (fig. 12). Curve 2 shows the re-tempering points
characteristic of hardened steel, while these are lacking in
curve 3. Thus the steel rod has been hardened at the first, but
not at the second cooling.
   These, and several other curves not given here, show:—
    (ix.) In order that steel may be hardened, it is necessary to
heat it to a degree of temperature not lower than the corre
sponding point D, and then to cool it suddenly when it is at
a degree of temperature which is higher than that at which
the anomalous change of length at D’ begins.
    The connerion between the anomalous changes in length and
 temperature of Iron and Steel.-Figs. 13–15 reproduce some
 simultaneously photographed length and temperature curves
 of Bofors wire with different percentages of carbon. All of
 the temperature-curves show, in congruity to the corre
 sponding longitudinal curves, the presence of critical points.
 These critical temperature-points have been more closely
 studied, and some of the results thereby obtained ought to be
 of interest in ascertaining the connexion between the anoma
 lous length and temperature changes of iron and steel; they
 agree rather well with the results which have already been
 obtained by M. Osmond.
    During the heating of the different specimens, I always
 observed at about 725° a decrease of temperature, or an
 intermission in the speed of heating, which appeared more
 strikingly the higher the percentage of carbon was. In hard
 steel this decrease of temperature even reached 5°.
    During the cooling of the specimen which then took place,
 I observed at about 600° either a recalescence, which in hard
 steel ran up as far as to 20°, or an intermission in the speed
 of cooling, which could only be discovered with difficulty in
 very soft iron. During the cooling of soft steel and iron I
 also discovered a second intermission in the speed of the
 cooling process at 710° and 800° respectively.
    A comparison between the length and temperature curves
 reproduced in figs. 13–15 shows:–

         (x.) The anomalous length and temperature changes seem
      to appear simultaneously and consequently at about the same
      degrees of temperature. These anomalous length and tem
      perature changes do not, however, correspond to each other
                                                                   S$
      in regard to the intensity of the phenomena. The changes in
      length are, according to the preceding proofs, greatest in soft
      steel, and about equally as great in hard steel and soft iron;

    while the anomalous temperature changes have their greatest
    values in hard steel and rapidly diminish in magnitude with
    the diminution of the percentage of carbon in the specimens.
       Herr Brinnell* is the one       . first observed that hardened
    steel re-tempers more quickly than annealed steel, and M. Os
    mond has found that heat is released in the heating of hardened
    steel during the interval of temperature between 200° and
     520°. I have found in corroboration that this releasing of heat
     continually increases during heating from 200° to 350°, and
    thereafter decreases just as continually during the following
     heating up to about 500°.
       These observations appear to show :-
       (xi.) The re-tempering points d, and dº, mentioned above,
    are not corresponded to by any isolated thermal points; on
    the contrary, i. is released during the whole interval of
    temperature within which the re-tempering points in question
    are situated.
       Approximate values of the coefficients of expansion of Iron
     and Steel during the interval of temperature from 0°-800°,
     and of the magnitude of the anomalous longitudinal changes.—

     temperature curves in rods of Sandviken wire with different
     percentages of carbon. These have been secured by simul
     taneous readings from the dilatometer and galvanometer at

    The appearance of the longitudinal curves characteristic
 of the different specimens at the critical points D and D' has
 not been noticeable, depending upon the relatively long
 intervals of time (6 seconds) between the respective readings.
 The longitudinal curve for iron containing 0-3 per cent. of
 carbon appears to show, meanwhile, that the contraction at
 D, before mentioned, consists of two moments, D1 and D, of
which the former embraces the interval of temperature from
 705° to 725°, the latter the interval of temperature from 740°
to 800°. The corresponding division of the critical point D'

         XIV. On Conduction of Heat by Rarefied Gases.
             By M. SMoLUCHowski DE SMola N, Ph.D.f
 1.  A"       the same time when this year's first number of
             the Philosophical Magazine appeared, containing
 Mr. C. F. Brush’s very interesting paper “On Transmission
 of Radiant: Heat by Gases at Varying Pressures,” I published
 in Wiedemann's Annalen (vol. lxiv. p. 101, 1898) the results
 of an experimental investigation of mine on quite a similar
 subject, and conducted in quite a similar way, though quite
 independently, of course, of Mr. Brush's.
     The   .        of my work was somewhat different, however.
 His research, which is of a purely experimental character,
 extends over the general laws of cooling of bodies in gases at
 various pressures, including the effects of convection-currents,
 of radiation, and conduction of heat. I tried, on the contrary,
 to eliminate the first two effects, considering former researches
 of Kundt and Warburg, and confined my attention to the con
  duction of heat, and especially to the modifications of it
  arising at very low gas-pressures, in respect of which the
  kinetic, theory of gases gives some remarkable suggestions
  which had not been examined before.
      In order to explain these, I may be allowed to remind the
  reader of certain points in the mathematical theory of con
  duction of heat.
      2. As is known, Fourier based his theory upon the
  assumption that the quantity of heat flowing through a
  body in a given direction is proportional to the corresponding
     * This is, of course, only shown for the conditions of heating in
  question, and it is not thereby proved that the heating extended over a
   longer period at the final temperature of the preceding heating is without

gradient of temperature, which he supposed to be distributed
everywhere in a continuous manner.
   Poisson, however, constructing his theory on the sup
position of a special mechanism of conduction (defined, in a
somewhat vague way, as “molecular radiation ”), inferred
from it that there must be a discontinuity of temperature
distribution at the surface of separation between two bodies
of different conductivities when there is going on an exchange
of heat between them.
    The difference of temperature 6, -6, (ordinarily very
small) at both sides of this surface should be proportional
to the flow of heat passing through it, and therefore also
to the slope of temperature in either of them. This is
expressed by the equation
                     6, -6, = 'yºl, . . . . . . . (1)
where y may be called the coefficient of discontinuity of
temperature.
   But until now there has been no experimental evidence for the
existence of such a discontinuity, and the coefficient y has been
supposed commonly to be zero, so much the more as Poisson's
theory of “molecular radiation ” has lost all credit and the
kinetic nature of the conduction of heat is generally
 accepted.                                                  -
    Kundt and Warburg, however, who discovered the slipping
of rarefied gases moving along solid surfaces, thought it
probable that something analogous—viz, a discontinuity of
 temperature–may arise in such gases when conduction
of heat is going on.
    To decide whether this is the case or not, was the scope of
 the present work.

    3. The chief difficulty in examining the conduction of heat
 by gases consists in separating the pure conductive effect
 from the effects of the convection-currents and of the direct
 radiation, which always are present to some degree where
 conduction is going on.
    The convective currents can be avoided to a great extent
 by a proper shape of the vessel containing the gas, so as
 to leave the least possible free space for their development.
 Besides, their effect can be still diminished, and made prac
 tically negligible, by rarefying the gas ; since its viscosity
 remains the same, whereas the disturbing forces decrease
   roportionally with the density. (See Kundt and Warburg,
 !.      Ann. clv. p. 156.)

194           Dr. M. Smoluchowski de Smolan on
   Then we have still conduction and radiation.      These two
can be separated by comparing experiments got with vessels
of different sizes (Winkelmann), or by measuring the effect
of radiation by itself, when the best possible vacuum has
been made (Kundt and Warburg).
    In the experiments described below both of these methods
were used.
    4. The experimental arrangement was quite similar to
that of Mr.   |. (and others before); but the shape and
dimensions of the thermometer and the glass vessel were
adapted to my special purpose.
    The thermometer BT (see figs. 1 and 2) had a cylindrical
mercury-bulb B and a very thin stem S, thickened in the
middle in the shape of a stopper P, so as to fit air-tight
in the mouth of either of two cylindrical glass vessels,
 V, and Wu, formed alike, and differing only in the value
 of the diameter. The outer diameter of the mercury-bulb
 was r=0:4566 cm., its length l-6-57 cm.; the inner dia
 meter of vessel I. R=0.653 cm., of vessel II. R=1:57.3 cm.
 These vessels were connected by glass tubing with a mercury
 air-pump (Töpler's construction), which was adapted also to
 the measurement of low gas-pressures by an arrangement
 similar to McLeod’s gauge. (See     tº.            Wied. Ann.
xii. p. 434.)
     Greatest care was taken for dryness of the pump and
 apparatus, and for the air-tight fitting—by means of some
 mercury poured in—at the mouth M and at the stopcock C.
     The mode of experimenting was quite simple. When the
   as was brought to the desired density, the vessel, with
 the thermometer in, was heated by hot water to nearly
 100°C. ; then it was suddenly immersed in ice, and now
 the cooling-down of the thermometer was observed by
 measuring the time which the mercury column took for
 creeping back from the point 100 of the scale to the zero
 point (corresponding in reality to the temperatures 47°-99
 and 20°-04 C.).
     5. Let us consider now in what way we might be able to
 decide, by observing the time of cooling, whether there is any
 such discontinuity of temperature between the gas and the
 solid, or not.
     If we denote by C the caloric capacity of the thermometer
 bulb, by a S the quantity of heat radiated from its surface to
 the sides of the glass vessel, and by cI, the quantity con
 ducted in the same way through the gas, when there is
 a difference of one degree between them, the temperature 6
 of the thermometer-bulb (which, approximately, can be

      Similar experiments were made with hydrogen.
      The bracketed values are not to be relied upon, as a con
siderable source of error arises in them from the vapour
pressure of mercury; also the theory, exposed later on, is
not quite justified for them, as the free path of molecules
is too great; nevertheless they agree very well with the
other values.
      7. The observations are sufficient to justify the following
conclusions:—
      (1) If the convection-currents were producing any sensible
effect, the time of cooling would have shown a marked increase
when the pressure began to decrease down from 1 atmo ;
but neither hydrogen nor air in the smaller vessel (I.) shows
any appreciable influence of pressure between 760 and about
50 mm.; with air in the wider vessel (II.) an increase of
cooling time can be noticed from 760 to 210 mm.; then it
remains constant to about 40 mm.; it is this value (marked
with an asterisk) which was supposed to be due to pure con
duction and radiation.
      (2) For eliminating the effect of radiation, it was supposed
that in the best possible vacuum obtained there was no longer
conduction of heat, only radiation. This assumption is
supported by the fact that the time of cooling, which at
normal higher pressures was 37 resp. 94 sec. for hydrogen,
and 184 resp. 380 sec. for air, appeared to be 790 sec. in the
vacuum, independent of the size of the vessel used and of the
nature of the gas with which it had been filled. It was
increased to 6807 sec. by roughly silvering the thermometer
bulb.
      Also the second method of eliminating the radiation, by
applying the formulae (4) and (2) to corresponding measure
ments at normal higher pressures in both vessels (of known
dimensions), gives well agreeing results.
      (3) The increase of the time of cooling at pressures below
several millimetres of mercury cannot be due to a diminution
of the coefficient of conductivity, which ought to be the same
for both vessels at corresponding densities, because the
apparent conductivity (as shown by the values of K) varies

in a different way in the two vessels, being for instance
in air at the pressure p=0.04 mm. in vessel I., K=0:23, and
in vessel II., K=0.56.
    (4) It is explained, however, by introducing a discon
tinuity of temperature according to formula (1), at the surface
between the gas and the solid; the values of the coefficient
y, calculated on this supposition, are in fact very nearly the
same for both vessels; they are inversely proportional to the
pressure, therefore proportional to the free path of molecules
of the gas—exactly the same law which has been found by
the before-named experimenters for the coefficient of slipping.

is for air in contact with glass

 by O. E. Meyer:
                 y=1-70A,                  y=696X.
    Considering the wide range of pressures experimented
 upon, which correspond in some cases to a reduction of the
 apparent conductivity to less than 1%t of its normal value,
 the agreement between observations and calculations, as
 shown by the constancy of the coefficient y/A, must be con
 sidered very satisfactory.
        Comparison with Mr. C. F. Brush’s Experiments.
    8. Mr. Brush’s experiments were not undertaken with
 the same express intention as these, but as they are made
 evidently with great carefulness, and extend over a great
 range of pressures, it is very interesting to look into them
 from the theoretical point of view, and it is very satisfactory
 to find the best agreement with the accepted theories, and
 also with the conclusions drawn in the above from my experi
 ments.
    According to what has been said in the beginning of this
 paper, and to Mr. Brush's own interpretation of his results,
 the “aether line * in his diagrams gives the effect of pure
 radiation; the remaining part of the ordinates is due to con
 vection-currents and conduction,
    The effect of the first ones is very considerable in the larger
 bulb, much less in the smaller one ; it was not perceptible at
 all in my experiments with the vessel I.

sloping-down of the curves A–and from a certain limit we
have only pure conduction of heat, just as in solids; this is in
dicated by the horizontal part of the curves A and B, since the
coefficient of conductivity for heat is independent of the gas
pressure, just as well as the coefficient of viscosity. This fact
is not so very surprising, it was foretold by Maxwell before
even any measurements of it had been made, as the conduc
tivity depends on the product of the number of molecules
with the mean length of their free paths, which are varying
with pressure in an inverse way *.
    The final bending down of the curves, shown on a larger
scale in part of B and in C, is exactly the phenomenon here
discussed, which I attribute to the discontinuity of tempera
ture. This theory explains why this effect is more conspicuous
and begins at higher pressures in the small vessel than in
the large one, exactly as in my experiments, and its largeness

nearly constant as can be expected, considering the inac

              Conduction of Heat by Rarefied Gases.          201
difference is probably due, apart from the inexactness of such
a rough calculation, to the fact that the surface of Mr. Brush's
thermometer was coated with shellac, which of course may
produce another value of 'y than glass.
    I should like to say some words concerning another point.
    Mr. Brush proves that Newton's law of cooling is not
 strictly true, since the curves representing the cooling down
 from 15° to 10°, from 9° to 6°, &c. do not coincide, as would
 be required by an exponential formula. The cooling is going
 on faster with increasing difference of temperature than would
 follow from Newton’s law.
    I think this is not surprising at all, since it is known that
 the coefficient of conductivity, and also the radiation, are
 increasing with rise of temperature. By assuming Stefan's
 law of radiation to be true, according to which the quantity
 of heat radiated away from a body is proportional to the
 fourth power of its absolute temperature, and by assuming the
 coefficient of conductivity to increase by about 0.2 per cent.
 for one degree (according to Winkelmann, Wied. Ann. xliv.
 |. 177, 429), we find just about such differences as exhibited
   y the air-curves and, at the lowest pressures, by the hydro
 gen C curves.
    The great value of these differences in the higher parts of
 the C curves, however, seems to suggest that y is decreasing
 with rise of temperature.
    A remarkable fact, too, seems to be the great influence of
 temperature-difference on the intensity of convection-currents,
 as shown especially by the air curves A in the larger bulb,
 which may be compared with a theoretical formula put
  forward by Lorenzº—for a less complicated case, though—
  according to which convection-currents produce an effect
  proportional to the # power of temperature-difference.
     But these phenomena are not in immediate connexion with
  the subject here discussed ; for our purpose it is sufficient to
  note that Mr. Brush’s experiments are quite in accordance
  with our theory, supposing the existence of discontinuity of
  temperature proportional to the free path of the molecules.
              Eaplanation by Kinetic Theory of Gases.
     9. Now the question arises how this remarkable pheno
  menon is to be explained.
     It cannot be reduced to any effects of radiation (in the
  sense now used), in Poisson’s way, as has been mentioned
  at the beginning of this paper; this is also excluded by the
                       * Wied. Ann. xiii. p. 582.

 202             Dr. M. Smoluchowski de Smolan on
 radiation being eliminated altogether, in the above-described
 manner.
    The very simplest way of explanation, however, is afforded
 by the kinetic theory of gases, which, in quite a similar way
 also explains the slipping of a gas moving along the surface
 of a solid, as has been shown by Kundt and Warburg (and
 afterwards by Maxwell too).
    Suppose two plane parallel plates, at different temperatures,
 separated by a layer of gas, the thickness of which may be
 great in comparison with the mean length of free path of the
 molecules.
    The temperature at any point of the gas is the mean value
 of the vis vira of the molecules travelling from the colder to
 the hotter plate and in the opposite direction.
    Now consider the state of things near the surface of the
 cold one PP'. The molecules going towards it are endowed
 with a greater energy than that which would correspond to
 the temperature of the plate, since they are coming from
 hotter regions; those going out from it, after rebounding,
 have only its exact temperature, if there is a complete
 equalization of temperature (resp. energy) during the act
 of impact on the plate ; therefore the mean value of both
must be greater lº the temperature of the plate itself;
there must be a finite break in the distribution of tempera
ture *.
    In reality this will be still greater than would follow from
this reasoning, since it is not probable—and is disproved by
 the experiments, as will be shown afterwards—that the mole
cules of the gas assume, at one impact only, the exact
temperature of the body.
    I have tried to make an approximate calculation of these
 effects after both theories of molecular action developed until
now, Clausius' and Maxwell's, and the results are quite similar,
only differing in the numerical value of the coefficients.

 elastic balls, requires several simplifying suppositions in order
 to allow of an easy reckoning, which let the result appear

Dr. Johnstone Stoney in his very suggestive paper “On the Penetration
of Heat across Layers of Gas" (Phil. Mag. vºl. iv. p. 424, v. p. 457),
the understanding of which is rendered difficult, however, in consequence
of wrong reasonings about the conduction of heat.

supposing the molecules to be centres of a repulsive force
proportional to the reciprocal fifth power of distance, is much
 superior, in some ... to the above, as the effects of the
encounters and the changing distribution of velocities among
the molecules are taken into account quite rigorously, but it
is to be considered only as an approximation too, since
 Maxwell supposes the state of the gas at the surface to be
 the same as in the interior, which evidently is not quite
correct.
    The action of the surface of the solid body is supposed by
him to consist

quite analogous to the one deduced before in (8), but with
somewhat larger numerical coefficients.
   Also in respect to several other phenomena, these two
theories give somewhat different numerical results; the actual
state of gases has been found usually to be intermediate be
tween them ; probably here also this will be the case.
   At any rate, it is a very satisfactory result that both theories
agree in proving the existence of a discontinuity of tempera
ture, as expressed in (1), and the proportionality of the factor
y to the mean length of free path of molecules in the gas ;
exactly the conclusion drawn from the experiments in § 7 (4).
This perfect agreement between the experimental facts and
the kinetic theory of gases could be considered as a new strong
evidence in favour of the latter—if such evidences were
wanted any more.

in my experiments between y/A in air and in hydrogen (1:70
and 6'96). It would not be surprising to find the factor &

or f, and in consequence also y, different for different solid
surfaces, but it is remarkable that its value depends so much
also on the nature of the gas. In hydrogen, at least, the
term depending on S must be several times greater than the
first term independent of it, whereas it is comparatively small
for air.
   I believe an explanation may be afforded by the following
reasoning:—The molecules of the gas, striking against the
particles (molecules?) of the solid body, will be different
generally from them in respect to size or mass. Now the
impact between two bodies generally tends towards producing
an equalization of their vis vira, but it is easy to show that
this equalizing effect is so much the smaller, i. greater the
difference is between the masses of the colliding bodies.
Therefore 8 will be great, and y too, if the molecules of the
gas have a much smaller mass than those of the solid body,
which certainly is the case in the above example for hydrogen
in contact with glass.
   It seems to be possible to arrive by similar arguments at
conclusions about the mass of the particles of the solid, the
motion of which constitutes the heat of the body, and about
which we do not know anything at present; but as this
requires a great deal more experimental data, I am first going
to carry on further such experimental investigations.
   It would be very interesting, too, to verify some other con
clusions of the kinetic theory of gases, easily arrived at, con
cerning the conduction of heat between solid walls the
distance of which is much less than the mean length of free
path (for instance with high exhaustions); in this case the
quantity of heat carried over by the molecules of the gas
ought to be the same as if—with unchanging k, and y put
equal zero—the plates were at the distance 2X         #.     (of
course, apart from radiation); and this quantity ought to be
independent of the distance of the plates, provided this is
very small in comparison with A.

    XV. A Simple Method of Reducing Prismatic Spectra.
 By Edwin Edser, A.R.C.S., and C. P. BUTLER, A.R.C.S.*
 IN order     to determine, from spectroscopic measurements,
      the wave-lengths corresponding to the bright lines in a
 prismatic spectrum of a metal or gas, one or other of the
 following methods is generally used. From preliminary
 measurements made of the deviation corresponding to a
number of known lines in the solar spectrum, or the line
spectrum of some metal or gas, a curve is drawn giving the
relation between deviation and wave-length. Owing to the
necessity of determining a very large number of points on
this curve in order to render its form trustworthy, this opera
tion is a very tedious one, and to an observer insufficiently
acquainted with the reference spectrum involves great dif
ficulty and uncertainty. This curve, however, having been
drawn, the wave-length of any line in another spectrum ob
tained with the same spectrometer (no alteration of the
adjustments having been made) can be immediately deter
mined from a measurement of its deviation.        On the other
hand, where photographs of spectra are employed the most
usual practice at present is to photograph a reference solar
spectrum alongside the one under examination. To an
observer of sufficient experience it is possible to identify any
of the numerous Fraunhofer lines with the correspondin
lines in a Rowland's standard map ; and thus the    ºf
of any line in the unknown spectrum may be determined by
inspection. In spite of the perfection attainable by the above
methods when employed by a trained observer, it has appeared
to us that a simpler one, capable of giving accurate results
in the hands of an experimenter without special experience
in spectroscopy, might often be found of some value. The
production of interference-bands in a continuous spectrum
seemed capable of furnishing a reference spectrum which
could be advantageously employed for this purpose, most of
the difficulties incident to the above-mentioned methods being
entirely eliminated. We have, therefore, devoted some time
to the examination of various methods by which such inter
ference-bands might be produced, with the object of selecting
the simplest, and determining the degree of accuracy finally
attainable by its employment. The results of our work in
this direction we beg to lay before the Society this evening.
   If the image of a system of rectilinear interference-fringes
be formed in the plane of, and parallel to, the collimator slit
of a spectrometer so that only a small part of the breadth of

208      Messrs. E. Edser and C. P. Butler on a Simple
one band falls on the slit, the resulting spectrum will be
crossed by vertical black bands, varying in number and
breadth with the order of the interference-band from which
the spectrum is derived *. If the interference-fringes are
displaced across the slit the black bands in the spectrum will
become finer and more numerous as the central interference
fringe recedes from the slit. Even when the coloured fringes
have become invisible at the position of the slit owing to the
high relative retardation of the interfering pencils, the bands
in the spectrum remain quite distinct, becoming indistinguish
able only when so fine that the resolving and dispersive
powers of the spectroscope are insufficient to separate them.
    In our earlier experiments we focussed the image of an
air-film, contained between two plane and parallel glass sur
faces, on the slit of the spectrometer t. The image should be
obtained by means of light reflected from the film, the
spectrum bands obtained when transmitted light is used being
very faint. This method, which is theoretically the most
perfect, has the disadvantage that a somewhat careful ad
justment is necessary in order to insure good results. We
have therefore sought for some simpler method. It is un
necessary here to detail the various methods which we have
successively tried ; it will suffice to describe the arrangement
ultimately adopted as being the simplest, whilst complying
sufficiently closely with the ideal conditions to insure trust
worthy results.
    Let us suppose that a transparent parallel-sided film of
thickness d is placed immediately against the slit of the
spectroscope and illumined with white light. Owing to the
interference of the ray directly transmitted and that twice
internally reflected within the film there will be bright bands
in the spectrum separated by darker intervals, the wave
lengths \o, A1, A2, ... Ar, . . . An corresponding to the bright

wave-length) of the substance of the film, . n may be

   It is therefore possible, by means of a series of interference
bands produced in the spectrum in the above manner, to
calculate the wave-length corresponding to any part of the
spectrum, having given any two lines of known wave-lengths
sufficiently remote from each other.
   Of course it is impossible to obtain a solid film of any
substance whose dispersion is sufficiently small to render the
above reasoning even approximately correct. Recourse must
then be had to an air-film between two transparent plates.
Since the film can now no longer be placed immediately against
the collimator slit, some indefiniteness of the interference
bands will result; but if the plate next to the slit is not more
than 3 millim. in thickness no trouble will arise from this
cause, at any rate with a spectrometer whose collimator
tube is more than a foot in length.
   A very considerable improvement in the interference-bands
thus produced may be effected by partially silvering the two
surfaces enclosing the air-film. In the first place the con
trast between the bright and dark bands is considerably
enhanced ; indeed, if both surfaces be silvered so as to reflect
about 75 per cent. of the incident light, the dark spectrum
bands become almost black.          The thicker the silver is the
greater will be the contrast, the only limit being prescribed
by the diminution of the total light transmitted.
   Another important advantage gained by silvering the sur
faces is the much sharper definition of the resulting bands.
Messieurs C. Fabry and A. Perot” have pointed out that
when monochromatic light is transmitted through a film
enclosed between two plane and approximately parallel
silvered surfaces, the resulting interference-bands present the
appearance of sharp      .#. bright lines separated by
broad black intervals. The explanation of this interestin
phenomenon is quite simple. Let the real part of erº-Yº
be the equation of the incident wave, whilst a and b are the
 respective coefficients of reflexion and transmission at the
silver surface. Since Wiener has shown that the phase
change for light reflected normally at a silver surface in air

            Method of Reducing Prismatic Spectra.                211
   It may be useful here to describe in detail the exact method
of procedure finally adopted. It has not been found neces
sary to use optically . glass; good ordinary plate-glass
gives perfect results. Sextant glasses have been recommended
to us for this purpose. It is well to select two plates having
the most suitable surfaces. This can be done by placing one
*      on another, the two adjacent surfaces having previously
   en cleaned with cotton-wool, and viewing the air-film
between them by reflected light from a sodium flame. The
bands formed when the plates have been gently pressed
together should be nearly straight and each one at least
2 millim. or 3 millim. in breadth.
   The two selected surfaces should now be silvered somewhat
heavily. The milk-sugar process”, in which the silver is
deposited very slowly, has been found to give good results.
   A simple mechanical arrangement for adjusting the two
silvered surfaces for parallelism, the distance between them
being also capable of adjustment, could easily be designed.
We have found, however, that if a little soft wax be placed
round the edges of the plates a perfect adjustment can be
obtained by simply pressing the plates together with the
fingers. The photograph accompanying this paper was ob
tained using this arrangement. To adjust for parallelism,
 view a spot of light, or the filament of an incandescent
electric lamp, through the silvered surfaces. A long train of
 images, due to multiple reflexions, will generally be visible.
 These images having been brought into coincidence, inter
 ference-bands will generally be seen on viewing a sodium
 flame through the silvered surfaces. These are adjusted, by
 W.". applied to the glass plates, to be as broad as possible.
  When the adjustment is nearly completed there is often some
 difficulty in seeing the bands, due to the fact that for a
 parallel air-film viewed normally the interference-bands are
 formed at an infinite distance in front of the film f.       At this
 stage the bands should be viewed from as great a distance as
 possible. The perfection of the results finally obtained will
 depend greatly on the accuracy with which this adjustment
 is performed.
    If the collimator slit of the spectrometer be now illumined
 by a slightly convergent beam from an arc-lamp, and the
 plates be placed in front of the slit, and as near to it as

possible, the spectrum will be found to consist of bright
lines separated by almost black intervals. The best results
 will of course be obtained when the plates are in such a
position that the slit is parallel to thc direction of the inter
 ference-bands seen with sodium light. The closeness of the
 bands will depend on the thickness of the air-film between
 the silvered surfaces. For photographic purposes we have
 adopted the plan of covering either the upper or lower half
 of the slit with a piece of black paper stuck on with soft red
wax before placing the plates in position. The necessary
 exposure will vary from about half a minute to three minutes
 (using Edwards's snap-shot isochromatic plates) according to
 the nature of the spectrometer employed. It is well to in
 troduce a little common salt into the arc while this exposure
 is being made, as thus the D lines, as well as the H and K
 lines, will be superimposed on the bands. Another piece of
 black paper having been placed so as just to cover the ex
 posed half of the slit, the first piece is removed, and the
 spectrum which it is wished to examine is photographed.
 Fig. 1 is a specimen of an iron spectrum together with a re
 ference interference-spectrum obtained in this way. It will
 be noticed that the interference-bands in the violet part of
 the spectrum are slightly inclined to the vertical. It is easy
 to adjust the glass plates so that this is not the case, but we
 have selected this photograph in order to point out that if
 readings are taken on the line of junction of the two spectra
 no error will result from such a want of adjustment.
    Starting from the red end of the spectrum every fifth and
 tenth band can be marked and the whole numbered.            The
 following exhibits the procedure when the wave-lengths of
 only a few lines are required.

sponding to a great number of spectral lines a graphical

          It is, of course, unnecessary to take a separate photograph
       of the reference interference-scale for every spectrum to be
       examined. If the D lines are superposed on the original
       interference-scale, and occur also in every succeeding spectral
       photograph obtained, the reference scale can be photographed
       once for all, provided the adjustments of the spectrometer
        remain unaltered. The photographic scale can be placed with
       its film in contact with that of the photograph bearing the

216       Mr. T. E. Doubt on the Measurement of Colour
 unknown spectrum, and the D lines having been brought
into coincidence the procedure indicated above may be pro
 ceeded with.
    For eye-observations the most convenient arrangement
 would be to place a small plate of optically worked glass
 between the reference prism, generally provided with a i.
 trometer, and the slit, a simple arrangement serving to adjust
 the adjacent surfaces (which should be silvered) for
 parallelisin.
    It will be seen that the phase-changes produced by the
silver do not introduce any serious errors into the final re
sults. Wiener” has shown that for light reflected from a
silver film of sufficient thickness the phase-change is very
nearly independent of the wave-length. To further test this
a streak of silver was rubbed off the glass plate which is
placed next to the collimator slit, and a photograph of the
spectral bands obtained. The displacement of the bands,
where the light had been reflected from the silver, relatively
to the bands formed where the light had been reflected from
the clear glass, was practically constant for the whole length
of the spectrum.
    In conclusion, we think that it may be claimed that by
means of this application of a well-known principle to spec
troscopy, the difficulties incident to the reduction of prismatic
spectra in terms of wave-lengths or frequencies are greatly
reduced, the whole process as above described requiring no
special experience in the experimenter.
   The experimental work incidental to this investigation has
been performed partly at the Davy-Faraday Laboratory,
Royal Institution, and partly at the Royal College of Science,
South Kensington. For the facilities afforded us individually
at these institutions our joint thanks are due.
  XVI. Vote on the Measurement of Colour and the Determi
   nation of White Light. By T. E. Doubt, University of
    Washington, Seattle, Washington f.
IN     his paper on the “Theory of Compound Colour.” Maxwell
                                                                  .
     has given colour-equations to represent white light. From
these equations, by eliminating the quantity W between any
two equations, the relation between any three colours may be
obtained. In making his determinations he used a white
diffusing-screen illuminated by direct sunlight. The quality
of the light that is reflected by a screen depends somewhat

             and the Determination of White Light.           217
upon the character of the paper used for its surface, and also
upon the kind of light that strikes the screen. The intensity
of sunlight is continually varying. Its quality may also vary
owing to the selective absorption of the atmosphere due to
vapour, smoke, and dust. The same conditions do not hold
in different parts of the world, and hence the standard equation
for white light must vary with the conditions.
    There would be considerable advantage in making com
parisons if one of the standards of intensity were chosen as a
standard white ; for instance, the Carcel lamp, the Methven
screen, the pentane burner, or the platinum standard.
Maxwell's standard equation for white light will not hold for
either of these standard sources for the normal eye.
    Lord Rayleigh, in experimenting upon mixtures of red and
green light to form yellow light, used as a source an Argand
burner covered with an opal globe. This source may be
good where the globes have the same selective absorption,
and where the gas burnt at the same rate has the same
composition. He, like Maxwell, had to contend with a dark
line between the two fields to be compared. He also had to
use a separate source for a comparison light.
    Even in Helmholtz's colour-mixing apparatus that had two
collimators fitted with Nicol and Rochon’s prisms, the light
 from the collimators meets the large dispersion-prism upon
different faces, and emerges parallel upon the opposite sides
 of one of the angles, so that the instrument has a dark line
 separating the two fields to be compared.
    The utilization of the principle of the apparatus used in
 this investigation was suggested by Prof. D. B. Brace. The
 instrument is constructed for the purpose of comparing mix
 tures of any number of components from a single source with
 the original light, or for making a comparison between the
 original light and any two mixtures.
     #. the light-source A (fig. 1) the light passes through
 the Donder’s double slit B, the achromatic lens C, the prisms §
  the achromatic lens E, to the concave mirror G, is reflected
 back through the lens E, the prisms D, the lens C, to the
 mirror H, and to the observer at 0.
     The radius of curvature of the mirror is equal to the focal
 length of the second achromatic lens. It is silvered upon its
  front face, and it is placed upon a movable.arm. This arm
  moves about an axis directly beneath the lens.
     The width of the adjustable slits F in front of the concave
  mirror G could be measured to tenths of a millimetre, and b
  estimation to hundredths of a millimetre. The plane mirror #
  is about 12 centim. long and 5 centim. wide. It is silvered

218 Mr. T. E. Doubt on the Measurement of Colour
upon its back face. It is about 5 millim. thick and some
what prismatic, so that any reflexion from the front face is
thrown aside. Commencing about 7 millim. below the upper
edge a strip about 1 centim. wide is cut away, leaving the

front face. The space between the mirrors is filled with a
medium the refractive index of which is intermediate between
that of the large glass and the microscopic slide. The distance
between the reflecting surfaces is not over a millimetre.

   Light in passing through the prisms is bent through
about 98°.   }.   the second lens it is brought to a focus at the
surface of the concave mirror, forming there a spectrum.
Thence it is thrown back, passing through the lower part of
the lens and prisms, whence, instead of being brought to a
focus at the slit, it is reflected by the plane mirror to the eye
of the observer. Light from the upper half of the slit passes
to the lower side of the spectrum on the concave mirror, and
is reflected to the microscopic slide of the plane mirror.
Similarly, light from the lower half of the slit passes to the
upper side of the spectrum, and the position of the slits deter
mines the components that are allowed to be reflected. These
components, when reflected back through the system, make
up the mixture and strike the plane mirror. Each division of
the mirror gives an image from each part of the spectrum.
These images would be superposed upon a screen placed at
the focus O (fig. 1); but the mirrors are so tilted with
respect to each other that the upper field gives an image of
the mixture partially overlapping the image of the original
light from the lower field. To an eye placed at O the images
do not appear, but each part of the field is illuminated with
the light from the separate parts of the spectrum.
   A vanishing line is easily obtained between the two fields
by this arrangement, for a portion of the light is dissipated by
reflexion between the two silvered surfaces. The light is
slightly convergent, and the mirrors give a full illumination
up to the edge of the silvering.
   The wave-length corresponding to any position on the
millimetre-scale was determined by the same interference
method that Maxwell used with his colour-box.         In the first
determination 31 bands were visible. The following table
gives the wave-lengths corresponding to the different positions
on the millimetre-scale.

   One of the standard sources is placed in front of the
Donder's double slit.     The observer sits between the two
arms of the instrument and looks at the optical mirror through
the diaphragm. In the lower field the original light appears
that has passed through the entire optical system.              º the
upper part of the field the mixture of the colours that escapes
being cut off by the shutters appears. There is no dark line
between the parts of the field if it is properly diaphragmed.
   To obtain a match to the colour of the original light with
two colours, one is chosen in position, and the other is sought
by adjusting the shutters until the right colour is found. The
upper part of the Donder's slit which gives the original light
is narrowed so that the two fields may be of the same intensity.
For making a match with three or four or any number of
colours the procedure is about the same. Two colours are
chosen and other components selected by experiment, so that
a match may be obtained in this manner. The number in
parenthesis represents position on the scale, the wave-length
corresponding to these positions may be found from the

     HE working parts of this instrument were obtained from
        Mr. J. A. Brashear, of Allegheny, United States of
America. They consist of two interchangeable L steel rails,
each of about 23 feet in length, and each having the upper
edged planed to an inverted A section with top truncated.
      hese rails were supplied with saddles of cast iron, into
which the rail was fixed, and which were provided with
levelling and lateral adjustment screws.
   One of these saddles takes one end of each rail at right
*
slit.
         one to the other, and also carries the mounting for the
   The “ diagonal beam ” is an iron girder consisting of a tube
about 3 in. diameter (T, fig. 1), trussed with 3 in. rods (R, fig. 1),
the struts being placed at angles of 120° round the tube.
Fixed to each .." of the tube is a cast-iron palm (J, fig. 1),
which is provided with a small range of adjustment in the
direction of the length of the girder.
    These palms are provided with vertical axes, which form the
connexion with the carriages (I, fig. 1), which run on the rails.
   On the one palm is fixed the grating-holder (G, fig. 1), and
on the other the camera. These parts are similar in structure
to those described and illustrated by Ames in the ‘Astro
Physical Journal, p. 28, January 1892.
   The concave grating, which was also obtained through
Mr. Brashear, has a focal length of 21.5 feet; the ruled
space is about 6 inches long, bearing 14,438 lines to the inch.
The spectra on one side of the grating are all bright: the
first order on the other side is somewhat brighter than the
others.     Mr. Brashear remarks, in a letter to one of us, that
“Professor Rowland states all the lines are clear and sharp,”
and adds, “You are very fortunate in getting this grating,
for no one knows when we will get another.”
    Our own experience with the grating fully corroborates
these remarks. The definition of the spectral lines afforded
by it is remarkably fine; and we feel it due to Mr. Brashear
to express here the thanks, which have been conveyed to him
by letter, for the trouble and care he has so courteously taken
to furnish this University with such a very fine instrument.

224 Dr. W. E. Adeney and Mr. J. Carson on the Mounting of
  For various reasons we decided not to erect the spectro
meter in a dark room, but determined rather to set it up in a
room open to day- and sunlight, and to endeavour to devise
the light-tight connexions between the working parts of the
instrument which then become necessary for photographic,
as well as for eye, observations.
   A raised floor, 30 feet by 30 feet and about 9 feet high, was
built at one end of the Physical Laboratory of the University,
the floor being supported on steel girders, the ends of which
were built into two opposite side-walls of the laboratory, while
the central portions were supported by steel columns resting
on concrete foundations.
  The spectrometer was mounted on this raised floor in the
following manner:-
                                       Fig.1.

       of a series of which the side of the rectangular box couldi. closed
       in from either end, making the whole $ompletely light-tight. This
       construction was necessary, inasmuch as the girder passed out
       through this side, and at a varying angle, and different position
       with every movement of the grating-carriage along H, and with
       the corresponding movement of the camera along the other rail<U+017F>.

the Large Spectrometer in the Royal University of Ireland. 225
    Two red deal beams, each 12 in. by 3 in., and of sufficient
length to carry the steel rails, were mounted true and level
on cast-iron standards bolted to the floor.
    To these were bolted the saddles mentioned above, and
on these were fixed the rails. The latter were very care
fully adjusted, so as to be exactly level, straight, and at right
angles to one another.
    The beam on which the grating-rail H was mounted also
served as a basis for a light-tight wooden structure running
along its whole length, and completely enclosing both the
rail and grating. Fig. 1 shows this structure in section, with
the rail, carriage, and grating indicated in position inside.
    One end of this rectangular structure or box was perma
nently closed, and a short piece of brass tube made to slide
through a hole in the end at the proper height for the slit.
This brass tube was supplied with a boxwood flange fitting
light-tight against the slit mounting, so that all the adjust
ments of theiatter were outside the wooden rectangular |.
    The other end was closed by a sliding door.
    A light-tight connexion had now to be established between
this wooden box and the camera at the other end of the girder;
and inasmuch as the girder not only moved from one end of
the tube to the other along the rail H, but at every new posi
 tion on the rail made a different angle with it, it was impos
 sible to accomplish this connexion by anything in the nature
 of a bellows. After much consideration the following method
 was decided on, and works admirably in practice: –On the
 iron tube of the girder was fixed, by means of wooden sup
 ports and clamps, a wedge-shaped rectangular tube of wood, a
 little wider than the grating at one end, and the width of
 the camera at the other, .# about 4 inches deep. Part of
 this is shown in fig. 1 as K. The end came to within about
 1} inches from the face of the grating G.
     Fig. 2 shows a section, ic represents the construction
 for º one-half of its length from the grating end, the
 remainder being without the grooved slides (A). The tube
 is shown in plan in fig. 3.                      -
     The opening (B) was in that side of the tube nearest the
 rail, and was necessary when the camera was close up to the
  slit; since the light from the slit would otherwise be cut off
 from the grating by the angle of the tube coming between
 them, as shown in fig. 3 in plan.
     An arrangement for wholly or partially closing this opening
  at will was provided in the shape of a door sliding in the
  grooves A, K.
     In order to close up the space below the tube K, inasmuch

226    On the Mounting of the Large Rowland's Spectrometer.
as the sliding doors referred to as moving in the grooves A, A
in fig. 1 could not come beyond the points of intersection of
the tube K with their plane (namely I, I in fig. 3), and
inasmuch also as the lower grooved piece (A, fig. 1) had to
be at sufficient distance below T to clear the lowest point of
the tie-rod R, the simplest way that could be thought of b
the authors was to suspend a loose bag or tube of felt-clot
from the lower edges of the sides of K, letting it hang down
and enclose the girder and its tie-rods.
   This is shown at C in fig. 2; but is supposed to have been
removed in fig. 1, so as to show the tube and tie-rods.
    The outer end of the bag, or the end nearer the camera,
 was closed up, and the other came well within the plane of
 A A, fig. 1.
    This was found to answer admirably; and by the aid of a
 cloth thrown across K, and loosely tucked in against A on
 the top, and the sliding doors and the felt bag at the sides, no
 difficulty has been experienced in obtaining a perfectly light
 tight joint in all positions of K. The camera is connected to

the other end of K by a few inches of bellows, which allows
for the focussing adjustment.
   The spectrometer, mounted in the manner here described,
has now been in use for more than a year, and has been
thoroughly tested. It has been found most convenient both
for making eyepiece observations and for taking photographs;
it has also been found completely light-tight. In proof of
this last statement, we may mention that we have exposed
rapid photographic plates in the camera of the instrument for
upwards of six ...! on bright sun-lit days, during the course
of an investigation we have been, and are at present, making,
in conjunction with Professor Hartley, F.R.S., upon the ultra
violet spark spectra of the elements, and have experienced no
difficulty whatever from “fogging.”

§ 1.  IN      studying the attempts which have been made to
            illustrate certain optical phenomena by analogies
drawn from chains of particles and from mutually influencing
pendulums, I have been impressed with the difficulty of
obtaining accurate information respecting the dynamical
results in question, and the proofs on which they rest. I
have taken some pains to find brief and simple methods of
establishing the most important properties, and have here
arranged both proofs and results in a form convenient for
reference.
   In discussing the chain of particles, I have not had recourse
to theorems in the Calculus of Finite Differences, but have
imitated the methods employed in Lord Kelvin's Baltimore
     * Communicated by the Physical Society: read Mar. 11, 1898.

228            Prof. J. D. Everett on Dynamical
Lectures; and in this connexion I have hit upon a curious
geometrical and kinematical theorem which I believe is new.
   In dealing with mutually influencing pendulums, whether
suspended side by side or one from the other, I have simplified
the usual investigation, by first assuming the motion to take
#. in a fundamental mode, and afterwards discussing com
  inations of such modes. The deduction of the properties of
the double pendulum here given is, I believe, the fullest to
be found anywhere.
   A “fundamental mode of vibration ” may be defined as
one in which all the particles have simple harmonic vibrations
with the same period and either identical or opposite phases.
The resolvability of the most general small permanent vibra
tions of a system into modes of this simple character is a
well-known proposition of abstract dynamics. Anyone who
objects to assuming it may regard our plan of operations as
a tentative method which is justified when it leads to solutions
containing the proper number of arbitrary constants.
   § 2. Suppose a series of equal particles attached at equi
distant points to a uniform elastic string of negligible mass.
For simplicity we shall ignore gravity, and suppose the only
forces acting on each particle to be the tensions of the two
portions of string between which it lies. Then the series,
when in equilibrium, will lie in a straight line, with uniform
tension throughout the whole string. Let F denote this
uniform tension, and a the common distance between the
particles. Then, in the case of small transverse vibrations in
one plane, if y1, y2, ys denote the displacements of three con
secutive particles, and the mass of each particle be M, we
shall have
or, putting u for F/Ma,
       ja- -Au (yº-yl)-H(<U+017F>/2–93)= -u(2/2-yi-yº). . (1)
   These formulae are also applicable to longitudinal vibrations,
if we make F denote Young's modulus multiplied by the
cross-section.
     3. When a simple harmonic undulation is running along
the chain of particles, we shall have
                     y=Asia ºr (-4).             .  . .    .  (2)

abscissa is w, A the wave-length, t the time, T the period,

         This is equal to ua” when A- x , and diminishes continuously
         to zero as tra/A increases from 0 to tr. Hence a VA is the
         velocity of infinitely long waves, zero is the velocity of waves
         of length a, and there is continuous diminution of velocity
         between these limits.                                 -
            The expression #. sin'." obtained in (3) for the square of
         the frequency shows that the frequency vanishes for A=a
         and A= x , and attains its maximum value Vu<U+017F>t when
         X = 2a.
            The maximum value of the acceleration-factor — y/y or
         (27/T)” is 4A, and is also attained when A =2a.                                    Every
         frequency less than the maximum corresponds to two different
         values of a between a and co. Calling them A1 and X2, we
         have

            It thus appears at first sight that two different modes of
         undulation correspond to each frequency. The following

    In the exceptional case M = 2a–As, successive particles are
in opposite phases, the frequency, has the maximum value
 Va<U+017F>tr, and the acceleration-factor has the maximum value 4/1.
The waves in this case can be more simply regarded as
stationary.
    In the exceptional case A1 = x , we have As-a=X3. The
particles are in one straight line, there is no acceleration, and
the frequency is zero.
    The above investigation establishes the following
  -                  Geometrical Proposition.
    Through any number of points lying on a harmonic curve
and having equidistant ordinates, it is always possible to draw
an unlimited number of harmonic curves, having the same
amplitude but different wave-lengths. Calling the common
distance a, and the wave-length of any curve A, the curves
can be divided into two sets such that for any two of the same
set the difference of the values of a/A is an integer, and for
any two of opposite sets the sum is an integer. At the points
in question, curves of the same set slope the same way, curves
of opposite sets slope opposite ways, and the tangents of the
slopes are inversely as the wave-lengths. If all the curves of
one set are displaced in one direction, and those of the other
set in the opposite direction, along the axis of abscissas,
through distances proportional to their wave-lengths, all the
curves will still intersect on the original ordinates.
    Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate the different possible specifications
of the same motion of the particles. Small circles are drawn
round the particles to render them more conspicuous. All
the curves pass through the centres of these circles. In fig. 1
the values of a/N for the two curves are 4 and #, their sum
being 1. In fig. 2 the values of a/N for the four curves are
#, 3, , ; ; the difference being 1 for the first and third, and
for the second and fourth ; and the sum being 1 for the first
and second, 2 for the first and fourth, and 2 for the second
and third. In fig. 1 the two curves are supposed to be
travelling in opposite directions, the flat curve six times as
fast as the steep one. In fig. 2, curves 1 and 3 travel one
way, and curves 2 and 4 the opposite way.

 Thus the resulting motion is completely determined.            Suc
 cessive particles will be opposite in phase, and their amplitudes
 will diminish in geometrical progression as we move away from
 the particle which is subjected to external constraint, the
 diminution being the more rapid as the frequency is greater.
     § 6. The constraining force (taking the mass of the particle
as unity) is the excess of the actual acceleration —oºy, above

It is proportional and opposite to the displacement yo, and
therefore does equal amounts of positive and negative work.
These remarks apply to the permanent regime only.
    The critical value of a which separates free from forced
vibrations is 2 wºu, and this value makes the constraining
force zero. As o increases from this minimum to infinity,
the constraining force increases from zero to infinity, and the
ratio r of successive amplitudes increases from unity to
infinity.                      w           -
    The work done in the initial stage is represented by the

energy of the whole chain (extending to infinity on both
sides) to the energy of the particle to which the constraint is
applied is                           -

be, since we have in this case an infinite train of equal oscil

practically to confine the energy to the first particle.

 critical value, any nascent disturbance is carried off to a
 distance by undulations; but when it is above the critical
 value the effects accumulate at the origin of the disturbance.
 In the latter case, when the applied force ceases to act, the
 subsequent motion is compounded of free simple harmonic
 vibrations; and for none of these does the frequency exceed
 the critical value. Hence there is a change from higher to
 lower frequency, and therefore a lessening of refrangibility.
     In support of the view that there is a critical frequency for
 a fluorescent substance, Sir G. Stokes says:—
     “In dealing with a single fluorescent substance—not a
  mixture of two or more—I have generally found that the
  following feature is (very approximately, at any rate)
  observed :—As we take incident light of increasing re
 frangibility, it is at first inactive ; then, on reaching a
 certain point P of the spectrum, it begins to produce
 fluorescence, and the heterogeneous fluorescent light contains
  refrangibilities not extending beyond P. As we continue to
  progress in the incident spectrum, the highest refrangibility
  of the fluorescent light does not follow the refrangibility of
  the incident light, but remains about P.”
     Professor Preston maintains that there is no difference in
  kind between fluorescence and the process by which lamp
  black transforms luminous into non-luminous radiation.        In
  the application of our analogy to lamp-black the critical
  frequency will be below the range of visibility.               -
     § 8. ii. fundamental modes of stationary vibration for the
  chain are most easily deduced from the consideration of two
  travelling undulations. If the fixed ends coincide with two
  of the particles, and the intervening length is ma, the equation
  for a fundamental mode is
                     y = 2A sin 27ta/X cos 27tt/T,

    § 9. Another mechanical illustration that has been often
 mentioned as analogous to certain optical phenomena is the
 mutual influence of pendulums.
    First, suppose two simple pendulums of masses 1 and s,
 with natural frequencies ol/27 and wa<U+017F> 2T, their bobs being
 at the same level, and elastically connected so that there is a
 mutual push or pull according as their distance is less or
 greater than when both pendulums are vertical. The con
 nexions are supposed to be of negligible mass, and the
vibrations to be so small that the vertical component of
the push or pull is negligible. The movements are supposed
to be confined to one vertical plane.                    -
    Let a denote displacement of the mass 1 from the vertical
 through its point of support, reckoned positive when towards s,
and £ the displacement of the mass s, reckoned positive when
away from the mass 1. Then w—# is their approach, and
#—a their recess. Let u(r-t) be the push, and u (#–w)
the pull.
    If the masses were unconnected, we should have
                 3 = –0.1%r,      f = — wº. . . . . (17)

        When ki is different from unity, one of the two quantities
    1–k, and 1–1/k, is positive and the other negative; hence
    Q1 is intermediate between on and os. Equation (20) shows
    that, if k is unity, o, is equal to o, ; that is, the pendulums
   are of equal length. Whenever they are unequal, the funda
   mental mode in which their displacements are similar is
   intermediate in frequency between the vibrations of the two
   pendulums singly.
       The actual vibration of the system will be either that
   corresponding to ki and Qi, or that corresponding to -k,
  and Q., or a combination of the two in an arbitrary ratio ;
  according to the initial circumstances.
      If the pendulums are nearly equal, both in length and
  mass, the coefficient o'-o'-Fu/s-u of k in the quadratic
 is small and the positive and negative roots are nearly equal,
 also their product – 1/s is – 1 nearly ; hence the roots are
 approximately + 1. The values of 0° from (21) are therefore
 approximately

When t is such that cos Qit and cos Qat are each sensibly

 When one of the cosines is sensibly 1, and the other sensibly

 Putting —k, for k all the terms are positive ; hence the first
 expression for Q,” is greater than g/b, and the second is
 greater than g/a; that is to say:—The mode in which the
 displacements are opposite is quicker than either pendulum alone.
     For the other mode, we have
                      1                  (ts                   4.

     The first value shows that <U+017F>li” is less than g/b. The second
value shows that it will be less than g/a if s-H (1-ki) as<U+017F>b is
negative, that is if k is greater than 1 +b/a ; and this con
dition is always fulfilled, for the substitution of this value of
k in the quadratic gives an opposite sign to the substitution
of a very large positive quantity. Hence the mode in which
  .   displacements are similar is slower than either pendulum
Ollone.
    The physical meaning of the result ki> 1 +b/a is that, in
the mode in which the displacements are similar, the lower
string is more inclined to the vertical than the upper.
    When a is infinite, -k, is – 1/s, and Q,” is (1+8)g/b.
    When b is infinite, k is zero, and Q” is (1+s).g<U+017F>a.
    In the former case, the lower string rotates about the
common centre of gravity as a fixed point, so that the virtual
length of the pendulum is b/(1+s). In the latter, the lower
string simply alters the downward force on the upper mass
from g to (1+s).g.

  with the statements contained in Lord Kelvin's paper * “On
  the Rate of a Clock or Chronometer as influenced by the
  Mode of Suspension,” some of which are quoted in recent
  editions of Tait and Steele's ‘Dynamics.”
     Lord Kelvin selects the second mode as the practical mode
  for a pendulum supported on a yielding stand, presumably
  because the amplitude of the pendulum in the first mode is
  comparable with that of the point of support and therefore
 inappreciable. He also selects it as the practical mode for an
 ordinary spring clock suspended like a compound pendulum
 from a fixed axis; presumably because the escapement would
 not work with such an enormous departure from correct time
 as the first mode would involve.
    On the other hand, Lord Rayleigh, in a paragraph which
 is often quoted in discussions on anomalous dispersion, ignores
 the second mode and adopts the first. The justification seems
 to be that his argument relates to the behaviour of the upper
 pendulum, and that in the second mode the excursions of the
 upper pendulum are infinitesimal.
    In the first mode, the ratio of the amplitude of the upper
 to that of the lower pendulum is 1/k = (a-b)/a, which may
 be small, but not negligible, and the ratio of the changed
 to the natural (frequency)* for the upper is 1+sb/(b-a).
 The upper pendulum is therefore quickened if b–a is positive,
 that is, if the lower pendulum is naturally the slower, and is
 retarded if the lower pendulum is naturally the quicker.
 Lord Rayleigh suggested many years ago that the paradoxical
appearances presented in “anomalous dispersion ” are due to
an action analogous to this. In anomalous dispersion there is
always excessively strong selective absorption, evidenced by
a black band in the spectrum produced by a prism of the
anomalous substance; and the colours which are not thus
blotted out are displaced from their usual order.            A general
statement of the facts, which has been deduced from the
comparison of a number of anomalous spectra, is that, in
passing through the colours of the ordinary spectrum from
red to violet, the refractive index is increased where the
absorption increases rapidly, and diminished where absorption
diminishes rapidly. In the case of iodine vapour, red is thus
rendered more refrangible than blue and violet.
   According to Lord Rayleigh, we are to regard the vibrating
aether as analogous to the heavy upper pendulum, and the
vibrating molecules of the substance to the light lower pen
dulum.     The colour which is absorbed is the colour which
has the same frequency as the molecules of the substance.
        * Glasgow, Trans. Inst. Engin. x. 1867, pp. 139–150.

242     Dynamical Illustrations of Certain Optical Phenomena.
 Colours which, in the ordinary spectrum, are on the red side
 of the absorbed colour have lower frequency than the mole
 cular vibrations. This is the case of “upper pendulum
 naturally the slower,” and the resultant vibration will be
 slower still. Lord Rayleigh calls this effect an increase in the
 “virtual inertia” of the upper pendulum. I subjoin Lord
 Rayleigh's own words (Phil. Mag. xliii. p. 322), which are
 quoted in full in Lord Kelvin’s ‘Baltimore Lectures,’ and
 are paraphrased in Preston’s “Light.” Professor Preston
 identifies the “pendulum ” in the quotation with the lower
 of the two, and the “point subject to horizontal vibration ”
 with the bob of the upper; and this is also my own under
 standing of the passage.
    “The effect of a pendulum, suspended from a point subject
 to horizontal vibration, is to increase or diminish the virtual
inertia of the mass, according as the natural period of the
pendulum is shorter or longer than that of its point of sus
pension. This may be expressed by saying that, if the point
of support tends to vibrate more rapidly than the pendulum,
it is made to go faster still, and vice versä.
   “Below the absorption band, the material vibration is
naturally higher, and hence the effect of the associated matter
is to increase (abnormally) the virtual inertia of the aether, and
therefore the refrangibility. On the other side the effect is
the reverse.”
   The latter part of the passage is to me somewhat obscure.
The analogy seems to point to a change of frequency, but
instead of this we have a change in velocity of propagation.

and electromotive force departs from a straight line beyond
one million two hundred thousand volts, and approaches the
axis expressing the voltage. Thus the extreme length of
spark in air which I have been able to obtain with three
million volts is six feet and a half; whereas a length of at
least ten feet should have been attained if the proportionality
between spark-length and voltage had been maintained.
   This departure from proportionality is due to the increased
conducting-power of the air; for a powerful brush-discharge
is seen to proceed from the terminals of the apparatus to the
floor and the walls of the room. Hoping to diminish this
loss, I raised the apparatus three feet above the floor and
removed all metallic masses and pipes from its neighbourhood.
There was a slight gain in length of spark; but it was evident
that the air yielded with great readiness to the powerful
electric stress. When a discharge occurred between the
spark-terminals a portion of it was shunted, so to speak,
through the surrounding air. The spark preferred to leap
through three or four inches of air to passing through one
thousand ohms of sulphate of copper between terminals of
copper one square centimetre in area It is probable that
with still higher voltage the initial resistance of air would
still further diminish, and would be of the order of metals.
   The initial resistance, too, of highly rarefied media dimi
nishes in a similar manner.         Thus a Crookes tube which
resists the passage of an eight-inch spark is brilliantly lighted
by a difference of potential of three million volts, and one
discharge of the duration of a millionth of a second is sufficient
to obtain a photograph of the bones of the hand.
   In  º          paper* I have spoken of the small resistance
of the electric spark, and of the singular fact that this resist
ance does not increase materially with the length of the spark.
In approaching this subject from another point of view, I
was interested to note that Bjerknest obtained a factor of
damping of 0:27 with sparks one millimetre long, and a factor
of 0-39 with sparks five millimetres long.
   Since the factor of damping y=          }.    in which W repre
sents resistance, t time, and L self-induction, it is evident
that the resistance W does not increase proportionately to the
 º of spark. Bjerknes states that his experimental results
with long sparks were uncertain. This uncertainty, I am
inclined to believe, was due to the rapidly changing electro
static field ; and to its wide extension when the spark-ter

minals are largely separated. The electrostatic field in the
neighbourhood of my apparatus is extremely powerful. Long
sparks can be drawn from neighbouring metallic masses, such
as gas-pipes; and sparks several millimetres long can be
obtained by presenting the knuckles to the brick walls of the
room in which the apparatus is placed.
   The behaviour of air and rarefied gases to powerful electric
stress seems to me to be analogous to the behaviour of elastic
solids to mechanical stresses.         The initial resistance of air
steadily diminishes with powerful electric stresses, and under
a disruptive discharge sinks to two or three ohms. This
phenomenon leads to a rapid change of potential, and is con
ducive to the formation of the electromagnetic impulses which
we have reason to believe are the source of the r-rays. The
question, moreover, of the electrical conductivity of the aether,
I believe can best be considered from the elastic-solid point
of view.

       through a rectangular slit A (fig. 1) and fall upon a
 piece of plate-glass of the same thickness as the width of the
 slit or greater, and if we observe the reflexion of the slit, it
 appears thus:–

 middle image is caused solely by the light reflected from the
 lower surface of the upper plate, and from the upper surface
 of the lower plate. If we substitute for the two glass plates
 the apparatus generally used for exhibiting Newton’s rings,
 we can in this simple way view the rings by light coming
 from the two interior surfaces only, and thus completely free
 from either light reflected from the upper surface of the
 upper plate, or from the lower surface of the lower plate.
    Thus viewed, the central area appears of a velvety black
 and the colours of the rings exceedingly brilliant. The whole
 experiment can be easily projected, and the difference in the
 appearance of the rings on the screen with and without the
 slit is very striking. But the interest of the method does not
 end here; for besides affording an easy and obvious proof
 that the rings are caused by two reflexions, one at each of
 the two inner surfaces,     º,      under these circumstances, by
 these two reflexions only, it also supplies a method of seeing and
 distinguishing the interference-curves caused by light which
 has undergone 1, 2, or 3 reflexions (forming the ring-system
 usually seen, and named after Sir Isaac), and the curves
 formed by the interference of rays which have suffered 4, 5,
 and 6 reflexions or more.       For if the reflexion of the slit in a
 single glass plate be viewed more obliquely, as suggested

                    of viewing Newton’s Rings.                247
 before, the images are arranged as in fig. 4, where B, is caused
 by light which, originally reflected from the lower surface of
                               Fig. 4.
 the plate, has undergone a second reflexion from the upper
 interior surface, and a third from the lower interior surface of
 the plate. Similarly, the light by which B is seen has under
 gone five internal reflexions; C has undergone seven; C1 nine;
and so on. Now when the second plate is added beneath the
 first it gives rise to a similar series, but more complicated
 from the fact that the second plate's reflexions are not only
 caused by its internal surfaces but also by its external upper
surface.
    The course of the rays forming the first few reflexions is
 easily seen from fig. 5. By backing the plate in the usual
                               Fig. 5.

way we can practically suppress the reflexions from the lower
internal surface of the lower plate; and since A1 is the sole
reflexion from the upper surface of the upper plate, it follows
that we see in A, B, B2, &c., the results of reflexions in (a)
the internal upper surface of the upper plate, (b) the internal

 face of the lower plate, º possibly (d) the external lower
 surface of the upper plate (ride fig. 8).
    Of (a), (b), and (c), the images A2, B1, B, C, C, contain
 rays which have undergone reflexion at these respective sur
 faces the number of times under the corresponding letter in
 the subjoined table

    Now since the phase of a light-wave loses half a wave
 length in the act of being reflected in a denser medium, and
 since the sum of the three rows is odd for each strip such as
 B1, the light which forms the figures sº en in each image of the
slit will in every case lose an integral number of wave-lengths:
 it follows that if the centre of the primary rings is black or
coloured, so far as this consideration is concerned, the centres
of the secondary and tertiary rings will also be black or
coloured.     Bl, B, C, C, . . . . will therefore each contain a
reflexion of the primary rings, growing weaker and weaker
in intensity, not only from the loss of light at each re
flexion but also from absorption, and perhaps from the
scattering of a very small fraction of the light by solid par
ticles of dust or air-bubbles, which are wont to occur even in
the clearest glass. The effect of the curvature of the lower
surface of the upper plate will be to displace these repetitions
of the primary rings a little downwards. It is clear that any
rays which once completely interfere are cut out once for all;
and it follows that any interference curves which appear for
the first time in any particular image of the slit must be the
result of light which has hitherto escaped interference : e. g.
if we look at the image B, besides the reflexion of the primaries
there is a series of rings which are exact continuations of the
primaries; and, moreover, these continuations can be traced,
though the observation is not an easy one, right across the
reflexion of the black central spot which occupies the centre of
the primary rings. If this be not due to light scattered in the
body of the glass itself, it must prove that the interference
which causes the black spot at the primaries is not complete,
though very nearly so. In making this observation the eye
must be screened from all light except that which comes
from the black spot in B; and it must be borne in mind that
care is necessary to avoid the smallest particles of dust between

                    of viewing Newton's Rings.               249
the two plates. If there are any of these, they cause white
specks in the black area, and in its reflecion in B, and will
obviously make it easy for the eye to follow the black conti
nuations of the primaries across the reflexion of the spot.
The writer is of opinion that the interference is not complete.
It seems worth notice that when the plates are very clean the
darkest area of the black spot has a sharply defined edge,
recalling the character of the black film of a soap-bubble. If
there is a species of welding together of the molecules of glass
at the black spot, with molecules of the gases of air mecha
nically entangled, the blackness would be explained, since the
light can pass through without leaving the glass medium;
and, on the other hand, the entangled air being, as it were,
pulverized, would reflect irregularly. The fact that the edge
of the spot is very sharply defined shows that it is not only the
effect of the difference of wave-length. As the black spot is
approached in the plane of the rings, the light does fall off
gradually up to a certain point, at which the shade is a dark
 grey, but then passes “per saltum,” to the velvety black
 before alluded to.           Fig. 6.
   To explain how it is the continuations of the primaries
are seen in B (vide fig. 6), see fig. 7, where l m is one

 250               Mr. T. C. Porter on a Method
 of the rays of white light coming through the slit, reflected
 at the uppermost surface at m, giving the image A, then
 º through the upper plate to a and accompanied by
 light reflected from the upper surface of the lower plate, which
has not interfered with it. At a a part of the ray is reflected;
 the rest is refracted into the air-space, undergoes reflexion
 at b, another refraction at c; and is then transmitted to d
 unless destroyed by interference: there, part is refracted into
the air and forms one of the bright primaries; but a consi
 derable part is reflected to h and g, the two reflected rays there
 interfering for the first time, and generating the continuations
 of the primary rings; for it is evident that light reflected from
 d might, so far as its effect at k is concerned, have been origi
 nally incident at d, in which case it certainly would have
 generated the continuations of the parts of the primary rings
observed in A. Thus B will show (1) a reflexion of the
parts of the primaries seen in A, and (2) continuations of the
primaries. It is now perfectly obvious that the image B,
 (fig. 5) ought to exhibit:-(1) Faint continuations of the
primary rings, produced by light which has escaped inter
ference in c and h (fig. 8), but has interfered for the first

originally incident at f. (2), Continuations of the first, re
flexion of the primaries visible in B1. These continuations
are caused by light which has escaped interference as far as o,
and is the result of the internal reflexion at d, i. e. the rings
occupy the same position as if the light had been originally
incident at d. (3) A new reflexion of the primary rings,
first caused at c, and reflected at d, g, f, s.
    Observation shows these three sets of rings in B, (vide
figures 6 and 9, fig. 9 being added to make plain the
arrangement by which fig. 6 was obtained), and no more.
In the same way we can predict exactly what the inter
ference systems will be like in Ci, Cº, &c. We have not

yet made any attempt to examine the effect of the re
flexions classed under (d), p. 248. If we look at fig. 8, which
is part of fig. 7 on a larger scale, we see that reflexions take
place at c, y, z, w, v : now if the path a b c causes the part
of the ray m a which takes it to be an odd number of half
wave-lengths behind that part of n c which is reflected at c
in the direction cd, and thus causes interference in ed; then
                                Fig. 9.
                               S L | T
c y z will cause the ray a b c y z which is reflected at c to be
very nearly an even number of half wave-lengths behind the
incident ray oa, and therefore this ray will increase the bright
ness of 2p: similarly in v q the residual light which reaches v
by the path a b c y z w v must be an odd number of half wave
 lengths behind the light in s v, and will therefore interfere:
 but since in every case the diminution in intensity caused by
 these reflexions at a b c y z must be rapid, it is practically only
 the reflexions a b c y z that can result in visible phenomena.
 If the region from a to v produces, on the whole, one of the
 dark rings (using monochromatic light), then if 2 p, regarded
 as part of n c y z p and of oz, be the darkest part of the ring,
 where interference is a maximum, nevertheless at z the part
 of the ray from a, namely a b c y z, will reinforce the reflected
 part of the ray or p, and make the interference less complete
than it would otherwise have been ; and, similarly, a bright
 ring will not be quite so bright as it would be if there were no
 reflexions in the air-space. In short, the last-considered
 reflexions superimpose upon the primaries another set not in
 general coincident with them, and therefore in general
 weakening their intensity.
    It is also evident, since the more refrangible the light em
 ployed, the smaller the diameters of corresponding rings, if we

252           On a Method of viewing Newton’s Rings.
use white light for the generation of the rings and the sub
ordinate systems, we can predict the result: for colour will be
visible in any of the images of the slit Bl, B, C, C, &c. at the
points of intersection of the dark curves when it has faded
elsewhere. Hence co-major-axial hyperbolic broken lines of
colour must result, since the various sets of curves in mono
chromatic light are intersecting systems of circles whose
centres lie in one straight line. As the systems considered lie
more and more remote from the primaries, the first hyperbola
formed will be intersected by others, their numbers ever in
creasing, till, finally, the whole space considered is so full of
them that it seems everywhere pervaded by faint white light.
    The results obtained by the experiments described in this
paper may be briefly stated as follows:—
    (1) The method gives a very simple method of viewing
         Newton’s rings by the light emitted from the two
         interior surfaces of the glass plates, free from all other
         light, except only that due to reflexions in the air
         space.
    (2) It reveals to the eye (for the first time) the subordinate
         interference systems which coexist with the primary
         rings, and demonstrates which of these reflexions must
         be taken into account in framing the theory of the
         rings as they are generally viewed.
    (3) It supplies a method of analysing these systems ex
         perimentally.
    (4) It shows that most probably the interference of mono
         chromatic light in forming the rings is never absolutely
         complete, though very nearly so.
   NoTE.—The photograph (fig. 6) of the interference systems was

        supply an emission from the paper in the June number

 Röntgen rays are ordinary light of short wave-length; and if

    Röntgen rays consist of two distinct undulations which
present themselves in succession. They are an irregular
progression of independent pulses in the first part of their
course—from the target upon which the kathode-rays impinge
up to the object which is being skiographed. Beyond that
object, between it and the fluorescent screen, they are a
different undulation.
    For, as proved in the June number of the Magazine, the
radiation from the target is the same physical (and not merely
kinematical) event as the simultaneous advance over the same
ground of trains of waves, some of long others of short wave
lengths. Since the resolution into these trains of waves is
physical, the trains advance independently of one another; so
that if by any contrivance some of them can be stopped, the
rest will be unaffected and will proceed. Now the flesh of
the human hand is a contrivance of this kind; it is opaque
to the wave-lengths of all visible light and of much ultra
violet light, but allows waves that are below a certain limit of
shortness to pass through it. Accordingly, the trains of suffi
ciently short wave lengths are the only physical constituents
of the first undulation which can get past this obstacle;
and are what produce, by their coexistence in the space
beyond, that second part of the Röntgen undulation j
lies between the object and the fluorescent screen.

Then instead of repeating the Röntgen events at intervals of
a day, let them be repeated at intervals of N* days. Thereby
the period of the Fourier's series becomes N*T; and the
radiation of the Röntgen experiment, repeated at these longer
intervals, is represented by the coexistence of series of pen

                 N"T, and its integer submultiples.
    If n be changed into n+1 or m into m + 1, these series
will include new terms.

periodic times of any period, whether commensurable or in
commensurable with T.

  XXII. Note on the Application of the Gamma Function to an
       Electrostatic Problem. By R. H. JUDE, M.A., D.Sc.”
      {LERK-MAXWELL in his larger work on Electricity
          deals with the distribution of electricity on a pair of
  freely charged spheres in contact, and denoting their potential
  by V, their radii by a and b, and their respective charges by
   Q, and Q, establishes the relation
                 Q —     &= or       a?b

   with a similar expression for Q.
      Except in the simple case where a and b are equal, the
   summation indicated by (1) cannot be effected by ordinary
   algebraic methods. But by means of the Gamma Function a
   very neat result may be obtained which, so far as I am aware,
   has not hitherto been noticed.     Thus:–
      If n denote any quantity which is not negative, we have by

   It is obvious from this that H(0) = co, and H(1)=0; also that
 for values of n between 0 and 1, H(n) is positive and decreases
 as n increases, while when n > 1 it is negative.

 The Elements of Electro-Chemistry (treated experimentally). By
    Dr. R. LUPKB. Translated by M. M. PATTISON MUIR, M.A.
    London: H. Grevel and Co., 1897.
 IN    this treatise the fundamental and elementary parts of electro
      chemistry are presented in such a manner that it forms an
introductory text-book to the more exhaustive works of Ostwald
and Nernst. The subject is divided into three parts, corresponding
 with its historical development. The first of these treats of the
 facts of electrolysis and the general laws of Faraday, Hittorf, and
 Kohlrausch ; it terminates with an account of the dissociation
 theory of Arrhenius in which electrolytes are considered as solutions
 containing ions or dissociated molecules, and questions regarding
 coefficients of ionization and heat of ionization are discussed.    In
 the second part a sketch of the physical theory of solutions is
 given, leading up to a very short chapter on the apparently ano
 malous behaviour of electrolytes and the explanation of it given
 by Arrhenius. This chapter appears unduly compressed, seeing
 that the volume deals specially with electrolytic solutions. The
 third part contains a description of Nernst's application of modern
 theory to the chemistry and physics of the voltaic cell, which is
 presented in an elementary manner.
     The volume requires very much revision, particularly in the
 statements involving electrical units. Thus on p. 35 we find the
  remarkable statement that “This quantity of electricity expresses
  the electrochemical equivalent, that is to say, the number of coulombs
  which causes the separation, in one second, of that fraction of the
  atomic weight of a metal, or of the [formula-] weight of an anion
 group, expressed in grams, which corresponds with a single
 valency.” (The italics are ours.) The translator adds a footnote
 to elucidate the chemical part of the statement, but confirms the
 two electrical errors involved in it. The confusion of amperes
 with coulombs appears again later on the same page, and the

                          Geological Society.                        259
expression quantity of current occurs here and in many other parts
of the book.     The student is also informed in a translator's note
that a watt is a quantity of energy equal to the product of a volt
and a coulomb. On p. 200 we read that “the current which can
 be obtained from the (secondary) cell, even after short charging, is
 strong enough to set an alarm-clock in action.” Some details
 ought to be given concerning the internal mechanism of this re
 markable clock; perhaps, however, an electric bell is meant, although
 even in that case the statement is too indefinite to be of any use.
    The illustrations in the volume are for the most part diagrams,
 and are well executed.                                           J.L.H.

         1.  “The Carboniferous Limestone of the Country around Llan
  dudno.” By G. H. Morton, Esq., F.G.S.
     Llandudno is so well known and frequently visited, that the
  Carboniferous Limestone and the subdivisions into which it is
  divided by clear lithological characters may be more easily examined
  there than at any other similar locality. The subdivisions of “Lower
  Brown,’ ‘Middle White,’ and “Upper Grey' along the broad belt of
  limestone from Llanymynech to Prestatyn, and around the Vale of
  Clwyd, Abergele and Llandulas, have been so frequently described
  in the Proceedings of the Liverpool Geological Society that it is
  unnecessary to give any general description of them. At Llandudno
  the precipitous Great Orme's Head presents fine sections of the
  Carboniferous Limestone and the subdivisions referred to, and may
  be easily examined (with the aid of the appended geological map),
  in a continuous series of cliffs, ridges, and quarries. The entire
  succession is, however, not perfect, for the highest beds of the
   “Upper Grey Limestone' have been denuded, and at the Little
   Orme's Head the subdivision is altogether absent.
      Copper-lodes on the Great Orme's Head appear to have been
   worked by the Romans, and again in recent years until abandoned
   fully 30 years ago. Some of the lodes are faults, but little can
   be ascertained about them now, and only two or three are faults
   with any appreciable amount of dislocation. It is to the undulation
   of the limestone that the ever-varying dip of the beds is attributed.
       Numerous fossils occur in the “Upper Grey Limestone,’ and a
    few are peculiar to the subdivision and the locality, but of these only
    a single specimen of each has been found. Productus margaritaceus
    is abundant, though only an occasional species in other localities,
    and not found at a lower horizon anywhere else in North Wales.

Other species, such as Orthis Michelini, formerly supposed to be
peculiar to the “Upper Grey Limestone,' have been found at the
base of the ‘Middle White Limestone,’ at the Flagstaff Quarry on
the Marine Drive, near the Happy Valley.
   The dolomitization of the Carboniferous Limestone is remarkable,
and almost peculiar to that around Llandudno, though it also occurs
at Penmon in Anglesey. The ‘Lower Brown Limestone' has been
almost entirely converted into dolomite, and portions of the over
lying subdivisions. The filling of the faults has often been changed
into dolomite, and the alteration of the Limestone has generally been
very capricious : the author's opinion being that the change took
place after the dislocation of the strata in post-Triassic times.

GENTLEMEN,                                                            -
ON      page 183 of the February 1898 number of your Magazin
-      appears an article by Frederick Jervis-Smith, M.A., F.R.S.,
Millard and University Lecturer on Mechanics, Oxford, entitled
“A New Method of Measuring the Torsional Angle of a Rotating
Shaft or Spiral Spring.”
   The method which Mr. Smith describes is precisely the same as
was employed for this purpose in my laboratory in 1885–86.
   An account was presented to the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers in November 1886, and this account was published in
voiume viii. of the Transactions, pages 130–139.
    In this article on the “Strength of Shafting subjected to both
twisting and bending ” the description of the apparatus for meas
uring the angle of twist is given on pages 138 and 139; and a cut
of the entire apparatus is on page 134.
   Moreover, in London Engineering of January 14th, 1887, page
26, a portion of my communication to the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers is published, including a copy of the cut of
the entire apparatus, though the written description of the portion
 used for measuring the angle of twist is onlitted.
   Evidently if Mr. Smith had been aware of these published
articles, he would not have called the method he describes new.
   I will add that this portion of the apparatus was mainly devised
by Mr. Theodore R. Foster, who was at that time a student in the
department.

TH:        object of the present investigation is two-fold:
       firstly to determine the effect of hydrostatic pressure
on the magnetization of iron and nickel and to find whether
there exist reciprocal relations between the effects of com
pression and the volume-change of ferromagnetics by magne
tization; secondly, to examine Kirchhoff's f theory of mag
netostriction from measurement of strains produced by
magnetization and from the effects of stress on the magnetiza
tion of iron and nickel.
    Both experiment and theory show that physical changes
are mostly reciprocal. In magnetism, this fact is             nºi,
brought out by the mutual relations between twist and
magnetization f, as well as by the change of length caused
by magnetization and the effect of longitudinal pull applied
to the magnetized wire. Theoretical exposition of these
facts was given by J. J. Thomson S; by applying similar
reasoning to the effect of hydrostatic pressure on magnetiza
tion, we can show that the change of volume accompanying

the magnetization must to some extent be reciprocal to the
change of magnetization wrought by compression.
    Unfortunately our knowledge of the volume-change by
magnetization is very scanty and discordant, so that we had to
undertake fresh experiments on the specimens of ferro
magnetics used in our research. The question regarding
the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the magnetization is
intimately connected with the thermodynamics of elastic
 bodies. From this standpoint, the problem was for the first
time attacked by Wassmuth", whose experimental results are
in rough agreement with his theory. His experiments were
 rather of a qualitative nature, no absolute measurement of
 ºr. as well as that of magnetization being undertaken.
    . Tomlinson f, in his series of experiments on the effect of
 stress on the properties of matter, has examined this point,
 and was led to the following conclusion —“Fluid pressure
 does not temporarily affect either the temporary magnetic
 susceptibility of annealed iron, or the permanent magnetization
 of hard steel, except, it may be, to a degree which is not
 comparable with that of the effect of stress in any one
 direction.”
     Although experiments on the effect of hydrostatic pressure
 are very scanty, the effect of one-sided pressure was a subject
 of investigation by several physicists; the effect of trans
 verse stress on the magnetization of iron was examined by
  Lord Kelvin f, and that of longitudinal compression by
  Ewing § and Chree ||. Unlike all these effects, the change
  wrought by hydrostatic pressure is of different order of
  magnitude, as remarked by Tomlinson. Without special
  arrangements for detecting a minute change in magnetization,
  we cannot well measure the change produced by all-sided
  pressure.
      In a paper on the effect of magnetic stress in magneto
  striction, Mr. E. T. Jones and one of us" have pointed out
  the importance of investigating the relation of magnetization
  to hydrostatic pressure in deciding the intricate question of
  magnetostriction. Mr. Jones” has, however, found out that
  it is unnecessary to take up experiments on hydrostatic
  pressure, inasmuch as the quantity which is required to settle

the question can be deduced by means of simple experiments
on the effect of longitudinal pull on a ferromagnetic wire.
   As our object was not confined merely to the question of
magnetic stress, we were enabled, after several fruitless
attempts, to establish the fact that the effect of hydrostatic
pressure is not immeasurably small, but that .. is a
remarkable reciprocal relation between the volume-change
due to magnetization and the change of magnetization by
compression.
    In order to settle the question of magnetostriction, we
measured the change of length and the effect of longitudinal
pull on the magnetization of iron and nickel. From the
different combinations of these effects, we can calculate the
coefficients k" and k" introduced by Kirchhoff.          We are
 thus enabled to examine the effect of stress from the strains
caused by magnetization and vice versa.                        -
    The present paper will therefore be divided into the
 following sections:–

          by magnetization.
     (2) Measurement of the effects of hydrostatic and transverse
          pressures and of longitudinal pull on the magnetization
          of iron and nickel.

          parison between theory and experiment.

    Measurement of the Intensity of Magnetization.—We shall
 hereafter consider the strains produced by magnetization as
  functions of the magnetizing force and the intensity of
  magnetization ; it will thus be necessary in the first place to
  determine the magnetizations of the various specimens of the
  ferromagnetics used in the present experiment. They were
  of the following dimensions:—
     1. Ovoid of Swedish iron.
           Length of major axis = 20 cm. ; minor axis = 0.986 cm.;

        factor N “ – 0.0848.

   The demagnetizing factor for the rod was calculated on
the supposition that N was equal to that of a circular cylinder
of the same cross-section.
   The magnetizing coil was 30 cm. long, and wound in 12
layers; its resistance was 0.63 ohm, and gave the field of
37.97 C.G.S. units at the middle of the coil due to a current
of one ampere.
   The magnetometer consisted of a small bell-magnet sus
pended in a thick copper case by a quartz fibre and provided
with a plane mirror. It was placed due magnetic east of the
coil, and its deflexion read by means of scale and telescope.

    Change of Volume produced by Magnetization.—Before we
 proceed to the description of the method employed in the
 present experiment, it will be worth while to compare the
 results of several previous investigators on the change of
 volume produced by magnetization.
    It was generally admitted that there is no change of volume
 by magnetization, but it will be easily seen that most of these
 experimenters tried to increase the volume of the magnet by
 unusually increasing the thickness instead of length, thus
 incurring the risk of increasing the demagnetizing factor.
 They did not therefore arrive at a field-strength sufficient to
 produce appreciable change of volume.
    Joule" was the first to call attention to the change of
 volume which may accompany the magnetization of iron.
 The result was in the negative; but as he gave neither the
 strength of the magnetizing current nor the intensity of
 magnetization, it is difficult to compare his result with that
              * Joule, Phil. Mag. vol. xxx. p. 76 (1847).

Messrs. H. Nagaoka and K. Honda on Magnetostriction. 265
of his successors. It is beyond doubt that the change of
volume was very minute, and there was sufficient evidence
that the elongation in the direction of magnetization is
accompanied by contraction in the direction perpendicular
to it.
   The elaborate researches of Cantone" on the strain of ferro
magnetic ovoids are not free from the fault above mentioned.
The major axis of the ovoid was 16-7 times that of the minor,
so that the demagnetizing factor = 0: 1134. As his results
are given in terms of the magnetizing current and the
moment of the magnet, we have thought it advisable to re
calculate the result in magnetizing force H (= Ho - NI,
where Ho stands for the magnetizing force in the coil) and
I. The following table gives Cantone's determination of the
intensity of magnetization —
     ------
             13.5                 2.0                    102

             58'5                 7.5                    450
   It will be seen from the above table that on account of the
great demagnetizing factor the magnetizing force was less than
8 C.G.S. units although the field in the coil was nearly 60.
   Cantone observed no alteration of volume in an iron ovoid
even with a magnetizing current of 12 amperes; but it is
quite probable that the intensity of magnetization, as well as
that of magnetizing force, was insufficient to produce appre
ciable change,
    On account of the small susceptibility of nickelf, the effect
of the great demagnetizing factor in Cantone's nickel ovoid
was not so marked as in iron.       So far as we are aware, he was
the first to notice the diminution of volume in nickel by mag
netization. Although his measurements with dilatometer
filled with water and with alcohol are widely different, it is
beyond doubt that the readings with alcohol are the more
reliable for reasons which will be afterwards given. His
calculation of Kirchhoff's coefficients k' and k" based on the
measurement of the change of length and of volume in nickel
by magnetization throw much light on the theory of magneto
striction.

    Our knowledge of the change of internal volume in iron,
steel, and nickel tubes in the magnetizing field has been
largely extended by the numerous researches of Dr. C. G.
Knott". It is much to be regretted that the magnetization
was not uniform in his experiments, and consequently the
change of volume could not be expressed as a function of
the magnetization. The discussion of his results is rendered
doubly intricate by the influence of the steel or brass cap for
fixing the capillary tube to the hollow cylinder. Such incon
venience will disappear if the change of volume of the magnet
itself be observed, as is easily possible if sufficient precaution
be taken in the arrangement of the measuring apparatus.
    These circumstances show that the question regarding the
change of volume by magnetization is by no means settled ;
as almost all theories of magnetostriction make the strain in
ferromagnetics depend on the intensity of magnetization and
that of magnetizing force, we have examined the alteration of
 volume as functions of these two quantities.
    The change of volume was determined by means of a dila
 tometer. The specimen to be tested was placed in a glass
 tube provided with a capillary neck (fig. 1). B shows the
 upper part of the capillary tube (0.215 mm. radius) with
 reservoir for filling the dilatometer with liquid. In supporting
 the ovoid in the tube, care was taken not to let it touch the
 sealed end of the glass tube. Two circular brass rings (a, a')
 were inserted into the tube, and made to fit tightly against
 the wall of the dilatometer. A brass plate of the form given
 at A was soldered to the ring at S. The ends of the ovoid
 were then placed loosely in the triangular holes. The ovoid
 was thus supported in the central line of the dilatometer
 without   toº,          the glass tube. A similar arrangement was
 º           for supporting the nickel rod within the dilatometer.
      o prevent rusting of iron, the dilatometer was filled with
 very dilute solution of caustic soda nearly up to the neck.
 The capillary tube and a small portion of the main tube near
 the neck contained ether.            When the dilatometer was all
 filled with water or petroleum, the indication of the volume
 change was very irregular, as fine drops of the liquid stuck
 to the wall of the capillary tube and as the liquid was not
  sufficiently mobile. Cantone f had also similar experience in
  measuring the volume-change of the nickel ovoid. It would
 have been easier to fill the dilatometer ail with ether, but

 there was difficulty in the observation owing to the greater
 expansion of the liquid due to the heating of the coil. We
 consider that the present mode of filling the dilatometer pro
 Yided, with fine capillary tube can be successfully applied
 for other purposes of a similar nature.

   The ovoid was placed in the middle of the magnetizing coil
and the rise or fall of the meniscus in the capillary tube was
observed by means of a microscope with micrometer ocular.
Although the resistance of the coil was only 0:6 ohm, the
heating effect was considerable, so that only an instantaneous
observation could be made. The difficulty was to a great
extent overcome by passing the current for some time in the
coil ; the ovoid was then demagnetized by the method of
reversals ; waiting for some time, the meniscus became
stationary, the magnetizing current was then made and the
reading taken. The measurement was made in a cellar with
gaslight at some distance behind the capillary tube ; by this
arrangement the meniscus was sharply defined.

     rapidly until it reaches the “Wendepunkt,” whence to increase
     º,       though at a slower rate.
        For feeble magnetization the change of volume is very
    small; but with the strong, the change is nearly proportional
    to the square of the intensity of magnetization. Compared
    with Dr. Knott's measurements, we find that the initial
    behaviour of nickel as regards the internal and external
    volume-changes is different, Dr. Knott finding the increase
   of internal volume. In other respects the quality of the
   change is similar, but the amount is nearly ten times smaller
   in the present experiment than the determination of Dr. Knott
   on the internal volume of the nickel tube; Cantone's deter
  mination with nickel ovoid is twice as large as in the present
  measurement.
     Change of Length by Magnetization.—It would be superfluous
  to give minute details of the measurement of the change of
 length by magnetization. The apparatus was the same as
 that used by one of us * some years ago in the measurement
 of hysteresis accompanying the change of length. It con
 sisted of a single optical lever with arrangement for tempe
 rature compensation on the same principle as the gridiron
pendulum. The mirror described in the former paper was,
on this occasion, replaced by a small right-angled prism.

are given in the following table, with the corresponding values

   These changes are plotted against H and I in fig. 7 (Pl. I.)
It will be seen from these curves that the length-change
produced in the ovoid or in the nickel rod is similar to
that obtained by one of us, and described in the papers
above cited. The determinations are in close agreement with
the results of Bidwell and several other investigators. The
inspection of these figures for nickel shows a striking re
semblance between similar curves for the change of volume
in the same metal.      The behaviour in iron is different as
regards the change of length and that of volume.
 § 2. Effects of Hydrostatic and Transverse Pressures on the
               Magnetization of Iron and Nickel.
   The remarkable effect produced by longitudinal pull or
compression on the magnetization of ferro-magnetic bodies
premised the outcome of a similar result by the application
of hydrostatic pressure, as shown by the experiments of
Wassmuth*. No such marked influence of compression was
observed, but a minute change in the reading of the magneto
meter showed that the effect was not immeasurably small. It
was only by special arrangement that the nature of the change
was clearly made out.                                 -
  The hydrostatic pressure was given by means of Cailletet's
pump used for liquefying gases. The pump was provided
with Ducretet manometer indicating pressure up to 300
atmospheres. These indications, on being gauged by mea
suring the volume of dry air, showed wide difference from the
actual pressure, the relation between the change of volume
and pressure being taken from Natterer and Amagat’s
determinations. One end of a seamless copper tube 4.7 metres
long and of 3 millim. internal, 7 millim. external diameter
was attached to the pump; by pumping water into the tube -
pressure was communicated to a vessel containing iron or
nickel which is to be compressed.
   The ovoid or rod, which was to be examined under dif
ferent pressures, was enclosed in a short brass tube T (fig. 2)
(internal diameter 1:1 centim., external diameter 2 centim,
length 31 centim.) filled with water. The tube fitted loosely
in the magnetizing-coil. The lower end of the ovoid was
placed in a conical hole bored in the end screw fitting into
the main tube T. To prevent dislocation of the ovoid and to
keep it always vertical, the upper end was loosely placed in a
triangular hole in the brass plate A in the manner already
described in the determination of the change of volume. The
neck of the vessel consisted of a smaller brass tube provided
                       * Wassmuth, loc. cit.

with a flange F; by means of a strong brass screw Sattached
to F the whole vessel can be slowly moved in the solenoid,
so that there was no difficulty in placing the magnetized body
in proper position for experiment.

    The vessel was connected with the copper tube from the
 pump by a screw-nut N. Before experiment it was always
 necessary to apply a pressure of more than 250 atmospheres
 to find if there was leakage at the screw-joints.
    Two such brass tubes T and T', both containing the magnet
 in the same geometrical form, were placed in the solenoids
 S and S (fig. 3), which also were of the same dimensions, as
 shown in the accompanying figure. The coils were each 40
 cm. long, wound in six layers, and gave the field of 17-7
 C.G.S. units for a current of one ampere. The magneto
 meter M was placed midway between the solenoids, due

magnetic east and west. When the current was made, the
magnetization of two similar bodies produced nearly the
same effect on the magnetometer in opposite sense ;      thus the
deflexion of the magnetometer was so compensated that the
magnetometer could be placed very near the solenoids and
thereby rendered sensible to a slight change in the condition
of the magnetized body. In order to make the compensation
exact, the auxiliary solenoid S' was provided with levelling
screws, and the brass tube containing the auxiliary magnet
with screw for adjusting the vertical position of the magnet.
The magnetizing solenoid was firmly fixed to the solid stone
pier, so that there was no risk of being disturbed by the
application of strong pressure to the vessel through bent
copper tubes; it was also tested by means of a long thread
pendulum attached to the solenoid that no appreciable dis
placement of the solenoid took place during the application
or removal of pressure.

   To make the reading of the magnetometer sensitive, it was
necessary to place the magnet in a position of maximum
deflexion; this can be effected either by calculation for the
ovoid + or experimentally determined for other shapes. The
brass vessel was moved slowly up and down to such a position
that it was not affected by the small vertical displacement,

thus giving the position of maximum deflexion.          It was
necessary to place the magnet in the above position, owing to
the slight displacement due to the strain caused by strong
pressure. For a small vertical motion, the magnetometer could
remain practically unaffected in the position above chosen. :
   It is clear from the arrangement for compensation that not
only is the effect of magnetization on the magnetometer to a
great extent compensated, but the effect of temperature rise
due to the magnetizing current is also compensated, as the
auxiliary magnet is enclosed in a similar brass tube and
placed in a coil of the same dimension and resistance. It
is to be remarked that the compensation was never exact, for
though the ovoids or rods were made of the same material,
there was some difference of quality as regards magnetization.
Thus the compensation, though exact in certain fields, was
not fulfilled throughout the whole range of fields; neverthe
less the difference was not very great, and we believe that
the influence of the rise of temperature or that of change of
position due to the strain caused by pressure would not be so
large as to materially deteriorate the experimental results.
In spite of this, care was taken to keep the field during the
experiment constant by watching the indication of the deci
ampere balance, by which the current was measured ; further,
it was generally possible to perfect the compensation for
feeble change of current by slightly shifting the auxiliary
magnet or the coil.
   The horizontal component of the terrestrial magnetic force
was slightly affected by thus placing the coils very near the
magnetometer, so that it was necessary to measure the period
of vibration of the magnetometer magnet by means of a chro
nograph, and to apply the correction to the observed intensity
of magnetization.
   The change in the intensity of magnetization due to alte
ration of volume is evidently nearly equal to —Iów/v. The
diminution of volume will therefore produce increase of
magnetization which is generally of the same order of magni
tude as the change in magnetization wrought by compression.
   Results in Iron.—A few of the observed results with iron
ovoid or cylinder are given in figs. 8 and 9 (Pl. II.). The
dotted lines indicate the correction due to change of volume
by compression, which must be added to the apparent change.
The inspection of these figures shows minute diminution of
magnetization by the application of hydrostatic pressure: in
fact, the apparent change measured in C.G.S. units does not
even amount to 0-1 with the pressure of 250 atmospheres.
At the above-mentioned pressure the change of intensity for

 274 Messrs. H. Nagaoka and K. Honda on Magnetostriction.
 H=54 is less than ºn of the intensity of magnetization.
 During a pressure cycle there is distinct hysteresis, and the
 curve of the change of magnetization generally forms a single
 loop. On account of the inconstancy of the field, the mea
 surement with the ovoid could not extend beyond H=15;
 with the iron cylinder H=54 was the strongest field in
 which the cyclic change could safely be observed.
    If, from experiments of pressure cycles, the curves of the
 change in magnetization for constant pressure in different
 fields be plotted, we obtain fig. 10, when the change of mag
 netization due to contraction of volume is not taken into
 account ; if the correction be applied, then we obtain fig. 11.
 These curves show that the range of the change in magneti
 zation due to pressure increases with the field ; the increase
 takes place very rapidly at first, but becomes asymptotic in
 moderate fields. Plotting these changes against magnetiza
 tion we obtain figs. 12 and 13.
    Comparing these curves with those for the change of
 volume by magnetization, we find similarity between the two.
 It is interesting to remark that whereas increase of magnetiza
 tion produces increase of rolume in iron, the diminution of
 volume produces diminution of magnetization. Thus a reci
 procal relation between the strain caused by magnetization
 and the effect of compressional stress on the magnetization
 of iron is established.
   Results in Nickel.—The curves of pressure cycle in nickel
are shown in figs. 14 and 15 (Pl. II.). The change of mag
netization wrought by compression is exceedingly small, but
comparatively greater than those in iron, and the hysteresis
during the cycle is more decided. Whereas hydrostatic pres
sure causes diminution of magnetization in iron, there is
increase of magnetization in nickel. Similar to other effects
of stress as stretching, and twisting, we find that the change
in iron is opposite to that in nickel.
   The curves of the change of magnetization by constant
pressure in different fields (figs. 14 and 15) show that there
is increase of magnetization in weak fields until it reaches a
maximum in moderate fields; it then goes on slowly decreas
ing. This feature is characteristic of all pressures up to 250
atmospheres. Plotted against magnetization, the general
appearance of the curves is the same as that for magnetizing
fields (figs. 16 and 17, Pl. II.)
   Comparing these curves with those obtained from change
of volume by magnetization, we notice that whereas increase
of magnetization produces diminution of volume in nickel, the
diminution of colume produces increase of magnetization.

Messrs. H. Nagaoka and K. Honda on Magnetostriction. 275
    It will be shown later on that the minuteness of the effect
of compression on the magnetization of iron and nickel leads
to an important conclusion in the theory of magnetostriction.
    Effect of Transverse Stress on the Magnetization of an Iron
 Tube.—Lord Kelvin ", in his series of experiments on the
electrodynamic qualities of metals, investigated the effect of
transverse stress on the magnetization of an iron tube by
subjecting the inner surface of a gun-barrel to hydrostatic
pressure. In our experiment it was of no small importance
to try similar experiments with iron, to decide whether the
minute change produced by all-sided pressure was also
characteristic of the effect of transverse stress produced by
pressure on the external surface of an iron or nickel tube.
    To the extremities of a hollow iron cylinder (external
diameter 0.936 cm., internal diameter 0.400 cm., length
25 cm.) were soldered two thick brass caps in the manner
shown in the annexed diagram (fig. 4), and placed in the
compressing-vessel above described. By pumping in water
to the vessel, the iron tube was subjected to pressure º
on its external surface alone, and the change of " "
magnetization tested in the manner above described.
It was soon noticed that the effect was enormously
large and opposite to that of all-sided pressure.
By keeping the pressure constant, the difference in
magnetization when the tube was in the strained
and unstrained state was determined for different
fields; the curves of the change in magnetization
thus obtained for pressures of 50, 150, and 250
atmospheres are shown in fig. 18 (Pl. II.).
    The present experiment is just the reverse of Lord Kelvin's,
and the inspection of the figures (fig. 18) will show that the
 result is just the reverse. With increase of the magnetizing
force there is increase of magnetization till it reaches a
 maximum, thence to diminish in stronger fields. As the
 pressure is increased, the decrease of magnetization after
 once reaching a critical value is so great that the magnetiza
 tion in strong fields is less than in the unstrained condition.
 The result is thus in close agreement with Lord Kelvin's
 anticipation that the effects of positive pressure will be
 opposite to the effects of negative pressure.
     These experiments show that the application of stress so as
 to produce no shear affects the magnetization of iron and
 nickel only very slightly; but the remarkable change in
 magnetization produced by tensional or compressional stress

   applied longitudinally, as well as that due to twisting-wrench,
   is always accompanied by a shearing strain, a result which
   will be of no small value in the theory of molecular mag
   netism.
      Effects of Longitudinal Pull on the Magnetization of Iron and
   Nickel.—This subject has been studied by several investigators,
   but, so far as we are aware, the change in magnetization by
   the application of feeble stress is scarcely known. It will be
   seen from experiments on the strain produced by magnetiza
   tion that the deformation corresponds to the effect of a feeble
   stress. As our principal object was a comparison of Kirch
   hoff's theory of magnetostriction with experiment, we found
   it necessary to pay special attention to the change in the
   magnetic qualities of iron and nickel, when the rods of these
   metals are subjected to small loading, which will strain the
   ferromagnetic body to an extent comparable with the defor
   mation in the magnetizing field.
      As the iron ovoid used in the preceding experiment was
   unfit for studying the effect of  ...;             pull, an iron rod
   of 0.273 sq. cm. section made of the same material as the
   ovoid was used for measuring the change of magnetization in
   the free and in the feebly stretched condition. The nickel
   rod used in all the preceding experiments was also examined.
   The magnetometer was made sensitive by means of the
   compensation arrangement used in studying the effects of
   hydrostatic pressure.

         The magnetization of iron in the stretched state increases
      with the magnetizing force till it reaches a maximum in
      H=14 nearly ; it then goes on slowly diminishing, and
      ultimately becomes less than in the free state. In nickel
      there is decrease of magnetization in the stretched state,
     except in weak fields, where a slight increase was observed.
     Corresponding to a critical field in iron, for which the change
     of magnetization is maximum, there is also a critical field for
     which the diminution of magnetization in nickel is maximum.
     It will be seen from the figures that the change of magnetiza
    tion is not exactly proportional to the amount of longitudinal
    stress.
        It appears from Prof. Ewing’s “ experiment that the
    increase of magnetization in iron in weak fields becomes more
    pronounced with greater loading, but the field at which the
    magnetization becomes smaller than in the unloaded state
    recedes towards the weaker side. Although Prof. Ewing
   did not observe these points in fields greater than 8, with
    loading which is far greater than that in the present experi
   ment, we can see from the course of curves of magnetization
   that if the loading be greatly diminished, the above-mentioned
   field will become correspondingly large. In the present
   experiment, it occurs in H=48 for iron with longitudinal
   stress 0-38 kg. sq. mm. Thus the general feature of the present
   investigation agrees with that of Prof. Ewing.                           -
        In nickel, there was a slight increase of magnetization in
   a weak field when the rod was loaded ; whether this has any
   connexion with the Villari effect observed by Heydweiller t is
   a question which, without special examination, cannot be
   easily decided.

 by magnetization or the effects of stress on magnetization
 ganerally depend on both of these coefficients. #. a joint
paper with Mr. E. T. Jones, one of us remarked that the easiest
method of testing Kirchhoff’s theory would be to measure the
 change of volume of a ferromagnetic ring. The volume
change is theoretically equal to

 experimental difficulty, if the test be made by means of

     The change of length in nickel, as calculated from the
 stress-effect, agrees fairly with the observed values, except
 in strong fields, where the deviation becomes apparent. Of
 the two sets of k', the one derived from the effects of smaller
 stress gives results which are more conformable to experiment,
 at least in quality. The agreement between theory and
 experiment would perhaps be closer, could we measure the
 change in the intensity of magnetization by smaller loading,
 or, better still, from the effects of small longitudinal com
 pression. Adopting the numbers obtained from the stress
 effect, the change of volume by magnetization ought to be
 very small. The discrepancy between theory and experiment
  lies in the sign ; theory gives increase of volume instead of
  diminution as in the actual case. But considering the
 minuteness of the change and the experimental errors which
  enter in the determination of k', we cannot say that the
  discrepancy is very great.

   It must not be forgotten that these coefficients are, strictly
speaking, functions of the strain caused by mechanical
action on nickel. Taking Prof. Ewing's" experiments on
the magnetization of nickel under various loadings, we find
the following values of k' on the supposition that

   The above values will probably not be far from those
obtained by actual determination. The coefficients k' and k"
are thus functions of the strains of the magnetized body. In
nickel, k" diminishes as the longitudinal pull is increased.
In calculating the coefficients k' and k" from the stress-effect,
we have taken care to use such values of 81 as are due to
very small loading, in order that the result may be com
parable to those obtained from the strains produced by
magnetization. . The diminution of k" with increased loading
is greater in the weak than in strong fields.                   Applying
equation (d) for measuring the length-change produced by
magnetization, we notice that 8l/l diminishes with the coefficient
k", so that we expect, from the above result, diminution in
the contraction of nickel wire with increased longitudinal
pull; but as the rate of diminution of k" becomes less as
the field-strength is increased, the lessening of contraction
will not be so marked in strong fields as in weak. This
theoretical conclusion is borne out by the experiments of
Bidwell on the effects of longitudinal stress on the length
change of nickel wire. . The change of volume, due to mag
netization will somewhat diminish for nickel wire under
longitudinal pull, but the difference will not be so pronounced
as for the length-change. The experimental verification of
these conclusions will be attended with considerable difficulty.

    The above table shows that k' and k" are of the same order
 of magnitude as for nickel ; they are,<U+017F> however, of opposite
sign. The approximate relation ****0 does not hold for

 iron, the quantity k'4', amounting to several thousands in
 low fields. It therefore appears that the effect of hydrostatic
 pressure must result in considerable increase of magnetization,
 which is irreconcilable with the experiments already described.
 The change in magnetization due to longitudinal pull
 (0.38 kg. sq. mm.) is calculated in the seventh column; in
 low fields there is increase of magnetization, which ultimately
 reaches a maximum in H=12 nearly ; the magnetization
 then begins to diminish very slowly until it becomes less than
 in the unstrained state in H=90.                      This theoretical conclusion
 agrees with experiment, although the actual numbers are
 somewhat different, as will be seen in the last column.
    If, on the other hand, we make use of the experimental
 result that the effect of hydrostatic pressure is negligible
 compared with that of longitudinal pull, we obtain the following
 values of k'- — k" by easy calculation from experiments on
 stretching.                              TABLE IV.

   The numbers found above are widely different from those
calculated from the strains due to magnetization, but the
general character of the coefficient k is similar. Using the
values of k in Table IV. we find that the change of length
(3rd column) agrees fairly with the experimental determina
tion (4th column). The field of maximum elongation given
by calculation coincides pretty well with the actual result.
According to calculation, there is always increase of volume
with increasing field, but the calculated result is about 15
times greater than the experimental numbers. The theoretical
conclusion as regards the change of volume by magnetization
agrees only in quality.
   The values of the coefficients k' and k" for iron and nickel
agree in sign with Cantone's determinations from the strains
produced by magnetization, but are far behind them in actual
numbers.      Drude * found from the effect of twist on a circu
larly magnetized iron that u" = 4trk"= — 400000 in weak
fields. In the present case k"=–30000 in H= 10, if it be
calculated from the stress-effect ; thus p"= –380000, which
is very near to Drude's observation.
                             Summary.
   The principal results obtained in the present research are
given in the following summary.
   1. Magnetization produces minute increase of volume in
         iron.
   2. Diminution of volume by hydrostatic pressure produces
         minute decrease of magnetization in iron.
   3. Magnetization produces minute diminution of volume in
         nickel.
   4. Diminution of volume by hydrostatic pressure produces
         minute increase of magnetization in nickel.
   5. Positive transverse stress produces increase of magneti
         zation in an iron tube, which reaches a maximum in
         a certain critical field.
   Kirchhoff’s theory of magnetostriction leads to the following
conclusions:
      I. Effects of stress deduced from the strains due to
                           magnetization.
      (a) (Theory).-Hydrostatic pressure produces increase
             of magnetization in iron.
           (Experiment).-Hydrostatic pressure produces de
             crease of magnetization in iron.

      (b) (Theory and Experiment).-Hydrostatic pressure
            produces small increase of magnetization in nickel.
      (c) (Theory and Experiment).-By the application of
            small longitudinal pull, there is increase of mag
            netization in iron till it reaches a maximum in
            moderate fields, thence to diminish till the magneti
             zation becomes smaller than in the unstretched
             condition.
      (d) (Theory and Experiment).-By the application of
             longitudinal pull, there is decrease of magnetiza
            tion in nickel till it reaches a minimum in moderate
             fields, thence to increase gradually but not in such
             a degree as to reach a value greater than in the
             unstretched condition.
II. Strains caused by magnetization deduced from the effects
                              of stress.
      (a) (Theory and Experiment).-Magnetization produces
             increase of volume in iron (the value assigned by
             theory being about 15 times greater than the
             observed numbers).
      (b) (Theory).-Magnetization produces small increase of
             volume in nickel (to a degree which is within the
             errors of experiment).
           (Experiment).-Magnetization produces decrease of
             . in nickel.
      (c) (Theory and Experiment).-Magnetization produces
             increase of length in iron till it reaches a maximum
             in about H=30, thence to diminish gradually with
             increasing field.
       (d) (Theory and Experiment).-Magnetization produces
             continuous diminution of length in nickel.
    Experiments show that the coefficients k, k', k" are all
 functions of the strain, but Kirchhoff’s theory makes the
 change of magnetization proportional to the strain. Strictly
 speaking, the present theory is a rough approximation and
 will perhaps only hold when the strain is infinitely small.
 We cannot, therefore, expect that such a theory can explain
 the relations between the strains caused by magnetization and
 the effects of stress on magnetization in all their qualita
 tive and quantitative details. In the present investigation,
 we have taken care to measure such effects as will be most
 conformable to theory. We have thus found out that, ex
 cepting the theoretical deduction as to the effect of hydrostatic
 pressure on the magnetization of iron, there are no serious

  discrepancies between theory and experiment. In default of
  a more perfect theory, it will be of no small interest to see
  how far the aforesaid theory can explain the correlation of
  strain and stress in magnetism ; we intend to continue similar
  investigations on the Wiedemann effect, and see how the
  mutual relations between the strains due to magnetization
  and the effects of stress on magnetization can be traced.

     XXVII. On the Photography of JRipples.—Third Paper.
  -             By J. H. VINCENT, D.Sc., A.R.C.Sc.”
                             [Plates III.-W.]
- THE present paper deals with some further experiments on
  .       wave-motion, which have, as before, been photographi
  cally recorded. In the first two paperst the apparatus used
  was described.      The work has been continued with the second
  form of apparatus, but it has been necessary to re-arrange the
  whole, as the induction-machine and tuning-forks suffered so
  much from the damp that the former finally refused to work
  and the latter required constant attention to prevent rusting.
  It was therefore decided to set up the apparatus in another
     ortion of the laboratory ; while this was being done the
  induction-machine was repaired. The room in which the
  experiments were continued is at the top of the building, but
  the unsteadiness was overcome by suspending the trough by
  a rubber cord.
       The floor of this room being unsteady, it was necessary to
   stop the motor and induction-machine some seconds before the
   spark was allowed to pass ; otherwise the motion of the floor
   would cause objects attached to the forks to give rise to dis
    turbances on the mercury surface.                                -
       Some alterations were made in the apparatus. The first
    spark-gap was reduced very considerably in width and was
   about 2 millim. across. With this alteration it was found that
    much larger apertures of the lens-stop could be used without
  ‘any ill-effects on the photographs. This spark-gap was
    short-circuited by a coil, about 8 centim. in diameter, of a
    dozen turns of rubber-covered wire.           The other electrical
    arrangements were similar to those described in the first
   paper. Four gallon Leyden jars were used, and the whole
    electrical circuit was insulated. The first spark-gap was
      * Communicated by Professor J. J. Thomson.

about 8 centim. across; it was found that when no elaborate
precautions were taken to prevent loss by brushing, the
.      would just not be able to leap this gap. The machine was
allowed to run until the electrical circuit began to give off
brush-discharges; the current driving the motor was then
cut off and the cap removed from the lens; when all was
i.       to be at rest the second spark-gap was closed. The
 ens cap was an ebonite arm pivoted to the camera front; it
could be manipulated in the dark.
                  On the Use of the Lens-Stop.
   The aperture of the stop was chosen to give the best
results in each case. If the surface of the mercury was
disturbed only slightly by the waves to be photographed, a
small stop was used; while if the waves had a larger amplitude,
the aperture of the stop could with safety be increased. In
some cases the stop was as great as F. 16. The effect of
allowing more of the cone of light transmitted to the lens to
pass through the diaphragm is to smooth down the surface ;
while using a º stop tends to magnify the apparent
amplitude of the disturbance.                                -
                  Photographic Considerations.
   Considered photographically the second form of apparatus
suffers from a defect from which the first is free. The spark
is on the same side of the large lens as the camera is, and
thus light may be reflected from the lens and affect the
sensitive plate. The white marks seen on some of the prints
are due to this cause.
   It is obvious that the effective lens of the camera must be
regarded as made up of the camera lens in combination with
the large condenser. The use of the camera lens is to make
the picture a convenient size on the sensitive plate. Quarter
plates have been used throughout. The front combination of
the camera lens might be removed ; the stop and spark-gap
would then have to be at the same distance from the con
denser. The latter is, of course, alone capable of producing
the photographs. Thus, for full-size pictures, if F is the focal
length of the condenser, the distances of the plate, spark and
stop, and lens from the mercury surface will be respectively
4F, 3F, and 2F.
   The plates used were Ilford Special Rapid, and were
developed in darkness with hydroquinone. This developer
has many advantages for such work. It does not stain the
negatives, the plates may be left in it a long time without
fogging, and, what is more, it tends to increase the contrasts.

292                    Dr. J. H. Vincent on
This last result is also brought about by under-exposure;
it would be no advantage to increase the brightness of the
spark until the exposure was normal.
   Where intensification was employed the mercuric chloride
and ammonia method was used.

   They are all approximately , nat. size.
   Fig. 1. Frequency 190. (Frequencies are given only
approximately.)
   This illustrates Doppler’s Principle. The stand of the fork
was placed on a sheet of plate-glass, and was moved by hand
across the field of view of the camera. Before the style had
reached the portion of the mercury-surface to be illuminated,
word was given to a second observer to connect the terminals
of the second spark-gap. By the time this could be done the
style had entered the field of view and the ripples were
thus photographed. The experimental difficulties of pro
ducing such a photograph are similar to the mathematical
difficulties met with in investigating the waves given out by
a source of finite dimensions moving relatively to the medium”.
The moving style, even if not vibrating, would give rise to a
series of ripples like those caused by the forward motion
of a ship. Thus it was necessary to move the fork slowly
enough not to create such disturbances (shown in fig. 2), but
yet with sufficient velocity to illustrate Doppler's principle.
   The source is moving in a direction making an angle of
about 45° with the edges of the plate. The ripples have a
much smaller wave-length in the region which the source is
approaching than in that from which it recedes. It should
be remarked that in the case of ripples the phenomena are
more complicated than in sound or light, where it is usual to
consider the effects produced when the velocity of propagation
is independent of the wave-length. In the case of ripples the
velocity is a function of the wave-length; the motion of the
source relatively to the medium alters the actual velocity in
the medium. If it were desired to obtain the exact analogue
of the case of sound, or of light in free aether, it would be
necessary to use a frequency such that the velocity of the
waves was a minimum. The velocity of propagation would
then be unaltered by a small change in the wave-length.
   Fig. 2. This is a photograph of the waves caused by the
motion of a style which was moved so as to have, as far as
possible, only one motion relatively to the mercury surface.

                  the Photography of Ripples.                 293
   In figs. 1 and 3, Paper 1, the series of hyperbolas due to
the interference of waves from two point-sources are shown ;
while in fig. 4, Paper 1, the hyperbolas are replaced by
another series of curves, the latter being due to the inter
ference of waves of different length emanating from two
point-sources. When the distance between the sources is a
large number of wave-lengths, and the frequency of the two
sets of waves is the same, we get a series of ellipses shown in
fig. 2, Paper 1.
   In the present photograph the change which these ellipses
undergo when the sources emit waves of different length is
shown. The ellipses are now represented by a family of club
shaped curves, with the blunt end pointing to the source of
higher frequency.
   The extreme case is seen in fig. 5, Paper 1.
   Figs. 4, 5, 6. Frequency 190.
   These photographs are intended to illustrate the fact that
in order to get wide interference-bands in optics it is necessary
to have the sources near together. The sources vibrate
in opposite phase; one style being attached to the upper and
the other to the lower prong of the fork. It is a matter of
great importance to make the styles so rigid as to have a
natural frequency many times as great as that of the fork.
The style from the upper prong gave most trouble; it will
be noticed that it is a light braced structure of fine glass
rods.
   The line bisecting at right angles the distance between the
sources is always a line of minimum disturbance and is
represented on the photographs by a bright band. The
number of such lines passing between the sources is necessarily
odd. As the distance of the styles from each other decreases
the number of lines decreases, until finally, in fig. 6, we have
only the central band left.
   Fig. 6 at once recalls the experiment in acoustics in
which two organ-pipes of the same pitch are mounted
on one wind-chest. The distance between the styles
would have to be decreased to illustrate this experiment
with ripples. It would also be advisable to use longer
WaWes.
   It is not to be expected that a bright straight band drawn
through the sources would make its appearance with any
great distinctness even when the distance between the latter
was an even number of wave-lengths. This is owing to two
causes. Each source protects half of such a band from the
ripples due to the other; and the amplitude of the vibration

falls off very rapidly as the distance from a source increases
owing to viscosity.
    Fig. 7. Frequency 190.
    This is the exact analogue of Young’s interference experi
ment. In the dark region a point-source is just visible.
The style is seen as a black line. The darkness is due to
ripples of considerable amplitude being employed. The
 ripples proceeding from this source meet a bridge made of
microscope cover-glass; the bridge has two arches and one
pillar. h. width of the pillar is 4.5 millim., and of the
 arches on each side '75 millim. The whole was floating,
 and the source was on a line bisecting the bridge at right
angles. This line is the median line of the central band of
maximum motion.
    The bridge moves as a whole, its vibration being forced by
 the ripples from the source ; this effect was made small by
having the approaches to the bridge very long. The region
 on the same side of the bridge as the source is marked by
 Lloyd's bands referred to in former papers.
    Fig. 8. Frequency 190.
    The two point-sources are moving in the same phase. The
 surface near the fork is marked by the usual interference
bands, while the bands on the other side of the sources are
 displaced by the influence of a drop of water floating on the
mercury. The exact meaning of the white marks in the
 middle of the drop is uncertain.                               -
    Being unwilling to disfigure the original negative a con
 tact positive on glass was made. On this the diagram was
 drawn and a new negative made by contact. From this
negative, fig. 8 is printed. This method eliminates error
which would arise from measuring a print.
    The line AB is drawn through the point-sources and is
 bisected at right angles by the line upon which the point P is
 marked. On the side remote from the drop this line is in the
 middle of the central band of maximum motion. The band upon
 which P is situated is moved nearly half a fringe to the left.
    This illustrates the crucial test of Newton's emission theory
devised by Arago.
    Fig. 9. Frequency 170.
    When the slit which emits the light to be diffracted by a
 Rowland grating is placed at the centre of curvature of the
 latter, the light reaches the grating in the same phase. The
  spaces between the rulings may then be regarded as a series
 of line-sources if we look at the matter from a two-dimensional
 standpoint.

                   the Photography of Ripples.                    295
    A similar effect is shown in this photograph. A strip of
 aluminium * 2:85 centim. long was cut in a castellated manner
 so as to have ten bars; the lengths of the bars and slits were
 each 1.5 millim. The strip was then bent into a portion of
 a cylinder of 8 centim. radius.
   The foci are not definite, but the number to be expected
agrees with the photograph. The wave-length on the negative
is 145 centim.    The width of a bar and slit is 3 x 755 = 2265
centim. The number of diffracted images is thus found by
making sin 6, equal to unity in
                       2-265 sin 6, = 145 n,
which shows that we shall only get one diffracted image and
thus three foci in all. From the above we find approximately
that
                             6, =40°.
As near as one can judge this agrees with the angle measured
on the negative, taking the centre of the comb as the apex of
the angle.
   Fig. 10. Frequency 190.
   This shows the interference pattern produced by three
point-sources vibrating in the same phase.
   Fig. 11. The ripples are caused by throwing a leaden shot
about 6 millim. diameter into the mercury. This was done
by hand. The photograph does not indicate what became of
the shot. It probably bounced and was out of the field of
view at the instant of illumination. The bright circular
patch indicates that the disturbance had subsided in this
region.
   Fig. 12. This is a photograph of a ricochet. The dis
turbances were caused by a shot 1.5 millim. in diameter.           It
first struck the surface inside the larger dark space, then it
dropped inside the oval dark space. . It probably did not rest
here but again left the liquid, and the illumination occurred
about this time.    If the shot had remained in the second dark
space it would have caused a deep depression in the surface,
which would have been dark in the print,
   The ripples caused by a splash would form an interesting
research, especially as we already know much about the splash
itself from Prof. Worthington's work.

experiments which have been tried with success, and also to
record some of the many failures.
   Using a fork of frequency 220 the mercury was disturbed
by two whole-period point combs moving in opposite phase.
They produced a focus, which, from a calculation like that for
fig. 9, Paper 2, was found to be in a position in accord with
theory. hi. optical analogue of this experiment is found in
the phase-reversal zone-plates of Mr. R. W. Wood". The
experiment was suggested by a note in Preston’s “Light,’
p. 218, 1895 edition.
   By using a comb like that in fig. 9, it might be possible to
produce the analogue of spectrum analysis. Experiments in
this direction have been unsuccessful. Using the grating for
reflexion, only faint traces of the effect have been obtained.
In another experiment a point was actuated by two simul
 taneous simple harmonic motions in a vertical direction. The
 frequencies were chosen so as to give four beat-lines on the
 negative ; these are distinctly visible, the ripples being well
 defined between the beat-lines.

  Sºlº after             the publication of my previous paper :
        on this subject Mr. Oliver Heaviside pointed out to me
  that it would be interesting to compare the observed attenua
  tion in the transit of the waves with that to be expected on
  the long-wave theory. He was also good enough to draw
  my attention to Lord Rayleigh's high-frequency formula for
  the effective resistance of wires to alternating currents as
  approximately applicable to the case.         He feared, however,

            Waves along a Line of Negligible Leakage.       297
that the experimental value of the attenuation would be
found considerably higher than the theoretical one due to
resistance of the wires simply.
   It immediately occurred to me that the extra attenuation
observed over that theoretically expected might be due to the
leakage conductance of the wood separators which were used
at intervals along the line to keep the two parallel wires pro
perly spaced. But at the time in question the line was
already dismantled.    It was therefore impossible to say pre
cisely what the resistances of the separators were, nor how
many of them were in use, when the attenuation was deter
mined.
   Assuming that the separators occurred on the average at a
metre apart along the line, a resistance for each of the order
half a megohm would suffice to reconcile the experiments
with the theory referred to. On testing a few of the sepa
rators their resistance dry was found to be of the order ten
megohms, but the resistance of one about a minute after
momentary immersion in water had fallen to 0-2 of a megohm.
It therefore seemed desirable to rig up a new line with sepa
rators of such high resistance as to render the leakage con
ductance of the line quite negligible. This was accordingly
done and the attenuation again measured. The result, how
ever, only confirmed the value previously obtained. . This
value is indeed higher than that predicted by the theory
approximately applicable to the case. Still, upon careful
examination of the differences between the experimental case
and that contemplated in the theory, I think it will be con
ceded (1) that this difference of values is in the right direc
tion, and (2) that it is not large enough to shake confidence
in the substantial accuracy of the experiments. This is dis
cussed in detail at the end of the paper.

   Experimental Arrangement.—The arrangement of the i.
paratus adopted in the determination is diagrammatically
represented in fig. 1. In this figure, A denotes the battery
of two storage-cells, B and C are the primary and secondary

coils respectively of the induction-coil, of which C has a
resistance of 3000 ohms and an inductance of about 20
henries. G is the spark-gap, which was adjusted to 2 millim.
The wire PGP", measured along the semicircle, was about
 2 metres. PP' are condenser-plates of zinc 40 centim. diam.
 placed opposite to and 30 centim. distant from the precisely
 similar plates S S'. The line is represented by SETT'E'S',
 and consists of two parallel copper wires 1.5 millim. diam.,
 and kept 8 centim. apart by wood separators at intervals of
 about one metre. These wood separators are about 12 centim:
 long, 2.5 centim. wide, and 1.2 centim. thick, and were well
saturated in melted paraffin-wax before use. Their resistance
 was thus raised to something. over 60,000 megohms each,
 which rendered the leakage of the line quite negligible.
 E E' denotes the electrometer, which has a single plane
 needle, initially uncharged, and suspended by a fine quartz
fibre between two disks attached to the line at E and E'.
The needle is therefore electrified by induction whenever
a wave passes E. E", and its ends are consequently attracted
to the disks whatever the sign of their potential-difference.
TT' signify the two bridges alternately used at or near the
end of the    i.      namely, (1) the bridge of critical resistance
which absorbs the waves completely, and (2) the bridge
which reflects them completely. The lengths of the line
before and after the electrometer will be stated in connexion

             Waves along a Line of Negligible Leakage.         299
with each experiment. The waves generated by the primary
oscillator were about 8.5 metres long, and, when on the line,
are of the form represented in fig. 2.
    The electric waves propagated along the line are thus
seen to be in the form of a damped train with the large
end leading; the tail after about ten or a dozen waves
being almost negligible. The curve of fig. 2 was obtained
experimentally by Bjerknes' method, and is identical with
that marked E in the paper on “Absorption of Electric
Waves”*.
    Method of Determination.—The method used for deter
mining the attenuation of the waves in their transit along
the line was the same as that described in the first paper
already referred to. It consists essentially of alternately
using at the end of the line a bridge which completely absorbs
the waves and a bridge which completely reflects them. In
the first case the wave-train goes but once past the electro
meter, and gives a deflexion 81, say; in the second case the
electrometer is affected by the sum to infinity of two geome
trical progressions due to the forward and return trains re
spectively. Let the consequent deflexion be 8. Then the
ratio r of 8, to 8, is a function of the attenuation factor e-",
the reflexion coefficient at the oscillator, p, and the lengths of
the line, li and l, before and after the electrometer respectively.
It is convenient, however, to solve the equations first for p”
and s, where 10-"=e-”, a<U+017F> denoting lengths in metres and
a lengths in centim. along the line.
    Observations and Results.--The present determination is
based upon observations with lengths of 116 metres and
65 metres respectively before the electrometer, and 48 metres
in each case after.     To determine the ratio 82/81 in the second
case 41 electrometer-throws were sufficient. These are given
in Table I. In the first case, as the sparks of the oscillator
were less regular, over a hundred electrometer-throws were
taken before the required accuracy was obtained. Table II.
summarizes the data and results.

    Thus we have for the theoretical value of the attenuation
 constant
                     a = R/2Dv=0.0000062, . . . . . (6)
 which is only half that determined experimentally.
    In the endeavour to account for this discrepancy two lines
of thought are open to us.
    (1) We may examine the order of accuracy of the expe
 riments and inquire in which direction the determination
probably errs; and (2) the applicability to the case in point
 of the theoretical expression given may be discussed, and the
sense of the modification which it requires for rigorous appli
cation to the present case may perhaps be inferred. These
will be taken in the above order.
    The experimental value is calculated upon the supposition
that the absorbing bridge used at the end of the line absorbs
all the electric waves incident upon it, and that the reflecting
bridge reflects all. If either supposition is incorrect the
phenomena are changed, and the value found for the attenuation
is in consequence affected.
    Now it was previously found that the absorbing bridge for
the line now in use must have a resistance of 560 ohms".            In
the present work it was accordingly endeavoured to keep the

Soc., Feb. and Mar. 1897.

resistance of the bridge at that value. It was adjusted before
each occasion of its use and tested afterwards.            The difference
was usually of the order 2 or 3 ohms; but on one occasion
it reached 10 ohms. However, to take an extreme case, let it
be supposed that the critical value 560 is not the correct one,
and that on some occasion of its use the bridge-resistance,
though differing little from 560 ohms, differed by as much as
45 ohms from the value required for complete absorption of the
electric waves incident upon it. Then the reflexion-coefficient
of the bridge is given by *
-               Ri-Lº           45       – 45            |             7
          P=#|Ii = 3Li:15 = Iij nearly . . . (7)
where R1 is the resistance of the bridge and Lv the instan
taneous impedance of the line.
   And it may easily be seen that the electrometer-throw when
the absorbing bridge only is in use is, in consequence of its
imperfect absorption, affected by a factor rather less than
               (1+p”)/(1-pºp”)=1 + šp”, nearly; . . (8)
since p” is of the order one-half, p being the reflexion-coefficient
 of the oscillator.
    Thus, for the supposed error of 45 ohms, which is an extreme
case, we have p'- 0:04 and the electrometer-throw increased
in consequence by 0:24 per cent. But this is within the
limits of the probable error of the determination of the ratios
of the throws, and is therefore almost negligible.
    Again, let us now examine the error consequent upon in
complete reflexion from the bridge used to reflect all. The
resistance of this bridge should be zero. It consists of a
copper wire put across the line, both it and the line were
cleaned and polished at the places of contact, and the bridge
made so as to spring on tightly into position. The bridge
in question, put on with much less care than usual, showed a
resistance of 0.04 ohm on testing with a P.O. box. But suppose
by any mischance that the resistance of this bridge were half
an ohm, then its reflexion-coefficient is given by

         2- ::=-(–)--(1-x), say, , ()
 where R, is the resistance of the bridge and Lo the instan
taneous impedance of the line as before. Then the electro
meter-throw when this bridge is in use is, in consequence of its
imperfect reflexion, affected by a factor rather nearer unity than
1+p". 1–p”             1 + (1–2x)           1—p”

    And this factor, for half an ohm resistance, would diminish
 the electrometer-throw by 0.5 per cent. This again is almost
 negligible, being within the limits of the errors of determi
 nation of the ratios of the electrometer-throws.
    Let us, however, in spite of the smallness of these effects
on the electrometer-throw due to imperfect absorption or
reflexion, inquire as to whether they are additive or compen
satory. We at once see that they are additive, and that any
departure from perfect absorption or perfect reflexion would
result in a lessening of the observed ratio r of the electrometer
throws.     Hence the true value of r which would be obtained
under ideal conditions may be expected to exceed the actual
one, if they differ at all.
    In order to follow this possibility to its consequence, let us
take each experimental value of r, plus its probable error, and
from these data determine the corresponding value of a.
These probable errors, it will be noticed, exceed those which
might be attributed to imperfection in the absorbing and
reflecting arrangements, so entirely cover any errors which
may be due to those sources. To still further test the conse
quences of extreme suppositions, values of the attenuation
have been calculated for a value of one ratio r1 plus its pro
bable error, and the other r, minus its probable error, and
vice versd.   The results are scheduled in Table III.
   It is thus seen that none of the suppositions considered
bring the experimental value of the attenuation down to the
theoretical value, though the slight difference made in the
most probable case (second line of Table III.) is in the right
direction, and lessens the value by nearly 6 per cent., whereas
a reduction of 50 per cent. is required for agreement.
   Turning now to the question of the validity of the expres
sion for the effective resistance in the case under discussion:
we have to notice (1) that this formula was developed for a
wire whose return" was at a distance, and (2) that it is for
“periodic currents following the harmonic law”f.
   Whereas in the actual experimental case we have
      (1) The two wires comparatively near together (diameter
         1.5 millim., distance of centres apart 8 centim.); and
      (2) The wave-train is a rapidly damped one (see fig. 2).
   To me it appears probable that each of these considerations
if introduced into the theory would lead to a modification of
the expression for the attenuation which would bring its value
nearer the experimental one. Whether or not they would
be competent to entirely bridge the discrepancy I do not
pretend to say.

     There are other possible causes of a discrepancy between
  the two values of a. For example, any irregularity in the
  spacing or diameter of the wires would lead to a slight re
  flexion at the place of its occurrence, thus making the line
  behave towards the electric waves somewhat as a turbid or
  translucent medium behaves towards light. But as great
  care was taken in the spacing of the wires, no appreciable
 effect is likely to have arisen from this cause.
      In conclusion I must thank Mr. Oliver Heaviside both for
  the suggestion which initiated this investigation and for his
  advice, ever freely given, during its continuance.
      I am also specially indebted to one of our advanced students,

  throughout the work both in the experimental and theoretical
  portions.

  XXIX. Note on Continuous Beams. By H. J. ToMLINsoN
       and KARL PEARSON, University College, London*.
                               [Plate VI.]
 (1) IN a paper communicated by Professor Osborne Reynolds
          to the Royal Society, and published in the R. S. Proc.
 vol. lxii. p. 268, 1898, Mr. George Wilson develops a novel
 method of finding the reactions at the points of support of
 continuous beams.       The author claims      that  the  method
given “affords an easy and accurate solution for continuous
 beam problems, and especially those in which the moment of
inertia is variable. It also permits of the variations in the
stresses due to alterations in the levels of the supports being
investigated.”
    Mr. Wilson applies his method to a particular example in
which he proceeds so far as the calculation of the reactions.
The numerical work appears to us somewhat laborious, and
the support-bending moments and the deflexions of the
girder are not investigated. The publication of Mr. Wilson's
paper seems to indicate that graphical methods of solving the
problem of the continuous beam are not so well known in this
country as they should be. They appear to us to contain all
the requisites for the practical solution of the problem ; they
give a great variety of tests for the accuracy of the work at
each stage, and for rapidity and ease of working they excel in
our experience all other methods. It is well to add that they
allow of full consideration of slight changes of level in the
points of support and of slight continuous changes in the
flexural rigidity of the girder.
   We have accordingly thought it worth while to illustrate
the graphical treatment by a reduced drawing of the work
needed to solve Mr. Wilson's example fully, including the
form of the elastic line of the deflected girder.     The method
adopted is one which has been in use in the Drawing Office of
 University College for the last twelve years, and is familiar to
all senior students, the full treatment of such a beam falling into
the second year's course. A good draughtsman will complete
the work indicated in the very much reduced diagram which
accompanies this paper in 6 to 8 hours.
   In one point only was it needful to diverge from Mr. Wilson's
data. The moment of inertia of the beam, as given by
Mr. Wilson, was such that the beam could not have carried
its own weight, and as we were desirous of exhibiting the
deflexions, it became necessary to select a different flexural
rigidity. The maximum flexural rigidity was accordingly

tons per square foot, and the moment of inertia 3300/144 ft."
instead of 3300 ft.**
   The main features of our method are due to Culmann; in
some points, however, we differ in our treatment from what
we believe to be the practice of Continental engineers: thus,
we get rid of the variability of the flexural rigidity ab initio,
while some of them at least appear to allow for it by dis
placements of the “verticals” and a series of discontinuous
changes in the position of the pole of the second vector
polygon f.                                                                -
    (2) If the flexural rigidity of a girder changes very
slightly, we still have the relation                           -
      flexural rigidity x      { change   in l

   Now if    8<U+017F> ..)  be the change in curvature after strain, M be
the bending-moment at any cross-section, EAk* the flexural
rigidity at that cross-section, and EAºko” that at any other
selected section, the above relation may be written —
                              EAk? x  *(·)=M.
or, again :-

                                          0n 0
   In this last form the result is identical with that for a
  irder of constant flexural rigidity and bending-moment M'
instead of the actual moment M. Accordingly in our method
we start by altering all the known bending-moments in the
ratio of Aok,”/Ak”, and the unknown bending-moments when
found will then have to be multiplied by Ak”/Aok,” to determine
their actual values.         If this reduction of bending-moments he
gone through all initio, then the girder may be treated as if
it had a constant instead of a variable flexural rigidity. Of
course the change back to the actual bending-moments must
be made before the reactions are found.
   We shall now indicate briefly the graphical stages requisite
   * This value was suggested by Mr. Wilson in a reply to a letter from
one of us pointing out the impossible value of the rigidity assumed in his
 ader.

 308        Messrs. H. J. Tomlinson and K. Pearson :
 for the solution of Mr. Wilson's problem. It is necessary
 to remind the reader that the original drawing has been
 photographed down to nearly 4 its size, and that the scales
 attached are those of the original drawing, or about $ in.
 in the diagram stands for 1 in. of the original drawing.
    (3) At the top of the drawing AJ gives the three spans
 with bending-moment curves for each span (in this case 60 ft.,
 100 ft., and 40 ft. loaded uniformly with 3 tons per foot run) on
 the hypothesis that the spans are crossed by discontinuous
 simple beams. In the particular example these curves are
 all parabolas. These parabolas then have their vertical
ordinates altered in the ratio of the constant flexural rigidity,
that at D, to the flexural rigidity at each section. The
 moment of inertia is 2100/144 ft.* at A, changes uniformly
 to 3300/144 at D, then uniformly to 3000/144 at G, and
finally to 2200/144 at J. This is represented by the line
marked “Curve of Moment of Inertia,” and the process is
the same whatever be the form of this curve. Any ordinate
like ob was then altered graphically as follows:–
    Let the ordinate meet the constant moment of inertia line
at c and the curve of inertia at d.      Rotate ob down to the
horizontal as at od', draw ce' to meet the horizontal in c',
parallel to dal'; then rotate oc' up to oa; it gives the point on
the altered bending-moment curve. The outer curves were
thus constructed.
   The next step is to construct the vertical through the
centroid of each one of these curves.        This was done by
drawing the so-called centroid-curves, the areas of º
give the first moments of the primitive curves about chosen
verticals. This is the process usually attributed to Collignon,
but as the method of “equivalent areas '' it has had probably a
much longer drawing-office existence. The areas were as usual
read off by a planimeter. After the centroid-verticals had
been inserted, the so-called “third-lines,” or lines at third and
two-third distance of each span were drawn, and also the
“inverted third-lines,” or lines obtained by drawing a vertical
between the right-hand third-line of one span and the left
hand third-line of the adjacent span, dividing the distance
between them inversely as the spans. The third step is to
draw the “cross-lines.”       From the centroid-vertical of each
span is taken off a distance equal to the constant flexural
rigidity, i. e. in our case 33,000,000 sq. ft. tons, not on the
scale on which areas of the bending-moment curves will
afterwards be plotted, but on some reduced scale, which
marks by its inverse the exaggeration of the deflexions as
given in the elastic line. Without such an exaggeration the

                    Note on Continuous Beams.                 309
 deflexions in any practical case would not be visible on the
 drawing-board. At this distance is set up on either side
 of the centroid-vertical lengths representing the area of the
 bending-moment curve for the span, supposing it to be a
 simply-supported beam.      These areas have already been
determined in order to find the centroid; they are plotted
here to a scale of 1 in. =6000 sq. foot tons, which is also the
scale of the second-vector figure. Through the ends of these
lengths the so-called ..". are drawn, being produced
back to meet the support verticals. They clearly must meet
on the centroid-vertical. The cross-lines prepare the way
for the fourth stage, the construction of the support tangents
to the elastic line and the “mid-links.” This follows by
 Culmann's theory of the “fixed points.” The terminals of the
girder being simply supported, the fixed points from which
we start are the points of support themselves F, and Es".
Then by Culmann's rules a fixed point on the other mid-link,
F, is known, because F, F, is equal to the intercept made
by the cross-lines on the same vertical. Starting from F,
we find Fi' by drawing any right-hand mid-link whatever
through F, till it meets the inverted third-line; we join the
second point of support to the point in which this arbitrary
.. meets the right-hand third-line of its own span, and
produce this line backwards till it meets the left-hand third
line of the second span; this point of intersection is then
joined to the point in which the arbitrary mid-link through
 F, meets the third-line ; FM lies on the line so drawn; but
it also lies on the line joining F, to the right-hand support
of its own span, thus F1' is found. This process takes
much less time to apply graphically than it does to de
scribe in words. The cross-lines give F, F, and so F, is
determined. F." is found from F,' precisely as F.' from F,
and F,” from F," is determined by aid of the intercept of
the cross-lines on the vertical through F1". A similar
process working from left to right gives the second series of
fixed points E," E.", E. E.", E, and E!. The construction
of these fixed points depends upon the theorems (i.) that the
vertical intercept between two mid-links is equal to that
between two cross-lines, (ii.) that the inverted third-line is the
locus of the intersection of any right-hand mid-link of one
span and the corresponding left-hand mid-link of the adjacent
span, (iii.), that the support-tangent passes through the points
in which the adjacent mid-links meet the adjacent third-lines.
The proofs of these propositions are due to Culmann, but they
Call      readily followed and the resulting methods used at
once by any     jºu.           The fifth stage can now be under

taken, namely, join any pair of corresponding fixed-points,
e.g. F1/E1’ and we have the real and not an arbitrary mid-link.
The mid-links being all known, the support-tangents can be
put in, and we have the second figure, i. e. that under the
bending-moment curves, completed. The necessity for the
mid-links meeting on the centroid-verticals, and for the
support-tangents passing through the points of support, gives
ample means of verifying the accuracy of the draughtmanship
up to this stage.
    In the sixth stage the areas of the reduced bending-moment
curves have been plotted down a vector line (the 2nd vector
polygon) as 1'2' in the scale 1 in. =6000 sq. ft. tons; parallels
through 1' and 2' to the mid-links, determine the pole O'.
This should be at a distance from 1' 2" equal to the reduced
 constant flexural rigidity used for the cross-lines, and this is
 again a test of correctness. Parallels to the support-tangents
 through O', namely, O'0' and O'3' cut off from the vector-lines
 lengths 0'1' and 2/3', which determine by the following
 process the unknown bending-moments at the points of sup
 port D and G. Mi' and Mº' being the altered bending
 moments at these points, then O'1' and 2'3' for the second
 vector polygon of the second span” are respectively equal to
 # (span x Mi') and (span x Ms), where care must be of course
 taken to read off 0'1' and 2'3' in the proper scale of sq. ft.
 tons. Invert the process by which we altered the bending
 moment and M1 and M2 are found.               Their numerical values
 are 2316 ft. tons and 2000 ft. tons respectively. Plotting
 these values and joining their tops to each other and to the
 terminals of the beam, we have the broken line marked with
 numbers in the drawing ; the vertical intercept between this
 line and the three original parabolas measures the bending
 moment at any cross-section of the girder on the scale of
 1 in. = 6000 ft. tons.
     The seventh stage is the determination of the reactions at
 each point of support due to the load on that span. This is
 done by the aid of the first vector polygon for each span.
 On the scale of 1 in. = 100 tons the total load on each span is
 plotted down a vector line as 01, parallels through 0 and 1 to
 the tangents to the parabolas at the points of support f give
 the pole O ; through O a parallel Oe to the numbered base
 line of the true bending-moment curve for the span cuts off
    * The second vector polygons for the other spans give again means
 of testing the accuracy .."the results reached.
    f These tangents are found by joining the points of support to the
 point reached when the maximum ordinate of the parabola is produced
 its own length.

                                                                   *

 RA=52 tons; RD=282 tons; RG = 254 tons; R = 12 tons.
 Mr. Wilson gives:–
 RA=52 tons; RD=281.9 tons; RG =253-5 tons; R = 12.6 tons.
    It would be difficult, perhaps, to say which are the more
 correct set of values, as Mr. Wilson has not used a purely
 arithmetical process, but what is quite clear is that for all
 practical purposes either set of results will suffice. Their
 differences are not of any practical importance. The eighth
 and last stage of the work is to break the true bending
 moment curve (i.e. the part intercepted between the parabolas
 and the numbered base-line) up into elements, to plot these
 elements down a vector line and to draw a link (funicular)
 polygon for them as if they were a system of forces, acting
 in the mid-lines of the elements. The poles of these vector
 polygons are determined by parallels to the support-tangents,
 and they are figured to the right of the drawing as “vector
 polygons for the elastic line.” They are obtained by plotting
 1 in. = 20,000 sq.ft. tons for elements of area of bending-moment
 curve, or, what is the same thing, by plotting 1/8 of the mid
 ordinates of the elements by aid of a pair of proportional
compasses. The link polygons together give the true form of
 the elastic line, and the scale of the deflexions has been so
 selected that the actual deflexions in the girder would be
 § of those in the original drawing, or about ; of those in the
photographic reproduction. The scale of the exaggeration
of the elastic line depends upon the value selected to represent
the standard flexural rigidity, and it can often be chosen so
that the deflexions on the drawing-board are precisely equal
to those of the actual girder at the corresponding points.
    (4) Our work is now fully described; it determines the
unknown reactions at the points of support, the shear curve
for the girder, the true bending-moment curve for the girder
(from which the curves of tensile and compressive stress can
be found so soon as we know the dimensions of the cross
section) with the support-moments and the curve of deflexions.
We have given no proofs of the constructions used, but have
endeavoured to show how graphical processes already in wide
use on the Continent, and also to some extent in this country,
provide a short and comprehensive solution of such important
  ractical problems as that dealt with only partially by Mr.
    ilson, and at the expense of what we consider a very large
amount of arithmetical labour.

XXX. A Quantitative Study of the High-Frequency Induction
                       Coil. By W. P. Boy NTon *.
       HE behaviour of circuits containing self- and mutual
            induction, and some of the properties of the disruptive
 discharge of a leyden-jar, were experimentally investigated
 by Faraday f and Joseph Henry t. The latter, besides
 studying º action of two mutually inducing coils, one
 of which was traversed by the current from a galvanic
 battery, also discharged a leyden-jar through one coil
 and noted the currents induced in the neighbouring coil Š.
 Henry also noted phenomena in the discharge of the Leyden
jar from which he concluded that this must be oscillatory in
 character ||.
      Perhaps the first direct experimental verification of the
 oscillatory character of this discharge was made by Feddersen
 in the years 1857–62 **, by observing the spark in a revolving
mirror.
     The mathematical theory of the oscillatory discharge was
 given by Lord Kelvin ft and Kirchhoffff. The general theory
 of electrical oscillations has been discussed at more or less
 length, particularly by J. J. Thomson $$.
     Hittorf ||, J. J. Thomson "", and others have used the
 discharge of a leyden-jar through a coil of wire about a
 vacuum tube as a means of studying the behaviour of
 the rarefied gas. Within the present decade many, have
 repeated Henry's experiment of discharging a condenser
 through one coil of wire and studying the effect produced
in a secondary circuit. Many” have paid particular attention

to the phenomena of the varying electrostatic field ; while
some have attempted to follow the behaviour of the current in
one of the circuits. Colley" has accomplished this by making
the period very slow and using an “oscillometer’—either a
fluctuating flame or the mirror of an exceedingly sensitive
galvanometer.
                              Theoretical.
    The mathematical theory of the so-called Tesla coil has
been discussed by Oberbeck and others f. The discussion
which follows is a modification and extension of Oberbeck’s.
It is essentially a discussion of a system with two degrees of
freedom.
    Let the suffixes 1 and 2 refer to the primary and secondary
circuits respectively. Let V represent the difference of
potential at the terminals of the condenser, I the current,
Q the charge on the condenser, L self-induction, M mutual
induction, K capacity, R resistance. We have then to
distinguish two cases:—(1) The secondary circuit is open ;
that is, is closed by a capacity. (2) The secondary circuit is
closed  º a resistance, or short-circuited.
    (1) The differential equations of the system are:—
                           dI        d'I
                  V1+LI     |+M**RI,             -  0,

                      Description of Apparatus.
    In the experiments to be described, the immediate source of
 current was a large induction-coil, capable of giving at the
secondary terminals on open circuit an effective difference of
potential of twenty-one thousand (21,000) volts when operated
from the commercial alternating circuit of fifty volts. This
was excited in various ways—by current from a storage
battery, by the commercial circuit spoken of above, and by
current from a small alternator kindly loaned by Prof. Pupin,
of Columbia University.
   The condensers in the primary circuit of the oscillating
system were sheets of micanite, 10 x 12 x ao inches, coated on
both sides with tinfoil to within about an inch and a half of
the edge. They were arranged symmetrically in two groups
of two, and their capacity measured in electromagnetic units
by the method suggested by Maxwell" and employed by
J. J. Thomson f and Glazebrook #.
   The condenser employed in the secondary circuit consisted
of two circular brass disks, slightly convex, of about ten
centimetres diameter, immersed in kerosene oil (petroleum).
Its capacity was computed approximately, but no attempt was
made to measure it.
   The primary coil contained 34°5 turns of heavy wire, was
22 cms. long, and 8.3 cms, in mean diameter. The secondary

 were measured by the simple bridge method suggested by
 Maxwell ", using alternating current and telephone; and as
 a standard a coil of rectangular cross section, whose self
 induction was computed by the method of Stefan f.

    The primary spark passed between two balls of zinc,
2 centim. in diameter, and was blown out by an air-blast
from a Sturtevant blower driven by a small electric motor.
The phenomena so obtained were more regular than when
 the spark passed in oil.
    The electrical dimensions of different parts of the system,
in C.G.s. absolute electromagnetic units, are as follows:–
       1,105,000 = Self-induction of standard coil.
Li = 54,000 = Self-induction of primary coil.
La = 454,000 = Self-induction of secondary coil.

   The resistances of the two coils to steady currents are
small, of the order of .05 and 3 ohm respectively. R1 and
T, will, however, contain not only these, increased perhaps
considerably on account of the peripheral distribution of the
current, but also the resistances of whatever measuring
instruments are inserted, and of the spark-gaps, where such
exist.
                                 Period.
    If in equation (19) we insert these values, we find
                  Al = -03 WoR1 ; Cl        -  -97 WoR1.
That is, the oscillation whose period is determined by the
value of 8 decidedly predominates in the primary circuit.
This is due simply to M. choice of dimensions of the system.
The corresponding frequency hardly differs from the natural
frequency of the primary system.
   The experimental determinations of the period of oscillation
were made by photographing a spark by means of a rotating
mirror.      The mirror itself was concave, silvered on the face,
of about 36-centim. focal length, and mounted on the end of
the shaft of an electric motor. The photographic plates were
set at a distance of 81°5 centim. from the centre of the face of
the mirror, and the speed of the motor was determined by com
parison with a standard tuning-fork by a stroboscopic method.
   The photographs of the most value were taken of the spark
in the primary circuit. Some were taken also of that in the
secondary circuit; but these seem by the theory to represent
an oscillation superposed upon a current dying away loga
rithmically, and the photographs are correspondingly hazy.
In each photograph |. appear several distinct sparks, each
showing fine striations, which indicate the oscillations (see
fig. 2)*.
    In Table I. are given (a) the number of revolutions per
second of the mirror, (b) the number of oscillations distinctly
visible in a given photograph, (c) the mean length of an
oscillation, (d) the double frequency of oscillation computed
 from a and c.                                      -
    The dimensions of our apparatus would give, substituting
in equation (9),
                             8 = 3,400,000;
and the frequency would be
                            8
                           27r T 542,000.
   * In each photograph there appear several distinct sparks, each showing
fine striations, which indicate the oscillations.  These are unfortunately
hardly visible in the reproductions.

    The mean observed double frequency, from the table,
 is 1,017,000, which would give the observed frequency
 510,000 nearly. This is as good a degree of agreement
 as could be expected, considering the degree of accuracy
 of our knowledge of the constants of the system.

quadrants was retained, and the needle was supported on a
horizontal axis with jewelled bearings (fig. 3). These bearings

were carried on glass pillars, but on account of the high
frequency the metallic parts had to be electrically connected
to the needle. Neglect of this precaution resulted in the
destruction of one of the jewels. The needle had suitable
adjustments for level and sensitiveness and carried a plane
mirror, enabling its deflexions to be read with mirror and
scale.   The whole was immersed in kerosene oil, to prevent
sparking. The oil served also as a damper to mechanical
motions, and to increase the sensitiveness.       The instrument

 ammeter or dynamometer due to Hertz". The current
 traversed a fine german-silver wire which held a small steel

 heat due to the current expanded the wire and allowed the
 steel wire to rotate under the influence of the spring. The
 deflexions were read with mirror and scale.                These instru
 ments were repeatedly calibrated, using a storage battery and
 known resistances, or current from a step-down transformer
 through a known non-inductive resistance, or by comparison
 with various Weston ammeters. The results were gratifyingly
 uniform. The sizes of wire used were numbers 30, 36,40, with
 carrying capacity varying from 2 to 5 amperes. The instru
 ments were very deadbeat, and particularly in the case of the
 smaller wires came to the final readings very promptly and
 returned to zero almost as promptly.

 connected in parallel with the secondary capacity K2, and the
 two dynamometers were inserted in convenient positions in

         In taking a series of observations the primary spark-gap is
      at first disconnected, and the current through the primary
     circuit of the Ruhmkorff coil is adjusted by inserting resist
     ance or varying the excitation of the dynamo. Then the
     terminal difference of potential of the primary condenser is
     determined by the absolute electrometer and recorded.
        The next step is to connect in the primary spark-gap,
     adjusting its length if necessary. Then starting the blower,
     and allowing the spark to pass, readings are made of the
     deflexions of the sensitive electrometer in the secondary
     circuit and of both dynamometers. These readings are re
    peated several times, allowing the instruments to return to
    zero after each reading ; and then the primary spark-gap
    is again removed and the potential given by the Ruhmkorff
    again noted, for a check. The great variations of potential
    and frequency of the commercial circuit necessitated the use
    of an independent generator of current. Table III. contains
    part of the data thus taken.        In column a is recorded the
    primary spark-length in centimetres; under Wo the potential
    corresponding thereto ; under b the maximum potential
    impressed upon the primary condenser when the spark-gap is
    removed, computed on the assumption of a true sine-current.
    The columns II, I, V, give the observed effective currents in
    both circuits, and potential in the secondary circuit, respec
    tively.                         Fig. 6.

    The maximum impressed difference of potential, b, has been
used as the most available parameter for the intercomparison
of data, and is taken as abscissa in the accompanying plot

   332               Mr. W. P. Boynton on the
   (fig. 6), which gives the observed effective primary current
   for a primary spark-length of 4 mm. All the curves for
   I, I, and W. are of similar character, and show a decided
   rise with what may be called increasing excitation. The
   same was true, but in less degree, of the maximum spark
  length in the secondary circuit, the data for which in Table I.,
  however, are not classified with reference to this point. The
  question immediately arises as to the reason for this behaviour.
  The most obvious suggestion is that, on account of the excess
  of current supplied to the condenser, the maximum potential
  effective at the primary spark-gap is greater than that indi
  cated by its length. This suggestion is decidedly negatived,
  however, by the fact that the spark-length in the secondary
  circuit consistently falls short of the value possible on theo
  retical grounds. i. would appear rather that the cause of the
  variation in our phenomena is the variable resistance of the
  primary spark, and that the helpful influence of increasin
  excitation is simply due to the increase of current      ..";
  through the spark-gap at instants of formation of the spark,
  which serves to decrease its resistance.

    These values are for the absolute system of units. To
change them into ohms, volts, and amperes, we must write
for the coefficients of 10 –3, -9, and –9 respectively.
The values of R1+387 R., computed according to these
equations (assuming in the first that i. is small), are given
in Table III., in the columns headed by R. R. is a purely
metallie resistance, while R, contains the spark-gap; so that
the resistance of this spark is in all probability the greater
part of the resistance R1+387 R.                                -

   The numerical values obtained from these different sources
are by no means identical, but the results deduced from the
values of V, and II will be seen, on inspection, to agree fairly
well; and all the results are concordant to this extent, that
the values of the spark-resistance, as thus given, are all of
the same order; and that this resistance is a variable, but not
linear function of the current in the spark. Fig. 7 gives Ri
for the same spark-gap as fig. 6, 4 millim., using the same
abscissa.
   Whether this resistance falls off indefinitely or approaches
some finite limit cannot be told from the limited amount of

   It will be seen by reference to the table that the values of
the resistances here found are of the same order as those
found in the case of open secondary circuit.
   It has been mentioned that the resistances R1 and R, consist
both of spark-gap and of metallic resistance.
   Gray and Mathews 4 show that the virtual resistance of a
straight metallic wire to very rapidly oscillating currents is
                               R-Vº.           2

where k is the conductivity. For n = 500,000 and k = 0006,

which for wire of 1 millim. diameter would be
                          R/= 1,800 R.
    This deduction assumes, however, that the wire is at an
infinite distance from other currents, while in our case the
distance between wires is comparable to their diameters. The
results of our experimental work would also entirely contradict
any assumption of such excessive increase in metallic resistance.
    A brief comment upon the degree of accuracy attained and
 attainable in such work may be of interest. The behaviour
 of the dynamometers left nothing to be desired. They acted
 with much greater uniformity than the phenomena to be
 observed, so that any irregularity observed in their readings
 must be attributed to actual variations in the currents.      As
 much can hardly be said of the electrometer. To give con
 venient readable deflexions with the mean potentials observed,
 it required to be adjusted with such sensitiveness that the
 directive force was not large enough to prevent frictional
 disturbance of the position of equilibrium. Further, the
 inertia of the moving system was such as to prevent prompt
  reading of deflexions, and in case of intermittent action the
  readings obtained were a time-average, which was necessarily
  small. The observations were of great value, however,
  because they were of a wholly different type of phenomenon,
 and furnished so good a ... upon both the theoretical
 reasonings and the accuracy of the other work. In general
 the accuracy of the results obtained seems to have been con
 ditioned almost entirely upon the uniformity of the phenomena
 of a blown-out spark in air.                                  ...    --
      In the foregoing work an attempt has been made to verify
 experimentally the agreement of the actual behaviour of an
 oscillating system with two degrees of freedom with the ap
 proximate theory. As specific conclusions resulting from this
 comparison we see that :—                                -
      1. The main period of oscillation of the primary circuit is
 very nearly that deduced from the dimensions of the system.
 The same may be said also of the maximum potential attained
 in the secondary circuit.                             -           -
     2. The effective currents and potentials, which are functions
 of the damping factors, and these in turn factors of the resist
 ances, would indicate that the resistances of the sparks are of
 the order of from 10 to 100 ohms, depending upon the amount

 338                    Mr. R. S. Hutton on the
 of current flowing through the spark. This conclusion is in
 gratifying agreement with the work of Trowbridge and
 Richards", who have similarly used the damping effect upon
 an oscillatory current to measure the resistance, but have done
 this by direct substitution.
     3. It appears from Table IV. that when the secondary circuit
 is closed by a spark, the primary current decreases with the
 length of this spark; but the secondary current decidedly
 increases. This behaviour is not explained by the approxi
 mate theory here deduced, but was most unmistakable both
 in early preliminary work and in the later more careful deter
 minations here recorded.         It still remains to be shown whether
this is due to the conditions of the experiment, or is to be
explained by a more accurate application of theoretical
reasoning.
     In conclusion, it only remains for me to express my thanks
to Professor A. G. Webster for his unfailing sympathy and
helpfulness, which has rendered this work possible, and to
Clark University which placed at my disposal the facilities for
the work.
          XXXI. Compound Line-Spectrum of Hydrogen.
                       By R. S. HUTTON, B.Sc.f
                              1. Introduction.
THE         general conclusion arrived at by spectroscopists with
         regard to the compound line-spectrum of hydrogen is
that it really belongs to the element, and not to a hydro
carbon as was at one time supposed. Nevertheless the question
cannot be said to be absolutely proved, especially in view of
Cornu's experiments, which seemed to indicate that if the
vacuum-tubes have been previously washed out with oxygen,
the compound line-spectrum disappears, or at any rate becomes
much weakened.           It seemed to me to be of utility to repeat
Cornu’s f experiments in a different form, and also to prepare
the hydrogen by methods different from those in common use.
     2. Fractionation of the Hydrogen occluded by Palladium.
    It first occurred to me that good results might be expected
by carefully fractionating off the hydrogen absorbed by
palladium $; and although my attention was shortly after

   +  Communicated by Arthur Schuster,
   1  A. Cornu, Journ. de Phys. ii. 5, pp. 100–103 & 341-354 (1886).
   §  I was able to make use of this method by the great liberality of
Messrs. Matthey in lending me 50 grams of palladium-foil, gratitude for
which I wish to express here.

             Compound Line-Spectrum of Hydrogen.             339
called to Randall’s paper (Am. Chem. Journ. vol. xix. p. 682,
1897), my method seemed to have advantages not possessed
by his, and I was consequently encouraged to proceed.
   The hydrogen was prepared by Bunsen’s method—the
electrolysis of dilute sulphuric acid combining the oxygen
with zinc amalgam ; very carefully purified chemicals and
apparatus were employed. In order to ascertain the amount
of hydrogen with which the palladium was charged, obser
vations were made of the quantity of electricity used for
electrolysis.
   The palladium was used in the form of foil, and, as sug
gested by Graham, was first heated to a high temperature,
oxygen being passed over it to ensure that any carbonaceous
matter should be oxidized : this of course caused some surface
oxidation; but on passing a current of hydrogen over the
heated metal and absorbing the moisture, the palladium was
left in a suitable condition. The palladium contained in a
suitably constructed glass tube was charged with hydrogen
by passing a current of gas over the metal previously heated
to a very high temperature, and in this way in a short time
the tube was freed from the last traces of air; a stopcock just
in advance of the palladium-tube was then closed and the metal
gradually cooled in hydrogen, which it thus absorbed to a
known amount : after j connexion with the hydrogen
generating apparatus was cut off by fusing off the connecting
tube.
   The palladium-tube was in connexion with a small drying
tube (containing potash which had previously been heated to
a high temperature in a silver dish and ...in a desiccator),
and ...,      this with the spectrum-tube and another drying
tube and thence to the pump; the spectrum-tube was also in
connexion with a tube containing potassium permanganate
which on heating gave very pure oxygen.                        >
   The spectrum-tube, which was of the ordinary “end-on
description but with the wide tubes longer than usual (to
keep the platinum—thrown off by the electrodes—away from
the capillary), was constructed conveniently, so that the
entrance and exit tubes for the gas were near the electrodes.
In this way, even at very small differences of pressure, the
fresh gas quite displaced that previously in the tube.
   Having first been thoroughly heated with oxygen, the
vacuum-tubes were exhausted several times with similar treat
ment until the spectrum of quite pure oxygen was alone seen,
this being taken as a criterion of the condition of the tube. A
very high vacuum having been obtained, connexion was made
with the palladium-tube and a current of hydrogen caused to

  340                Mr. R. S. Hutton on the
  flow through the vacuum-tube by continuing the action of
  the pump. In this way it was possible to fractionate off the
  hydrogen. Although the work was carried out with as great
  care as possible, I was unable to detect any difference in the
  spectrum of the fractionated gas notwithstanding that the
  method was varied. The compound line-spectrum was ex
  tremely bright all the time, at any rate until a fairly high
  vacuum had been obtained, and working under pressures
  between 2 and 1 millim. the second spectrum was always
  very evident; the colour of the discharge in the capillary was
  mostly of a greyish-blue colour and never red.
      3. Influence of Presence of Traces of Oxygen upon the
                       Hydrogen Spectrum.
    Special precautions had been taken to prevent carbonaceous
 contamination, the lubrication of all the Geissler mercury
 trapped taps being effected with phosphoric acid. Still I
 thought it might be possible to find if any hydrocarbon were
 present or not by introducing a little oxygen into the spectrum
 tube containing hydrogen, and then making observations for
 the carbon spectrum. The introduction of oxygen was effected
 by warming the permanganate-tube mentioned above; but
 although I repeated the experiment many times, no carbon
 spectrum was to be seen. It was most remarkable, however,
 that so soon as the oxygen reached the tube the colour of the
 discharge in the capillary changed to a very bright red ; and
 under these conditions it was possible almost entirely to get
 rid of the second spectrum, or at any rate it was so very
 dim in comparison with the principal lines that it could
 not be detected visually.
    These observations were confirmed in many separate expe
 riments, photographs of the spectrum being also taken. It
was most noticeable in each case that the sudden change took
place ; and although in the photographs, some of which had
25 minutes exposure, all the brighter lines of the second
spectrum came out dimly, the background of continuous
spectrum, which seems generally to accompany this second
 spectrum, was quite absent.
   I next tried sparking with magnesium electrodes to make
sure that the excess of oxygen had been removed, and in this
way the red colour of the discharge was not altered; and
other experiments, in which several fresh additions of hydrogen
were made to the tube without causing the disappearance of
the red colour, lead me to think that the amount of oxygen
necessary is very small.
   This sudden change from the bluish colour to the red seems

              Compound Line-Spectrum of Hydrogen.           341
  to be very similar to that mentioned by Trowbridge and
  Richards (Phil. Mag. [5] xliii. p. 137); the continuous
  discharge from their high-tension accumulator gave a whitish
 glow in the capillary which gave the second spectrum:—
  “A large capacity is needed to change this spectrum into the
 familiar 4-line spectrum. . . . . The change is marked by a
 sharp alteration in the colour of the glow from white to deep
 red.” It seems possible, therefore, that the presence of
 oxygen alters the electrical conditions, and that this alone
 accounts for the sudden change.
    It is not easy to find from Cornu's paper exactly how pure
 a spectrum he obtained; however, he says:– “Dans ces tubes
 ainsi purifiés l'éclat des raies de l’hydrogene est vraiment
 admirable.”    But in this connexion it . be noted that this
 may have been due to the presence of traces of oxygen, since
 Cornu washed out his tubes with ionized oxygen, and the
 arrangement which he used makes it quite possible that the
 hydrogen afterwards admitted might become contaminated
 with traces of this gas; at any rate precautions to guard
 against this contamination are not described in his paper.
    Stas has noted, in one of the papers published since his
 death, that extraordinary precautions have to be taken to
 remove a trace of some impurity which is present in all
 hydrogen prepared by the usual methods (see J. S. Stas,
 OEurres Completes, Bruxelles, 1894, iii. pp. 216, 225); and
 the possibility of this unknown impurity having some influ
ence upon the spectrum needs perhaps to be considered.
    I was sorry to be unable to continue the work upon the
influence of oxygen upon the hydrogen spectrum, as probably
some more conclusive result might have |. arrived at.
   4. Spectrum of Hydrogen prepared by a different Method.
    On studying the work which has been done not only on
 the spectrum, but also with regard to the other properties of
hydrogen, one cannot help being struck by the fact that very
few workers have attempted to prepare this gas except by
methods which are essentially the same, in nearly all cases
by the decomposition of water or of a solution of an acid in
water ; and, so far as I can find out, the gas prepared from
sources quite different has not been worked with. Various
methods suggested themselves by which at least small
  uantities of hydrogen might be prepared, but the one I
adopted recommends itself more by its dissimilarity from that
usually employed than by its simplicity. I decided to pre
pare hydrogen from pure ammonia gas, generated by heating
immonium chloride purified by Stas' method with lime pre
  ared from marble. The ammonia thus formed remained in
   Phil. Mag. S. 5, Vol. 46. No 280. Sept. 1898.      2B

342        On the Compound Line-Spectrum of Hydrogen.
contact with powdered caustic soda, to dry it well. The
decomposition of the gas was effected by red-hot platinum,
through which the hydrogen formed was allowed to diffuse
into a vacuum. The platinum was in the form of a closed
tube provided with a long narrow neck, the whole being in
one piece, and very beautifully made for me by the further
kindness of Messrs. Matthew.         The end of the narrow tube
was connected by fusion with glass tubing, and thus with the
spectrum-tube, pump, &c.
   In this way quite a large amount of hydrogen was diffused
through the platinum, three separate experiments being per
formed ; but the hydrogen gave to all appearances a spectrum
identical with that obtained from the hydrogen absorbed by
palladium. I feel that particular value is attached to this
experiment, simple as it may seem, since great care was
exercised in designing the apparatus, and many precautions
adopted which it is impossible to detail without making the
description excessively long. It is perhaps sufficient to say
that the platinum-tube was enclosed in a glazed porcelain
tube, into which after evacuation the ammonia was generated;
the porcelain tube was heated in a specially arranged muffle
furnace.
   My results, as far as they go, support therefore the
generally accepted conclusions that this second spectrum is a
true hydrogen spectrum, and render it probable that Cornu's
results may be explained by the fact that traces of oxygen
remained in his tube, such traces almost completely destroying
the compound spectrum.
   The above experiments were carried out in the Physical
Laboratories of the Owens College.

 XXXII. Note on Mr. Sutherland's Ol<U+017F>ection to the Conclusive
             ness of the Michelson-Morley AEther Experiment.
                To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.
      GENTLEMEN,
 I     HAVE just seen a paper by Mr. W. Sutherland in
          your number for January this year, where he suggests
 reasons for doubting the trustworthy character of the negative
 result of Michelson and Morley’s great experiment. It might,
 for instance, be attributed to the possible second-order influ
 ence of a hitherto neglected first-order tilting or shifting of
 the wave-fronts brought about by the undiscovered drift of
 the aether past the earth. (I am not sure that Mr. Sutherland
 means exactly this; but if not his meaning is unintelligible,
having regard to the way in which the experiment was actually
performed, viz. by revolving a floating stone and observing in
all azimuths. A criticism by Mr. Sutherland is, however,
always of importance.)
     But in my memoir on Aberration (Phil. Trans. A. 1893,
pp. 739, 748, & 790) I have shown that though motion of the
entire medium can readily affect waves, it has no first-order
effect upon rays, neither upon their path nor their time of
journey; and inasmuch as it is either ray-path or time of journey
which is observed in any optical experiment, I am unable to per
ceive any flaw in the Michelson-Morley result, that the expected
second-order effect is also nil. It might be thought that the
 varying inclination of the ray to the mirror at different

- 344        On the Michelson-Morley AFther Experiment.
  azimuths might possibly have a neglected neutralizing influ
   ence; but the wave has no such inclination, it strikes absolutely
   plumb (l. c. p. 791). The discrepancy between this and
   other experiments, which show definitely that the aether is
  not carried along by moving bodies (Phil. Trans, vol., 189,
   p. 149, and the Fizeau experiment also when properly inter
   preted, e.g. 1893, p. 751), is to be sought, I conjecture, in
   that new and important though minute       hypothetical  residual
   phenomenon first suggested by FitzGerald, and then again
   indicated with more elaboration by H. A. Lorentz, viz. a
   probable modification (diminution) in cohesive force due to
  aether motion across the line of particles; or, as Larmor ex
   presses it on his theory, a shrinkage in the dimension of bodies
  along the line of their motion, of amount 1–4 vº<U+017F> V* (Phil.
  Trans. 1897, p. 229); in other words, a slight distortion in
  the stone slab supporting Michelson's optical apparatus, exactly
  sufficient to undo or compensate the optical influence of the
  real (relative) ather-drift past the moving earth.
      Parenthetically I may say that the whole of this subject
  indicates that the aether is a physical standard of rest; and
  that motion relative to it, which is becoming cognisable by
  us, is in that sense an ascertained absolute motion. Every
  body has always had an instinctive feeling that absolute
  motion was somehow a reality, else would there be no difference
  between Copernicus and Ptolemy; Galileo was in some sort a
  martyr to faith in the reality of absolute motion; and although
  a scientific agnostic occasionally says that we do not know
  whether the visible system is or is not flying bodily through
  space at a prodigious pace, he forgets that in that case every
  electric charge would be likewise an electric current.
      Nevertheless even in that case only second-order effects of
  those currents could be observed. They could attract or repel
  each other, to the order of vºV*, but they could not deflect a
  compass-needle, because of the compensating induced charges.
  Any experiment made with the object of observing galvano
  metric action (i.e. compass-needle deflexion) in the dielectric
  of a condenser is therefore illusory : its result is not so much
  negative as null. It would be worth while to look for the
  second-order electro-dynamometric effect of the earth's occa
  sional 28 miles a second, but it might quite possibly be com
  pensated by an influence to be expected on the balancing
  elasticity. If so, these numerous compensations would be in
  favour of an “electron " theory of matter. I see no reason,
  however, to expect an influence on a balancing weight.
                                  Yours faithfully,

XXXIII. Latent Heat of Evaporation of Zinc and Cadmium.
                  By WILLIAM St.THERLAND +.
    N an article on the Fundamental Atomic Laws of Thermo
       chemistry (Phil. Mag. [5] vol. xl. 1895), certain prin
ciples as to molecular force were used to calculate the latent
heats of evaporation of metals and compounds of metals. At
the time of these calculations it escaped my notice that Barus,
in his article on the Pressure-variation of certain High
pressure Boiling-points (Phil. Mag. [5] vol. xxix. 1890), had
supplied data whereby the latent heats of vaporization of zinc
and cadmium could be determined.        It therefore seems desi
 rable to show briefly now how the theoretical agree with the
experimental determinations.
    The usual thermodynamical equation for the latent heat of
evaporation of a gramme of liquid at absolute temperature 6
and of volume ri into saturated vapour of volume vs at Satu
ration-pressure p,          d
                       x=0% (º-r)|J,
has been so thoroughly verified that it furnishes an experi
mental method of determining A without the necessity of
direct calorimetric measurements.      Let M be the molecular
mass of the substance, that of hydrogen being 2; then ne
glecting ri beside rº, we have
                          —a". M.
    Now for 2 grammes of hydrogen under standard conditions
Mv3 is 22,400 c.c.; so that for a vaporized metal at a pressure
of 1 atmo and at 6 the value of Mvs is 224006/273.
    For the relation between p and 0 for Zn and Cd, Barus
gives formulae which represent his experimental results satis
factorily, and enable one to calculate dp/d6 at values of p
from 1 atmo down to a fraction thereof. Using the con
stants of the formula at p. 152 of his paper, we find for
(dp/d6)6/p when p is 1 atmo the value 11:9 for Zn, and 14.2
for Cd, the corresponding values of 6 being 1200 for Zn and
1050 for Cd.       }.    then, taking 1 atmo as 1:01.4 x 10"
dynes per cm.*, and J as 42 x 10" ergs, we obtain as
the values of MA in kilocalories 28-3 for Zn and 29-6 for
  'd : these are the heats of vaporization of gramme-mole
cules of these metals as liquids. Now Person's values (.1nn.
de Ch. et de Phys. [3] xxiv.) for the latent heats of
fusion of Zn and CJ per gramme-molecule in kilocalories are
18 and 1:5; so that the total heats of volatilizing gramme
molecules of solid Zn and Cd are 30:1 and 31: 1.          These
numbers include the heat used in expanding the evaporating
                  * Communicated by the Author.

metal against the atmospheric pressure, which for most liquids
has been found to be about one-eleventh of the total latent
heat. Thus for the vaporization of a gramme-molecule of solid
Zn and of solid Cd, without performance of external work, we
have the approximate values 27 and 28 respectively, while the
value adopted on p. 18 of my paper is 29-6 for both of them.
This agreement should increase the confidence to be placed
in the estimates of the latent heats of the other metals and
compounds given in that paper.           It should interest thermo
chemists to learn that the work of Barus shows how a number
of important latent heats can be determined experimentally
with the aid of thermodynamics.

TVHE following communications were read:—
       1. ‘The Garnet-actinolite Schists on the Southern Side of the
St. Gothard Pass.’    By Prof. T. G. Bonney, D.Sc., LL.D., F.R.S.,
V.P.G.S.
   The author describes the field relations and the microscopic
structures of a group of schists or gneisses characterized by the
frequent presence of conspicuous garnets and actinolites, which are
exposed on the southern slopes of the St. Gothard Pass and for some
distance west and east, on the northern side of the Val Bedretto.
These, called for purposes of reference the Tremola Schists, he has
examined from time to time since 1878, the last occasion being
the summer of 1897, when he was accompanied and aided by
Mr. John Parkinson, F.G.S.      These rocks in the field might be
regarded as highly-altered sedimentary strata (as the author once
thought) or as a group of igneous rocks (originating possibly in
magmatic differentiation) affected by fluxion-movements anterior to
consolidation.   To the latter view he now inclines, but considers
the schistosity and the peculiar minor structures to be the results
of crushing (generally without marked shearing) followed by very
considerable mineral reconstruction. The garnets he holds to be
anterior to this crushing, but the larger biotites and the con
spicuous actinolites to be posterior to it. These minerals, in
his opinion, throw some light on processes of crystallization in
rocks more or less pulverized, or, in other words, in the presence of
various impediments. He thinks it probable that the Tremola
Schists assumed their present form prior to the great Tertiary
earth-movements which gave rise to the existing Alpine chain.
   2. “On the Metamorphism of a Series of Grits and Shales in
Northern Anglesey.' By C Callaway, M.A., D.Sc., F.G.S.
   These rocks occur in a patch about 3 miles square, situated
south-west of Amlwch, and extending from Llanfechell and Rhos

         On the Discorery of Natural Gas in East Sussea.            347
beirio to the boundary-fault near Melin Pant-y-gwydd, and from
 Mynydd Mechell to Bodewryd. They dip to the north, and appa
 rently form a series in the following ascending order:-(1) Highly
 quartzose and gritty rocks. (2) A considerable admixture of softer
 beds (hypometamorphic shales). (3) Predominating shaly strata,
 with gritty seams in subordinate proportion. The lower beds
 contain intercalated seams of well-foliated micaceous or chloritic
 schist, and in these lower beds the signs of compression and contortion
 are most marked.
    A series of microscopic slides from Rhosbeirio, Llanfechell,
 Pant-y-glo, and intermediate localities links together the fragmental
 rocks with the true schists. Grains of clastic quartz are replaced
 by “granular particles fitting into each other with foliate inter
 locking margins’; when in contact ‘the grains are moulded into
 each other, and welded together'; but when ‘entirely immersed in
 a soft matrix of mica or chlorite, they ‘still retain their sharp
 outlines. In the ‘matrix’ the chlorite and mica-flakes are gradually
enlarged.
    While ‘ mechanical force has been concerned in producing the
more intense metamorphism of the lower part of the series, the
 author is ‘not disposed to advance this as the sole cause of the
changes produced.’
    3. ‘ On a Volcanic Series in the Malvern Hills, near the Here
fordshire Beacon.” By H. D. Acland, Esq., F.G.S.
    These are the rocks described briefly by Dr. Callaway and
Mr. Rutley, and afterwards more fully by the late Prof. A. H. Green.
They consist of tuffs, rhyolites, andesites, and dolerites or basalts.
The microscopic appearance of the rocks exposed in excavations for
a new reservoir between Tinker's Hill and Broad Down indicates
that they are much crushed; indeed, the amount of infiltrated
calcite often causes the rhyolites to assume the aspect of limestones.
On Tinker's Hill there is less crushing.      On Hangman's Hill there
are rocks allied to epidosites.
    It is suggested that the rocks may be the volcanic equivalents of
the plutonic rocks of the Malvern axis, faulted down and protected
by the bend in the axis which occurs in the neighbourhood of the
Herefordshire Beacon.

   The following communications were read:—
    1. ‘ On the Discovery of Natural Gas in East Sussex.' By
C. Dawson, Esq., F.G.S., F.S.A.
    Inflammable natural gas was first recorded by Mr. H. Willett
in his 13th quarterly report of the Subwealden Exploration.
Another discovery was in a deep artesian boring in the stable-yard
of the New Heathfield Hotel. In 1896, at a site about 100 yards
distant from the last-mentioned locality, a boring was put down by
the London, Brighton, & South Coast Railway Co., the details of
which are given in the paper together with those of the earlier
Heathfield boring. From this boring gas has been escaping for the
last 18 months, with a pressure of not less than 15 lb. to the square

  inch, and at the rate of about 124 cubic feet per hour (with a pressure
  of 20 tenths maintained), although the tube is stopped up, and is
  partially filled with water.
     Though deficient in illuminating quality, the gas burns well
  when mixed with air and gives a good bunsen-flame.                      The author
  considers that it is probably derived from the lower beds pierced,
  that is, the Purbeck strata, or by percolation from the still lower
  Kimeridge beds, which were not reached by the borings. The
  borings pierce the southern slope of the great anticline which runs
  from Fairlight into Mid Sussex and is joined at Heathfield by
  another considerable anticline running through Burwash.

 GENTI.EMEN,
    N answer to Prof. Lanza's letter in August number of the
       Phil. Mag. p. 260, respecting my method of measuring the
 torsional angle of a rotating shaft, I beg to state that I knew
 nothing whatever of Prof. Lanza's work when I devised the method
 to which he alludes.         On referring to the note on his work in
 • Engineering, Jan. 14, 1887, I find an illustration of the Pro
fessor's apparatus, but of the method of electrically measuring the
torsion no mention whatever is made; and it certainly could not
be discovered from the diagram, which is rather too heavily shaded
to be definite in detail. The method I use (Phil. Mag. Feb. 1898)
was suggested to me by my own form of dynamometric speed
indicator, described on p. 12 of a small book on ‘Work-Measuring
Machines’ written by me, and published by Spon & Co., London
& New York, 1884. The speed-indicator was used in the Paris
Electrical Exhibition, 1881, for determining the relative velocities
of two rotating shafts by means of a telephone included in an
electrical circuit controlled by contact-disks attached to the shafts.

                            Introductory.
     NDER the above title the authors, in conjunction with
        Dr. Sumpner, read a paper before the Physical Society
in January 1890 t, and gave a list of sensibility-records
relating to a large number of instruments of various types.
To facilitate comparison between different instruments, the
results were reduced to a common standard as regards scale
distance, length of a scale-division, periodic time of vibration,
and resistance, the values chosen for this purpose being,
respectively, a scale-distance equal to 2000 scale-divisions,
periodic time 10 seconds, and resistance 1 ohm. The sen
sibilities for steady currents were expressed as the number of
scale-divisions deflexion a current .."one microampere would
produce (assuming proportionality) under the standard con
ditions, and the sensibilities for quantity as the swing produced
by the instantaneous discharge of one microcoulomb when the
instruments were used ballistically. The resulting numbers
give a measure of the relative sensitiveness of the various
instruments when quickness of action is all important. For
cases where time is of little consequence, and constancy of

zero (as depending on the controlling forces) is of prime
importance, the results were modified by appropriately intro
ducing the moment of inertia of the suspended systems.
    Our reasons for choosing a scale-distance of 2000 scale
divisions and a period of 10 seconds as standard conditions,
were, that these conditions represented more nearly than any
other round numbers those under which sensitive galvano
meters were generally used. For example, scales of half
millimetres used at about a metre distance were frequently
met with, whilst scales of fortieths of an inch used at 3 to
4 feet distance were quite common. Further, nearly all the
reflecting-instruments at the Central Technical College had
long scales with divisions about ºr of an inch placed at about
6 feet from the mirror.     Since 1890, however, scales divided
into single millimetres have come into much more general use,
 and may now be regarded as the standard type in physical
laboratories. As the present tendency in galvanometer con
 struction is to reduce the size of the needles and mirrors, and
 therefore the available light, it is probable that scale-distances
 will decrease rather than increase.     We are therefore led to
 believe that a scale-distance equal to 1000 scale-divisions
  (rather than 2000) would be, on the whole, a more convenient
 standard to adopt. Another reason for proposing the change
is to facilitate the international acceptance of a common
 system; for we learn from Prof. H. du Bois that our system
 thus modified is to be recommended for adoption at the next
 meeting of the Society of German Physicists and Physicians in
 September next at Dusseldorf.        Doubtless some instrument
makers will object to the change ; others, we are sure, will
 welcome it, for some have used the proposed standard them
 selves for some time.    Millimetres at a metre, as the deflexion  t
 per microampere, is a convenient way of stating the “figure
of merit” of sensitive galvanometers. Moreover, the con
 version into circular measure is quite simple, 1 division at
 1000 divisions distance corresponding with a movement of
 the suspended system through 3 º'ºw of a radian. We would
 therefore suggest that in future all sensibilities be expressed
 in terms of this standard. In the new sensibility-records given
 in Table II. of the present paper we have adopted this standard ;
 and to facilitate comparison of these records with those given
 in our 1890 paper, we have appropriately reduced the numbers
 given in the principal table of the latter paper, and embodied
 them in Table I.
     As regards the standard periodic time, 10 seconds       repre

  round number ; hence we decided in 1890 to use this time as
  the standard period to which all sensibilities were reduced. So
 far as we can see, this is still the most convenient standard
  time, and it has therefore been retained in the present paper.
     The reduction to a standard resistance of one ohm has
  proved of considerable value in comparing various instruments,
  and has been frequently used by others interested in the
  subject. The question as to whether the “square-root law,”

or the two-fifths power law,
               Deflexion per microampere o (resistance)*,
  should be used in this reduction is still perhaps debatable.
  On the whole, we consider the two-fifths law more nearly
 true over wide ranges of resistance; nevertheless we have
 given the principal results reduced according to both
 systems.

                      Periodic time of any instrument is 10 VI seconds.
                       Recent Improvements.
     Since the above-mentioned paper was published con
 siderable advance has been made in the construction of
 sensitive galvanometers, more especially in the direction
 of reducing the dimensions of the suspended parts. We
 therefore thought it desirable to prepare a supplementary
 list of records, giving the results obtained on more recent
 instruments. In passing, we may remark that German and
 American instruments of the suspended-magnet type show
 the greatest progress in the reduction of dimensions and
 consequent quickness of action, whilst the d’Arsonval, or
 moving-coil type, seems to have received its greatest deve
 lopment in England.
     To make the present list more complete than the original
 one, we have inserted three additional columns, giving
 respectively the period of vibration of the suspended system
 when tested, the logarithmic decrement, and the actual
 sensitiveness of the instruments obtained in the test, reduced
 to standard scale-distance and scale-divisions.            From the
 first two of these columns (Columns 1 and 2 of Table II.,
 pp.356,357) the relative suitabilities of the various instruments
  for ballistic or deflexional observation can be seen ; whilst
  the third column (Column 3, Table II.) shows the actual
  “figures of merit” of the galvanometers (reduced to
  standard scale-distance) in the condition under which they
  were tested. This latter column is of considerable importance
  in the case of instruments whose controlling couple cannot be
  readily altered—for example, in the case of ordinary moving
  coil instruments.
     In addition to the three columns above referred to, we have
  also given in Table V. (p. 364) a list of records relating to
  moving-coil galvanometers used as voltmeters.
     The values of D/r' or D/ri in columns 9 and 10 of Tables I.
  and II. express the relative sensibilities of the various instru

        Prof. Ayrton and Mr. Mather on Galvanometers.                  353
ments for constant period and constant resistance of coil, when
the galvanometers are used as ammeters. The same columns
give their relative merits as voltmeters, provided the resistance
of the coil is equal to the resistance between the terminals,
i. e. when the resistance of the connexions is small compared
with that of the coil. This may be taken to be the case in
instruments with fixed coils; but for moving-coil galvano
meters it is by no means true, especially when the coils have
low resistance, for in some instruments the resistance of the
suspensions is greater than that of the coil. Further, as
instruments of the d’Arsonval type cannot always have their
period, and therefore their sensitiveness, easily varied, no
reduction to constant period or constant resistance has been
made in Table V., and the numbers in column 3 (F) Table V.
give the actual sensibilities of the respective instruments
as voltmeters when the scale-distances equal 1000 scale
divisions.
    We may again point out (as in our original paper") that
the comparison of galvanometers by reduction to constant
period, scale-distance, and resistance, is a purely electro
magnetic comparison, and takes no account of optical magni
fication, which in some instruments is of a much more perfect
nature than in others.        It is also to be noticed that the Table II.
contains some records of galvanometers having very short
periods, e. g. instruments numbered 4, 25, 41, 42, 43, 46,
and 47; and the results of the tests on these instruments have,
for the sake of uniformity, been reduced to the same period,
scale-distance, and resistance, as the galvanometers having
longer periods. It must not, however, be supposed that these
short-period instruments could easily have their periodic
time lengthened to 10 seconds—indeed, in some cases this
would be practically impossible. But although the values
given in columns 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 17, and 18 for the above
 mentioned short-period instruments cannot as yet be realized
in practice, the ratios of these numbers to those in the corre
sponding column for any other instrument give approximatel
the relative sensibilities of the two instruments compared,
 when both have the same short periodic time. To make our
 meaning clearer we will compare instruments numbered 24
 and 43 in Table II. Referring to column 13 we find the
 values of D/r3 for these instruments to be 254 and 985
 respectively, indicating that No. 43 has a “factor of merit”
 between three and four times as large as No. 24. This must
not be taken to mean that No. 43 is actually more sensitive

    On comparing Table II. of the present paper with the one
published in 1890 (shown in Table I., pp. 354, 355), it will be
observed that in columns 12 and 13 (which express the
factors of merit of the various instruments when time is
of importance) the values are on the average greatly in
creased. For example, the highest values in the 1890 table
were given by one of Messrs. Elliott Bros.' Thomson instru
ments of special form (see line 4, Table I.), for which D/4
was 206.5 and D/r? 493, and these numbers were far above
any others in the list made out at that time. These figures
are now surpassed by no less than eleven instruments given in
the present list (omitting the oscillograph records in lines 4,
25, 46, and 47); and three of the eleven instruments are of
the moving-coil type.
    The highest values in the present table (omitting the
oscillographs previously mentioned) are those given by one
of Prof. Paschen’s instruments, line 21, Table II., and are
5800 and 8750 for D/r" and D/r? respectively. We therefore
see that Prof. Paschen has produced an instrument which, at
a given periodic time and of a given resistance, is about
twenty times as sensitive as the best given in our previous
paper. Other instruments of the moving-magnet type giving
very high factors of merit are:—
    (a) Two Paschen instruments. (Lines 20 and 23 of table.)
    (b) Prof. Nichols’ galvanometer". (Line 11 of table.)

numbers for these instruments are abstracted from the main
table and put in order of magnitude below.

     These increases in the factors of merit have been brought
 about chiefly by reducing the dimensions of the suspended
 parts, and º, use of better magnet steel has probably con
 tributed something to the improvement.
     The three moving-coil instruments which have surpassed the
 highest values of D/r? and D/rº given in our 1890 table are
 of the narrow coil type, the cross-section of the winding being
 of the form described before this Society in 1890*, viz., two
 equal circles in contact.
     To attain the results here shown (Table III.), the transverse
 dimensions of the coils have been made smaller than usual and
  very powerful permanent magnets employed. When we
 compare the records of these instruments with the best listed

instrument in 1890 was 27, the present highest value is 985.
    It is also interesting to notice that so far as absolute sen
 sitiveness for current is concerned (i.e. the “millimetres at
 a metre’” per microampere, unreduced for period and re
 sistance) the progress made with moving-coil instruments
 during the last eight years has been considerable. In our
 1890 Table the d’Arsonval of greatest absolute sensitiveness
 as an ammeter was the “Large invariable sensibility” instru
 ment given in line 4 of the d'Arsonval section of that list (see
 line 34, Table I.). This galvanometer gave 6:1 divisions per
 microampere, its period being 2-6 seconds, and coil-resistance
 21 ohms. In the more recent list, Table Il., the above record
 is surpassed by no less than thirteen instruments out of the
 twenty-one tabulated, the most sensitive d’Arsonval galvano
 meter to current being one made by Messrs. Nalder Bros.
 & Co., which gives 760 divisions per microampere, its period
 being 12.9 seconds and resistance 1053 ohms (see line 37,
Table II.).
    On comparing column 15 of Table II. with the corresponding
one in the 1890 Table, which gives the values of DI/r?, i. e.
numbers proportional to the deflexion per microampere with
constant controlling moment *, we observe that no increase is
perceptible. On the contrary, the numbers in the columns of
the present table are on the average smaller than in the
previous one. This is what might be expected from a
diminution of the dimensions of the moving parts of the
instruments.       An examination of columns 16 in the two
tables (values of SI}/r?) leads to a conclusion similar to that
deduced from a comparison of columns 15, the only instance of
increased values being in the three narrow-coil d’Arsonval
instruments just referred to.
    It is perhaps worth while again calling attention to the fact
of the superior sensitiveness (as ballistic instruments) of gal
vanometers with suspended parts having small inertia, a fact
which is clearly shown by a study of columns 9 and 14 of the
tables.

   Since the paper was read our attention has been directed to
a very sensitive galvanometer designed by Prof. R. Threlfall,
M.A. (an account of which is given in the Phil. Trans. of the

and Mr. J. H. D. Brearley in their “Researches on the Elec
trical Properties of Pure Sulphur.” This instrument is in
many respects a remarkable one. Unfortunately the details
of the sensibility tests given in the printed paper are hardly
sufficient to enable us to make the reductions to constant
period and scale distance, as is done in Table II., so we give
the results separately below. The tests were made by ob
serving the i. produced on reversing a small current
through the galvanometer, the throws being read by a tele
scope at about 267 centimetres from the galvanometer. The
telescope had a micrometer eyepiece and a glass scale in it
divided to fifths of a millimetre.                                                -

      The definition of the optical system was sufficiently good
 to permit the micrometer-scale being read to a fifth of a
division, so that currents of one-fifth the magnitude of those
given in the last column of the above Table could be detected.
                                  Oscillographs.
      Oscillographs, or instruments for showing the character of
   rapidly-varying currents or potential-differences, were practi
   cally unknown when our 1890 paper was read. They have
   become possible by the great reduction of dimensions of
   moving parts which has gone on continuously since that date.
   An oscillograph may be defined as a galvanometer of very
   short period. The short periodic time is usually obtained by
   using very small moving parts and a very strong control.
   In these instruments the reduction of size has been carried
   far beyond what has yet been attempted for ordinary scale
   reading work.           Mr. McKittrick’s i galvanometer has a
   moving system whose moment of inertia is about one
   millionth of a C.G.S. unit, or about one ten-thousandth the
   inertia of an ordinary light astatic needle fitted with a 3 in. light

         Prof. Ayrton and Mr. Mather on Galvanometers. 363
   On comparing Mr. Duddell's 1897 instrument with those
of Messrs. Hotchkiss and Millis and Mr. McKittrick, we find
its factor of merit, as indicated by d/v4 (the expression most
suited to instruments having comparatively low resistance), is
decidedly greater than either of the other two, in spite of the
fact of its wires being of phosphor-bronze instead of copper.
It may also be pointed out that the moment of inertia of the
moving parts of Mr. Duddell's 1897 oscillograph is very consi
derably greater than the inertias of the two first-mentioned
instruments, being in the approximate ratios of 30 : 2:2:1,
thus showing the great superiority of the moving-coil type
for work of this nature, where short periodic time (or high
frequency) and good sensitiveness are necessary. In his
latest oscillograph Mr. Duddell has carried the reduction of
dimensions much further than has previously been attempted,
and has produced an instrument whose periodic time is
less than a ten-thousandth of a second (frequency 10,680).
Although its resistance is little more than 2 ohms, it actually
gives 420 divisions per ampere at standard scale-distance, and
its factors of merit, as represented by d/r4 and drº, are
more than 30 times those of any instrument made previously.
              d’Arsonval Galvanometers as Voltmeters.
    In Table V. the actual sensibilities of various d’Arsonval
galvanometers when used as voltmeters are given, reductions
having been made to bring them to the same scale-distance
and scale-divisions only.
    As will be seen from the table, considerable advance has
been made in recent years. Of the d'Arsonval galvanometers
mentioned in our 1890 paper, the most sensitive instrument as
a voltmeter we had then seen was one of the “invariable sensi
 bility " type, having a very large magnet.   Its record is given
 in line 4 of the d’Arsonval section of that table (see line 34,
Table I.). The instrument had a period of 2.6 seconds, coil
resistance of 21 ohms, and total resistance of 57.5 ohms, and
gave a deflexion of 0-105 division per microvolt when the
scale-distance was equal to 1000 scale-divisions. Referring
to Table V. of the present paper, we notice that in 1892 a
narrow-coil galvanometer was constructed, having a period
 of 2.2 seconds, coil-resistance 13.2 ohms, and total resistance
 24-8 ohms, which gave 1.31 divisions per microvolt, an in
.           of over 12 times in sensitiveness, with a shorter
    r1 O(1.
    In 1893 Messrs. Queen and Co., of Philadelphia, produced
a galvanometer of 178 ohms resistance, which gave 1-13
divisions per microvolt, whilst in 1896 Messrs. Crompton

  showed to the authors one of their high-grade instruments,
  having a total resistance of 143 ohms, which gave 1.83
  divisions per microvolt, its period being 12:1 seconds (see
  line numbered 33, Table V.). Up to the end of 1896 the
  Crompton instrument was the most sensitive d’Arsonval volt
  meter we had any record of, but its period was, for some
  purposes, inconveniently long.

                   Uniformity in recording Tests.
    We would here mention that in some of the galvanometer
records we have received, the time of a single swing from one
side of the scale to the other has been given as “the period,”
and this has caused considerable trouble on account of the
 sensibilities under standard conditions, calculated out on the
assumption that the “complete period * was meant, coming
out abnormally high. We therefore think it important that
in all records of tests the “complete period,” i.e. the time
 between two transits of the spot across the zero in the same
 direction, should be given. We may also remark that in all
 cases the logarithmic decrement (or the decrement) under
 the conditions in which the period was tested, should be
 stated, so that the change of period caused by damping may
 be allowed for. Unless this be done, well-damped instru
 ments, which are usually the most convenient, will be unfairly
 handicapped. In the case of d’Arsonval or other instruments,
 in which the periodic time cannot readily be altered by the
 user, it is important that the actual period of the vibration
 when tested should be given.
    For a complete record the following particulars are
required —
       (1) Resistance of instrument *.
       (2) Periodic time when tested.
        (3) Divisions deflexion per microampere (or micro
                amperes per division).
       (4) Scale-distance.
        (5) Length of one scale-division.
        (6) Logarithmic decrement under test conditions.

         Nomenclature relating to Dead-beat Galvanometers.
     Some ambiguity at present exists in the use of the words
  “dead-beat” as applied to galvanometers. Sometimes it is used
  as synonymous, with “well-damped" or “aperiodic,” whilst
  at other times the adjective is applied to instruments having
  quick-moving systems irrespective of whether the decrement
    * If instrument be of the moving-coil type the resistances of coil and
  suspensions should be stated separately.

        Prof. Ayrton and Mr. Mather on Galvanometers.               367
of the motion is large or small. Since quickening the move
ment by increasing the control (i. e. decreasing the periodic
time of vibration) of a given system lessens the decrement,
the two uses of the words “dead-beat" are to some extent
incompatible. Maxwell used the term for galvanometers in
which the motion of the suspended system was “aperiodic,”
i. e. the system only passed once through the position of
equilibrium before coming to rest. As this meaning of the
word seems most rational, we think it desirable it should be
retained, and that its use in connexion with instruments havin
rapidly moving systems whose motion is not aperiodic .#
be discontinued. The expressions “quick-moving” or “short
period” galvanometer might be used to denote this class of
instrument.
  Insulation of Coils and Terminals of Galvanometers, and the
                    use of Price’s “Guard-Wire.”
    When testing very high resistances, such as the insulation
resistance of a short length of good cable, with a galvano
meter, the difficulties which arise from leakage over the cable
 ends or from the galvanometer itself are well known ; the
importance of constructing galvanometers so as to ensure
 good insulation was referred to in our previous paper*.
    Since that date Mr. W. A. Price f has suggested the use
of a “guard-wire” which practically eliminates error due to
 surface leakage over cable ends. The method there described
 can be adapted to galvanometers, thereby making the question
 of perfect insulation of coils and terminals of far less conse
 quence than formerly.
                                 ||||||
    Mr. Price's method consists in winding a bare wire W
about midway between the extremities of the pared ends
of the cable as shown in fig. 1, and connecting the other

end of the wire to H, the battery side of the galvano
meter G.
    As the current through the galvanometer is very small, the
 P.D. between the wire W and the conductor C is also very
 small, and the surface leakage between them is quite negligible
 if the surface of the dielectric between them is fairly clean
 and dry. The full P.D. exists between W and the sheathing
 or wet braiding S, but any leakage-current from one to the
 other does not pass through the galvanometer. In the same
 manner error due to leakage from the terminal J of the
 galvanometer may be eliminated.
    It will be evident that there is no need to have the battery
 side of the galvanometer perfectly insulated : all that is neces
 sary is that the insulation resistance of H from earth is large
 compared with the internal resistance of the battery.
     Probably the simplest way of applying the “guard-wire”
 principle to a galvanometer is to put one terminal of the
 winding to frame and case, preferably of metal, and carry the
  other terminal from the frame on a support moderately well
  insulated therefrom. The whole galvanometer may be suffi
  ciently well insulated from earth by putting short ebonite
 sleeves, or caps, on the tips of the levelling screws. This
  construction was carried out in the Ayrton-Mather galvano
  meter as made by Mr. R. W. Paul in 1892, an instrument of
  this class being shown before this Society on June 10th in
  that year". By using the frame terminal as the battery side
  of the galvanometer, the frame acts as an efficient guard-wire.
  Another advantage of the construction here described is that
  electrostatic deflexion of the moving system is at the same
  time prevented, a matter of considerable importance when
  resistance tests with fairly large potential-differences are
  being made.
     A similar construction is, of course, applicable to shunt
  boxes.

        Limiting Sensitiveness of Thomson Galvanometers.
    At the Oxford meeting of the British Association (1894),
 Prof. Schuster read a paper “On the Construction of Delicate
 Galvanometers,” in which inquiry is made as to the smallest
 current that can be detected by a non-astatic instrument of
 1 ohm resistance, and controlled by a field of strength 0.17
 C.G.S. unit. The calculated minimum current depends on
the resolving power of the mirror employed, the smallest
angle observable being taken as   3. where A is the wave-length
 of light and d the diameter of the mirror. The result arrived
 at is that 1.5 x 10-" amperes is the smallest current that can
 be detected under the assumed conditions.
    Taking A as 5.9 × 10-" centimetres we find the minimum
 angle to be 2.95 x 10-" radians or about 6 1 seconds of arc;
this corresponds with 0.0593 division on a scale at 1000 divi
sions distance. Expressing Prof. Schuster's result in this
way we get 3-9 divisions per microampere as the limiting
sensibility of a non-astatic galvanometer of 1 ohm resistance
when controlled by a field of 0-17 C.G.S. unit, the cavity
within the coil being a sphere of 1 centimetre diameter. It
is interesting to notice that to obtain a deflexion of 200 divi
sions per microampere (a number one might fairly expect to
get from a good Thomson instrument having a period of
10 seconds and needles about a centimetre long) would
necessitate the controlling field of a non-astatic instrument
being reduced to less than one-fiftieth of the assumed value,
or to 0:003 C.G.S. unit.
   In his calculations Prof. Schuster had no need to take into
account the period of vibration of the suspended system, but
in the following treatment of the subject period is considered
an important factor, and the specific magnetism of the needle
is also taken into account. Further, the suspended system is
supposed astatic, but this is not essential, for a non-astatic
system with an adjustable control would lead to the same
results.
   The calculations in this section of the paper were made to
ascertain whether some unusually high records of galvano
meter tests which had been sent to us could possibly be correct.
The answer was in the affirmative.      A similar investigation
had previously been made relating to some instruments of the
d'Arsonval type, and this gave an answer in the negative.
The calculated maximum sensibility came out about 30 of the
published value. Subsequent tests made on an actual instru

ment gave a result about 30 of the published value, or about
two-thirds of the calculated maximum.
  In treating the subject mathematically the following as
sumptions are made :-
   (1) Clearance between coil and end of magnets 1 millimetre.
   (2) Mirror and stem of negligible inertia compared with
         that of magnets.
   (3) Perfect astaticism of needle. (Thickness negligible.)
   (4) Coil unlimited in size and of best shape as voltmeter.
   (5) Thickness of insulation on wire negligible.
   (6) Control of suspension negligible.
   (7) Deflecting field equal to field at centre of coil.
   Note.—All the assumptions, except (7), and perhaps (1),
will give too high a value for the calculated sensitiveness.

      With these results before us it is interesting to examine how
    nearly the limits here given have been approached in actual
   instruments.
      One galvanometer for which the dimensions of the magnets
    are known is that mentioned in line 9 of Table II.               In this
    instrument the magnets are 0.82 centimetre long, therefore
    l=0-41.        From Table VII. an instrument with such a needle
    and wound to have a resistance of 1 ohm should give about
    1350 divisions per microampere under the assumed conditions.
    On referring to Table II., line 9, we find the value of D/r? (the
    expression most suited for a high-resistance instrument with
    small coils) actually obtained to be 380, or little more than a
    quarter  (...)      the calculated possible value.

       1°rof. Ayrton and Mr. Mather on Galcanometers. 373
   Another comparison can be made in the case of
Mr. McKittrick's oscillograph, which has a needle of almost
microscopic dimensions. In this instrument l-0.053, and
we see from Table VII., that we might possibly get 150,000
divisions per microampere when the resistance is one ohm,
period 10 seconds, and scale-distance equals 1000 scale
divisions. Line 4 of Table II. gives the values 60,000 and
105,000 for D<U+017F>,” and D/r3 res Sectively. These numbers
approximate more closely to the theoretical values than those
for the Mudford galvanometer previously referred to, the
probable reason being that the needle of Mr. McKittrick's
instrument consists of a piece of soft iron placed in a very
strong magnetic field. The specific magnetism would therefore
be much greater than that of short permanent magnets in a
weak field such as used in controlling the needle of the
Mudford galvanometer. In all probability the value of a for
Mr. McKittrick's instrument would be two or three times as
great as the value used in calculating Table VII.
                           SECTION C.
  Long versus Short Period Galvanometers for Zero Methods.
   For rapidity and accuracy of working a short-period
instrument is certainly better than a long-period one, providing
its sensitiveness is as great. It is interesting, however, to
inquire whether, with the same galvanometer, it is more
expeditious to use a strong or a weak control, provided the
sentitiveness when strongly controlled is sufficient for the
purpose. For although the spot will move to its maximum
elongation, corresponding with a given want of balance, more
  uickly when strongly controlled, that elongation will be less
}. when a weak control is used. Hence it is possible that a
given small displacement of the spot from the zero position
may occur in a shorter time when the control is weak than
when it is strong, because such displacement is then a smaller
fraction of the whole.
    First applying general reasoning to the problem, we may
notice that the deflecting couple produced by a given want of
balance is initially independent of the control, and as the
inertia of the moving system is constant, the acceleration at the
beginning of the motion is the same whatever the control.
If f be this acceleration the space traversed by the spot in a
short time t is 4 ft”, and this is therefore independent of the
control, consequently for small displacements strong or weak
control makes no difference in the time it takes to see that a
want of balance exists.

374     Prof. Ayrton and Mr. Mather on Galvanometers.
   It is to be noted, however, that the weakly controlled
system will take longer to return to zero, so that a longer
wait is necessary before another test can be made. On the
other hand, should the sensitiveness of the strongly controlled
instrument be only just sufficient to get the desired accuracy,
then half a period must elapse before the want of balance can
be detected, whereas the weakly controlled instrument would     *
have moved over a greater distance in that time. Taking
the controls in the ratio of 4 to 1, and therefore periods as
1 to 2, the movement of the weakly controlled instrument
will be double that of the other in the case here considered.
In this instance therefore the long periodic time is advan
tageous because it will show a very small want of balance
more quickly, but the advantage is somewhat discounted by
the longer time occupied in the return to zero.
                        Undamped Motion.
   To consider the matter in further detail let us first take
the case of undamped simple harmonic motion. Assuming
the ratio of the controls to be as m” to 1, the periods will be
in the ratio of 1 to m.

   Draw two circles touching at A, centres at B and C, and of
radii in the ratio of 1 to m”. Draw lines BP and CQ making
angles 8 and y with AC and such that 8=my. The distances
from A of N and M, the projections on AC of P and Q
respectively, will then represent the displacements from zero
after a given time of the short and long period galvanometers
respectively. From the figure (to scale) it will be seen that
these are nearly equal when the time is, say, one-sixth of a
period of the quick-moving system. And even when the
time is one-fourth of the period of the strongly controlled
instrument, the difference in the displacements is not very

       To put the matter in another way, we may determine the
    relative times after which the spots will have moved appre
    ciably from the zero. A little consideration will show that
    these times will depend on the relation of the least visible
    movement to the maximum displacement produced by the
    want of balance it is necessary to detect. For example, if
    the sensitiveness of the short-period instrument is such as to
    give a fairly large movement of the spot for the given want
   of balance, then a perceptible movement will occur in a time
   which is a small fraction of its period, and this motion will
   take place in practically the same time as an equal motion of
   the spot of the long-period instrument. On the other hand,
   if the sensitiveness of the short-period instrument is only
   just sufficient to show the given want of balance when the
   spot reaches its maximum elongation, then half a period
   must elapse before the want of balance would be detected,
   and the more sensitive long-period instrument would have
   moved an equal distance in a shorter time. In this case,
   therefore, the more sensitive instrument would have a distinct
  advantage in quickness in showing the want of balance, but
  more time would be required for its return to zero before
  another test could be made.                    -
      To show the relative times under different conditions of

value consistent with the desired accuracy, e.g., the 1 in the
first column indicates that the instrument is only just sensi
tive enough to indicate the maximum permissible error in
balance ; the 2 in the first column denotes that the instrument
is twice as sensitive as absolutely necessary ; and the 3 that it
has three times the necessary sensibility &c. The numbers in
line 1 below the various values of m” show the relative times
required for the spot to move perceptibly, the time occupied by
the slow-moving instrument in moving over the minimum
perceptible distance being taken as unity. In column 2 line 1
we find the number 1:41, and this indicates that if the short
period instrument is only just sensitive enough to show the
maximum permissible want of balance, then, doubling the
sensitiveness by making the period V2 times as great, would
enable the want of balance to be detected in a shorter time,
the times being in the ratio of 1 to 1:41. Similarly for
column 3 line 1, increasing the period to twice that of the
short-period instrument and therefore increasing the sensi
tiveness four times would reduce the relative times to the
ratio of 1 to 1-5. When m equals 100 (or the sensitiveness
is increased ten thousand times, if such an increase were
possible) the relative times become 1 to 1-63, showing a com
paratively small extra diminution in time required to detect
a want of balance, although the sensibility is very largely
increased.
    The numbers in line 2 show that when the short-period
 instrument is twice as sensitive as is absolutely necessary the
gain in time required to detect the want of balance becomes
less, the ratio of the times being 1 to 1:06 when m” equals 2,
and only reducing to a value 1 to 1:11 when m” equals
 10,000. Subsequent lines show that when the short-period
 galvanometer is several times more sensitive than is absolutely
 necessary to obtain the desired accuracy, the gain in quickness
 in detecting a small error by weakening the control becomes
 unimportant, and so the small gain will be more than neu
 tralized by the longer time taken in the return to zero.

 greater than the corresponding term in the denominator, and
this indicates that the displacement of the slow-moving
instrument gains on that of the quick-moving one as the

   The above investigation teaches us that when we have a
galvanometer whose control can be readily altered and whose
sensitiveness can be easily made ample for the purpose of
the test, then for rapid working adjust the control so that the
sensitiveness is, say, two or three times as great as is alsolutely
necessary for the desired accuracy,

       XXXVII. The Anomalous Dispersion of Cyanin.
                        By R. W. Wood+.
INyºrº's                    on the anomalous dispersion of the
     aniline-dyes have been made, for the most part, by
means of solutions of these substances contained in prismatic
vessels, the dispersion of the solvent being eliminated by
means of a second fluid prism of the same angle, in contact
with and opposed to the first. Such prisms, when the solution
is at all concentrated, allow the passage of very little light,
and that close to the refracting edge. They are extremely
inconvenient to work with, and the phenomena are not very
easy to observe. Wernicket made some determinations of
the refractive index of solid fuchsin, and Pflüger f has lately
investigated a number of the dyes in the solid state. Both of
these investigations were made with prisms formed by allowing
an alcoholic solution to evaporate between a section of glass
tubing and a flat plate of glass. This method has great dis
advantages: it is practically impossible to get a perfect optical
surface, and the prism-angle is so small that the deviation of
the ray is very    J.        Pflüger was unable to obtain prisms
with an angle greater than 2', and stated that only about one
in forty could be used at all, owing to the formation of rills and
streaks on the surface.        Both of these methods seemed so
unsatisfactory that I have undertaken some experiments with
a view of preparing solid prisms of fairly large angle and
with perfect optical surfaces, that would allow of a more
accurate determination of the dispersion-curve.
   I first tried to find some solvent for the aniline capable of
solidifying, and had considerable success with Canada balsam,
and though this method was finally given up for a better one,
it seems worth while to outline some of the results obtained,
as they proved interesting in another way.
   Filtered Canada balsam was boiled down until a drop placed
on a slip of glass solidified on cooling. The aniline was then
added and a little of the hot solution daubed on a strip of hot
plate-glass. A similar strip, well heated, was lowered onto
this and pressed down into close contact along one edge, the
other being held up, squeezing the fluid into a thin prism of
two or three degrees. A prism of clear balsam was then
formed on the back of the glass strip to neutralize the effect
of the solvent, as is done in the case of fluid prisms. The
whole formed a solid rectangular piece, appearing thus in

 cross section. These prisms worked fairly well, and had a
 great advantage over the fluid ones in that they were per
 manent, compact, and could be used either
 vertically or |...i.         The rectangular
 trough with the diagonal partition, devised
 by Soret, cannot be used for showing the curved spectra by
 the method of crossed prisms, unless one has a telescope
 moving on a vertical circle. Balsam prisms coloured with
 different dyes are especially advantageous for exhibiting
 dichromatism, and it is on this account principally that I have
 brought them in. For showing this, however, it is best to
 dispense with the second prism of clear balsam, as the sepa
 ration of the transmitted colours by the action of the prism
 is an advantage. If we look at a brightly illuminated slit or
 a candle-flame through the thin edge of a prism stained with
 “Brilliant Green,” we see a very bright green image, and
 close to it a faint red one. On moving the prism along so as
 to increase the thickness of the transmitting layer, the green
 image fades very rapidly, leaving the red almost unaffected,
 and finally the red image is all that remains. This separation of
 the transmitted portions into two images renders the mecha
 nism of dichromatism much clearer than the usual method of
 showing it by the superposition of a number of flat plates of
 coloured glass.
    The balsam double prisms for anomalous dispersion were
 not quite what I wanted, as they were in reality nothing but
 solutions; and though the dispersion was much greater than
 anything I had obtained with alcoholic solutions, I sought a
 better method. To fuse the dye and press it out into a thin
 wedge between two pieces of plate-glass appeared to be the
 best line to work on, and I made a trial with cyanin. This
 proved to be a lucky choice, as it is the only suitable dye that
 I have found thus far, all the others decomposing at or below
the fusing-point. But with cyanin I succeeded after one or
two trials in preparing some admirable prisms, which yielded
results far ahead of anything that I could produce by any
of the other methods. From a piece of plate-glass 5 to
7 millim. in thickness a number of rectangular pieces are cut
measuring about 4 centim. Square. A pair of these plates are
carefully cleaned and a narrow strip of paper pasted along
and close to the edge of one. Along the opposite edge is
strewn a little train of cyanin crystals about 2 millim. wide.
The train should be     º     of uniform depth, and pushed into
a straight line with another piece of glass. Both plates are
now laid on a sheet of asbestos-board over a bunsen-burner,
and heated until the cyanin fuses. Just before the fusing

382                  Mr. R. W. Wood on the
point is reached the surface-colour of the crystals will change
from brilliant green to a purple plum-colour, which will be
the surface-colour of the cyanin after it has solidified again.
The crystals fuse at about 135°; and as soon as it is evident
that solid particles no longer remain, an edge of the other
plate must be dipped into the fluid and the plate carefully
lowered until the opposite edge is in contact with the paper
strip. Both plates should now be lifted together, and the
cyanin edge compressed in a vice. This is the critical point,
and the right amount of pressure can only be learned by ex
perience. If the pressure is too slight the fluid film will not
be squeezed out thin enough; if too great, the plates of glass
will bend, and a prism of variable angle will be produced. It
is best to experiment with plates of different sizes and with
paper strips of different thicknesses. After the plates have
cooled they can be removed from the vice and examined. If
 the prism is desired merely for purposes of illustration, the
 plates had best be left in contact, as they protect the prism
 from injury; but if measurements are desired and the angle
 of the prism required, the plates may be separated by a blow
 from a hammer struck on the edge of one of them. The
 cyanin prism will usually adhere to one or the other of the
plates, though sometimes half a perfect prism will stick to
each one; on rare occasions it will split into two layers, in
which case it must of course be rejected.
    I find that prisms of from 10' to 15' give the best results;
the optical quality of the surface can be determined by re
flecting the light from the collimator of a spectrometer, partly
from the cyanin and partly from the glass surface, the back of
the plate being rubbed over with a little grease to avoid con
fusion arising from the third image. There should appear in
the telescope two images of the slit, one white due to the
reflexion from the glass, the other yellow due to reflexion
from the cyanin. If the prism surface is curved, the yellow
image will be broad; but if it is found that by screening off
all but a strip of one or two millims. in width along the re
 fracting edge a fairly sharp image is produced, the prism
need not be rejected. By measuring l. angular distance
between these two images we can compute the prism-angle.
    I have not succeeded in producing    I. this method a prism
 sufficiently thin to transmit any appreciable amount of light
in the region of the absorption-band. But for observations
outside of this region I believe that far more accurate results
can be obtained than by the method employed by Wernicke
and Pflüger. A suitable prism having been formed, it should
be mounted on a black card provided with a narrow rectangular

                  Anomalous Dispersion of Cyanin.              383
  aperture in such a way that the refracting edge is in contact
  with one side of the aperture. This screens off all rays
  except those which pass through the cyanin. If the telescope
  of a spectrometer is directed towards the slit of the instrument
  on which is focussed an image of the sun or the electric arc
  and the prism put in place, a most beautiful anomalous
  spectrum will be seen, bluish green being the least deviated,
  followed by blue and violet, a wide dark space, orange and
  red. I have even succeeded in projecting this spectrum so
  that it could be seen by a large audience. To do this requires
  sunlight, a broad beam of which should be focussed on a narrow
  slit, and a projecting lens so placed as to throw an image of
  this slit on a screen 3 or 4 metres distant. The image of
  the slit will of course be 3 or 4 centim. wide on the screen.
  On placing the cyanin prism in front of the lens the ano
  malous spectrum will appear, considerably blurred and rather
  dim, but clearly recognizable in a sufficiently dark room. By
  carefully selecting the prism I have succeeded in producing
  on the screen a spectrum measuring about 15 centims, in
  length, showing colours in the order green, blue, and red
  with perfect distinctness.
     The oppositely curved portions of the spectrum seen by the
  method of crossed prisms, and described by Kundt, can be
  shown very nicely with a prism of solid cyanin mounted on a
  black card as already described. The slit of a spectrometer
  should be covered with tinfoil with the exception of about a
  millim., and sun or electric light focussed on the clear space.
  A low-dispersion prism (best a hollow prism filled with
  water) should be set on the table of the instrument and the
   narrow continuous spectrum brought into the field of the
   telescope. On holding a 15 cyanin prism in front of the
   objective of the telescope with its refracting edge horizontal,
   the yellow portion of the spectrum will be removed, and the
   remaining portions curved in opposite directions, the curves
   being identical with the dispersion-curve plotted from direct
  observation, except that in the latter case the spectrum is
  normal.
      The great advantage of prisms prepared in this way over
   those made by evaporation is their large angle and excellent
   optical surface. Pflüger worked with prisms varying from
   one to one and a half minutes, two minutes being about the
   maximum angle he could produce satisfactorily. It appearing
   probable that a much more accurate determination of the dis
    persion could be obtained by means of prisms of much larger
:
    angle, I arranged a piece of apparatus as follows:–The light
    of the sun from a heliostat was focussed on the slit of a very

384                   Mr. R. W. Wood on the
large direct-vision spectroscope. The length of this instru
ment was nearly 2 metres and the dispersion very high. The
eyepiece was removed and the slit of a Geneva Society spec
trometer with verniers reading to 10" was placed in the focal
plane.    By turning a tangent-screw on the spectroscope the
entire spectrum could be made to pass across the slit of the
spectrometer. This arrangement permitted the use of approxi
 mately monochromatic light of any wave-length desired and
 of great intensity. The method of observing was as follows:–
 A reading being taken on the slit, the cyanin prism was
 n. and the deviation noted. The cyanin prism was
 then removed and a glass diffraction-grating put in its place,
 and the wave-length of the light determined. The tangent
 screw was now turned       º         a fraction of a revolution, and
 a second observation made ; and in this way about a dozen
 points were determined on each side of the absorption-band.
 A second set of observations was then made by opening a
 small aperture in the black screen near the refracting edge of
 the prism. By this arrangement the direct image of the slit
 and the deviated image formed by the prism could be observed
 at the same time and the distance between them measured by
 means of a filar-micrometer in the eyepiece. No deviation
 was produced by the glass plate on which the prism was
 mounted. The results are given in the following table, and
 are shown graphically in a curve.

part of the curve. Pflüger's work has shown that the curve is
undoubtedly continuous, and prisms prepared by his method
appear to be the only ones suited for investigations in this
portion of the spectrum; for I have not yet succeeded, even
with very strong pressure in a vice, in squeezing melted
cyanin into films thin enough to transmit yellow light.
    It is difficult to get accurate readings close to the absorption
 band, since the only part of the prism which allows the passage
 of rays in this part of the spectrum is a strip only a small
 fraction of a millim. wide along the refracting edge, the prism
 acting as a narrow aperture, and giving Fraunhofer diffraction
 phenomena of the first class. Instead of a sharp image of the
 slit we have a broad diffused band which cannot be accurately
 set on the cross-hairs of the eyepiece. I have           ..".
 indicated by question-marks those values on the curve which
 I regard as not accurately determined. Comparison of the
 dispersion-curve figured above with the one given by Pflüger
 in his last paper" shows very close agreement on the red side
 of the absorption-band, while on the blue side his curve runs
  a little higher than mine. It is of course very probable
  that the optical properties of cyanin solidified from fusion are
  not the same as as when crystallized from alcoholic solution.
  The change in the surface-colour indicates that this is so ;
  consequently prisms prepared by the two different methods
  could hardly be expected to yield identical results. The
  surface-colour, moreover, changes on exposure to the air,
  being an orange-yellow when the glass plate is first removed
  and changing to a plum-colour in the course of a day or two.
     A determination of the extinction-curve of cyanin films
  prepared from fused crystals will of course be necessary before
  anything definite regarding the difference in the optical pro
  perties can be said. Facilities for such an investigation are
  not at my disposal at the present moment; but I hope in the
  near future to make a complete study of the optical constants
  in their relation to the Ketteler-Helmholtz dispersion formula,
  as has been done by Pflüger. The superiority and large angle
  of the prisms prepared from the fused dye make it seem worth
  while to repeat Pflüger’s work on this particular substance,
  particularly as he found some discrepancies in the extreme
  violet.

XXXVIII. On the Circulation of the Residual Gaseous Matter
   in a Crookes Tube. By ALAN A. CAMPBELL SwisToN*.
     HERE appears to be generally some doubt as to the way
       in will the particles or atoms that form the cathode
rays in a Crookes tube return again to the cathode. It is
obvious that they must return, as otherwise they would all
become collected at one end of the tube, and the cathode
would soon be surrounded by an absolute vacuum. By some
it has been supposed that the atoms return by ordinary dif
fusion in the intervals between the succeeding electrical
discharges; by some that they creep back along the inner
surface of the glass walls of the ... by others that they
return during a discharge through the space between the
cathode-rays and the glass. Further, there is the question
whether the returning atoms carry any portion of the positive
electricity from the anode to the cathode, similarly as part at
any rate of the negative electricity is believed to be carried
from the cathode to the anodic portion of the tube by the
cathode-ray atoms.
    In his 1891 Presidential Address to the Institution of
Electrical Engineers, Sir William Crookes described a tube
which was divided into two halves by a diaphragm pierced
with two small apertures Near each aperture was mounted
a small wheel with vanes to detect and show the direction of
any stream of atoms that might pass through. It was found
that when the cathode was caused to project rays through one
 aperture, the rotation of the wheel at the other aperture showed
 the atoms in the act of returning.
    In this tube, however, both anode and cathode were on the
 same side of the diaphragm, the anode being behind the
 cathode. So the experiment cannot be said to decide the
 existence of a true anode-stream, but merely to demonstrate
 that the action of the cathode-stream was to create a differ
 ence of gaseous pressure in the two halves of the tube which
 relieved itself by a current of atoms through the spare aper
 ture in the diaphragm.
    The writer, with the assistance of Mr. J. C. M. Stanton
 and Mr. H. Tyson Wolff, has investigated the matter further
 by means of a series of tubes, one of which is illustrated in
 fig. 1. In this tube, which is very highly exhausted, we
 have as two electrodes a concave aluminium cup and an
 aluminium plate placed opposite to one another, as in an
  ordinary focus-tube. As º be seen, there is also a supple
 mental wire electrode at one side. Inside the tube is a very

 rectly upon the vanes, or can be moved back to the position
 shown in full lines in the illustration, when the vanes are
 quite out of the cathode-stream. When the wheel is in the
 former position the tube acts exactly as an ordinary Crookes
 electric radiometer-tube, the wheel rotating one way or
another in the direction of the cathode discharge as the con
 cave cup or the flat-plate electrode is made cathode, the
 rotation being much more rapid in the latter than in the
 former case.
    On the other hand, if the wheel is moved well out of the
 cathode-stream, provided the exhaustion is high enough, it is
 found to rotate in the opposite direction to the   ...
that is to say, in the direction that indicates an atomic stream
from anode to cathode round the outside of the cathode-stream.
The rotation will only take place with high exhaustion, and is
never so rapid as in the previous case when the vanes were
in the cathode-stream; but it is faster and faster the higher
the exhaustion, and at very high vacua the speed is very con
siderable.    The wheel rotates whether the concave or the flat
plate is made cathode, but in either case in a direction oppo
site to what it did when in the cathode-stream.
   Very little electric power is necessary to show this effect.
With a sufficiently high vacuum a small Wimshurst machine,
passing so little current through the tube that scarcely any
fluorescence is visible, will cause the wheel to rotate at a
speed of many turns per second ; and rotation can even be
  roduced by the mere approach of two oppositely charged
 eyden-jars to the terminals of the tube.
   Further experiment appears to show that the rotation is
really due to a stream returning round about the cathode
stream from anode to cathode, and that the atoms or particles
of which this stream consists are positively charged. In the
experiments so far described the anode was also the anti
 cathode; and it is obvious that the stream might not be truly
 an anode-stream, but merely a reflected or splashed cathode
 stream. It is, however, found that if the flat plate used as
 anode be earthed, or if the plate be disconnected from the
 electrical source of power, and used merely as an anti-cathode,
 the spare electrode already alluded to opposite to the wheel
 being employed as anode, the wheel refuses to rotate, though
 rotation recommences immediately in the first case when the
 earth-connexion is removed, and in the latter case when the
 anode and anti-cathode are connected together. This appears
 to be fairly conclusive evidence that it is a stream projected
from the anode that causes the rotation of the wheel.          It

390 Mr. A. A. Campbell Swinton on the Circulation of
might, however, be argued that this stream, though coming
from the anode, is in reality a cathode-stream due to oscil
lations in the electric discharge causing the anode to be at
times negatively charged. Against this view it should be
stated that the effects are produced quite as well by the silent
discharge from a small Wimshurst machine as with Ruhmkorff
coil discharges. It has further been noted that the wheel
rotates in the proper direction with either the flat plate or the
concave cup employed as cathode, the other being used as
anode; and any cathode-rays given off by the concave cup
would be concentrated, and could not therefore reach the
wheel in the position in which it is used to show the stream
from the anode.    Again, it might be supposed that the ro
tation is due to heat-radiation from the anti-cathode.    In this
case, however, the rotation should occur when the side anode
is employed, which, as mentioned, is not the case. Further,
even when such powerful discharges are used as to make the
anti-cathode visibly red hot, the rotation of the wheel ceases
almost immediately the current is interrupted, the movement
that continues being obviously due to the momentum of the
wheel.
   The experiments therefore appear to establish the existence
at high exhaustions of a true anode-stream which travels from
the anode to the cathode, just as does the cathode-stream
from the cathode to the anti-cathode, the anode-stream passing
round the exterior of the cathode-stream at a considerably
lower velocity than the latter, but at a greater and greater
velocity the higher the exhaustion.
   It also appears that while, as is well known, the cathode
stream is negatively charged, the anode-stream is charged
positively.
   For the purpose of ascertaining this a tube fitted with
exploring-poles, as used by Sir William Crookes, was em
ployed. These poles were, however, somewhat differently
arranged to any described in Sir W. Crookes's papers, while
the exhaustion, which was taken to the degree required for
Röntgen-ray work in which the negative dark space appears
to fill the whole tube, was probably much higher than that
Sir W. Crookes employed. Such a tube is illustrated in
fig. 2, and contains the usual aluminium cathode-cup and
anode-plate. The exploring-poles consist of aluminium wires
tipped with platinum plates enclosed in glass tubes, which are
blown out into small bulbs at the free extremities so as to
contain and shield the platinum plates, the bulbs having, how
ever, each an aperture exposing the platinum on one side.
One platinum plate is arranged just opposite to the centre of

       the Residual Gaseous Matter in a Crookes Tube.      391
the cathode-cup, and the aperture in its containing glass bulb
faces the cathode so that the cathode-rays can impinge upon
the platinum. The other and shorter pole has its platinum
plate well to one side of the cathode, º has the aperture in
its glass cup turned away from the cathode towards the anode.
                              Fig. 2.
 Experiments were conducted with this tube highly exhausted
 and excited by means of an induction-coil, the  º       of the
 two exploring-poles being ascertained by means of a quadrant
 electrometer. With the aluminium cup as cathode and the
 plate as anode, the longer exploring-pole, which has its bare
 extremity facing the cathode-stream, was found invariably to
 be charged negatively, while the other and shorter exploring
 pole was found always to be charged positively. This was

 392     Mr. A. A. Campbell Swinton on the Circulation of
 found to be more and more distinctly the case the higher the
 exhaustion.
    It seems therefore that at high vacua at any rate some
 portion of the positive electricity passing through the tube is
 carried by the positively charged atoms or particles that form
 the anode-stream. Very probably at lower exhaustions the
 electric discharge passes through the tube chiefly by an inter
 change of electrical charges from molecule to molecule on the
 Grothuss chain principle. At very high exhaustions, however,
 when the mean free path becomes considerable, this may cease
 to be the case, at any rate to a large degree; and there may
 be to some extent a regular and complete circulation of the
 positively and negatively charged atoms, some of which may
 make the entire journey from anode to cathode, or vice versö,
 and deliver up their charges not by interchange with other
 gaseous atoms, but by direct convexion to the electrodes of
 opposite sign.
                              Fig. 3.
   It may be mentioned that for showing the movements of
the streams a tube of the form illustrated in fig. 1 is not
essential, the anode-stream being equally well marked in a
tube of the ordinary globular form, provided the wheel is
mounted so as to be half contained within a glass cup arranged
so as to prevent the stream acting equally and oppositely upon
the vanes upon diametrically opposite sides of the wheel, as
shown in fig. 3. Further, it is not necessary to employ the
sliding adjustment for the wheel, as the effects can be shown
equally well by means of two separate tubes, one with its

             N the discussion which followed my former paper on this
                subject some objection was taken to the use of a non
          conducting substance, i. e. mica, for the vanes of the mill
         which was used to detect the circulation of the ultra-gaseous
          matter, it being suggested by Professor Boys that the rotation
           roduced might be the result of electrification of the vanes.
         }. was further suggested by Mr. Appleyard that gilding the
         vanes, so as to make them conductive, might modify the
         effect.              -
             Mr. Wolff has now constructed for me a tube similar to
         fig. 1 of my former paper, but with the mica vanes gilded and
         mounted on a brass cap revolving upon a steel needle-point
         connected with a wire and terminal, so that the vanes can
         readily be earthed.
             In this condition, and with the vanes so placed as to be
         outside the cathode-stream, it is found that this wheel behaves
         in a similar manner to the former non-conducting and insu
         lated wheel. It shows a greater tendency to assume a position
         of stability, due evidently to electrostatic induction; but
         though this renders it sometimes rather troublesome in starting,
         still when once under weigh it will continue to rotate as long
         as the tube is excited. It will occasionally, when starting,
         make a few reverse revolutions, due probably to electrostatic
         influence and momentum, and also possibly to eddy-currents

in the residual gaseous matter; but it is found that when it
does this it invariably reverses its rotation almost immediately,
and proceeds to rotate more and more rapidly in the direction
that indicates a stream of residual gaseous matter passing
from the anode to the cathode. Usually, after one or two
oscillations, it starts immediately to rotate in this direction.
   An electrometer connected to the wheel through the pivot
and needle-point shows that the vanes are always positively
electrified.
   In order further to investigate the matter, I have had con
structed another form of radiometer-tube, as shown in the
accompanying illustration. Here the vanes (of mica) are
inclined, and the axis is parallel to the line joining the cathode
and anode. The wheel thus rotates in a plane at right angles
to  the cathode- and anode-streams; and it is difficult to see
 how electrification of the vanes should in any way assist its
 rotation either in one direction or in another.
    The wheel is arranged so that the vanes are all outside the
 cathode-stream, and when the tube is excited it is found inva

riably to rotate in a direction indicating a stream from anode
to cathode. Concave aluminium cups are used for both
electrodes, and the direction of rotation of the wheel is found
immediately to reverse when the positive and negative con
nexions are transposed.
    These experiments consequently confirm the hypothesis
suggested in my former paper, that at very high exhaustions
there exists a molecular or atomic stream from anode to cathode
which carries a positive charge and travels at considerable
velocity outside of the opposite cathode-stream.
  XL. On the Possible Effects of Solar Magnetization on
    Periodic Variations of Terrestrial Magnetism. By ARTHUR
    SchustER, F.R.S.*
 1.  IN      the various attempts which have been made to
            establish a periodicity in the elements of terrestrial
 magnetism, depending on solar rotation, it has been uni
 formly assumed that the periodic time is that of the synodic
 revolution of the sun. This seems plausible at first sight,
 but on closer investigation it is found not to be true.
    There are two principal periods which might be caused by
 a transversely magnetized sun, one being of about 25 days
 and equal to the time of sidereal revolution, while the other,
 and more important, has a time of 29°1 days, being longer
 than the synodical revolution by about as much as that is
 longer than the sidereal revolution.
     Minor periods are produced by the eccentricity of the
 earth's orbit, and among these one has a time equal to that of
 the synodical revolution. But as the amplitude of this period
 amounts only to about the thousandth part of the amplitude
 of the principal period, it may for all practical purposes be
 neglected.
     If it can be proved, therefore, that the elements of terrestrial
 magnetism have a period equal to that of the synodic revo
 lution of the sun, while the sidereal period is absent, it would
 follow that this cannot be due to a direct effect of solar mag
 netization. At present, however, the so-called 26-day period
 rests on a feeble and altogether insufficient basis, which is still
 further weakened by the absence of any rera causa for the
 period.
     The reason why the solar revolution does not produce the
  effect which is commonly ascribed to it, lies in the fact that
                      * Communicated by the Author.

                                                                      º

 during the synodic revolution, the position of the earth’s axis
 relative to the radius-vector drawn from the sun to the earth
is altered. The true periods are those produced by a combi
nation of the annual and synodic periods.
   Lord Kelvin has already discussed the effect produced
by a sun magnetized in a direction parallel to his axis of
rotation ; and I may therefore, in the first instance, confine
myself to the discussion of effects due to a uniform transverse
magnetization, neglecting the inclination of the solar equator
to the ecliptic. The more general problem will be treated
afterwards.
   In fig. 1 let OT be the direction of the radius-vector drawn
                               Fig. 1.
from the sum to the earth, and O E the normal to the ecliptic.
If the sun rotates in space, the component of magnetic force
resolved along O T will depend on the angle between that
direction and the axis of the sun's magnetization.           If n be
the mean angular velocity of the earth round the sun and k
that of the sun round his axis, the required angle will,
neglecting the ellipticity of the earth's path, increase as (k - m)t.
The component F, of magnetic force resolved along OT will
therefore be given by
                   F =2 cos(k–n)t–8)/r",
where r is the radius-vector and 8/(k-m) represents the time
when the north-repelling pole of the sun crosses the radius
vector. The component along O N drawn at right angles to
O T is                                                        -
                    F, - sin ((k–n)t–8)/r".
   As the earth moves in space its axis O P will move relative
to OT, in such a way that P will describe a circle clockwise
round O E. The problem consists in finding the components
of the vectors F. and F, at right angles to and in the plane of
the equator.    If P is the pole at any time, the magnetic force

        on Periodic Variations of Terrestrial Magnetism.     397
along O P will be
                        F1 cos PT-1-F, cos P.N.
 If M M' is the equator corresponding to the pole P, and a
 great circle be described through EP, the point of intersection
 H between this circle and M M' will be that point which has
a right ascension of 90°. The components of magnetic force
along OH will be
              F, sin PT cos TPH + F, sin PN cos NPH.
Similarly, the components of force in the direction of a point
of right ascension 180° are
              F, sin PTsin TPH–F, sin PN sin NPH.
   At the winter solstice the pole P will be on the great
circle ET, so that if time is measured from that epoch, the
angle PET will bent. Calling e the inclination of the ecliptic
to the equator represented in the figure by EP, the above
components of force, with the help of easy reductions in the
spherical triangles N P E and EPT, become
      sin e (Fi cosnt-FF, sin nt) along O P,
       cos e (F, cos nt + F, sin nt) along O H (R.A. = 90°),
             (F, sin nt–F, cos nt) along O'H' (R.A. = 180°).
    Substituting for F, and F, their values, the magnetic com
ponents finally become
sin e
 27.3 [cos  (kt-8) +3 cos((k—2n)t–8)] along O P,
‘...[cos (st–B)+3 cos(2-2)-3)] along oh (R.A.-90°),
* [sin (kt-8)—3 sin ((k–2n)t-8)] along O H' (R.A. = 180°).
   It is thus seen that there are two periods having for time
27/k and 27/k–2n respectively; the first of these periods is
the sidereal time of solar revolution, the second has an am
plitude three times as large, and is longer than 27/(k-n), the
period of synodical revolution. The latter is , completely
absent. If we take the synodic revolutions to be 27 days,
the periods introduced have a time of 25°14 and of 29:15
days.
   3. We may now treat the problem in its most general

directions. We choose for these directions O E, OA, and O B,

OP and O E.; B is the sun's ascending node. The three

position of the following five systems:–
   (a) A fixed sphere permanently magnetized at right angles
to the ecliptic with moment cos y cos 8. The effect of such a
 sphere has been discussed already by Lord Kelvin. If the
north-repelling pole is above the ecliptic, the result will be a

     If the magnetic axis of the sun nearly coincides with his
  axis of rotation, the first term is the only important one. If,
 on the other hand, the sun were transversely magnetized, the
  most important period introduced by the eccentricity would
 have a time 27/k–3n, or of about 3i:7 days. The amplitude
 of the synodic period having a time 27/(k-n) is quite insig
 nificant, for A=5°28' and e=do, so that e sin A is less than
  º      this is only about the thousandth part of the amplitude
 of the leading period produced by the rotation of a trans
 versely magnetized sun; and it may therefore well be said
 that #. synodic period is practically absent.
    4. It remains to discuss the effects of those magnetic forces
 which act in the equator along directions which are fixed in
 space, and which now must be referred to axes fixed in the
 earth. If the force is constant as in the simple case discussed
 by Lord Kelvin, a periodicity with a time equal to the sidereal
 day will result; if the forces themselves are variable, other
 periodicities will be produced.
    If pt represents stellar time, the hour-angle of a star having
 right ascension a will be pt—a ; unit-force directed to a star of
 zero declination and right ascension a may be decomposed
into three components which, if u denotes the colatitude, are
          sin u cos (pt—a) acting vertically upwards,
          cos u cos (pt—a) acting towards the North, and
          sin (pt—a) acting towards the East.
    We obtain the solution of our problem by making a equal
to 90° or 180° respectively, and multiplying each compo
nent by the intensity of the forces which have been found to
act towards points of the sky having these right ascensions.
Neglecting i. inclination of the solar axis and the eccentricity
of the earth's orbit, it is found that all terms are of the form
cos act cospt or cos (k—2nt) cos pt. The periodic times are
therefore 27/p + k, 2T/p—k, 2T/p—k + 2n, 27/p + k—2n. It
will be remembered that 27/p represents the sidereal day,
2T/1: the sidereal revolution of the sun, and 27t/n the year.
These four ºrigi: measured in solar days have a time of
23h 1:3", 24' 55'4", 24h 46.9", and 23, 8:6". These varia
tions are characterized by the fact that the amplitude of the

easterly force is the same all over the earth, while the ampli
tudes of the vertical and northerly components vary respec
tively as the cosine and sine of the latitude.
   5. The above investigation has been confined to the case
where the sun acts like a homogeneously magnetic sphere.
There is no difficulty in extending the calculations to any
magnetization. But it must be remembered that if the
magnetic potential of the sun is referred to his axis of rotation
and expressed in a series of spherical harmonics, it is only
the forces due to the terms giving a uniform magnetization
which vary inversely as the cube of the distance, the other
terms varying with the higher powers. Forces which depend
on the next terms, and vary inversely as the fourth powers,
must, if they be of equal magnitude at the distance of the earth
with those due to uniform magnetization, have magnitudes at
the sun's surface which are more than 200 times greater than
these. Hence if there are any appreciable effects at the
distance of the earth due to the higher terms, these terms
would be paramount at the sun, whose magnetization, there
fore, would have to be of an entirely different character from
that of the earth.
   For the present we are justified in leaving that possibility
out of account, and limiting the investigation, as has been
done, to the case of a homogeneously magnetized sphere.
    XLI. On Phosphorescence. By HERBERT JACKsoN *.
IT is not possible in one lecture on phosphorescence to
      give any historical sketch which shall do justice to the
work of those who have made a study of the phenomena.
In a list of the names of the many who have enriched the
subject with facts and with theories, those of Pliny, Albertus
Magnus, Robert Boyle, Canton, Becquerel, Stokes, and
Crookes stand out most prominently. Any attempt to make
a sketch of our knowledge of phosphorescence and fluores
cence must be to a very large extent an adaption of the work
and of the views of these masters.
   The phenomena themselves may be divided into two main
classes—those in which the evolution of light is associated
with chemical change, and those in which there is no evi
dence of such direct alteration.             In the first class the
commonest instances are connected with the process of
oxidation. Examples of this kind are numerous. It is
hardly possible to take any very easily oxidizable substance

Meeting of the British Association at Bristol, Sept. 12, 1898.

  and to fail to get some evolution of light. Phosphorus,
 sodium and potassium, ether, many aldehydes, and a host of
 organic compounds may be cited as instances. The experi
 mental illustrations of these are not, however, suited to an
 audience of more than a very few. The same may be said
 of the examples of animal and vegetable phosphorescence.
 It is proposed therefore to deal more especially with the
 second class, and to limit the experiments to the cases where
 the light given out is visible and not of such a character as
 to necessitate the use of a photographic plate. This evolu
 tion of light may occur in varying conditions. In instances
 such as solutions of quinine and fluorescein and many solids,
 of which thallene is a good example, the duration of the
 Phosphorescence is so short that it may be said to last only
 While light is acting upon them. Balmain's luminous paint
 is an illustration of the persistence of the phosphorescent
 light.   With many minerals, notably some fluorspars and
felspars, light is given out when they are slightly heated or
in some cases only crushed.
    The most brilliant phenomena are those which can be
studied when many bodies are excited with electric dis
charges inside a Crookes's vacuum-tube, while outside of a
slight modification of his focus-tube fairly brilliant phos
phorescence can be obtained by the action of Röntgen rays
 upon several substances—notably upon some of the platino
cyanides.
    In dealing with the whole subject of phosphorescence with
the view of attempting to connect all the various phenomena
 together, it is convenient to divide it into the nature of the
 substance giving out the light, the nature of the light given
out, and the nature of the exciting causes.
   With regard to the nature of the substance either very
much or little might be said : very much from the details of
numerous experiments with a great number of compounds;
but little from the point of view of general principle. The
most important question in this respect is probably the ques
tion of the relation of phosphorescence to the purity of the
substance giving out the light. Experiments with carefully
prepared compounds of many metals make it clear that not a
few substances can be made to exhibit phosphorescence when
they are so free from impurities that none can be detected by
any analytical methods. In some cases, however, there        is
either no light given out under     . of    the conditions for
exciting phosphorescence, or the light is so feeble that it is
necessary to add impurities so as to obtain a suitable mole
cular condition for rendering a substance responsive to excite

ment. That the light given out is not to be ascribed to the
impurity has been determined by many experiments with
varying impurities and careful examination with the spec
troscope. The further consideration of these physical and
chemical conditions is better left until the other two aspects
of the subject have been dealt with.
   If a large number of observations be made of the phos
phorescent lights given out by compounds of such metals,
for example, as sodium, potassium, calcium, strontium and
barium, magnesium, and aluminium, it is hardly possible to
avoid coming to the conclusion that the colours of these
lights have a close resemblance to the colours of the lines and
bands seen in the various spectra of the different metals and
some of their compounds.      Examination by the spectroscope
confirms this conclusion in several instances.       It is not
suggested that the lines of the metals and the bands of their
compounds are reproduced in the spectra of the phosphores
cent lights. What is noticeable is that the maxima of light
are grouped about these bands and lines, fading away from
them and extending to other parts so that a more or less con
tinuous spectrum is seen with positions of greatest brilliancy.
In the case of some specimens of lime these positions are
well defined, and in some kinds of fluorspar the green and
some red bands are well seen either when the fluorspar is
heated or when it is excited by discharge in vacuo. The
questions of exact coincidence and of the shifting of the
positions of the maxima of brightness seen with different
compounds of the same metal need not be considered here.
The intention is only to emphasize the similarity between the
phosphorescent spectra of several metallic compounds and
the spectra of these compounds, or of the metals in them,
obtained in other ways.
   In experimenting with phosphorescent compounds it is
frequently noticed that specimens of the same substance in
apparently the same state of purity give different colours.
Confining attention for the present to lime, as a very
infusible substance easily obtained in a state of purity, what
follows will be made clearer by a brief consideration of the
spectrum of the coloured flame produced by holding some
compound of calcium, e.g. calcium chloride, in the flame of
a bunsen-burner.
   The spectroscope breaks this red flame up into red,
orange, and green bands and a blue line. For the moment
the suggestion may be taken that these differently coloured
bands are indications of the existence in the flame of groups
of particles of calcium compounds of varying degrees of

             Mr. H. Jackson on Phosphorescence.            405
complexity, the red being related to more complex groups,
the orange to less, and so on. It seemed not unlikely that it
might be possible by preparing lime from a great many
calcium salts to obtain separate specimens which might pre
serve in the solid state some relation in their own molecular
complexity to that of the salts from which they were obtained,
or the conditions of decomposition of the different calcium
salts might impress upon the residual limes different
characters of molecular structure. The preparation of about
350 specimens of lime showed that it was quite possible to
get specimens some of which phosphoresced red, some orange
red, some orange, others green, and some blue. Examination
of their phosphorescent lights with the spectroscope showed,
as referred to before, that the maxima of brilliancy in their
spectra were grouped about the bands and lines of the usual
spectrum of calcium oxide. The details of the preparation
of these specimens of lime are too elaborate to enter
into here, nor is it possible to do more than just to refer
to their varying densities and different rates of hydration.
Out of the number of specimens tried the most satisfac
tory were analysed to make sure that it was really lime
and only lime which was being dealt with in each case.
In general terms it may be said that the most compli
cated organic salts of calcium yielded the best attempts at
lime giving blue phosphorescence, simpler bodies gave green,
while the best orange was obtained from Iceland-spar and
the red from specially prepared calcium carbonate. That
lime yielding a blue colour was obtained from highly com
plicated organic salts does not contradict the former sugges
tion that perhaps it is really of simpler molecular structure
than the others. Chemists are familiar with the conception
that the complexity in structure arising from the massing
of many molecules together in groups is probably often
greater in bodies of apparently simple chemical composition
than in those of a much more highly complicated nature.
   The colours seen in the specimens of lime shown are not
pure. In each one the other colours are present; thus the
orange contains also the red, green, and blue, only these are
masked by the greater proportion of the one colour. Com
pare, for example, the light obtained from a vacuum-tube
containing the gas helium. In this case the colour is yellow,
although the spectrum contains beautiful red, green, and blue
lines.  If the different colours are related to varying mole
cular complexity in the substances, then it might be said that
the lime showing a green light contains a large proportion of
groupings of such a nature as to be capable of oscillating in a

way to give rise to green light, and in like manner for the
red, orange, and blue specimens. Whether it will be possible
or is in the nature of things to separate out the different
kinds in a state of purity can only be decided by further
experiment.
   The examples of different forms of lime have been so far
exhibited only under the conditions obtaining in a high vacuum
with an electric discharge. Before trying to show the points
in common between these phenomena and the phenomena of
phosphorescence in other conditions, it may be as well to
consider briefly the character of the action in a high vacuum.
The suggestion which follows is not intended to be anything
but an imperfect attempt to bring all the phenomena of phos
phorescence into line with one another.                         -
   When a discharge passes through a vacuum there can be
little doubt that the transferring medium is the residuum of
gas in that partial vacuum. If the particles of this gas behave
as visible masses are seen to do, they are probably attracted
or are driven to the electrode at high potential. Receiving
the same kind of charge as this electrode, they fly off from it
in that charged condition.                                    -
   But if these particles consist of more than one unit, each
unit, after the group has travelled a certain distance from the
electrode, must repel each other unit in the same way as the
whole little group was repelled from the electrode. If, how
ever, the units making up the group are held together by
that something which is called chemical attraction, a condition
of strain is set up in which the electrical repulsion is striving
to overcome the chemical attraction. Travelling unimpeded
through the high vacuum, this condition of strain would be
maintained until the charged group met with something
capable of discharging it. At that moment of discharge the
chemical attraction would assert itself; there would be a
rushing together of the units composing the group, and an
over-rushing, whereby oscillations would be set up. These
oscillations, considered as blows or pulses either directly or
aethereally transferred to a substance, would set it in turn
oscillating in a manner fitted to its own molecular structure;
and its oscillations would in their turn give rise to the undu
lations which appeal to our eyes as the phosphorescent light.
If instead of the discharge taking place on a substance capable
of responding to and absorbing most of the energy of the con
sequent oscillations it were to occur on glass, platinum, or
any of the materials which have been employed, it is con
ceivable that the oscillations would appear as short aethereal
waves, or in other words as Röntgen rays. In the case of a

              Mr. H. Jackson on Phosphorescence.             407.
low vacuum, or of no vacuum at all, the charged particles
would discharge themselves against the intervening gas, which
would in its turn respond to the rapid oscillation, and give out
its own particular coloured light. The expression “short
aethereal waves” is used intentionally; for if there should be
forthcoming experimental evidence of the complex molecular
structure of a gas, it is reasonable to suppose that in a high
vacuum, with consequently a high potential at the electrode,
the internal electrical repulsion in a group would tend to a
dissociation resulting finally in the simplest form of system
capable of separate existence in those conditions. It might
be expected that the oscillation-frequency of so simple a
system would be very high.
   Here it may be stated that this comes to practically the
same thing as Sir William Crookes's original conception of
radiant matter.
   Leaving the method of electrical excitation in vacuo for
obtaining phosphorescence, we may now turn to light as a
source of oscillations. For the sake of simplicity, it will be
best to continue the experiments with the same substance,
viz. Hºme. If this body be exposed to the light of the sun, of
the electric arc, of a hydrogen flame, and of a great many
other substances in a state of vigorous combustion, a phospho
rescent effect is obtained, feeble in comparison with the results
in vacuo, but apparently similar in kind. The best light for
inducing the phosphorescence is the spark from a fairly
powerful coil with a leyden-jar in circuit. Many specimens
of lime go on giving out light for a considerable time after
exposure. A cylinder of lime such as is used in the pro
duction of the lime-light glows quite visibly when it is rotated
before a jar-spark.
    The light from the sun is not so active in inducing this
 glow; but with suitable arrangements a fairly visible result
 can be obtained. The colour of the glow from most lime
 made from limestones is an orange-red becoming a golden
 orange when the lime is heated. The introduction of glass,
 mica, or Iceland-spar between the spark and the lime cuts
 off the glow at once, since these bodies are opaque to the
 undulations to which lime of this kind responds. Quartz,
 rock-salt, and selenite are quite transparent.
    It is found that the different forms of lime which have
 already been exhibited in vacuum-tubes yield, when exposed
 to the jar-spark, their specially coloured phosphorescent glows.
 But these are difficult to see; they are very faint when pure
 specimens of lime are used.       However, there is a way out of
 the difficulty. The <U+017F>aint light scarcely visible at the ordinary

408           Mr. H. Jackson on Phosphorescence.
temperature may be increased very considerably by raising the
temperature. As an extreme instance of this a specimen of
calcium sulphide may be taken. After exposure to almost
any source of white light this glows with a bluish phos
phorescence, which becomes quite brilliant when the sulphide
is heated. A similar change is noticeable in the case of the
different limes. The orange, green, and blue varieties exposed
to a series of jar-sparks and subsequently dusted over hot
plates give with easy visibility the colours which they
exhibited in the vacuum-tubes, and which may, for the pre
sent, be considered as sensible indications of their molecular
constitutions.
   Two important considerations have to be dealt with at this
point. In the first place, the question arises how far one and
the same light, i.e. one and the same oscillation-frequency,
will excite the different specimens of lime. Without entering
into dry numerical details it is not possible to give a complete
answer to this question. In a general sense, however, it is
apparently true that although the range of frequency is large,
the red and orange varieties of lime respond to oscillations
less rapid than those which readily affect the varieties giving
a green or blue phosphorescence. It is possible to obtain a
form of lime which illustrates this experimentally. It is not
easy to make. It is prepared from calcium urate by heating
this for many hours to a dull red heat, and afterwards raising
the temperature of the blackened mass sufficiently to burn off
all the organic matter and leave only lime. The residue, on
analysis, was shown to be       º      lime. Such a specimen
exposed freely to jar-sparks and afterwards heated shows
mainly an orange phosphorescence; but if the glass or mica
or Iceland-spar be placed between the lime and the source of
light, then the effect of heat is to intensify greatly a phospho
rescence of a blue colour. It must be clearly understood
that this blue was there before; only masked by the superior
brilliancy of the orange colour; the undulations which would
otherwise have affected the molecular groupings capable of
giving out the orange light being cut off by the glass or mica.
It would be tedious to give all the reasons for assuming that
the oscillations exciting the blue phosphorescence are probably
the more rapid. To some extent the transparency of glass
and mica to a rays may be taken as confirmatory; but to
follow the argument out from spectroscopic evidence would
involve a discussion unsuited to a lecture dealing with general
questions. Referring, however, to the suggested explanation of
the action taking place in a vacuum-tube, it is not inappropriate
to mention now that it is possible to make a specimen of lime

give an orange glow in a moderate vacuum while a portion
of the same specimen is exhibiting a blue glow in a high
vacuum. The readiness with which this blue glow appears
and the time which it takes to develop must be taken into
account in dealing with its supposed origin and with its
relevancy with the question of the relation of the rapidity of
the exciting undulation to the wave-length, i. e. to the colour,
of the phosphorescent light. Perhaps it is advisable to leave
this point for the moment and to turn to the second con
sideration. This deals with the question of the duration of
the phosphorescence.
    At the beginning it was shown that some bodies glow only
while light is acting upon them, or while they are under
the direct influence of an electric discharge. In others
there was a marked after-glow ; while still others required
 the application of heat before any phosphorescence was visible,
 or, as in the case of the limes, before the phosphorescence
 was easily visible. With Balmain's luminous paint, or with
 any body which gives a marked phosphorescence that lasts for
 some time after withdrawal from the exciting influence, it can
 be readily shown that lowering the temperature reduces the
 brilliancy of the glow but lengthens the time during which
 it lasts. The effect of heat has already been mentioned as
 vastly increasing the brilliancy; but it greatly diminishes
 the duration of the light. On the other hand Professor Dewar
 has shown that great reduction of the temperature will cause
 the phosphorescence to linger for a considerable time in many
 substances which had hitherto been considered as practically
 non-phosphorescent. The different behaviours of substances
 in this respect can perhaps be best brought under one explana
  tion by applying the idea of a statical charge or a condition of
  strain to the phosphorescent substances themselves. Duration
  of phosphorescence would then be a measure of rapidity of
  discharge. If it be supposed that, the strain having been
 set up in the particles of a substance, these discharge them
  selves against one another, or rather against uncharged par
  ticles, then a substance with great freedom of interchanging
  movement among its particles would fail to show any sign
  of phosphorescence ; since the strain would be released or
  conducted away by rapid transference before a condition could
  be set up out . oscillations of sufficient amplitude could
  arise. With rather less freedom of movement among the
  particles the non-conducting state might be reached by
  restricting the extent of that movement by cold, as in
  Professor Dewar's experiment. Still less freedom of inter
  change may be considered to obtain in Balmain's luminous

410           Mr. H. Jackson on Phosphorescence.
paint, and even less in the limes which require heating to
show up their phosphorescence, while in the case of the
chlorophane and many other minerals, the condition of strain,
however set up, can apparently be retained indefinitely.
Specimens of lime, after exposure to the jar-spark, have been
found to give out light when heated after being four years
in the dark. It seems not altogether improbable that the
influence of impurities in promoting phosphorescence may
often be attributed to their interfering with the freedom of
movement and so permitting the groupings of the substance
to be sufficiently highly charged. The effect of heat in
rendering a substance a better conductor can be well studied
with pure substances in vacuo under the electric discharge.
   Under the vigorous bombardment of radiant matter the
temperature of the substance rises. In some substances this
leads to an increase in the brilliancy of the glow maintained
often even when the heating is very considerable; in others
the hotter portions are ...i. out by a complete absence of
phosphorescence. Observation seems to favour the conjecture
that this absence is in many cases to be explained on the
hypothesis that the heat endows the molecules with such free
dom as to practically render them uninsulated. To pursue
this part of the subject any further would lead to a discussion
of a question that can only be referred to. It is the con
sideration of how far the change of glow in some specimens
of lime from a red or orange colour in a low vacuum to a green
or blue glow in a high vacuum is to be attributed to shorter
oscillations in the exciting cause, and how far the change is
connected with a dissociation of complex groupings into
simpler ones; a dissociation which may be considered to be
brought about by the rapid oscillations breaking up the lime
groups into two or more smaller groups. Connected with this
is also the question dealing with the possibility of phospho
rescence being coincident with the recombination of the
separated smaller groupings ; but this part of the subject can
only be illustrated by experiments of too minute a character
to be suitable to a lecture, and involves besides the study of
too many details. One other thing which must be taken into
account in drawing any deductions from the change in the
colour of the glow as the temperature rises is that in some
cases the effect of heat is to discharge some colours in a
complicated substance, and so leave visible others which were
before masked.
   The whole question of the inter-relations of the molecular
weights of the phosphorescent substances, of the wave-lengths,
of the exciting undulations, and of the wave-lengths of the

              Mr. H. Jackson on Phosphorescence.             411
resulting glows is an important and interesting one : but it
must be left alone at present with the statement, somewhat
unsatisfactory it is feared, that, while there is no doubt that
special undulations of measurable wave-length are most
efficient in exciting phosphorescence in some substances, the
same effects can i. produced, though to a less degree, by
vibrations which can, perhaps, be best described as undiffer
entiated and irregular pulses.
   Returning to the sources of oscillations there is one other
source which has yet to be considered, and that is chemical
combination. The fact that many substances will phosphoresce
during and after exposure to the flame of hydrogen has
already been alluded to. The flame of coal-gas burnt in a
bunsen-burner will excite phosphorescence in many speci
mens of lime; but the effect is not strong enough to be shown
to an audience.
   Naturally this effect would be stronger the nearer the lime
 was placed to the source of light. i. the flame itself
would be the nearest attainable position, but then the heating
effect practically masks or destroys all others. In phenomena
 such as the glow of phosphorus the temperature does not rise
 to any very marked extent. It is possible to obtain chemical
 combination in the presence of many bodies of a porous nature
without, during the early stages of the action, getting very
 marked heating effects. The action of spongy platinum in
 inducing the oxidation of coal-gas or alcohol-vapour may be
 taken as a familiar illustration of the use of a porous material
 for this purpose.
    In the case of a conducting metal it could not be expected
 that the oscillations arising from the chemical combination
 would cause phosphorescence even in the early stages when
 the temperature has not risen to any extent; but if such a
 body as lime could be obtained in a very porous condition it
 might, while acting as an inducer of chemical combination,
 itself respond to the oscillations arising out of that com
 bination.                                                       -
    This is found to be the case. A jet of unlighted coal-gas
 allowed to play over warm porous lime produces a slight
 phosphorescence, very faint, but quite visible in a dark room.
    By dusting easily volatile substances, such as finely-pow
 dered resin, over slightly heated lime the oxidisable vapour
 is brought more closely into contact with the lime, and the
 phenomenon of phosphorescence is made more visible. So
 far, however, it has not been obtained with sufficient bril
 liancy to be shown to more than a few people at a time.
 When the different limes that have already been experimented

 412           Mr. H. Jackson on Phosphorescence.
 with are subjected to oscillations from this chemical source
 they yield their respective colours in the same way as before.
 The lime which showed a green glow in the vacuum-tube or
 when dusted on to a hot plate after exposure to the jar
 spark gives a green glow with the powdered resin. So also
 in the cases of the orange and blue yielding limes. The
 possibility of the phosphorescence being due to the resin
 vapour itself is excluded by control experiments with other
 porous bodies which do not phosphoresce, but yet are equally
 active in bringing about oxidation.
    This  i. was                often well seen when some of
the limes were being prepared in a furnace. (It has been
already mentioned that many substances retain the power of
jº.               at a high temperature, especially if they are
in a very fine state of division or not quite pure.) Most of
the limes were made from organic salts of calcium, and as
the organic matter burnt away a thin and scarcely visible
flame played over the surface of the lime at the top of the
crucible in which the calcination was carried out.        It was
frequently quite possible to predict by watching the glow
which was developed in the lime, what colour would be given
when the phosphorescence was brought about by oscillations
from the other sources such as the jar-spark or the discharge
in vacuo.
   No one who has spent much time in experimenting with
various substitutes for lime in lantern work can have failed
to be struck by the very different appearances of the light
on the screen given by such bodies as magnesia and zirconia
in comparison with lime ; but perhaps the best examples are
the two mantles in use at the present day for incandescent
gas lights. One of them, the Welsbach mantle, gives a light
of almost a white colour. The other, or Sunlight mantle,
shows a much pinker colour to the eye.
   Experiments with many substances used in a similar way
to the mantles seem to indicate that in addition to the
ordinary heating effect of the gas flame there is another and
a phosphorescent effect which probably, so far as observation
can tell, precedes the ordinary hot stage. It is not usual to
find any pure substances capable of showing this phenomenon
to any marked extent, unless, as mentioned just now, they
are in an extremely fine state of division; a condition which,
like the presence of impurities, may be considered to be un
favourable to the too rapid discharge of the strained particles;
thus giving them the opportunity of becoming fully enough
charged to make their oscillations, when they are discharged,
of sufficient vigour to be sensibly visible.

                 Mr. H. Jackson on Phosphorescence.            413
     If either of the mantles mentioned be introduced into a
  tube and treated with an electric discharge in a high vacuum
  the phosphorescent glow can be studied either with or without
  the heating effect. The glow of the Welsbach mantle is
  a greenish white but not very marked. The Sunlight mantle
  gives a fine red glow. It is interesting to note that the glow
  shows great persistence even when the temperature of the
  substance has been raised considerably by the vigour of the
  bombardment.
     Having now dealt with the last source of oscillation which
  it was proposed to consider, it may be as well to summarize
  the conclusions which for the present seem to be the least
 open to objection so far as experimental evidence goes. The
 attempt has been made to connect together all the phenomena
 of phosphorescence with a view of showing between them a
 likeness in kind. Any theoretical suggestions should be
 taken only as hypotheses for assisting this attempt and for
 pointing the direction of further experiments. It is believed
 then that the following typical examples of the various phe
 nomena which are described as phosphorescent phenomena
 are similar in kind and can be related to one another by the
 application of slight modifications of the same general principle
 —the glow of phosphorus, the fluorescence of quinine, the
 sparkling of heated chlorophane, the luminosity of Bal
 main's paint, the light from lime in a vacuum-tube, and the
 glowing of barium platinocyanide under the influence of
 w-rays. To these it is proposed to add coloured flames and
 the spectral light of glowing gases. It is suggested that all
 these phenomena may be looked upon as outward evidences
 of response on the part of the substances to rapid oscillations,
 whether these oscillations have their origin in chemical com
 bination, in what is commonly spoken of as light, or in elec
trical discharge. The nature of that response may in some
cases be of a direct character; but, when account is taken
of the many degrees of persistence of phosphorescence and of
potential phosphorescence, it seems in many cases first to
assume the form of something which to avoid circumlocution
may be called a statical charge. The release of this con
dition of strain is accompanied by oscillations which give rise
to the visible undulations of the phosphorescent light.
    One final suggestion may perhaps be made, though it is
mentioned with     i.          as many may consider it outside
of the subject.
    If it be accepted that the light of the sun has its immediate
origin mainly in the masses of luminous clouds floating in
the photosphere, and if these clouds be considered as con
densations into material of greater molecular complexity than

414          Prof. O. Lodge on Absolute Velocity and
that from which they were condensed, then it may be not
altogether out of place in the present lecture to speculate on
the relation between the actual light from the glowing clouds
and possible oscillations of the particles of the medium in
... they exist.       There is no need to emphasize the idea
that the oscillations of very simple º: systems give
rise to undulations which can only be perceived when by their
action upon something more complex than themselves they
 cause either a distinct chemical change or set up undulations
 within the range of the visible spectrum.
    May it be that there are similar oscillations in the sun,
 that the simpler materials out of which the photospheric
 clouds are condensed vibrate too quickly to give out visible
 light, but are rendered visible when they are absorbed and
 responded to by the more complex groupings of the condensed
 masses? A sun-spot,        .." upon      as a partial absence of
 clouds, would mean that the conditions which serve to screen
 us to a great extent from the rapid undulations have been
 somewhat modified.
     Is it too much to suppose, in view of the close resemblances
  between many of the actions of light and electricity, and of
  the well-known electrical effects of ultra-violet light and of
  a-rays, that the breaking down of a dielectric which they
  can accomplish may, on a vastly larger scale, accompany an
  unusual exposure of the earth to similarly rapid undulations?
  Should there be anything in this suggestion it may help to
  remove a part of the difficulty in relating the presence of
  sun-spots to those casual electrical disturbances with which
  they undoubtedly coincide in point of time.
  XLII. On the Question of Absolute Velocity and on the
     Mechanical Function of an AEther, with some Remarks on the
     Pressure of Radiation. By Prof. OLIVER LODGE, F.R.S."
        NDER the belief that fundamental doctrines of science
           can be and should be treated in an exceedingly simple
   manner as well as by abstruse processes, the following short
   paper was mostly written a few years ago as a continuation of
   an elementary treatment of dynamical foundations, and as a
   prelude to a similar treatment of some more difficult problems
   concerning which I thought at that time that I had some trust
   worthy facts. It may be some time now before it is completed,
   so I publish it as it stands at present.
      In the Phil. Mag. for February 1889, vol. xxvii. p. 115,
   Professor Newcomb calls attention to a fact that must often
   have struck people as a difficulty (Mr. Heaviside mentioned it
   twenty-five years ago in ‘The English Mechanic”), viz. that
                     * Communicated by the Author.

              on the Mechanical Function of an AEther.             415
   the kinetic energy of a definite mass moving with given speed
   varies according to the standard of rest arbitrarily chosen ; in
   other words that energy is as arbitrary and relative as velocity;
   and the amount of work needed to confer a given velocity on
   a body depends on how fast that body was already moving
   [because (u + v)*—w”= vº-Fa term proportional to ul, a datum
   either meaningless or impossible to know.
      But further, even though work might be rigidly defined,
  with reference to two bodies and their velocities relative to
  their centre of mass, by a suitable statement of the third law
  of motion, yet the same would not be true of energy, for it
  is not expressible in terms of their relative motion, and is
  therefore essentially arbitrary. Professor Newcomb takes
  this as limiting the generality of the law of the Conservation
  of Energy; and says that it would promote sound philosophy
  if the limitation were made clear.
     But I submit that it is more consonant with physical habit
  to assume the law of conservation and to deduce its conse
  quences.    Nothing that we know about energy points to its
  being a relative thing ; it has all the marks of objectivity.
  No one can really suppose that energy is destroyed or created
 wholesale by a mere     º,     in the origin or point of reckoning
 for velocity. It is kinematically convenient to confer an
 arbitrary velocity on an extensive     .       so as to bring some
 body in it to rest, but it is not physically possible without
 performance of work; hence it would appear that there is a
 real meaning in absolute velocity after all. Newton perceived
 this, and his great scholium preceding the ariomata, though
 it has been often criticised and misunderstood, is one of the
 most interesting details of his philosophy.
    It was indeed the instinctive feeling of the race that absolute
 motion had somehow a real meaning which caused the excite
 ment concerning Copernican views of astronomical movements,
 as taught by Galileo and others.
    To i. that conservation of energy, as accepted, demands
attention to absolute velocity, and that it is only the customary
neighbourhood of a     º           infinite mass which has masked
the ambiguity, it suffices to take the simplest possible case ;
say the earth and a stone initially moving together with
absolute velocity u. Their absolute energy is E0– ) (M-H m)u”,
their relative energy is nothing.                         -
    Fire the stone in the same direction, with extra velocity r, and
let the earth recoil with velocity w; the absolute energy is now
E1, such that E1–E0–$nv’--, Mu'+ (mv–Mw) u : and, since
the last term is zero, the gain of absolute energy is equal to
the gain of relative energy provided the imparted relocity be
reckoned from the centre of "...". the only point whose velocity
                               2 (+ 2

416         Prof. O. Lodge on Absolute Velocity and
is really unchanged. Any other reckoning of the relative
energy, such as the usual #m(v-H wy”, where the large mass
is considered stationary, is wrong: the error being #(\f+m)w’
1Il eXCeSS.
    The error, however, is smaller as M is bigger, and vanishes
when M is infinite, hence it is usually ignored; but the error
is in principle the same as if the small mass were the one
considered at rest, in which case the relative energy would be
preposterous.
      ence velocities cannot rigorously be referred to any
artificial standard of rest, but must be referred either to a
point which does not move in the particular problem, like
the centre of inertia of a system, or to a body which never
 moves at all, viz. either one of infinite mass or one to which
there are no stress attachments. The aether (I proceed to
argue), regarded as an omnipresent connecting medium be
tween material bodies, satisfies probably both these conditions,
and certainly one of them, and therefore serves as a standard
of reference—a universal standard of rest—available in all
cases; in other words, the aether possesses no kinetic energy,
at least no kinetic energy accessible through purely mechanical
force.                               -
    I next argue that it is the sole medium of stress, i. e. that
it possesses all the potential energy there is. And then that
all mechanical activity consists in a transference of energy,
through the agency of normal force, from aether to matter or
vice versd.
    I cannot indeed deny that in some unknown way the aether
 may be moving progressively as a whole, if such a state
 ment has any meaning, which I doubt; but I maintain that
 for all practical purposes motion of matter relative to the
 aether is absolute motion, and is what we really mean by
 velocity in space, without any appeal to artificial material
 standards or axes of reference.       I am much interested in
 finding in Dr. Larmor's treatise on AEther and Matter a
 sentence in some sort of agreement with these views (Phil.
 Trans. (1897) p. 219).
    First, I state a pair of simple axioms which require no
justification, and whose necessary definitions can be easily
 supplied :—
         1. Stress is Essential to Action.
         2. Stress cannot erist in or across Empty Space.
     (By “free space”. I mean space full of aether; by “empty
 space.” I mean a thing of which we have no experience
whatever; but we have plenty of experience of stress, an
 cannot conceive its existence except as a modified state of
 something real.)

            on the Mechanical Function of an AEther.               417
    I have stated these axioms already, with some preliminary
 explanation, in a communication to the Physical Society of
 London (see for instance “Nature,” vol. xlviii. pp. 62 and 101,
 as well as Phil. Mag. July 1893); and I add another —
          3. Material Particles never come into Contact,
 meaning by material particles the actual substance of atoms
 or molecules composing ponderable matter as ordinarily
known. It is for convenience that I use the term “material”
 as opposed to “aetherial:” I would not be understood to assert
or deny anything about the immateriality of aether—the
 question would turn largely upon definition as well as upon
 greater knowledge of properties than is at present possessed,
 but at least it is not material in the ordinary sense.
    For the acceptance of these three axioms I appeal to the
 instinct of every physicist, based on his wide experience of
 phenomena which it would be only tedious to recapitulate,
 and I take them as constituting our real reason for postulating
 the existence and constant activity of an aether; they certainly
 necessitate an immaterial connecting medium if action is ever
 to occur. The ordinary argument for the existence of an
ather is obtained if in (2) the word “stress” is replaced by
 the word waves, and in that form it is quite valid too, but force
 is a simpler experience than light, and the undulatory theory
 has only become established with difficulty and refinements of
observation. Something led Newton to postulate an aether,
 and I apprehend it was really some form of the axiom here
 numbered 2.      Axiom 3 is not essential to the demand for the
 existence of an aether, but it is essential to the aether's universal
activity. It may not be perfectly acceptable, especially by
those who seek to explain all actions in terms of material
collision—whether of ultra-hypothetical corpuscles, or any
other kind of discontinuous substance.         It is indeed intended
definitely to depreciate and deny the probability of that
doctrine.
    Next I appeal to experience for support to the following
proposition :-premising that the word “mechanical * is here
throughout used to signify the behaviour of plain matter as
observed in bulk and thence inferentially extended to molecules,
but not so as to include the chemical behaviour of atoms.
The adjective is intended to exclude chemical and electric and
magnetic forces, it is not intended to discriminate molar from
molecular ; but in order that the term mechanical may apply
to molecules they must be dealt with individually, or else
statistically as in the kinetic theory of gases, their motion is
not to be treated in the unorganized way appropriate to the
ideas of heat and temperature.

418          Prof. O. Lodge on Absolute Velocity and
   4. ZEtherial Inertia does not Influence Mechanical Actions;
 by which I mean that it does not enter into mechanical
 equations, that in all attractions and repulsions of matter
 nothing has to be allowed for in respect of the mass of any
 connecting mechanism, that everything occurs as if action
 were really “at a distance.” The statement is in fact
 equivalent to the following alternative form:—
    4'. The hypothesis of Action at a Distance accurately
         accounts for all the results of Astronomical Attractions
         and Mechanical Collisions.
    Consider two unequal balls driven apart by a spiral spring,
 or consider a gun and bullet driven apart by exploding
 powder; it is not true to say that miri + m,", =0, a third term
 mars must be introduced to represent the momentum of the
 spring or of the powder gases: a statement emphatically
 obvious in the case of a rocket.
    No such third term is needed to express correctly the
 results of the impact of elastic particles, nor of the gravitative
 attractions of two unequal masses; at any rate if such a third
term is necessary it has yet to be discovered, it is too minute
to have been so far noticed. The only case in which its
 existence has hitherto been suspected is in Maxwell’s “Pres
 sure of Light.” Assuming that to be a real phenomenon, and
it can hardly be doubted on electromagnetic principles, it would
 seem that any illuminated body, or any non-uniform source
of light, is like a rocket reacting on the vibrating aether.
It might be urged that the stress really acts between the
source and the body on which the light falls, but the finite
rate of wave-propagation forbids the universality of this ; and
the exceptional character thus required of the wave-impact
force is noteworthy. Possibly it is going to constitute a most
important exception, the first of a large class of forces for
which the usual interpretation of the third law of motion may
have to be enlarged. If gravitation were transmitted at a
finite rate, a similar phenomenon would occur there ; and the
force in either case would be a function of the motion of a
body, for a body moving away with the speed of light (or of
gravitation respectively) would not feel it.
   We will return to the consideration of this most interesting
aetherial force, but for the present we will deal with the usual
interpretation of the third law, viz that the action and reaction
are on material bodies only.
   Now three sufficient reasons may be assigned as to why
aetherial inertia should not enter into mechanical equations
(assuming for the present that it never does), viz. the following,
as alternatives:—

             on the Mechanical Function of an AEther.             419
     Either (1) because the inertia of aether is zero, or
            (2) because the inertia of aether is infinite, or
            (3) because aether is not disturbed by motion of plain
                 matter, for want of any frictional connexion be
                 tween them.
     Hypothesis 1 is apparently inconsistent with electromag
  netic experiments, with the hypothetical continuance of
 electric currents inside molecules, and with the existence of
 oscillations like light in free space.
     If the aether is of finite density and of infinite extent, of
 course the total mass is infinite, and in that sense hypothesis
 2 may be true; but infinitude of total mass, even combined
 with incompressibility, would not prevent the aether from
 affecting by its inertia the motion of bodies through it if it
 flowed round them like a fluid.     Non-disturbance must mean
 that in some sense it flows straight through them, and its unre
 sisting immobility must signify an entire absence of viscosity.
    Direct optical experiments confirm this suspicion of zero
 viscosity, and show that matter and aether are mechanically
 disconnected ; we have no mechanical method at present
 known for moving aether, i.e. for affecting the speed of light
 through free or “unloaded " aether. The Fizeau experi
ment, which shows that moving matter does affect light
velocity, though it is sometimes misapprehended as meaning
that moving matter carries aether . it, really implies, and
was so understood by Fresnel who suggested it and predicted
its actual result, that the aether is not moved at all, but that
the extra speed of light is to be accounted for by an affection
or modification, or say “loading,” of the aether by matter in
situ, and by a motion of the load (see Glazebrook, Phil. Mag.
Dec. 1888; also Phil. Trans. (1893) p. 731). Hence I may
say at once that the third of the above hypotheses is the one
which commends itself to me.
    But now plainly arises a question about this same “loading.”
If matter is able to load ather, is not that iPso facto a
mechanical connexion between them 2 And even the bare fact
of radiation and absorption, does not that represent mechanical
connexion between aether and matter?                                -
    I  º if light is a mechanical oscillation, yes;       if it is an
electrical oscillation, no.    For what is it that is moved when
light-waves are absorbed or refracted, and what is it whose
motion excites radiation? In all probability not the atoms of
matter themselves, but their electric or ionic charges. An
electric charge has inertia of its own (as was first iºn by
J. J. Thomson), and that inertia is sufficient to account for
the facts without the necessity for postulating any motion of
the material substratum, if there be any such substratum.

 420          Prof. O. Lodge on Absolute Velocity and
    But it may be objected that atoms can move ; and if they
 move, their charges must go too; and if their charges move,
 the aether may be affected ; hence it appears as if motion of
 matter could disturb ather after all. I.et us get clear on
 this point. On Larmor's theory, for instance, there need be
 no material substratum at all, nothing but an agglomeration
 of ionic charges or “electrons’’ with a definite configuration;
 and this assemblage of electrons constitutes an atom. Now
 if there is an excess of free charge which vibrates or revolves,
 or if the electrons move in any way differentially, that is an
 electrical phenomenon, and it disturbs the aether and excites
 or absorbs, or delays and therefore refracts, radiation ; but
 if all the electrons move together, positive and negative
 simultaneously, that is a material or mechanical phenomenon,
 and need not excite the aether at a finite distance at all.
 Similarly an electrical disturbance applied to water decom
 poses it, either actually or initially, setting up at least a
 polarization no matter how small in amount; whereas a
 mechanical disturbance applied to water merely moves it
 about, oxygen and hydrogen together. As I have suggested
 long ago concerning these two processes, the first has an
 analogue in the aether ; the second has none : aether can be
 polarized or even sheared, but not moved. It may be that
 the immobility is only approximate, that it behaves as if
 its inertia were enormous but not infinite; but until further
 facts are forthcoming, and for present purposes, I will assume
 the immobility absolute, on the ground that the properties
 of free aether usually seem to be of a perfect and not an
 approximate order.
    The only tangential communication between aether and
 matter is through the medium of what we call an electric
 charge; such charges are essentially of equal and opposite sign,
 and imply some form of doubleness of constitution (right- and
 left-handed strains on Larmor's theory) in the aether. In
 purely electric and magnetic phenomena the aetherial consti
 tuents are sheared, either elastically or continuously, but their
 “centre of gravity” is stationary ; and so even in those cases
 the aether is immovable, while in mechanical phenomena there
 is no necessary aetherial disturbance at all ; and hence in all
 cases it is as a whole absolutely fixed. The only kinetic
energy it possesses is that of its constituents when being
sheared in opposite directions; this is electrokinetic energy";
but of translatory or available mechanical kinetic energy it
has, i. e. it receives or delivers up, none.
    As to potential energy, the energy of statical stress,
   * Larmor would express this differently, he would have translatory
energy with very great inertia and therefore very small velocity.

            on the Mechanical Function of an AEther.            421
—it exists in the space between separated electric poles,
and between separated material particles, but there is no
potential energy in the material particles themselves, for
the disjoined atoms could not communicate with each other
by any except an aetherial process. All the mechanical
energy which an atom possesses is kinetic, and this is
possessed, so far as it is translatory, by all its electrons alike,
irrespective of sign. On Larmor's theory the kinetic energ
of matter, including inter-atomic energy and energy of
rotation of the atom, depends on nothing but the number
of its electrons, the linear dimensions of their nuclei, and
their motions through the tether. It is indeed rather difficult
to see what other material substratum is necessary, or even
what supplementary conception of material substance is
 possible. The problem of matter, as regards purely physical
manifestations, is in that case shifted to an account of the
nature and properties of an electron, i.e. of an isolated electric
charge with its lines of force and their behaviour when it
is in motion.
    Leaving these speculative considerations, I will state the bare
result of the familiar experience that the tether is mechanically
inoperative, i.e. that it never compensates the momentum of
matter, or that the total momentum generated by any stress
is zero without including any aetherial inertia, by stating that
a stress existing in aether always terminates at each end on
 material bodies, its terminals being the forces which act
normally on those bodies, driving them apart or pulling them
 together; in other words, that mechanical force is only found
 at the junction of aether and matter, and acts solely on matter,
 no force-component of any stress being attributable to the
 reaction of quiescent aether:—
 5. A Stress eclends from one Material Body to another, it
   does not End in Zlther [when it is in a steady electric state].
    The usual interpretation of Newton's third law is to the
same practical effect (without the words in square brackets),
since the “reaction " whose constant existence is postulated
is silently assumed to be that of another lump of matter.       But
whereas Newton's law itself can hardly be other than quite
general, some exceptional cases where the above usually
understood specialization or limitation of it ceases to be true
may yet be discovered. In fact Maxwell’s “radiation-pres
sure" may perhaps be already such a case. Anyhow, since
 (5) unqualified represents the usual understanding of the third
law, it is better to have it so stated explicitly ; if only that it
may be contradicted. The fact is that law iii. has only been
established for bodies between which the aether has attained a
steady state ; if this condition is not satisfied the law as

422          Prof. O. Lodge on Absolute Velocity and
ordinarily understood is not true; some additional words, such
as those above in italics or square brackets, must be appended
to it as a qualification in order to make it general. Only
then can the potential energy of a system be expressed in
terms of the configuration of the matter alone ; which, as
Larmor points out, is the most general statement of the third
law (Phil. Trans. vol. cxc. p. 216).
   An immediate deduction from this and the preceding state
ments is that a stress cannot exist inside a single lump of
matter (unless it be in a closed curve); for if it had free
ends they would terminate in aether, since matter is only in
contact with aether. A stress might indeed penetrate the space
inside a lump of matter on its way between two other lumps,
but inasmuch as the stress inside could not exceed in amount
the aetherial stress outside (or a portion of it would be ending
at the surface) it follows that the aether is the vehicle and
medium of all stresses that exist.
               6. Stresses exist solely in the AEther.
   In other words the aether is essentially the seat of all
potential energy.
   Furthermore, since steady aether is not subject to mechanical
force (i.e. one end of a stress) it cannot have any kinetic energy
imparted to it mechanically. It is improbable that as a whole
it has any motion at all, fit whatever mechanical motion it
has is entirely disconnected from us, and for all practical
purposes it is stationary.
7. The AEther as a whole is at rest, and Velocities referred to
                     it are Absolute velocities.
   Thus we find that matter possesses all the kinetic or simple
inertia-energy there is, and aether possesses all the potential or
stress energy.
8. The two fundamental Forms of Energy are distinct and are
        possessed by different bodies, viz. Potential by aether,
        Kinetic by matter; hence whenever there is transference
        there is transformation, and whenever there is trans
        formation there is transference. (It is necessary to ex
        clude radiant, i.e. alternating energy from this state
        ment, at present, but it    ..".    found that the property
        which enables aether to alternately receive and deliver
        electrokinetic energy is essentially a quasi-material or
        potentially material property.)
   Consider for instance an action between a mass of matter
and the aether in contact with it: the speed of the body is
either increasing or decreasing or remaining constant. (1) If
its speed is increasing, it is gaining kinetic energy and the
aether is losing potential energy. This is achieved not by an
ordinary process of recovery from elastic strain, but as it were

             on the Mechanical Function of an AEther.           423
by mopping up part of the energy of cells or regions of fresh
aether over which it passes; a process which delivers the aether
from stress without involving it in any yielding motion, and
without relaxing the stress in contiguous regions. That such
must be the kind of process in aether we know, because the
stress between attracting bodies is by no means lessened by
their approach, as it is when a crude complex substance like
indiarubber is the agent; on the contrary, a body may be
urged with increasing speed into regions of greater and greater
intrinsic energy; nevertheless the stress in the region behind
it has decreased, and therefore the potential energy as a whole
is diminished by the motion *. (2) If the body's speed is de
creasing, it is losing kinetic and the aether is gaining potential
energy (by means of the stress caused and left in the aether it is
sweeping over or through). In both these cases an unbalanced
force is acting on the boundary of the energetic aether and the
matter, and the activity is Fv, being the rate at which the
body gains or loses kinetic energy. (3) If its speed is con
stant, the matter is merely transmitting a stress which is the
same in front and behind it; in that case it is acted on b
balanced forces, the aetherial energy passes fore and aft   hº
the atom, assuming the kinetic form for the moment, and is
left behind unchanged.
    Referring to the phrase “unbalanced force ’’ used above,
the force is only unbalanced with regard to the single piece
of matter under consideration, the reaction-force is exerted on
another piece of matter—the reacting body—at the other end
of the stress. The quiescent connecting medium, the vehicle of
the stress, sustains no part of the reaction; it merely transmits
a static stress, and only at its boundaries is there any motion.
    (There is nothing here to prevent aetherial energy from
being ultimately hydrodynamically kinetic, but considered
from the practical material point of view aetherial energy is
what it has been agreed to call “potential; ” i.e. it displays
itself as a force to which matter can yield, rather than
as a motion which something in space can resist.)
   But now return to the consideration of Maxwell's stress
due to radiation. It exists in any region filled with waves of
any kind, and acts in the direction of the rays on the bodies
which bound that region at either end. It repels a target
upon which light falls, and it repels the source whence the
light originates; it is a definite stress producing on perfectly
opaque bodies a normal pressure equal to the energy of the
radiation per unit volume of the space filled with it. So long
as the light extends all the way from source to sink there is
nothing exceptional about this stress, and the third law is
  * As an illustration of a field of energy being discharged without
normal yield we may think of a sharp blade moving through a forest of
stretched elastics.

  424         Prof. O. Lodge on Absolute Velocity and
  naturally obeyed by the action on the one body and the
  reaction on the other. But during the growth of the stress,
  during the generation of the energy-filled region, i.e. during
  the time required by the light to advance from source to sink.
  there is something exceptional and very instructive. Suppose
  the light has travelled half-way, and consider a parallel beam
  for simplicity; half the space is full of energy, the other half
  is empty, the boundary between the two spaces is like an
  immaterial piston advancing with the velocity of light. On
  one side of this piston the stress must be complete and must
  extend from the source (or parabolic mirror &c.) to the
  boundary ; the force on the source is manifest, where is the
 corresponding reaction?
     I reply, on the advancing boundary between the active and
 inert regions: on the first wave-front. Here there is an
 electromagnetic disturbance combined with a sudden transi–
 tion ; on one side of the boundary, energy H*/47 per unit
 volume, half of it magnetic, half of it electrostatic ; on the
 other side, no energy at all: , But the energy is growing, the
 clear space in front is receiving energy, how does it receive
 it? By the performance of work. The front-wave force, p
 on every unit area, is advancing with the speed c and doing
 work at the rate pr, filling a cylinder of length v with energy
 every second ; filling every unit cube therefore with energy p.
 This mechanical force acts along the ray, doing work on the
 aether, which it displaces or shears, not normally but tangen
tially, giving rise to, or at least accompanying, the co-phasal so
called electric and magnetic displacements in the wave-front.
    The energy is propagated along the ray in the direction of
 the normal force, it exists wherever there is electric accele
ration, and not only where there is obvious radiation ; and
the value of the mechanical force in general is the vector
product of the electric and magnetic forces, corresponding
with Poynting's transmission of energy.
    The front-wave surface may be likened to a liquid skin;
on one side of a liquid boundary is cohesion force, on the other
side nothing ; a residual consequence of the internal mole
cular (normal) pressure is a tangential tension in the surface.
Somewhat similarly, a result of the internal aetherial shearing
stresses in the aether is a normal pressure at the boundary.
    A piece of matter encountering the rays may feel the force,
and experience mechanical acceleration in the direction of the
force. If it interrupts their progress sharply and discon
tinuously, either by reflexion or absorption, it feels the whole
force; if it reflects or absorbs a little, it feels a little; if it
is perfectly transparent but delays the rate of transmission,
then it feels a temporary force appropriate to the difference in
speed. For now the aether inside the body receives the energy

              on the Mechanical Function of an AEther.            425
more slowly than before, and yet energy is poured in at the ori
ginal rate; the difference p(p-v') is being .. by the material
lº           or electrons which share in the conveyance of light.
   ut the matter only feels the force p(v-º') for a moment;
When the light emerges the pressure behind is the same as
that in front, and the matter transmits its portion of the stress
like any other transparent region and experiences no per
sistent acceleration.       (Divergence of rays matters nothing,
fºr Stokes's solenoidal law, p4 = constant, of course holds.)

molecules, and in that case will experience the whole pressure;

                         now represents the rate at which heat is
                                  in the body per unit of illumi
 nated area. A reflecting body of course leaves the energy
 in the ether, and starts a new reaction force travelling back
 Wards with the new advancing wave, the mirror itself taking
 up the reaction both of the old and the new streams.
    The force at a free wave-front is not to be thought of as if
 operating on a yielding or elastic body, but, after the manner
 of all such cases, as generating and leaving energy in one
 region of the aether after another as it sweeps over it.
     If, for whatever reason, there is a boundary between active
 and inert tether, that boundary must experience the pressure;
 if the boundary is the surface of black matter, the transition is
 maintained by absorption, and the energy generated is that of
   eat; if the boundary is free aether, the transition can only
 be maintained by rapid translation, and the energy generated
 ls that of radiation. If the activity of the source is at any
 lºstant stopped, a definite block of radiation, with its longitu
 dinal stress, travels bodily forward;  the front of it acts precisely
 as before, but the pressure at its back surface is opposed to the
 motion, and thus corresponds with the wiping out of the energy
  9f the aether left behind. So long as the source was in action
 it kept this otherwise back region constantly replenished.
         hen the force impinges on matter it accelerates it
  normally, and may move with the matter at any arbi
  trary rate; though if the matter move away with the

 Speed u, the force on it is diminished in the proportion V :
  So also if a source moves with speed -- u, the reaction on it
  * likewise altered, and with it its radiating power, which at
  %ce becomes p(V+u), or in general p(Wi-ucos 0) in any
  direction. It is simply a question of relative velocity; and
  the balance of force is such as to oppose the motion. What
  "Yer force a retreating black target thus avoids is taken up by
  the ºther recently inside it, which thus has energy given to
  it at the rate pu, while the matter takes the rest; but while
  mechanical yield is along, absorption yield is across, the force.

  426        Prof. A. Gray on the Virtual Resistance of
     Thus the statement No. 5, made above, is incomplete and
  inaccurate without the proviso about a steady state of the
  aether. It appears to be true, so long as it is a case of the
  statical exertion of force, that such force can only be exerted
  by matter; but it appears also to be true that the aether or
  any other medium capable of transmitting rays is able to
  experience a force on the boundary between two regions
  possessing different intensities of vibrational energy (the force
 per unit area being equal to the difference in the energies per
 unit volume), provided that this boundary advances at a certain
  speed appropriate to the medium, viz. the speed at which it
  transmits that particular kind of vibrational energy, or pro
 vided that it retreats at the same rate in a direction opposed
 to the force,—in this latter case destroying the wave-energy
 which previously existed in the medium.
    Hence 5 may be generalized thus:–
    5'. A stress occurs either in the space between two material
 bodies, or between a body and an advancing trace-front, or
 between an advancing and a retreating ware-front. Its action
 and reaction are always equal and opposite, and a free wtherial
 reaction is necessarily transmitted with the speed of light.
    In other words, a stress whose one end terminates in aether
 is necessarily a growing or decaying (or, in the case of both
 ends, a shifting) and not a statical stress; it is doing work at
 a certain definite rate, and thereby generating or destroying
 aetherial wave-energy. The mechanical force acts not only
 at obvious wave-fronts, but at every boundary on one side
 of which there is electric acceleration, i. e. where electric
 and magnetic forces coexist; and its value is V(EH).
 Thus a boundary between pulsating and inert aether behaves
 in some respects like a material partition; it is able on certain
 conditions to take the place of a reacting body in Newton's
 third law. This is suggestive in connexion with the view that
 regards all matter as a variety of aetherial strain and motion.
 The normal pressure on such a boundary results not in normal
but in tangential (electric) yield; there is probably very little
meaning in disentangling cause and effect, otherwise the
gyrostatic analogy is suggestive.
XLIII. The Calculation of the Virtual Resistance of Thin
    Wires for Rapidly Alternating Currents. By Professor A.
    GRAY, F.R.S.
          To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.
      GENTLEMEN,
    N his interesting paper on “The High-Frequency Induc
       tion-Coil,” published in the current number of the Philo
sophical Magazine, Mr. W. P. Boynton quotes an expression,

         Thin Wires for Rapidly Alternating Currents.          427
given by Mr. Mathews and myself in our treatise on Bessel
Functions, for the resistance of a straight metallic wire carrying
a very rapidly alternating current. The equation we give is
                           R=VAum      lR
                                      2 2
where R is the resistance of a wire of length l and permea
bility a to steady currents, and R is its virtual resistance to
currents of frequency n/2t. Taking p as unity, r as the
 radius of the wire, and k as its conductivity, Mr. Boynton
 transforms this equation to
                           R! = Rr     Th,
                                        2k
 which leads to the result that for n=500,000 and k= 0006,
                           R!—36,000rk.
     This result, as Mr. Boynton says, is startling, and is not
 confirmed by his experiments.
     I desire to point out that the transformed equation obtained
  by Mr. Boynton is not correct, and should stand
                           R = Rr A /  4.
  which, with n and k as stated, gives
                           R'-21-7 rR.
      For wire of 1 millimetre diameter—the case considered by
  Mr. Boynton, this becomes
                           R!—1.085R,
  so that the virtual increase of resistance in this case works out
  to only 8.5 per cent. This number, however, is not a close
  approximation to the true value of R'. Obviously, if we were
   to make the radius of the wire about 8 per cent. less than half
  a millimetre, 21-7 rR would become R, and further diminution
   of r would give R's R, results which are clearly erroneous,
   To find a fair approximation recourse must be had to the
   series by which, for a given n and a given r, the virtual
   resistance can be calculated. Thus I obtain, from three
   terms of the series, R'='1'291R, which, as the next term is
   positive, must be somewhat too small.
      The series is really one of ascending powers of the product
   Hºnºr'k”; and it is only when this quantity is increased without
   limit that we obtain the limiting formula stated above. In
   other words, the formula gives the value of R' for a given
   wire to a given degree of approximation only when n is made
   sufficiently great; and it cannot be applied to a case in which,

 while n is fixed at the fairly high value of 500,000, r is taken
 so small as half a millimetre.
    I wish to add that the value of R' for alternating currents
 of any periodicity is really due to Lord Rayleigh, who first
 fully worked out this question. This acknowledgment, I find
 ...      on looking up the passage referred to by Mr. Boynton,
 we have inadvertently omitted. The particular Bessel Func
 tion method adopted in the book for obtaining the formulae is
 the only thing to which we have any claim.

             A NEW COMBINATION OF WHEEL-GEARING.
                       BY J. J. TAUDIN CHABOT.
 IF   we try to construct a skew-gearing (endless screw) with a
     velocity-ratio of 1:1, we find that the two wheels become
identical. These, repeated to any desired extent, are the elements
 of the model to be here discussed.        The structure of the model
may be described as follows:—The axes of rotation of the wheels
 coincide with the w, v, z and q, x, y axes of two equidistant
 systems of rectangular coordinates projecting into each other;
on two of the axes of each of the two systems of coordinates there
occur alternately a wheel and a zero-point (point of intersection
 with the other two axes of the same system); while on the third
axis of each system there occur in order a wheel, a zero-point, a
 space without a wheel, a zero-point, a wheel, and so on in endless
repetition. These two last-mentioned axes cross each other at
right angles.
                         Properties of the Molel.
   I. When all the wheels rotate gearing into each other, a negative
or positive acceleration of the rotation of one of them causes the
rotatory motion—whether of this wheel only or of the wheels
directly or even indirectly in gear with it—to be partially trans
formed into a motion of translation.         The wheel moves in one
direction or the other along its axis of rotation until the accele
ration ceases, or is replaced by one of opposite sign. In the
former case the wheel continues to rotate in its new position; in
the latter it returns by a reversed motion of translation to its
original place (or goes beyond it, as the case may be).
   II. If translatory motion is continuously maintained, the wheel
may pass out of gear with the adjacent wheels, and may even
  ear in with an independent set of wheels.
   III. The disturbances described under heads I. and II. extend
uniformly in all directions throughout a sphere of finite dimensions.
The working (regular rotation) of the wheels which at any instant
lie outside the sphere of disturbance remains unaffected, even if
they belong to the same model.—Communicated by the Author.

XLV. On the Deflecion by Magnetic Force of the Electric
       Discharge through Gases. By J. HENRY, M.A., B.E.
       (R.U.I.), Trinity College, Cambridge; 1851 Erhibition
       Science Scholar, Queen's College, Galway”.
THE        experiments described in the following paper were
        undertaken for the purpose of finding the explanation
of the change produced in the magnetic deflexion of the
electric discharge between a pair of electrodes in a rarefied
gas, when the gas carrying lº discharge is changed: this
 effect of the gas on the magnetic deflexion of the discharge
through it had been noticed by Professor Thomson.
    It is well known that the electric discharge between a pair
of electrodes in a rarefied gas is deflected by a magnetic force
at right angles to the direction of discharge, in somewhat the
same way as a flexible and elastic conducting string would be,
if it were stretched between the electrodes and carried a
current in the same direction as that in which the discharge
passes through the gas; the discharge in the gas, like the
string, is deflected from the straight line between the electrodes
while the magnetic force acts, and returns to the straight
  ath again as soon as the magnetic force is removed (“Recent
j. p. 131, par. 127).
                    Description of Apparatus.
   The apparatus used in my experiments consisted of:—
A vacuum-tube with an air-pump and a mercury-manometer
            * Communicated by Prof. J. J. Thomson, F.R.S.

430         Mr. J. Henry on the Deflerion by Magnetic

an   induction-coil for producing the discharge, a galvanometer
for measuring it, and an electrostatic voltmeter for #. the
difference of potential between the electrodes of the discharge;
and a camera for photographing the discharge.                             -
    The vacuum-tube is shown in fig. 1. It was found that in
a narrow tube the direction of the discharge for high pres
sures of the gas was very unsteady, owing to the walls of the
tube becoming electrified ; so for this reason, and also to
allow room for the discharge to be deflected without coming
too close to the glass, a wide tube had to be used. An ordi
nary bell-jar, fitted as shown in fig. 1, made a very convenient
                                    Fig 1.

 form. The ebonite plug, d, through which the three-way
 glass tube passes, was made air-tight in the neck of the jar
 with sealing-wax ; the glass tube contained the electrode, b,
 and also allowed of gas being admitted to, or pumped out of,
 the bell-jar by the side tube, e. The electrode was fixed in
 the tube with the sealing-wax, w; but by softening the wax
 it could be easily shifted in or out, so as to change the length
 of the discharge.
    The bottom of the jar was closed by pressing a plate of
 ebonite (c) turned plane, against the ground glass rim of the
 jar. The joint was at first made air-tight with sealing-wax,
 but grease was found to answer the purpose quite as well,
 and it was much easier to work with.
    The electrode, a, passed through the centre of the ebonite
 plate, and was secured with           º                 The tube e com

     The exhaustion in most of the experiments was made with
 an oil air-pump capable of producing a vacuum of less than
  1 mm. of mercury.
     Two large coils of thick copper wire, capable of carrying a
 current of ten or twelve amperes for a short time, were used
 for producing the magnetic force to deflect the discharge.
 These coils were wound on wooden bobbins with 150 turns in
 each coil, and with a mean radius of 17 cms. each. They were
 fixed in a frame with their planes parallel, and perpendicular
 to the line joining their centres, at a distance apart of 17 cms.,
 the mean radius of either coil,-Helmholtz's arrangement for
 producing a uniform field about the middle point of the axis
 of the coils.
    The current in the coils was given by an ammeter in series
 with them.
    The discharge was produced by a Ruhmkorff's coil, and the
 mean current in the discharge was measured by a galvano
 meter in the discharge-circuit.
     In the experiments the discharge-tube was placed so that
 the middle point of the discharge was as near the middle
 point of the axis of the coils as possible, and with the direction
 of the discharge at right angles to that axis.
                     Preliminary Erperiments.
    Some preliminary experiments were made with different
 gases in the discharge-tube, and for a given magnetic force,
 the deflexion of the discharge produced in each gas was
observed. As the deflexions could not be very accurately
 compared with the eye alone, a camera was employed; it was
 permanently fixed and focused on the discharge so that a
 photograph could be obtained at any time by simply uncapping
 the lens. In order to compare the deflexions produced by a
 constant magnetic force in the different gases, the mean
 current in the discharge, as measured by the galvanometer,
 was kept constant by varying the pressure of the gas in the
 discharge-tube.
    The following table gives the gases used, arranged in order
of the magnitude of the deflexions obtained in them by the
method stated above: the deflexion in hydrogen was least.
    (1) H.         -    N.        (4) NO.           (6) NH2.

    The position of the gases   marked thus 2 in the above table
is rather doubtful, as the oil-pump could not be used for

deleterious effect on the pump.
   Figs. 2, 3, and 4 show the deflexions obtained in hydrogen,
air, and carbonic acid gas respectively; the deflexion in chlorine
was much nearer that in air than in hydrogen.
           Fig. 2.           Fig. 3.            Fig. 4.
   These figures show the discharge deflected to both sides of
the straight path, as in the photos. Each plate was exposed
to the discharge deflected first to one side, then to the other,
by reversing the current in the magnetic-field coils. The
figures are the same size as the photos.
   The actual distance between the terminals was Fig. 5.
8.8 cms.
   During these experiments. I noticed that the cur
vature of the deflected discharge was not uniform
but was always greater at the upper electrode, as
shown in fig. 5, the discharge being vertical. It did
not matter whether b was the positive or the negative
electrode.

charges passing through gases at high pressures than
at low pressures.
       Bending of the Discharge by Convection-Currents.
   To try if the distortion, above referred to, was caused by
convection-currents due to the unequal heating of the gas in
the discharge-tube, I turned the tube into a horizontal
position, and then found that for air (the gas I was using at
the time) the discharge was always bent vertically upwards,
the deflexion being very large for high pressures of the gas,
and vanishing for i. pressure.
   When the discharge passed, it could be seen to go, at first,
straight between the electrodes, and then to be quickly
carried upwards as the gas got heated, until a steady position

         Force of the Electric Discharge through Gases.      433
was attained where the discharge remained permanently
deflected; for very high pressures of the gas in the discharge
tube there was no steady position (see fig. 18, below); in this
case the path of the discharge, after being bent upwards,
always fell back to the straight line again, as if it were being
blown out.

   The curvature of the discharge, as deflected by convection
currents, was not nearly uniform for pressures in the discharge
 tube of 4 or 5 cms. of mercury, but appeared as shown in fig. 6,
 the curvature being much greater near the negative electrode;
 as the pressure of the gas was diminished, the curve became
 more symmetrical until it finally became quite circular.
    The discharge in carbonic acid gas was bent by convection
currents rather more than in air; but in hydrogen the effect
 was so small as to be almost imperceptible.
                  Rearrangement of Apparatus.
   To get rid of the effect of the convection-currents in the
 photographs of the discharge, the direction of the magnetic
 force was made vertical, and that of the discharge horizontal,
so that the horizontal component of the deflexion was due
 entirely to the magnetic force.
    The camera had now to be fixed in a position verticall
 over the discharge, and with the sensitive plate i.
 By this means the horizontal component only of the deflexion
 showed in the photographs, and the deflected    º          then
appeared of nearly uniform curvature except for high pres
sures of the gas—3 to 4 cms of mercury—when the rig.:
curvature increased greatly towards the middle of the *.
discharge; but with the point of maximum curvature         :
always nearer to the negative electrode, as shown
in fig. 7, where a is the negative electrode and b the
positive. On the other hand, for low pressures of the
gas—less than a centim. of mercury—the curvature
increased towards the positive end of the discharge.
For a pressure of 1 millim. the discharge in air or
carbonic acid gas was turned at right angles to the
positive electrode by a strong magnetic force, and the
positive column was deflected till it pressed against          (t
the sides of the tube.
   In hydrogen the deflexion showed similar changes for low
pressures, but on a smaller scale; for high pressures the

 434        Mr. J. Henry on the Deflecion by Magnetic
 deflexion was so small that irregularities in it could not be
 detected very well.
                             Experiments.
     Experiments were next made to find how the deflexion of
 the discharge by magnetic force changed with—
     (1) The pressure of the gas in the discharge-tube;
     (2) The mean difference of potential between the electrodes
            of the discharge;
     (3) The mean current in the discharge.
     The method adopted in these experiments was to find the
 deflexions produced in the same gas by a constant magnetic
 force, first for different pressures of the gas while the mean
 current in the discharge was kept constant; and, second, for
 different strengths of current in the discharge, as measured
 by the galvanometer, while the pressure of the gas was kept
 constant. The mean current carried by the discharge through
 the gas was controlled by a variable water-resistance, con
 nected in series with the discharge-tube. Thus by increasing
 the water-resistance in circuit when the pressure of the gas in
 the discharge-tube fell, the mean current through it was kept
 constant.
    As the difference of potential between the electrodes de
 pended for any gas on its pressure in the discharge-tube, so long
 as the distance between the electrodes remained unchanged,
 it could not be varied independently of the pressure; but, as
 we shall see, this did not matter.
                      Details of Eaperiments.
    The length of the discharge in these experiments was
 8.8 cms., and the gases most used were air and carbonic acid
   as, especially the latter, owing to the large deflexions pro
i.       in it. In these gases when the pressure was less than
 2 cms. of mercury, the discharge had a “fuzzy” appearance;
and for pressures less than 1 cm. the photographs obtained
were too indefinite to be of any use. The highest pressure
for which the discharge would pass properly between the
electrodes was about 5-5 cms.

mean current in the discharge in divisions of the galvano
meter-scale—one division of the scale corresponding to a current
of iºn of an ampere, -and the mean potential-difference
between the electrodes in volts.
   From these figures we see that there is very little, if any,
change of deflexion with pressure so long as the current in
the discharge is kept constant, but that the deflexion increases
 with the current whether the pressure of the gas is kept
constant or not; the increase in the deflexion, as measured by
the increased curvature of the path of the discharge, is not,
however, proportional to the increase of the mean current in
the discharge. Figs. 8 and 9 also show that the deflexion
is independent of the potential-difference between the electrodes
of the discharge.
    The magnetic force deflecting the discharge in these expe
riments was nearly one C.G.S. unit, and the frequency of
discharge was about 60 per sec.
              Tension in the Gas carrying a Discharge.
    The part played by the gas in modifying the deflexion of
the discharge through it could be readily explained by sup
posing that the dissociated molecules or ions in the gas along
 the line of discharge are polarized and held in line by a sort
 of tension, this tension being different for different gases; on
 this assumption, the greater the tension in any gas the less
 would be the deflexion.
    Assuming the path of the discharge to be held in position
 in this manner, and to be deflected like an elastic string by
 a uniform force everywhere perpendicular to the element of

          Force of the Electric Discharge through Gases.      437
the string on which it acts, we have the following formula
connecting the tension T along the discharge with r, the
radius of curvature of the deflected path,
                              T= F. r,
where F= the force deflecting the path of the discharge at
any point                           -
                               =C. f.
where C is the current in the discharge, and f is the magnetic
force at right angles to the discharge.
    If C, r, and fare expressed in C.G.S. units, T in the above
 formula will be given in dynes.
    On calculating T, however, for different values of C and r
 obtained by experiment, the values were found to differ widely
 for the same gas.
          The Nature of the Deflerion by Magnetic Force.
    From the behaviour of the discharge when the magnetic
field was suddenly made, or being made was quickly reversed
 in direction, it seemed more probable that the deflexion of the
discharge by magnetic force was due to the same cause as
 that produced by the convection-currents in the gas, and that
in either case the path of the discharge was determined by the
line of least resistance through the gas between the electrodes.
 The discharge could hardly be deflected in the form shown in
 figs. 6, 7, or 18 if it were held in position by a tension along
 the line of discharge.
    It is well known that the electromotive force required to
 maintain a discharge in a rarefied gas is not nearly so great
 as that required to start it, since the molecules of the gas
dissociated or ionized by the first discharge leave, as it were,
a thread of conducting material between the electrodes, along
which succeeding discharges pass much more easily than
through fresh gas. When this thread of ionized gas is dis
placed by any means—e. g. magnetic force acting on the
charged and moving particles of the gas, or by currents in the
gas itself due to any cause and blowing across the electrodes—
the discharge follows it, since the increase of the resistance
due to the increase in length of the displaced path is more
than compensated for by the greater conductivity in this
direction.
    If, however, the time between successive discharges is so
great that the thread of ionized gas produced by one discharge
becomes dissipated, or is destroyed in any way, before the
next discharge takes place, then we should expect no deflexion

438       Mr. J. Henry on the 19eflexion by Magnetic
from any cause unless each discharge lasted a sensible time
(‘Recent Researches,” p. 105, par. 90).
   Support is given to this view by the fact observed throughout
the experiments, that when the discharge was vertical a hori
zontal magnetic force always increased the potential-difference
between the electrodes of the discharge, this increase being
greatest when the deflexion of the discharge was greatest—
the mean potential-difference was increased in some cases
from 1000 to 1100 volts, while in hydrogen, where the de
flexion was hardly visible, the same magnetic force produced
no perceptible increase in the potential-difference, as mea
sured by the electrostatic voltmeter used. When the discharge
was horizontal and at right angles to the magnetic force, the
potential-difference between the electrodes was increased or
diminished according as the magnetic force increased or
diminished the deflexion of the discharge due to the convection
currents in the gas. In the latter case the magnetic force
shortened the length of the discharge, and at the same time
tended to keep the ionized gas together, thus reducing the
resistance, while it had the opposite effect in the former
Case.
   When the time between successive discharges was increased
by using a hand-break for the primary current in the induction
coil, the magnetic deflexion was diminished until, when the
discharge was separated by nearly a second or more, each
discharge began almost in the straight line between the
electrodes, and was broadened as shown in fig. 12, the ionized
gas being here deflected through the breadth of the band
 while the discharge lasted.
                              Fig. 12.
                  _*.
   To get a visible broadening the pressure of the gas in the
 discharge-tube had to be low enough to let the discharge last
some time: for high pressures of the gas the discharge passed
almost straight across.
                     Further Erperiments.
   To try if the current in the discharge as measured by the
galvanometer was proportional to the maximum current
during the discharge, a magnetizing-spiral was connected in
series with the discharge-tube; a bundle of steel wire carried
in the end of a glass tube could be slipped into this spiral and

          Force of the Electric Discharge through Gases.        439
then taken out and tested for its magnetism by an ordinary
magnetometer with lamp-and-scale arrangement.
   From these experiments it was found that the maximum
current in the discharge, as measured by its magnetizing
effect on the bundle of wire in the spiral, was not at all pro
portional to the average current measured by the galvano
meter. The experiments showed that while the maximum
current increased with the pressure of the gas in the discharge
tube, the average current, and with it the magnetic deflexion,
decreased.     Different kinds of wire, from soft iron to hard
steel, were used for testing the maximum current; but all
showed the same result.
    In order to increase considerably the maximum current in
the discharge without changing the pressure of the gas,
leyden-jars were connected across the electrodes as shown in
fig. 13.

    The effect of this arrangement was to increase very much
 the intensity of the discharge and its magnetizing power, but
 always to decrease the deflexion, whether caused by magnetic
 force or by convection-currents; this effect was increased by
 making a spark-gap in the discharge-circuit at a in the
 diagram (fig. 13).
     On examining this discharge in a rotating mirror I found
 that it was, so far as the mirror showed, instantaneous; and
 as the duration of the discharge, from these and previous
 experiments, seemed to be very closely connected with its

deflexion by magnetic force, experiments were next made to
 see how far this connexion went.
                      Details of Experiments.
    In these experiments the discharge-tube was placed between
the poles of a powerful electromagnet so that a very intense
magnetic field could be employed ; the discharge-circuit was
 arranged in four different ways, and for each the duration
and the deflexion of the discharge were observed, with the
 gas in the discharge-tube at different pressures.
    (1) The discharge-tube was connected directly with the
          terminals of the secondary of the induction-coil.
    (2) The same as (1), except that a spark-gap was made in
          one of the wires leading to the induction-coil.
    (3) The arrangement shown in fig. 13.
    (4) The same as (3), but with a spark-gap made in the
          circuit at the point marked a in the diagram (fig. 13).
   The duration of the discharge in each case was roughly
estimated by the extent of the broadening of the image in a
rotating mirror, and the magnetic deflexion by direct obser
vation.
                         Results obtained.
    In case (1) the deflexion produced by the magnetic force
was small for high pressures of the gas in the discharge-tube,
but increased greatly with a considerable broadening of the
discharge as the pressure of the gas fell.         -
   The duration of the discharge also increased as the pressure
of the gas fell, and the broadening of the discharge, seen in
the rotating mirror, seemed proportional to that produced by
the magnetic force. For high pressures of the gas the
discharge seemed instantaneous.                             -
   (2) The external spark-gap always diminished the deflexion
greatly, but did not entirely destroy it, except for very high
pressures of the gas in the discharge-tube. The effect of the
spark-gap was greater the greater its length.
   The appearance of this discharge in the rotating mirror was
a bright line followed by a fainter band of varying breadth,
depending inversely on the length of the spark-gap and the
pressure of the gas in the discharge-tube. This fainter portion
of the discharge was always more deflected than the bright
part, and the latter was not sensibly broadened either by the
magnet or by the mirror.
   (3) Here the discharge for high pressures of the gas was
practically instantaneous; no broadening could be seen in the
rotating mirror, and the magnetic deflexion vanished. The

          Force of the Electric Discharge through Gases.    441
discharge in this case was intensely bright, and <U+017F>º the
usual candle-spectrum of the gas in the discharge-tube.
    As the gas was pumped out of the tube the appearance of
the discharge changed gradually from being very bright,
white, and sharply defined, to being dull, reddish coloured for
air, and “fuzzy,” its deflexion by magnetic force and also its
duration increasing at the same time.
    This discharge was separated both by the magnet and by
the rotating mirror into two parts, the first being very bright,
least deflected by the magnet, and lasting a very short time;
the next not so bright, reddish coloured for air, deflected and
broadened by the magnet, and of much longer duration than
the first.
    The  º as deflected by magnetic force is shown in
 fig. 14; the heavy line represents the bright part of the
 discharge, the hatched portion of the figure the fainter but

 represent the undeflected discharge as seen in the rotating
 mirror if the heavy line were straight instead of curved.
    As the pressure of the gas in the discharge-tube was lowered
 still further the discharge became uniform in appearance, both
 in the mirror and in the magnetic field, while the deflexion as
 well as the broadening and the duration of the discharge
 increased.
     (4) In this case no deflexion could be observed at any
 pressure when the spark-gap was of sufficient length to ensure
 the whole discharge     |...";   at once; for very low pressures
 of the gas in the discharge-tube the capacity of the jars had
 to be increased, as changing the length of the spark-gap alone
 was not sufficient to prevent the discharge    ºil.   out.
     In any of the above experiments a discharge that could be
 sensibly broadened in the rotating mirror was always deflected
 by the magnetic force.
     The frequency of the discharge was about fifteen per second.
     In an experiment arranged as in case (3) above the pressure
 of the gas was gradually reduced, until the coil was just able
 to send a discharge that was drawn out a little in the rotating
 mirror, and that had a slightly “ fuzzy ” appearance; but when
 the discharge passed for a little time it º changed into a
  bright sharp discharge, not visibly broadened in the rotating

442        Mr. J. Henry on the Deflecion by Magnetic
mirror. The magnetic force deflected this discharge at first,
but immediately it changed its appearance it fell back to the
straight line between the electrodes. . The change in the
character of the discharge was evidently due to the increase
of pressure in the discharge-tube caused by the heating of
part of the gas, as letting more gas into the tube would have
produced the same changes. This experiment was repeated
several times, but always with the same result: after stopping
the discharge for a few seconds, it always started again as
at first.
   In hydrogen the deflexion is very small, but as in other
gases it increases, though slowly, as the pressure of the gas
falls. For the lowest pressure obtained—less than one millim.
of mercury—the deflexion was very much greater than for
pressures of one or two centims., yet it was not nearly so great
as that obtained in air or carbonic acid gas for the same
  ressure.
   The discharge in hydrogen, when examined in the rotating
 mirror, showed no appreciable broadening until the pressure
of the gas in the discharge-tube was reduced sufficiently to
allow a decided magnetic deflexion, and as the pressure was
lowered still further, the broadening of the discharge in the
mirror, as well as the magnetic deflexion, continued to increase.
                     Jºrplanation of Results.
   These experiments point to the conclusion that the influence
of the gas on the deflexion of the discharge in it is indirect.
In any of the gases used, when precautions were taken to make
the discharge abrupt, and to prevent it trailing out at the
end, no deflexion could be observed, even in a very stron
magnetic field produced by a large electromagnet wit
conical pole-pieces, the discharge-tube used in this case being
small—one inch in diameter—to allow the pole-pieces to be
brought near together, so as to increase the magnetic force
between them. But when the discharge was allowed to pass
in the ordinary way, the deflexion always increased as the
discharge became less abrupt and more prolonged as the pres
sure of the gas in the discharge-tube fell.
   A very important factor in determining the magnitude of
the deflexion in any gas for a given frequency of discharge,
was its duration, the quantity of electricity carried by the dis
charge being of little importance.
   This was shown by a comparison of the deflexions obtained
in the experiments, case (4) above ; when the pressure of the
gas in the discharge-tube was high, and a small leyden-jar
was used instead of the two shown in fig. 13, the quantity of

         Force of the Electric Discharge through Gases.       443
electricity carried by each discharge was very small, even
when the pressure of the gas was low enough to allow the
discharge to be appreciably deflected ; but when the pressure
of the gas was low and several large jars were used instead
of the one small one, the quantity of electricity carried by
each discharge through the gas was very much greater than
in the former case, as was shown by the galvanometer, still
the discharge was not visibly deflected ; while the discharge
carrying much less electricity in the former case, but lasting
a longer time, as was shown by the rotating mirror, was
deflected. When jars were used without any spark-gap, as
in case (3) above, the first part of the discharge, which carried
 the charge of the jars connected across the electrodes, was
always least deflected (see fig. 14), while the less intense but
more prolonged parts were always more deflected.
    As the duration of the discharge in any gas depends on
the pressure of the gas, the conclusion might seem to be at
 variance with the results of previous experiments, where it
 was shown that the deflexion was independent of the pressure
 of the gas, provided the current in the discharge was kept
 constant; but in those experiments, to keep the current in the
 discharge constant when the pressure of the gas was lowered,
 a very large resistance had to be introduced into the discharge
 circuit, and this added resistance had the same effect in
 shortening the time of discharge as the reduction of the
 pressure had in increasing it : that adding resistance to the
 circuit had the effect of shortening the time of discharge was
 shown by the rotating mirror. In the experiments referred
 to, an increase of current in the discharge was always accom
 panied by an increase in its duration.

 the deflexion of the discharge should be influenced by the

 dissociated or ionized gas left by one discharge scatters rapidly
 through the tube owing to diffusion, so that the conductivity
 along this path for the next discharge rapidly falls; and if the
 diffusion is very rapid, the path of least resistance for each
 discharge, may be the shortest one, i.e. the straight line
 between the   idºl. as in the case when         the frequency of
 the discharge was made very small,

444         Mr. J. Henry on the Deflexion by Magnetic
        (2) The Rate of Recombination of the Ionized Gas.
    The recombination of the gas ionized by a discharge has
much the same effect as diffusion in destroying the conduc
tivity of the gas between successive discharges, rapid recom
bination acting like rapid diffusion.
              (3) The Velocity of the Ions in the Gas.
    The velocity of the ions in the gas under an electromotive
force has an effect similar to (1) and (2), since the ions will
be pulled towards the electrodes between successive discharges,
thus destroying the conductivity of the path through the gas;
the greater the velocity of the ions the less would be the
conductivity of the ionized gas left by a discharge for the
following one.
    For high pressures of the gas in the discharge-tube the
effect of the velocity of the ions should be more marked, when
an induction-coil is used to send the discharge. In this
case the coil will only send a discharge for a break of the
primary, while for the make there is an electromotive force
acting on the gas between the electrodes pulling in the ions,
though no discharge passes to renew the supply.
                (4) The Duration of the Discharge.
    The time given for causes (1), (2), and (3) to destroy the
conductivity of the gas for a given frequency of discharge, is
diminished by the length of time each discharge lasts, so that
the greater the duration of each discharge the less will be the
effect of (1), (2), and (3) in destroying the conductivity of
the gas between successive discharges. For very low pressures
of the gas in the discharge-tube, the time each discharge lasts,
as shown by a rotating mirror, is a big part of the interval
between two discharges produced by an induction-coil.
(5) The Conductivity of the Gas after a Discharge has passed
       through it, relative to that of the same Gas before the
       Discharge.
     If a gas suffers little change from the passage of a dis
 charge through it, and if its resistance to the first discharge
 is little greater than it is to succeeding discharges, then the
   ath of the discharge should never be much deflected from the
 straight line between the electrodes, as the length of the path
 of least resistance for the discharge through the gas cannot
 in this case be much increased.
     In hydrogen, for example, the potential-difference required
 to maintain a discharge between a pair of electrodes is much

          Force of the Electric Discharge through Gases.     445
 greater than that required in nitrogen or carbon monoxide
 (Recent Researches, p. 152, par. 150), although the potential
difference . to begin the discharge is much less in
hydrogen than in these gases. This effect, in hydrogen, may,
however, be due to the very rapid scattering of the ionized gas
produced by a discharge, from causes (1), (2) and (3) men
tioned above.
   The less a gas is ionized by a discharge through it, the less
should its resistance be diminished for succeeding discharges,
and the less should the discharge in it be capable of being
deflected.
   The resistance of the gas in the discharge-tube to the
 discharge passing through it will affect its duration, since
the coil will continue to send the discharge until the potential
 difference between its terminals has fallen so much that it is
not able any longer to force the current over the opposing
resistance.                                                -
               The Discharge in Mercury Vapour.
   As it seemed probable that a monatomic gas would be less
broken up, and would consequently have its resistance less
changed, by the passage of a discharge through it than other
gases, an experiment was made to try the effect of magnetic
 force in deflecting the discharge in mercury vapour.
    To procure a good mercury vacuum, a tube of the form
 shown in fig. 15 (see p. 446) was employed. The vacuum-tube
 was partly filled with clean mercury m, and connected by the
 tube d to a mercury air-pump with the capillary tube c in a
 vertical position ; the end of e dipped under mercury in the
test-tube e as shown ; c was more than 76 centims, long.
   The vacuum was made by pumping until no more air could
be got out, then the mercury in the tube was heated and
slowly distilled for about two hours, the air-pump being
worked at the same time.
   While the mercury was being distilled, the discharge was
kept going by an induction-coil and the platinum electrodes
a, b were raised several times to a white heat, to drive out
any gas occluded in them.      The vacuum-tube was then sealed
off the air-pump at the constriction d, left for the purpose.
   After distilling the mercury left in the bulb for about three
hours more, so as to get rid of any traces of air left in it, the
bulb was then placed between the poles of the electromagnet
used in previous experiments, with the direction of discharge
horizontal and perpendicular to the magnetic force. The
mercury was then heated, and the effect of the magnet on the

discharge between the electrodes, sent by an induction-coil,
noted. The pressure of the mercury vapour in the bulb was
first raised as high as possible by heating, and then allowed
to fall by cooling the bulb, but in no case was the discharge
very much deflected. The discharge was bent upwards a little
by the vertical current of vapour.
   The experiment showed that the deflexion of the discharge
in mercury vapour was very much less than in air or carbonic
 acid gas for low pressures, and seemed even less than in
hydrogen.

             Comparison of Theory with Experiment.

 with which careful experiments were made, we find the mag

    netic deflexion of the discharge in hydrogen very small, in
   air many times larger, but less than in carbonic acid gas.
       This is what the explanation given above would lead one to
   expect, since all the causes mentioned above as tending to
   prevent deflexion are, so far as we know them, greatest for
   hydrogen and least for carbonic acid gas.
      In this connexion I may mention that McClelland finds
  the velocity of the ions produced by an electric discharge
  many times—five or six—greater in air than in carbonic
   acid gas, and though he has not yet made a determination
   for hydrogen, there is no doubt the velocity of the ions in it
   is much greater than in any other gas. Cf. the velocities
   found by Rutherford for the ions produced by Röntgen rays
   (Phil. Mag. vol. xliv. p. 434, 1897).
             Eaperiments on the Frequency of Discharge.
      In most of the above experiments, in order to make the
  discharge as steady and regular as possible, a tuning-fork
  mercury interrupter was employed for breaking the current
  in the primary of the induction-coil, instead of the ordinary
  vibrating contact interrupter belonging to the coil.
      Some experiments were made to find whether, by increasing
  the pitch of the fork used for interrupting the current in the
  primary coil circuit, the frequency of the discharge could not
 be increased sufficiently to enable even the abrupt, short dis
 charges to be deflected. . These experiments, however, were
 not a success, as the induction-coil would not work with a
 fork making more than about 120 complete vibrations per
 second, and for a fork of this pitch the action of the coil was
 very weak, even when a dangerously high electromotive force
 was used in the primary circuit. The vibration frequency of
 the interrupter belonging to the coil was about 60 per second.
     In these abrupt discharges the time between successive dis
 charges is practically the same as the time of vibration of the
 interrupter in the primary circuit of the induction-coil, since
 each discharge is almost instantaneous, whereas in the ordinary
 discharge the current begins gradually in the discharge-tube,
rises to a maximum, and falls away gradually again, in accord
 with the rise and fall of electromotive force in the secondary
of the coil. In this way the interval between successive dis
charges during which the ionized path through the gas may
be destroyed is diminished, and when the resistance in the
discharge circuit is small—when the pressure of the gas in
the discharge-tube is low—this interval may become small
compared with the time of vibration of the interrupter in the
  rimary-coil circuit.

448        Mr. J. Henry on the Deflerion by Magnetic
    That this is the case is shown pretty clearly by Fed
dersen’s observations (Pogg. Ann, ciii. p. 69, 1858) on the
appearance presented by a succession of sparks in a revolving
 mirror, when a blast of air was directed across the electrodes
 (Recent Researches, p. 132, par. 128).
    Feddersen's sparks were obtained from the oscillatory dis
 charge of leyden-jars, and the blast was simply that caused
 by the rotation of the mirror. Each discharge gave a series
 of sparks following one another very rapidly, the sparks at
 the beginning of each series being less separated in the
  revolving mirror than those towards the end of the series.
      In these experiments the first spark in each discharge was
  observed to pass straight between the electrodes, while the
  succeeding ones were more and more bent by the blast, as
  shown in fig. 16: this figure gives the appearance presented
  by the sparks at different parts in the series of oscillations
  forming one discharge; a is the beginning of the series, and
  b the end.
   0.                           Fig. 16.                         b
       These observations show that between successive discharges
   the ionized gas was blown away or scattered, so that each dis
   charge found it easier to begin along the straight path ; but
   the interval between successive sparks in the same discharge
   was so small that the thread of ionized gas was bent only a
   little more by the blast each time while it retained its con
   ductivity ; the increase in the deflexion between successive
   sparks, especially at the beginning of a series, was very small,
   but before the end of a series was reached the bending was
   very evident, as at b, fig. 16.
        When the electrodes of the secondary of an induction-coil
   are placed near enough together to form an arc, the gentle
    current of air across the electrodes produced by the heat of
    the discharge bends the are upwards; if the current of air
    be much increased, instead of bending the are still more it
    will destroy the are altogether, and the discharge will pass as
    a spark straight between the electrodes with an aureole blown
    aside. A olast of air is used to destroy in this way the
    sparking at the commutators in some dynamos.

         Force of the Electric Discharge through Gases.      449
   The spark-discharge of the induction-coil is not visibly bent
by a blast. The blowing-out of the discharge was frequently
observed during the experiments on the deflexion by mag
netic force (p. 433 above).
  An interesting case, showing the similarity between the
action of magnetic force and of convection-currents in the
gas, in deflecting the discharge, is shown in figs. 17 and 18.
                             Fig. 17.

   The large discharge-tube was filled with air, and exhausted
until the coil was just able to send the discharge—the direction
of the discharge was horizontal—when it was found that
instead of remaining permanently deflected, the path of the
discharge rose and fell; the first discharge was nearly
straight, the second was more bent, and so on for four or five
discharges, as shown in    #. 18, the discharge then fell to the
straight line as if it had been blown out, and was blown aside
again, the convection-currents in the gas being too strong to
allow the discharge to preserve a permanent path.
                            Fig. 18.

   In fig, 17 the pressure of the gas was reduced until the dis
charge passed freely, and maintained a permanent path deflected
by convection-currents, as b, fig. 17, only turned upwards,
the convection-currents being always vertical.
   Now when the magnetic field was made so as to bend the
discharge upwards still more, it presented the appearance
shown in fig. 17, a. The discharge rises and falls as before,
the increase in the blast across the electrodes due to the mag
netic field being sufficient to blow out the ionized path.
When the magnetic force deflected the discharge downwards
against the convection-currents, the discharge passed steadily,
as shown at b, fig. 17.

450       Mr. J. Henry on the Deflerion by Magnetic
   Experiments in Blowing the Discharge in a Rarefied Gas.
   Experiments were made to see if the discharge in hydrogen,
at pressures less than atmospheric, could not be blown aside,
as it was in other gases by the convection-currents in them
due to the heat of the discharge.
   For this purpose the tube shown in fig. 19 was employed.
                              Fig. 19.

The discharge passed across the tube, between the aluminium
electrodes a and b; the diameter of the tube was 2.5 centim.,
and the ends of the tube were drawn out, so that rubber
pressure-tubing could be slipped on them ; in this way the
end c of the tube was connected through a stop-cock k (not
shown in fig.) to a large vessel A of 2045 cub. centim. capacity,
and the end d to a large vessel B, and to the air-pump and
manometer.
   To begin an experiment the tube and vessels connected
with it were filled with the gas to be experimented with, then
the stop-cock k was closed and the gas pumped out of the tube
and vessel B.
   A current of gas could now be blown across the electrodes
by opening the stop-cock k, the strength of the blast depend
ing on the difference of pressures between the gas in A and
that in B.                               -                   -
   In this way the discharge in air or carbonic acid gas could
be blown aside very readily when the pressure of the gas in
the tube was not high enough to make the discharge pass as
a bright sharp spark. By partially exhausting A, and then
further exhausting B, the mean pressure of the gas in the
discharge-tube while the blast through it lasted could be varied
at pleasure.
   When the gas used was hydrogen, the blast across the elec
trodes when the stop-cock k was opened bent the discharge
very slightly for any pressure of the gas in the discharge
tube. A strong blast had less effect than a rather gentle one :
cf. the blowing out of an arc mentioned above.
   By filling the vessel A and the tube with gas, vessel B
being cut off, and then steadily pumping, the stop-cock k

being open, while the discharge passed between the elec
trodes, the effect of the current of gas across the electrodes
produced in this way was observed for all pressures of the
gas in the discharge-tube : of course the blast through the
discharge diminished with the pressure of the gas and finally
vanished.
   When air or carbonic acid gas was used, the deflexion pro
duced in this way was at first nothing, but gradually increased,
attained a maximum, and then died away again as the vessel
A became exhausted. In hydrogen the deflexion produced
was always very small, and the maximum deflexion was pro
duced after exhaustion had gone much further than in the
case of air or carbonic acid gas, and consequently when the
blast was weaker.
   The velocity of the blast in air through the discharge-tube
produced by this pumping method was about 2 centim. per
second, when the pressure of the gas was about 14 centim. of
mercury, and the discharge was bent as shown in fig. 21,
though hardly so much.
  The velocity of the blast in hydrogen, for about the same
pressure of the gas, was 3 centim. per second, but the
deflexion produced in the path of the discharge was hardly
perceptible ; blasts of smaller velocities for different pressures
were also used, in addition to the strong blasts obtained by
the first method, i.e. by exhausting vessel B, and then opening
the stop-cock k until the pressures in A and B became equal
by a flow of gas through the discharge-tube, but in no case
was the discharge in hydrogen much deflected.

   Fig. 20 shows the deflexion in hydrogen, about the maxi
mum observed. Fig. 21 shows the deflexion in air, the
actual deflexion was even greater in some cases.
   When the blast through the discharge-tube was ver
strong, the deflexion in either air or hydrogen diminished.

452 On the Deflecion of the Electric Discharge through Gases.
and the discharge became unsteady, as shown in figs. 17 and
18. The blast required to produce this effect for a given
pressure of the gas was much less in hydrogen than in air.
    From these experiments it is quite clear that the ionized
path produced by a discharge is dissipated much more
 rapidly in hydrogen than in air or carbonic acid gas, other
 wise the path of the discharge should be bent as the ionized
 gas is blown aside.
                             Conclusion.
    The experiments described in this paper show that the
 deflexion of the electric discharge by magnetic force, and the
 deflexion of the discharge by a blast across the electrodes, are
 affected by the gas through which the discharge passes in
 exactly the same way ; and that the properties of a gas on
 which the magnitude of the deflexion of the discharge in it
 depends are as stated at length on pages 443 and 444:—
     (1) The rate of diffusion of the gas.
     (2) The rate of recombination of the gas ionized by a dis
          charge.
     (3) The velocity of the ions in the gas under an electro
          motive force.
     (4) The duration of the discharge.
     (5) The relative resistance of the gas to the passage of
          electricity through it before, and after, a discharge
          has passed.
     Also for a given gas, the greater the frequency of the dis
  charge the more readily is the discharge deflected, the
  deflexion vanishing for very slow rates of discharge.
     For discharges following one another with very great
  rapidity we should still expect to get the magnitude of the
  deflexion produced by magnetic force, or by a blast, different
  in different gases unless (5) above is the same in all gases.
     In conclusion I desire to acknowledge my indebtedness to
  Professor Thomson for the valuable assistance his suggestions
  have afforded me.

TH: diffusion of a subtance through          a liquid, e.g. water,
       may be regarded as merely the transmission of the sub
stance through the stationary water.
   If the solution of the substance has a density different from
that of water, depending on its strength, the act of diffusion
tends to alter the density at any point; in general this
tendency to alter the density prevents the possibility of
statical equilibrium and hence convection-currents are
produced.
   So far as the author is aware the only case in which
diffusion of the substance can take place without the pro
duction of convection-currents is that in which diffusion takes
place along a perfect cylinder, the generating lines of which
are truly vertical.
   The determination of the magnitude of the convection
currents is, in general, a difficult task, involving, as it does,
hydrodynamics as well as diffusion.
   The present contribution determines the magnitude of the
convection in a simple case, which arose in connexion with
an attempt to devise an apparatus for the accurate deter
 mination of the coefficient of diffusion of copper sulphate

equation

   Since P, exceeds Pl, if the tap be opened liquid will flow
from the right to the left.
   If the tap be now closed, the diffusion will again attain a
steady state, and the same inequality of pressure will
 be developed as before. The tap may again be opened and
SO On.
   It is not necessary, however, to have a tap at C ; if there
is no obstacle whatever between B and N a steady flow will
take place down MN and up AB.
   The irregularity between AB and MN produces, as we
have seen, a pressure tending to produce circulation. On the
assumption that the density is the same at all points of a
horizontal layer, the magnitude of this pressure in dynes per
square centim. equals

462         Mr. A. Griffiths on Diffusive Convection.
   To take a definite example let
                         R=0:1 centim.,
                         m =0,1324,
                         T=0.1,
                         k = 2.47 x 10-9,
                         L = 4 centim.
   Then f= 10,000, and a study of the deviation shows that it
is practically nil, except when r is nearly equal to R; in which
case it equals
                        e<U+017F>"-") approximately.
   To make it equal to 0-001, r must equal 0:09931, and it is
clear that, on the assumptions made, the effect of the viscosity
is to produce variations in the average flow of only a fraction
of a per cent. With tubes of ordinary calibre, no appreciable
error is made if the viscosity be neglected altogether. The
expressions also show that the tubes would have to be very
narrow to affect the magnitude of the diffusive convection to
any appreciable extent.
   Another method of showing that very little error is made
by neglecting the viscosity is to obtain an expression for the
average velocity.

   The upper extremities of two tubes, A and B, of equal
diameter   |. slightly unequal in length, terminate in com
partments connected by a capillary tube CD.
   Any motion down B and up A is magnified in the pro
portion of the sectional area of A or B to the sectional area
of the capillary tube.
   The motion along CD is detected by the addition of
copying-ink or other colouring matter. To introduce the
ink, the taps E and H are closed, G and F opened, and the
ink poured down F.
   Owing to viscosity the velocity of the liquid at the centre
is double the average velocity.
   In the experiments, the results of which are recorded
below, the tubes A, B, &c. were filled with water and placed
in a strong solution of º sulphate, the taps E, F, G,

and a rush would doubtless occur along CD. After some
time, perhaps 5 or 10 minutes, the taps E and H were closed,
and the ink added.
    The chief data are as follows:—
       Diameter of A or B = 1.09 centim. approximately.
       Diameter of capillary =0.019 centim. approximately.
       Height of top of B above top of A                = 0.08 centim.
       Height of bottom of Babove bottom of A=0.292 centim.
       Length of A=4622 centim.
        Length of B-4-410 centim.
    The motion of the centre of the liquid in the capillary is
indicated in the table below.

    If a curve be drawn with hours as abscissae, and the dis
 tance moved as ordinates, a regular diminution of the flow
 is indicated, the velocity tending to a steady value. The
average velocity in the last three days was 2.5 centim. per day.
    Calculations made on the principles indicated in the previous
section give about 8 centim. per day as the velocity.
    The observed velocity is thus three times the calculated.
As the apparatus when originally put together was only
intended to give qualitative results, it would be premature
 to discuss the cause of the difference *.
    After the above observations had been made, the tube B
 was lowered with respect to A ; the flow along the capillary
 from left to right was stopped, and there was probably a flow
 in the opposite direction. (The ink is not adapted for
 for detecting slight backward motions.)
    A second apparatus made by Mr. Rixon was fitted up, and
 a solution of common salt employed. Currents were produced
 in the direction indicated by theory. This new apparatus is
 capable of delicate adjustment, and experiments with it are
 still in progress. To the author the interest lies not so much
 in the confirmation of the theory as in the possibility of a
 physical method of determining the coefficient of diffusion.
   * Note added July 15th, 1898. Later experiments indicate that the
 difference between the calculated and observed velocities in the above
 was due to the continual increase of density of the solution owing to
 evaporation of water at the surface. On covering the surface with oil, to
 prevent evaporation, the observed and calculated values are found to be
 close enough to prove the substantial truth of the theory. Thus in one
experiment, the observed motion of the index, at the end of a fortnight, was
 23 centim. per day, whereas theory indicates that the final velocity should
 be 2:1 centim. per day.

            On the Hall Effect in a Binary Electrolyte.            465
     A theoretical consideration suggested by the phenomena of
  diffusive convection may not be uninteresting.
     As the water flows along the capillary, friction occurs and
  heat is produced. Ultimately the dissolved salt mingles com
  pletely with the water. Instead of allowing the flow to occur
  along the capillary the tap E or H might be closed. The
  dissolved salt would then mingle completely with the water
  without producing any flow, and the final state (assuming the
  apparatus is thermally insulated) is exactly the same as before.
     Now the principle of the conservation of energy indicates
  that the heat produced in the capillary plus the heat developed
  by the mixing of the solution with water is a constant.
     Does not this indicate that the heat produced on mixing a
  solution with water depends on how the mixing takes place 2
  Is the matter connected with a sort of surface-tension existing
  in the spaces between a strong and weak solution?
   XLVII. Theory of the Hall Effect in a Binary Electrolyte.
                 By F. G. DoNNAN, M.A., Ph.D.”
 IN     1883 Roiti f investigated the subject of a possible Hall
       effect in electrolytic solutions, but failed to obtain any
 positive result. Recently, however, the question has been
 taken up by Bagard f, who has obtained very considerable
 effects in aqueous solutions of zinc and copper sulphates. On
 the other hand, negative results have been obtained by Florio S,
 and as both Bagard and Florio maintain the correctness of
 their experimental work, a polemic on the subject has arisen
 between them.       In this condition of affairs it seemed worth
 while to examine what effect might be expected theoretically.
 With this purpose in view I made the calculation contained
in the following pages. Subsequently I discovered that a
similar theory had been given by Van Everdingen, jun.|; but
as I do not arrive at quite the same results, and have considered
the subject somewhat more generally, it seemed to me not to
be needless repetition to communicate this note.
    The basis of the following calculation may be stated briefly
as follows. The diagram shows the directions of the primary
current and the magnetic field. The lines of flow of the
primary current are supposed to be straight and the magnetic

466                  Dr. F. G. Donnan on the
field everywhere uniform. The effect of the ponderomotive
forces on the moving ions in the magnetic field is to urge
both positive and negative ions in the positive direction of 2.
The moving ions will thus acquire component velocities in
this direction, and these velocities being in general different
for each sort of ion, the result is the separation of positive
and negative charges, whereby a potential-gradient is set up
in the direction of the z-axis which reduces the originally
unequal velocities to equality. We thus obtain a flow of
ionic matter in the positive z-direction. This produces in
its turn a reverse osmotic gradient or concentration-fall both
for dissociated and undissociated salt. The stationary state
is finally attained when the net flux of ionic matter in the
positive direction of z is balanced by the flux of undissociated
salt in the opposite direction.

    Now an ion with a positive charge we moving with a velocity

 force in the positive 2 direction equal to weWH; so that the

favour of the negative results obtained by Roiti and Florio :
and it would therefore seem that Bagard has measured a phe

XLVIII. On the Admissille Width of the Slit in Interference
            Eaperiments. By JAMES WALKER, M.A.f
 1.   IN   a paper published in the Philosophical Magazine for
          August 1889, Lord Rayleigh has discussed the question
 of the admissible width of the slit forming the proximate
source of light in interference experiments, and has pointed
 out that “In Fresnel's experiment, whether carried out with
 mirrors or with biprism . . . the condition for distinctness is
simply that the width of the slit be a small proportion of the
width of the bands f.” This rule, which applies to the case
in which the variation of the width of the bands is produced
by a change in the mirrors or biprism, the distances of
the slit and screen of observation from the apparatus
 remaining constant, requires modification when it is the
 variation of the distances that causes the alteration of the
 width of the bands, the apparatus remaining otherwise
 unchanged ; for it is an experimental fact that in this latter
 case, as the bands become finer, the slit may be made wider
 without loss of distinctness. A more detailed investigation
 leads to this result, and shows moreover that a progressive
 widening of the slit causes a periodic disappearance of the
 bands, the system of bands at the successive reappearances
 being alternately bright and dark centred $.
     2. We require first the relative retardation at a point of
the screen of observation of the streams emanating from any
point of the slit.

 mirrors be the axis of y, and let the axis of 2 be taken so as

    § I find that this result of the progressive widening of the slit has
already been given by M. Ch. Fabry in his thesis for the degree of Doctor

aware of this interesting work until my paper was in type.

then the equations of the planes of the mirrors may be

    Suppose the slit perpendicular to the plane through the
centre of the slit and the line of intersection of the mirrors,
it edges being perpendicular to the plane of w2, and let a be
the distance of the central line of the slit from the axis of y.
The coordinates of a point of the slit distant # from this
central line are

by + sin (Tyk/x)/(Tyk/A); this vanishes when yk/A is "
integer, while the maxima of distinctness occur when

   small fraction of 8A/y, and referring to the results obtained
   above, we see that in the case of Fresnel’s mirrors, and in
   the cases of the biprism and of the divided lens when the
   thickness is neglected, 8/y-a/b, so that the condition for
   maximum distinctness is that the width of the slit must be a
   small fraction of a/b times the width of the bands, where
   a and b are the distances of the interference apparatus from
   the slit and screen of observation respectively".
      In the case of the biprism when its thickness is neglected,
   if a and b alone vary, their sum remaining constant, a M.
   is constant, and hence, in order that the distinctness may
  remain unchanged, the width of the slit must be inversely as
   b, that is the narrower the bands, the greater the admissible
  width of the slit.
      Starting from the case of maximum distinctness and
  gradually increasing the width of the slit, we see that the
  interference-bands will become less and less distinct; they
  then vanish and reappear again in the complementary
  position, since sin (Tyk/A)/(Tyk/A) changes sign on passing
  through the value zero, and increase in distinctness up to a
  maximum which is about a fifth of the prime maximum of
  distinctness, and so on.
      An interesting method of observing this phenomenon is to
  allow white light to pass and to subsequently analyse the
  mixture by a spectroscope with its slit placed at right angles
  to the interference-bands. When the source of light is a
  narrow slit, the ordinary fan-like appearance is obtained,
  that is a spectrum traversed by slightly curved bands running
  more or less along the spectrum and approaching one another
  towards the violet end. As the source of light is gradually
  made wider the bands become less distinct, the distinctness
 decreasing most rapidly at the violet end, until a region with
 no bands takes its rise at that end and passes along the
 spectrum to the red end, to be followed by a second such
 region and so on, the bands on the two sides of the bandless
 region being complementary.
     This method also affords a means of determining the “limit
 of visibility” for a given wave-length ; for by using a
 micrometer slit as the proximate source of light and adjusting
 its width until one of the limits of the bandless region
 coincides with a given Fraunhofer line, the quantities that
 occur in the expression for the visibility may be determined
    * In other words, the angle subtended by the slit at the interference
apparatus must be a small proportion of that subtended by the width of
. bands at the same point, a result that might be arrived at by
elementary reasoning.

different (Lord Rayleigh, loc. cit. p. 80). If { be the distance
of the luminous point from the plane of the mirror, the
 relative retardation of the reflected and direct streams at
a point of the screen distant a from its line of intersection
 with the plane of the mirror is (measured in length) 2+8/d,
where d is the distance of the luminous point from the screen,
 supposed at right angles to the plane of the mirror.

 plane of the mirror, the intensity due to the whole slit of

The visibility is here given by + sin (Trnk/c)/(Trnk/e), where
 n is the order of the bands, and the condition for maximum
 distinctness is that the width of the slit must be a small
 fraction of c/n, and thus depends upon the order of the bands:
 in other respects the phenomenon is the same as in the
 former cases.
    This dependence of the visibility on the order of the bands
 and their periodic disappearance may be observed with
 homogeneous light by leaving the width of the slit unaltered
 and moving backwards the eyepiece with which the bands
are observed, keeping it all the time in the doubly illuminated
field.
 XLIX. On the Distribution of Magnetic Induction in Straight
    Iron Rods. By J. L. W. GILL, B.A.Sc., 1851 Erhibition
    Scholar *.
      URING the summer and autumn of 1897 the author was
        engaged in working out the details of a new method
 of measuring magnetic hysteresis in iron. The fundamental
 principle of this method is the measurement of the mechanical
 work expended when a specimen of iron is passed through
a magnetic field (see ‘Electrician, Sept. 24, 1897).
                  * Communicated by the Author.

            Magnetic Induction in Straight Iron Rods.             479
    This method does not require specimens of any particular
dimensions or shape, but it is most convenient to use specimens
of round or square section, the length being less than thirty
times the section.
    It is well-known that when a specimen of iron of these
relative dimensions is placed in a magnetic field, the induction
varies greatly from i. centre to the end. It is therefore
obvious that in measuring the hysteresis loss by the method
above referred to, each part of the specimen passes through a
different cycle.                                                -
    Since the hysteresis loss is expressed in relation to the
amplitude or maximum induction of the cycle, it is necessary
to know the amplitude of the cycle (termed B, for reference)
through which the whole specimen would have to be taken to
 give the same loss as that measured. If the amplitudes of
 the cycles through which the different parts of the specimen
 pass are known, the value of B, can be easily calculated.
    It has been shown by Steinmetz, and confirmed by others,
 that the hysteresis loss can be expressed in relation to the
 amplitude B of the cycle by the equation
                             L= KB",
 L being the loss per cubic centimetre per cycle, and K a
 constant depending on the quality of the iron.
     From this equation it follows that if Li be the loss measured
 by the above method
                     Li=KB1*ls= KººBººdl,
 l being the length of the specimen, s the section, and dl the
 differential of the length.
     From the above equations

 When the specimen is in the centre of the field it is obvious
 that the induction in each part will be a maximum for that
  part. If therefore the distribution of induction when in this
  position is known, the value of B, can be calculated by
  equation (1).
     To determine the distribution of induction in a given speci
  men requires some time and is somewhat tedious.            It was
  therefore decided to carry out a series of experiments with a
  view of obtaining, if possible, the value of B, by a simple
  and direct method.
     The experiments consisted mainly in determining the dis
  tribution of induction in specimens when placed in a uniform
  field,

480         Mr. J. L. W. Gill on the Distribution of
   From the results obtained it is observed that for any speci
men the ratio of B, to B max. is constant as long as the centre
of the specimen is not saturated (B max. being the induction
at the centre). It is also observed that this ratio varies only by
a small amount for specimens of different relative dimensions,
and is constant for all specimens whose length is less than thirty
times the section.
   When this ratio is known, the value of BI may be deter
mined simply by measuring the induction at the centre of
the specimen.
   The value of this ratio for specimens whose length is less
than thirty times the section is 768.
   This method of obtaining the value of B1 can be applied
over the whole range of induction used in practical work,
since saturation does not begin below an induction density of
at least 10,000. While the main object of the experiments
 was to obtain if possible some simple relation of this kind,
 other interesting and useful results have been deduced from
 the observations.   These will be referred to later on.
                      Method of Observation.
   The induction was determined by measuring the induced
 current in a small search-coil C (see fig. 1) when the field      |
 was reversed.                                                     |

              D
    This coil was wound on an ebonite spool which could be
 moved along the specimen. A d’Arsonval ballistic galva
 nometer G was employed to measure the induced current.
    The scale of the galvanometer was calibrated relatively by

  means of a standard solenoid S (also used for magnetizing the
  specimen) and secondary coil A. This coil could be placed
  inside the solenoid coaxial with it, and its dimensions were
  accurately known. It was always in the galvanometer circuit
  and served to calibrate the galvanometer absolutely. This
  was done at the conclusion of taking each set of observations
  by removing the specimen from the solenoid and inserting
  the secondary coil. The advantage of this method of calibra
  tion is that the conditions of the calibration are the actual
 conditions of the experiment.
     Although it is generally assumed that the quantity of
  electricity discharged through a suspended coil ballistic
 galvanometer is proportional to the deflexion, it was found
 that for this particular galvanometer the correction was about
 2 per cent. positive for small deflexions, and 2% negative for
 large deflexions.
     This was no doubt due to the effect of damping, as there
 was a large air-vane fixed to the upper part of the coil and
 partially enclosed.
    The magnetizing current was measured by observing the
 fall of potential on a standard resistance K. This was done
 with a Weston direct-reading voltmeter which had been
 previously calibrated by a potentiometer and Clark cell in the
 usual way.
    The solenoid employed was 56 centim. long, 4.03 centim.
 mean diameter, and had 17-82 turns per centim.
    The specimen was kept central in the solenoid by means of
 an ebonite tube D, whose inside diameter was just large
enough to allow the specimen to pass inside, and the outside
diameter large enough to fit the solenoid tube closely. The
 larger part of the specimen was allowed to project from this
tube so that the search-coil could be placed in any position
 from the centre to the end. To the search-coil was attached
a small brass rod P, which projected beyond the end of the
solenoid. This rod served to move the search-coil along the
specimen, the outer end indicating on a suitably placed scale
    the position of the coil.
    The search-coil could thus be placed in any desired position.
    Prof. Fleming in a paper on “A Method of Measuring
Hysteresis Loss in Straight Iron Strips '' (Phil. Mag. Sept.
1897; Elec. Feb. 5–March 11, 1897), gives the results of a
series of experiments to determine the distribution of induction
in iron rods or bundles of strips cut from transformer plates.
The object of the experiments was to determine the value
of B. His method of measurement was to place the

     482         Mr. J. L. W. Gill on the Distribution of
     specimen in an alternating field and observe the R. M. S.
      ( Vmean square) difference of potential on the terminals of a
      small search-coil wound over the specimen.

      the specimen the induction at different sections was determined.

     From his experiments, Prof. Fleming deduced that at a
 point of the specimen whose distance from the centre is a
 certain fraction of the half-length, the induction is always
equal to B1.
    The author has found this to be true for any one specimen
as long as the centre of the specimen is not saturated, but as
the centre becomes saturated, the distance from the centre
where the induction is equal to B, increases.
    Fig. 2 shows this very plainly. The position of this point
for different inductions is indicated by a cross. Table I.
gives the observations which are shown in fig. 2.

    With regard to the relative position of this point for
different specimens, it was found that, this was the same .
for all specimens whose length is less than thirty times the
section, and that the relative distance from the centre in
creased as the ratio of length to section increased.
    This is shown by Table II., which gives the results obtained
from specimens whose length is greater than thirty times the
section.                                                                          -
    Prof. Fleming found this distance to be '56 of the half
length. The mean value deduced from Table III. for speci
mens whose length is less than thirty times the section is 564.
    While the variations from this value, as shown by Table III.,
are not more than 1 per cent., the error in the value of Bl
may be much greater than this, if obtained by measuring the
induction at this point as suggested by Prof. Fleming ; for
since the rate of variation of the induction along the specimen
at this point is great, a small error in placing the coil would
  ive a relatively large error in the result. If, on the other
fi. the induction at the centre of the specimen is measured,

484             Mr. J. L. W. Gill on the Distribution of
a small error in placing the coil will give practically no error
in the result.

 will be seen that the conditions which will give one result
 will also give the other. If the induction at different sections
 of the specimen change proportionately, the results above
 referred to must follow. |rom this hypothesis it follows that
 the functions of the field representing the induction at

   The latter part of equation (3) obviously represents the
induction at some definite point of the specimen, which is the
result deduced by Prof. Fleming.
   The induction at the centre of the specimen may be repre

   This is the result deduced by the author.
   For very short specimens it is well known that the functions
representing the induction at different sections are straight
lines below saturation.       In such cases the above results are
correct a priori. As the length of the specimen increases
these functions deviate from straight lines but are more or less
similar. It was to determine the range and limit of this
similarity that so many observations were taken.
   From the above equations it follows that similar relations
exist for any function of the induction.
   It has been found from the observations that the ratio of
the mean value of the induction to the maximum is 745.
   The effect of saturation can be seen most plainly by com
paring specimens Nos. 1 and 2, Table II. For specimen
No. 1 the value of K and the ratio of B, to B max. varies
from an induction of about 10,000, while for specimen No. 2
these ratios remain constant up to an induction of 14,000.
   From the B-H curves for the centre of these specimens,
shown in fig. 3, it will be seen that saturation begins at a
much lower value of the induction for specimen No. 1 than
for No. 2.
   This explains the difference referred to.
                Law of Distribution of Induction.
    Since a complete mathematical analysis of this problem is
 at present impossible, no attempt has been made to derive
 theoretical equations. Other writers have derived equations,
 but these are either based on hypotheses which are not
 altogether warrantable or are deduced by approximation.

     The first equation was given by Biot in his Traité de Phy
  sique, vol. iii. page 77 (1816). He obtained it by comparing a
  magnet to a dry electric pile. Green in his Essay derived a
  formula for the case of a long rod placed in a magnetic field
  parallel to the lines of force. His formula gives the same distri
  bution as that of Biot. Prof. Rowland, who has carried out a
  great many experiments on the distribution of magnetism, has

488         Mr. J. L. W. Gill on the Distribution of
derived a similar formula (Phil. Mag. (1875) vol. 1. pp. 257
and 348). He compared a rod magnetized by a helix to an
electric circuit. His formula is more general than the others,
but it cannot be said that it represents the real distribution
with any degree of accuracy, as his own observations show.
   From the experiments above described, it was found that
the linear distribution of free magnetism was almost the
same as in the case of an ellipsoid magnetized uniformly.
   In the case of the ellipsoid the equation relating the total
flux N at any section to its distance a from the centre is
                   (six)+(, ) = 1.             .   .   .   .   . (6)
N max. being the flux at the centre and a the semi-axis.
   If the leakage or circuital distribution of lines of force for
a bar of uniform section were the same as in the case of the
ellipsoid the distribution of induction would be represented
by the equation
                         B          a’ \?
                     (º) (...)  +         = 1,   .   .   .   .   (7)
a being a constant depending on the dimensions of the
specimen.
   A comparison of this equation with the curves of distribu
tion obtained from the experiments indicated that the real
distribution might be represented by an equation of the form
                     (#) + (i) =1 . . . . (8)
   Assuming as before that the functions of the field repre
senting the induction at different sections are similar (an
assumption which the results deduced above would indicate
to be correct), it follows that the functions representing the
distribution for different fields are also similar.    This would
also indicate that the distribution might be represented by a
 function of the nature of equation (8).
   From the numerous observations taken it was found that
the real distribution for all values of B max. below saturation
is represented very accurately by the equation
                   (º) + (i) =1 . . . . . )
   This formula gives the real distribution much more
accurately than any other with which the author is acquainted,
and can be applied over as great a range. At first sight it
would appear that the permeability was neglected since it

   From these tables it will be seen that equation (9) repre
sents the real distribution with an accuracy of about 1 per
cent., a difference of 2 per cent. between observed and calcu
lated values being very rare.
   The value of a in equation (9) seems to depend altogether
on the diameter (equivalent diameter if section is square).
   It was found that for all specimens of the same diameter
the difference between a and the half-length was constant.
This fact suggested that a might be determined by the

in this equation as determined from the observations is 48.

   The somewhat large variation from this value would indicate
that Ki was not constant in equation (10), but when it is
considered that its value is obtained by taking the difference
between a and     #.

that it was constant.

solenoid which was employed in measuring hysteresis loss

     capable of transmitting them, and of Radiant Heat, Visible

      ONSIDER the following three analogous cases:–I.
         mechanical, II. electrical, III. electromagnetic.
     I. Imagine an ideally rigid globe of solid platinum of
  12 centim. diameter, hung inside an ideal rigid massless
 spherical shell of 13 centim. internal diameter, and of any
 convenient thickness. Let this shell be hung in air or under
 water by a very long cord, or let it be embedded in a great
 block of glass, or rock, or other elastic solid, electrically con
  ductive or non-conductive, transparent or non-transparent
  for light.
     I. (1). By proper application of force between the shell
  and the nucleus cause the shell and nucleus to vibrate in
  opposite directions with simple harmonic motion through
  a relative total range of 10-% of a centimetre.                  We
  shall first suppose the shell to be in air. In this case,
  because of the small density of air compared with that
  of platinum, the relative total range will be practically that
  of the shell, and the nucleus may be considered as almost
  absolutely fixed. If the period is 4, of a second, frequency
  32 according to Lord Rayleigh's designation, a humming
  sound will be heard, certainly not excessively loud, but
   probably amply audible to an ear within a metre or half a
   metre of the shell. Increase the frequency to 256, and a very

  tion to Section A of the British Association at its recent meeting in
  Bristol.

          Condensational-rarefactional Waves in Gases &c. 495
  loud sound of the well-known musical character (C256) will
  be heard *.
     Increase the frequency now to 32 times this, that is to 8192
     riods per second, and an exceedingly loud note 5 octaves
    igher will be heard. It may be too loud a shriek to be
  tolerable; if so, diminish the range till the sound is not too
  loud. Increase the frequency now successively according to
  the ratios of the diatonic scale, and the well-known musical
  notes will be each clearly and perfectly perceived through the
  whole of this octave.      To some or all ears the musical notes
  will still be clear up to the G (24756 periods per second) of the
  octave above, but we do not know from experience what kind
  of sound the ear would perceive for higher frequencies than
  25000. We can scarcely believe that it would hear nothing,
  if the amplitude of the motion is suitable.
     To produce such relative motions of shell and nucleus as we
  have been considering, whether the shell is embedded in air,
  or water, or glass, or rock, or metal, a certain amount of
 work, not extravagantiy great, must be done to supply the
 energy for the waves (both condensational and rarefactional),
 which are caused to proceed outwards in all directions. Sup
 pose now, for example, we find how much work per second
 is required to maintain vibration with a frequency of 1000
 periods per second, through total relative motion of 10-% of a
 centimetre. Keeping to the same rate of doing work, raise
 the frequency to 10", 10°, 10", 10°, 10%, 500 x 10°. We now
 hear nothing ; and we see nothing from any point of view in
 the line of the vibration of the centre of the shell which I
 shall call the axial line. But from all points of view not in
 this line, we see a luminous point of homogeneous polarized
 yellow light, as it were in the centre of the shell, with in
creasing brilliance as we pass from any point of the axial line
to the equatorial plane, keeping at equal distances from the
centre. The line of vibration is everywhere in the meridional
plane, and perpendicular to the line drawn to the centre.
    When the vibrating shell is surrounded by air, or water,
or other fluid, and when the vibrations are of moderate fre
quency, or of anything less than a few hundred thousand
periods per second, the waves proceeding outwards are con
densational-rarefactional, with zero of alternate condensation
    * Lord Rayleigh has found that with frequency 256, periodic con
densation and rarefaction of the marvellously small amount 6 × 10-9 of
an atmosphere, or “addition and subtraction of densities far less than
those to be found in our highest vacua,” gives a perfectly audible sound.
The amplitude of the aerial vibration, on each side of zero, corresponding
to this is 1:27 x 10-7 of a centimetre.—'Sound, vol. ii. p. 439 (2nd
edition).                          M

and rarefaction at every point of the equatorial plane and
maximum in the axial line.          When the vibrating shell is
embedded in an elastic solid extending to vast distances in all
directions from it, two sets of waves, distortional and con
densational-rarefactional, according respectively to the two
descriptions which have been before us, proceed outwards
with different velocities, that of the former essentially less
than that of the latter in all known elastic solids*.              Each
of these propagational velocities is certainly independent of
the frequency up to 10°, 10°, or 10", and probably up to any
frequency not so high but that the wave-length is a large
multiple of the distance from molecule to molecule of the
solid. When we rise to frequencies of 4 x 10”, 400 x 10”,
800 x 10”, and 3000 x 101*, corresponding to the already
known range of long-period invisible radiant heat, of visible
light, and of ultra-violet light, what becomes of the conden
sational-rarefactional waves which we have been considering 2
 How and about what range do we pass from the propaga
 tional velocities of 3 kilometres per second for distortional
 waves in glass, or 5 kilometres per second for the con
 densational waves in glass, to the 200,000 kilometres per
 second for light in glass, and, perhaps, no condensational
 wave? Of one thing we may be quite sure; the transition
 is continuous. Is it probable (if aether is absolutely incom
 pressible, it is certainly possible) that the condensational
 rarefactional wave becomes less and less with frequencies of
 from 10" to 4 x 10”, and that there is absolutely none of it
 for periodic disturbances of frequencies of from 4 × 10” to
 3000 × 10** There is nothing unnatural or fruitlessly ideal
 in our ideal shell, and in giving it so high a frequency as the
 500 x 10% of yellow light. It is absolutely certain that there
 is a definite dynamical theory for waves of light, to be
  enriched, not abolished, by electromagnetic theory; and it is
  interesting to find one certain line of transition from our dis
  tortional waves in glass, or metal, or rock, to our still better
 known waves of light.
     I. (2). Here is another still simpler transition from the dis
  tortional waves in an elastic solid to waves of light. Still
  think of our massless rigid spherical shell, 13 centim. internal
  diameter, with our solid globe of platinum, 12 centim. dia
  meter, hung in its interior. Instead of as formerly applying
  simple forces to produce to-and-fro rectilinear vibrations of
  shell and nucleus, apply now a proper mutual forcive between
  shell and nucleus to give them oscillatory rotations in contrary
  directions.   If the shell is hung in air or water, we should

have a propagation outwards of disturbance due to viscosity,
very interesting in itself; but we should have no motion
that we know of appropriate to our present subject until we
rise to frequencies of 10°, 10x 10”, 400 x 10”, 800 x 10”, or
3000 x 10”, when we should have radiant heat, or visible
light, or ultra-violet light proceeding from the outer surface
of the shell, as it were from a point-source of light at the
centre, with a character of polarization which we shall
thoroughly consider a little later. But now let our massless
shell be embedded far in the interior of a vast mass of glass,
or metal, or rock, or of any homogeneous elastic solid, firmly
attached to it all round, so that neither splitting away nor
tangential slip shall be possible. Purely distortional waves
will spread out in all directions except the axial. Suppose, to
fix our ideas, we begin with vibrations of one-second period,
and let the elastic solid be either glass or iron. At distances
of hundreds of kilometres (that is to say, distances great in
comparison with the wave-length and great in comparison
with the radius of the shell), the wave-length will be approxi
mately 3 kilometres *. Increase the frequency now to 1000
periods per second : at distances of hundreds of metres the
wave-length will be about 3 metres. Increase now the fre
quency to 10" periods per second ; the wave-length will be
3 millim., and this not only at distances of several times the
radius of the shell, but throughout the elastic medium from
close to the outer surface of the shell; because the wave-length
now is a small fraction of the radius of the shell.             Increase
the frequency further to 1000 x 10" periods per second ; the
wave-length will be 3 x 10- " of a millim., or 3 mikroms f,

  f For a small unit of   '.      Langley, fourteen years ago, used with
great advantage and convenience the word “mikron " to denote the
millionth of a metre. The letter n has no place in the metrical system,
and I venture to suggest a change of spelling to “mikrom " for the
millionth of a metre, after the analogy of j. English usage for millionths
(mikrohm, mikro-ampere, mikrovolt). For a conveniently small corre
    nding unit of time I further venture to suggest “michron” to denote
i. period of vibration of light whose wave-length in tether is 1 mikrom.
Thus, the velocity of light in aether being 3× 10 metres per second, the
michron is ; x 10T” of a second, and the velocity of light is 1 mikrom
of space per michron of time. Thus the frequency of the highest ultra
violet light investigated by Schumann (1 of a mikrom wave-length,
Sitzungsber. d. k. Gesellsch. d. Wissensch. zu Wien, cii. pp. 415 & 625,
1893) is 10 periods per michron of time. The period of sodium light
(mean of lines D) is '5892.12 of a michron; the periods of the “Rest
strahlen " of rocksalt and sylvin found by Rubens and Aschkinass (Wied.
Ann lxv. (1898) p. 241) are 512 and 61.1 michrons respectively.
   No practical inconvenience can ever arise from any possible confusion,
or momentary forgetfulness, in respect to the similarity of sound between
michrons of time and mikroms of space.—K.

if, as in all probability is the case, the distance between the
centres of contiguous molecules in glass and in iron is less
than a five-hundredth of a mikrom. But it is probable that
the distance between centres of contiguous molecules in glass
and in iron is greater than 10-" of a mikrom, and therefore it
is probable that neither of these solids can transmit waves of
distortional motion of their own ponderable matter, of so short
a wave-length as 10-* of a mikrom. Hence it is probable
that if we increase the frequency of the rotational vibrations
of our shell to one hundred thousand times 1000 × 10°, that is
to say, to 100 x 10”, no distortional wave of motion of the
ponderable matter can be transmitted outwards; but it seems
quite certain that distortional waves of radiant heat in aether
will be produced close to the boundary of the vibrating shell,
although it is also probable that if the surrounding solid is
either glass or iron, these waves will not be transmitted far
outwards, but will be absorbed, that is to say converted into
non-undulatory thermal motions, within a few mikroms of
their origin.
    Lastly, suppose the elastic solid around our oscillating
shell to be a concentric spherical shell of homogeneous glass
of a few centimetres, or a few metres, thickness and of refrac
tive index 1.5 for D light. Let the frequency of the oscil
lations be increased to 5:09.2 x 10" periods per second, or its
period reduced to 5892.12 of a michron: homogeneous yellow
light of period equal to the mean of the periods of the two
sodium lines will be propagated outwards through the glass
with wave-length of about 3 x 5892.12 of a mikrom, and out
 from the glass into air with wave-length of 5892.12 of a
 mikrom. The light will be of maximum intensity in the
 equatorial plane and zero in either direction along the axis,
 and its plane of polarization will be everywhere the meridional
 plane. It is interesting to remark that the axis of rotation of
 the aether for this case coincides everywhere with the line of
 vibration of the aether in the case first considered ; that is to
 say, in the case in which the shell vibrated to and fro in a
 straight line, instead of, as in the second case, rotating through
 an infinitesimal angle round the same line.
     A full mathematical investigation of the motion of the
 elastic medium at all distances from the originating shell, for
 each of the cases of I. (1) and I. (2), will be found in a volume
 containing my Baltimore Lectures on “Molecular Dynamics
 and the Wave-Theory of Light,” soon, I hope, to be published,
     II. An electrical analogy for I. (1) is presented by sub
 stituting for our massless shell an ideally rigid, infinitely
 massive shell of glass or other non-conductor of electricity,

        Condensational-rarefactional Waves in Gases &c.        499
 and for our massive platinum nucleus a massless non-con
 ducting globe electrified with a given quantity of electricity.
 For simplicity we shall suppose our apparatus to be surrounded
 by air or aether. Vibrations to and fro in a straight line are
 to be maintained by force between shell and nucleus as in I.(1).
 Or, consider simply a fixed solid non-conductor coated with
 two circular caps of metal, leaving an equatorial non
 conducting zone between them, and let thin wires from a dis
 tant alternate-current dynamo, or electrostatic inductor, give
 periodically varying opposite electrifications to the two caps.
 For moderate frequencies of vibration we have a periodic
 variation of electrostatic force in the air or aether surrounding
 the apparatus, which we can readily follow in imagination,
 and can measure by proper electrostatic measuring apparatus.
 Its phase, with moderate frequencies of vibration, is very
 exactly the same as that of the electric vibrator. Now sup
 pose the frequency of the vibrator to be raised to several
 hundred million million periods per second. We shall have
 polarized light proceeding as if from an ideal point-source
at the centre of the vibrator and answering fully to the
description of I. (1). Does the phase of variation of the
electrostatic force in the axial line outside the apparatus
remain exactly the same as that of the vibrator? An affirma
tive answer to this question would mean that the velocity of
propagation of electrostatic force is infinite. A negative
answer would mean that there is a finite velocity of propaga
tion for electrostatic force. This velocity, according to views
regarding conceivable qualities of aether described in my
article “On the Reflection and Refraction of Light” (Phil.
Mag. vol. xxvi. 1888) might be greater than, equal to, or less
than the velocity of light.
   III. The shell and interior electrified non-conducting mass
less globe being the same as in II., let now a forcive be
applied between shell and nucleus to produce rotational oscil
lations as in I. (2). When the frequency of the oscillations
is moderate, there will be no alteration of the electrostatic
force and no perceptible magnetic force in the air or aether
around our apparatus. Let now the frequency be raised to
several hundred million million periods per second ; we shall
have visible polarized light proceeding as if from an ideal point
source at the centre and answering fully to the description of
the light of I. (2). The same result would be obtained by
taking simply a fixed solid non-conducting globe and laying
on wire on its surface approximately along the circumferences
of equidistant circles of latitude, and, by the use of a distant
source (as in II.), sending an alternate current through this

wire.   In this case, while there is no manifestation of electro
static force, there is strong alternating magnetic force, which
in the space outside the globe is as if from an ideal infinitesi
mal magnet with alternating magnetization, placed at the
centre of the globe and with its magnetic axis in our axial line.
               LI. On Standard High Resistances.
       By F. B. FAwcETT, University College, Bristol”.
r | HERE are at the present time two principal forms of
       high resistance in use. That made of insulated wire,
which is reliable but costly, and the carbon line on ebonite
which is neither. The purpose of this paper is to describe a
method of constructing
and reliable.
                             º,     resistances which are both cheap
   Metal in some form seems to be the only solid conductor
of which the resistance remains constant over long periods,
and I have therefore examined the properties of the thin
metallic films which, as is well known, may be deposited in
vacuo from a metallic kathode on surfaces in its neighbour
hood. . By making the kathode in the form of a grid of
several wires stretched parallel to one another and in the same
plane an even deposit of the metal of the wires may be obtained
on a strip of glass placed parallel to the grid ; moreover, if
the wires are of two different metals, films of what seem to
be alloys of these metals may be obtained. Gold and pla
tinum, from their chemical stability, are very suitable for the
 purpose, and I have therefore used these two substances in
most of my later experiments; the homogeneity of the film
being further increased by twisting the gold and platinum
wires tightly together and building up the grid of these
twists. The results to be described refer to gold-platinum
films exclusively.
   When a film is first deposited its resistance alters at a
rapidly decreasing rate ; the alteration continuing for many
months.     There seem to be two causes at work in this—dis
solved gas and molecular rearrangement in the film.             If a
film which has been exposed to air be placed in a high
vacuum the resistance rapidly falls—the change amounting
to 3 per cent. in one of my experiments. Prolonged heating
also brings down the resistance. This is probably partly
 due to expulsion of gas; but that molecular rearrangement
occurs is shown by the marked hardening of the film which
accompanies it. Before heating the metal may be much

more easily scratched off the glass with a needle than after
wards. These effects seem to correspond with the toughening
of platinum wires by prolonged electrical heating in vacuo,
observed many years ago by Edison.
   Whatever may be the physical cause of the resistance
change, it may be brought to an end by boiling the film
for several hours under reduced pressure in non-conducting
and chemically inactive oil ; and if after this the film be
hermetically sealed in its oil-bath, the vacuum being also
maintained, the resistance does not undergo further measure
able change ; at any rate for seven months, the greatest range
of my experiments. This is shown by the results of tests on
three separate resistances, A, B, C, given in Table I.

expect. To see whether the thickness of the film had any
thing to do with it I deposited two films on the same piece of
 glass, under precisely similar conditions, except that one was
deposited during a longer time than the other, and was there
fore thicker. Table II. gives the values of the temperature
coefficients (per cent. per degree) for the two films (Tube I.)

same way. The column headed approximate thickness of
film was calculated from the resistance, length, and breadth of
the film on the assumption that the specific resistance was the
same for all the films. The thickness is expressed in arbitrary
units, but if the specific resistance of the films is anywhere
near that of platinum-silver the numbers in the column give
the thickness of the film in millionths of a centimetre to the

   The results clearly show how the temperature-coefficient
decreases as the thickness of the film decreases.        In fact I do
not think it impossible that films may be made of nega
tive, and therefore also of zero temperature-coefficients :
one extremely thin film having shown signs of a negative
coefficient. Its resistance became infinite, however, before I
was able to test it perfectly, and I am thus unable at present
to speak decidedly on the point. I hope shortly to investigate
the whole question of the temperature-coefficients of films.

   The film is deposited to such a thickness that its resistance
is far below the required value. It is then heated in oil,
under reduced pressure, to render it electrically stable (as
explained above). In this condition it is scratched with a
needle in the manner shown in the figure, so that it becomes
a  .#    zigzag narrow strip, and the scratching process is con
tinued until its resistance has arrived at the required value.

      GENTLEMEN,
 I NOTICE in the September issue of the above magazine a
      “Note on Continuous Beams,” by Mr. H. J. Tomlinson
and Professor Karl Pearson, in        º    reference is made to
my paper “On a Method of Determining the Reactions at
the Points of Support of Continuous Beams ” (Proc. Royal
 Society, vol. lxii.).      -
   Whatever may be the relative merits of graphical and
 arithmetical methods of solution, it is always desirable to have
 both, and I wish therefore to call attention to a few points in
 the solution I offered which may tend to remove the objections
 preferred by the authors of the note.                     -
    In the first place, as stated in my paper, almost all the
 arithmetical work to which objection has been raised can be
 replaced by the simple graphical construction there given, the
 planimeter being used to measure the areas from which the
 coefficients for the final equations are obtained. The arith
 metical method was preferred owing to the fact that in order
                              {< M 22
 to construct the original I- curve a certain number of
 ordinates must in general be calculated, and these may be
 used in avoiding the planimeter.
    The arithmetic involved is simple, and although the tables
 appear formidable yet they can be quickly constructed by
 means of the slide-rule, and the tabular form itself has a
 certain value in office work.
    After having shown how the reactions could be obtained
 I hardly thought it necessary to indicate that the bending
 moment and shearing-force curves could be erected from these
 data if thought desirable.

 504                Notices respecting New Books.
    The method is not well adapted to show the curve of
 deflexions, although the deflexion at any point can be obtained,
 if it is ever required, from the curve of bending moment.
    In conclusion, when the moment of inertia is constant and
 the beam under the action of concentrated and uniform loads,
 the original bending-moment curves become those whose
 geometrical properties are well known, and it is a matter of
 a few minutes to determine the reactions by the above method",
 and this not only applies to continuous beams but also to
 beams fixed at the ends, as I have shown elsewheret.

Radiation : An Elementary Treatise on Electromagnetic Radiation
    and on Röntgen and Cathode Rays. By H. H. FRANCIs HYND
    MAN, B.Sc. With a preface by Professor SILVANUs P. Thompson,
    D.Sc., F.R.S. London, Swan, Sonnenschein & Co.; New
    York, The Macmillan Co., 1898.
THE treatise of Mr. Hyndman may be described as a supplement
       to the ordinary text-books. He has not attempted to give an
 account of the phenomena of radiation, such as will be found in
treatises on light or heat, except in cases where it is necesssary
for his purpose. His aim has been to furnish a summary of
 recent research on radiation, including under that term not only
known transverse aether disturbances, but also the imperfectly com
 prehended cathode, Röntgen, and Le Bon rays. The scope of the
work is therefore a wide one, and the author can only give a brief
sketch of each research ; he atones, however, for this brevity by
copious references to original memoirs. The results of pioneer
work in any department of science are necessarily disconnected to
a certain extent; they wait for some great discovery, either of
theory or fact, by which they are all explained, and until the
discovery is made they are not amenable to text-book treatment.
Under such circumstances classification alone is possible, and by
judicious classification the author has produced a very readable
and useful treatise. The discovery which will enable his treatise
to be converted into a text-book is that of the relation between
aether and matter.                                               J.L.H.
   * As an example of this, take the case of a continuous beam of two
equal spans 100 feet long, loaded with a uniform load of 3 tons per foot
run, and a concentrated load of 20 tons placed on one span 40 feet from
the centre support, the moment of inertia of the cross-section of the
beam being constant. Ten minutes' work sufficed to show that the
reactions are 118:58, 390.84, 110:58 tons respectively. I doubt if this
could be done more quickly by any other method.

   3. ‘ On some High-level Gravels in Berkshire and Oxfordshire.”
By O. A. Shrubsole, Esq., F.G.S.
   The high-level gravels are divided by the author as follows,
beginning with the oldest:-
       1. Pebble-gravel, composed very largely of flint or chert.
       2. The Goring Gap gravel.
       3. Quartzose gravel, with only a small proportion of flint-pebbles.
       4. Quartzite-gravel, with purple and brown quartzite-pebbles,
       5. Local flint-gravels.
   The pebbly contents of these gravels are expressed in per
centages. The Pebble-gravel occurs on the higher plateaux of the
Chiltern Hills, and a suggestion is thrown out that it may possibly
be of Diestien age. The Goring Gap gravels contain a large pro
portion of subangular flint. The Quartzose gravels are distinguished
by a certain proportion of opaque and vitreous quartz-pebbles and
a small number of quartzite-pebbles, generally pale in colour:
a small flint-flake was found in them at Bowsey Hill; amongst
the possible sources of the constituents of this bed, old pebble-beds
like those of Potton and Upware are mentioned.                The Quartzite
gravel is widespread, and is found at heights varying from 294
 to 544 feet. There is a gravel-pit near Moreton-in-the-Marsh,
 close to the source of the Evenlode, which shows an exceptionally
 large proportion of quartzite-pebbles, both smaller and larger than
 6 inches in diameter. Farther on, similar gravels may be traced
 through Evesham, up the Salwarp valley, and into the Lickey
 district; the author conjectures that the source of the quartzite
 pebbles may lie in the direction of Warwickshire and the Midlands.
 Small flint-flakes usually having one bulb of percussion have been
 found in all the gravels except the oldest. The value of these
 flakes as evidence is disputed.

 F.G.S., and Prof. J. B. Harrison, M.A., F.G.S. With an Appendix
on the Foraminifera by F. Chapman, Esq., F.R.M.S., A.L.S.
    After a reference to previous publications on the island by one of
 the authors and Mr. Jukes-Browne, an account is given of the
 tectonic structure of Bissex Hill, on which the principal exposures
 of the Globigerina-marl occur. Five faults are described, four of
 which cut all the rocks, while the fifth disturbs the Scotland Beds
 and the Oceanic Series, but leaves the overlying Globigerina-marl
 undisturbed.
    The general succession is as follows:—The Scotland Beds are
 overlain unconformably by the Oceanic Series, which shows the
 usual succession from chalks to calcareo-siliceous beds, and in places
 to the upper chalks, the overlying red clays being absent.                Then
 follows, unconformably, a detrital bed of Globigerina-marl containing
 rolled pebbles of various parts of the Oceanic Series, especially the

 506                      Geological Society:-
 chalks, and inclusions of clay presumably from the Scotland Beds.
 The bed is followed by buff marls, granular in appearance, and this,
 again, by marls and limestone, in the upper part of which Globi
 gerinae die out and are replaced by Amphistegina and fragments of
 lamellibranch shells.     The whole succession is about 90 feet in
 thickness, and the beds pass up into basement-reef rocks without
 coral, and coral-rock.
    Somewhat similar rocks were met with in a shaft at Bowmanston,
 and they probably occur in other localities. The presence, succession,
 and relations of these rocks enable the authors to draw conclusions
 as to the history of the island.
    In the Appendix a list of 146 species of foraminifera is given.
 15 of these occur only in strata ranging from the Cretaceous to the
 Pliocene Period.    The rocks bear some resemblance to the lime
 stones and marls of Malta and to the Globigerina-beds of Trinidad;
 the recent foraminifera indicate that the deposit was formed at a
 depth of about 1000 fathoms and at some distance from land.

    1. ‘Post-Glacial Beds exposed in the Cutting of the new Bruges
 Canal. By T. Mellard Reade, Esq., C.E., F.G.S.
    The following beds, enumerated in descending order, were found
 in this cutting:—
                  5. Argile des polders supérieure.
                  4. Cardium (edule)-sand.
                  3. Argile des polders inférieure.
                  2. Scrubicularia (plana)-clay.
                  1. Peat with the remains of trees.
    Mechanical analyses of beds 5 and 2 are given. The argile
des polders supérieure consists mainly of extremely finely
divided material, in which sponge-spicules and foraminifera were
found. The Cardium-sand yielded many foraminifera and ostracoda,
with a few diatoms. The Scrobicularia-clay contained sponge
spicules, many of them apparently derived from older deposits,
diatoms, and foraminifera.
   The land-surface on which the peat grew appears to have slowly
subsided, in such a manner as to allow of the inosculation of Beds 1
and 2 at their junction. Beds 3 and 5 represent the shallower
water phases, and the Cardium-sand the deepest-water phase through
which the area passed as the deposits accumulated. As a whole,
these beds are correlated with those ‘in Lancashire and Cheshire
which overlie the Peat and Forest Bed,” but the wide horizontal         s
extent of the deposits, at levels varying very little, has no parallel
in Britain.

Among the pebbles and boulders in the drift, and scattered about
in the sandpit, were granites from Eskdale and the South of Scotland,
small flints, and local and Welsh rocks identified by Mr. Ruddy as
derived largely from the head of the Conway valley. The base of
the sand is not exposed, but the author has no doubt that it is
geologically above the grey till with Welsh boulders.
   At Groes and Old Colwyn a “typical marine-drift sand,’ with
well-rounded quartz-grains, also occurs, at one place possibly 60
feet thick, and at another resting on “marine brown boulder-clay.'
The marine sands of Groes, Old Colwyn, and the Wale of Clwyd
‘lie on the east side of their respective valleys, and the marine
boulder-clays to the greater extent on the west side, while the
marine drift has accumulated as bars near the mouth of the valleys.
   3. ‘Observations on the Geology of Franz Josef Land.’ By
Dr. Reginald Koettlitz.
   This paper opens with a detailed description of the geography
and geology of various portions of the archipelago.
   The basaltic rocks occur in tiers from 10 to 70 feet high, and
range to a height of 1300 feet above sea-level. The associated and
interbedded rocks consist of shale, sandstone, and basaltic tuff. The
stratified rocks are not appreciably altered by the heat of the basalt,
which is often vesicular both at the base and summit of the tiers.
From this and other evidence the author concludes that many of
 the sheets are contemporaneous flows, and that as the fossil plants
and ammonites are of Jurassic age, some of the lavas date back to
Jurassic time. Dykes, sills, and necks are also described.
   The Jurassic rocks consist of shales and sandstones; they have
yielded ammonites and belemnites, a portion of a specimen of
A. Lamberti having been found embedded in “basaltic tuff.' Pebbles
 of radiolarian chert have also been found embedded in these rocks,
 and a granite-block, mentioned by Payer as having been seen em
 bedded in an iceberg, is believed to have come from the same source.
    The raised beaches are very numerous, and occur at various
 heights, from just above sea-level to 287, 310, 340, and even
 410 feet, drift-wood and bones of seals, walrus, and whales having
 been found on them.      On Cape Mary Harmsworth twelve beaches
 are seen in a series one above another.     The entire skeleton of a
 seal was found on the summit-plateau of Cape Neale, together with
 waterworn stones, at a height of 700 feet above sea-level. The
 highest waterworn pebbles noted were found at 1111 feet on Cape
 Flora.    In some cases floe-ice at sea-level becomes covered over
 and preserved by gravel heaped upon it by the sea; and some of the
 raised beaches seem to consist of a similar mixture of ice and
 gravel, as is proved by the formation of pitfalls in them where the
ice melts. Ice-masses are also sometimes preserved under taluses,
 avalanches, and slips.
    The “ice-cap' is probably not so thick as is generally supposed,
 and it has little downward movement. It forms domes on the summits
and plateaux, but it seems to be a mere mantle on the terraced
slopes, as it is ridged and dimpled, and during warm seasons raised
beaches and terraces are thawed-out under the ridges. Com

paratively few evidences of glaciation were met with. Roches
moutonnées and rounded hills are absent, and only in the two
valleys separating Cape Flora from Cape Gertrude were the rocks
planed, scratched, and polished.
   Some of the landscape-features, including the separation of the
group into individual islands, are attributed to marine action
 following lines of fault.
   The paper concludes with observations on soundings, the tempe
rature of glaciers, the size of icebergs, and the finding of reindeer
antlers by Mr. Leigh Smith and the members of the Jackson
 Harmsworth Expedition.

   In this communication an analysis of the basalt is given, which
compares closely with those of basalts from Iceland. The silicifi
cation of the rocks, presumably by geyser action, the presence of a
black analcime, pebbles of radiolarian chert, and crystals of selenite,
 probably formed in situ in shale, are also described.
   Notes are given on some of the fossil plants, on the drift-wood,
and on apparently new species of Inoceramus and Belemnites.
   5. “On the Corallian'Rocks of Upware.’ By C. B. Wedd, Esq., B.A.
   The opinion usually held that the ‘Coralline Oolite' of the northern
quarry at Upware is of older date than the ‘Coral Rag' of the
southern quarry, gains support from the work detailed in this paper,
although the results of recent excavations show that a rock of
different lithological character from that of the northern quarry
probably underlies the rocks of the southern quarry.
   A list of the fossils found in the lowest beds of the southern quarry
includes eleven species not yet found in the ‘Oolite' of the northern
quarry; a second list comprises the fossils found just below the
‘ Rag' in the Oolite of the southern quarry. Both these faunas are
intermediate between those of the ‘Rag' of the southern and the
“Oolite' of the northern quarry.
   During the deepening of a well less than 3 mile north of the
northern quarry, fossils identical with those of the northern quarry
were found ; the lowest rock enclosed lumps and streaks of bluish
black clay, as though the Oxford Clay were not far underneath.
From this excavation and other evidence, the author considers that
the ‘Oolite' can hardly be less than 40 feet thick, and that this
rock is geologically below the ‘Rag' of the southern quarry.
   Excavations at the southern end of the ridge and south of the
southern quarry show that beds containing the ‘Rag' fauna are
conformably underlain by a rock 16 feet thick, identical with the
“Elsworth Rock’ both in lithology and fossils.        The discussion of
the fossils from this rock and that of Elsworth itself indicates that
‘there is no longer any palaeontological evidence for correlating it
with the Lower Calcareous Grit rather than with higher beds.”
   On the whole, the author is in favour of the view that the
‘Oolite' of the northern quarry is the lateral equivalent of the
Elsworth Rock seen in the excavations south of the southern quarry.

 LV. On the Conductivity-Method of Studying Moderately
   Dilute Aqueous Solutions of Double Salts. By J. G.
   MAGGREGoR and E. H. ARCHIBALD, Dalhousie College,
   Halifar, N.S. *
    HE conductivity method of determining whether or not
       double salts exist as such in solutions consists in a com
parison of their observed conductivity with what it is
supposed their conductivity would be if the constituent salts
were entirely uncombined. The difficulty which has always
presented itself has been to determine what the conductivity
would be on this assumption.
   The difficulty vanishes in the case of extremely dilute
solutions, because in their case it follows from the principle
of the superposition of small effects alone, that, if no double
salt exist as such in solution, the specific conductivity will be
equal to the volume mean (or the arithmetic mean) of the
conductivities of the simple solutions of the constituent salts
by the mixture of which in any given ratio as to volume (or
in equal volumes, as the case may be) the given solution
would be produced (we may for shortness call this volume
mean, the volume mean conductivity of the solution, and the
simple solutions the mixing of which would produce the given
solution, its mixture constituents). Accordingly Grotriant,

510 Prof. J. G. MacGregor and Mr. E. H. Archibald on
Mackay" have found no difficulty, other than the experi
mental one, in concluding in the case of certain complex or
double salts that they do, or do not, as the case may be,
exist as such in extremely dilute solutions.
   In dealing with solutions of moderate dilution it has
generally been held that as the above relation holds
rigorously for extreme dilution it may be expected to hold
approximately for moderate dilution, and consequently (1)
that the differences between the actual and the volume mean
conductivity of a solution containing two salts which do not
form a double salt, will be small ; (2) that in the case of a
solution containing two salts which do form a double salt,
the differences will be of the same order of magnitude pro
vided no double salt exist as such in the solution ; and (3)
that the observation of large differences, in the case of a solu
tion of a double salt, establishes a probability of the existence
 of double salt as such to a certain extent in the solution.
   Klein f and Bouty f have subjected the first of these
assumptions to experimental test. The former concluded
 from his own observations on mixtures of potassium and
sodium sulphate solutions, and from Bender's S on mixtures
of solutions of chlorides, that the conductivity of mixtures
of equal volumes of equimolecular solutions is sensibly the
same as the arithmetic mean of the conductivities of the
constituents.       Bouty made observations on solutions con
taining lead and potassium nitrates, the chloride and nitrate,
chloride and     º,          and nitrate and sulphate of potassium,
and the sulphates of zinc and copper, and drew the con
clusion that in the case of neutral salts, simple solutions
of which on being electrolysed undergo equal changes of
concentration at both electrodes, the conductivity of mix
tures of equimolecular solutions in any proportions as to
volume, is equal to the volume mean of the conductivities of
the constituent solutions. When we examine the experi
mental results on which these conclusions are based, however,
we find that in a considerable proportion of cases the differences
between observed and calculated values are considerably
beyond the limit of error within which conductivity can be
measured ; and the same is true of similar observations
made by Chroustehoff and Packhoff T.                We find, also,

especially from Bender's observations that the differences
between observed and volume mean conductivities, even for
equal volume mixtures of equi-molecular solutions, increase
with the concentration ; and no observations are available to
determine within what limit of concentration the differences
become negligible.
   For the second assumption we have of course no experi
mental ground whatever.
   With regard to the third it should be noted that both
Bender's and Chroustchoff and Packhoff's observations show
that the differences between observed and volume mean con
ductivity are in some cases positive and in others negative.
Unless therefore the effect produced on the conductivity
by the formation of double molecules has always the same
sign as the effect produced by mere mixing, the resultant
differences, in cases in which double salt exists in solution,
might be smaller than the differences exhibited in other
Cases.
   It would seem therefore that except in cases in which a
large amount of double salt is present as such in solution, the
volume mean criterion cannot lead to conclusions of any high
degree of probability.
   There is one source, however, from which assistance may
be obtained in researches of this kind and which has not yet
been used, viz., the dissociation theory of electrolytic con
duction. Whether that theory be ultimately well founded
or not, it has at any rate shown itself to be capable of .
coordinating the phenomena of electrolytic conduction to
a remarkable extent; and what it has to say with respect
to the point under consideration should therefore be at
tended to.
   And first with regard to the agreement between the actual
and the volume mean conductivity of a complex solution :-
If we mix volumes vi, r, of solutions of electrolytes 1 and 2,
which have a common ion, and whose concentrations, ioniza
tion coefficients, and molecular conductivities at infinite
dilution, are ni, n., ; 21, as ; and P. c. 1, 4× 2, respectively, the
concentrations being so low that no appreciable change of
volume occurs on mixing, and there being no formation of
double salt, and if, after mixing, the ionization coefficients
become ai', a, respectively, the excess of the actual con
ductivity over the volume mean conductivity will be
        { (21'-2) n1914-c 1+ (as'-aa) natºo s}/(vi + ta).
This will not vanish unless (1) the solutions are infinitely

512 Prof. J. G. MacGregor and Mr. E. H. Archibald on
dilute (all the 2's equal to unity), or (2) the solutions are
isohydric (21'—al and as'–2, both equal to zero), or (3) the
change of ionization and other, quantities involved are
appropriately related to one another. . It will be obvious
that in experimenting on solutions of double salts of moderate
dilution these conditions of the valid application of the volume
 mean criterion cannot in general be applied.
    Jones and Mackay * are the only observers in this field who
 have recognized this difficulty ; and while still employing the
 volume mean method, they have endeavoured in one case
 to meet it. In studying solutions of potassium-aluminium
 alum and of potassium-chromium alum, they determined
 the ionization coefficients of series of simple solutions of
 the three sulphates involved, by means of freezing-point
 observations, and found that for equi-molecular solutions
 of the aluminium and chromium sulphates they have ap
 proximately the same values. They assumed that the dif
 ferences between the actual and the volume mean con
 ductivity in these alum solutions, so far as they might be
 due to ionization, would therefore be the same for both ;
 and from the fact that much greater differences were found
 for the chromium alum than for the aluminium alum they
 concluded that in solutions of the former double salt existed
 as such.                      -
    The assumption thus made may be shown to have been
 justified, in its result at any rate, by a calculation of what the
 differences would be if no double salt existed in solution.   For
 this purpose the az's and the a”s of the above expression
 must be determined. The former may be found from the
 determinations of ionization coefficient and molecular cen
 ductivity made by Jones and Mackay; for the molecular
 conductivity at infinite dilution is very approximately the
 ratio of the latter to the former. They were found in this
 way to be 1412, 759, and 763 for #KASO, #Al,(SO,)s,
 and Cra<U+017F>s0,)3 respectively, when expressed in terms of
  10-5 times the conductivity of mercury at 0°C. The value
 for 4K, SO, at 25°C. (Jones and Mackay’s temperature) calcu
 lated from Kohlrausch's data is about 1465. The values
 which the ionization coefficients would have in the alum
 solutions, on the assumption of the presence of no double mole
 cules, may be determined from the values of the ionization
 coefficients of the simple solutions observed by Jones and
 Mackay, by the method described by one of us in a former
                                 * Loc. cit.

           the Conductivity of Solutions of Double Salts.        513
 paper", though the data are somewhat meagre for the
 }. and the results must therefore be used             with caution.
    aving obtained the requisite data in the ways indicated, we
 have calculated the amounts by which the conductivities of
 the alum solutions should differ from the arithmetic means
 of the conductivities of their mixture constituents, if no double
 salt were present as such ; and we find that for solutions of
 KAl(SO,), and of KCr(SO.), of dilution 12 litres per gramme
 molecule, the molecular conductivity should be |. than the
 arithmetic mean of the molecular conductivities of the mixture
 constituents by about 0:4 and 0.7 per cent. respectively.
 Jones and Mackay found that for these solutions the molecular
 conductivity was less than the arithmetic mean by 2-6 and 8.8
 per cent. respectively. Assuming that the available data are
 sufficient for the calculation, it is obvious not only that the
 conclusion of these observers with respect to the chromium
 alum seems to be substantiated, but that in the case of the
  º alum also the result is such as would be accounted for
  y the existence of double salt in solution.
    The same observers determined the ionization coefficients
 in the mixture constituents of a series of solutions of sodium
aluminium alum also, as well as the differences between
observed and volume mean conductivities of the alum solu
tions. We have calculated the differences on the assumption
of no double salt in solution in the case of this alum, although
the data are much less satisfactory than in the former case,
with the result that for a solution of the same dilution as
above the actual conductivity should be greater than the
arithmetic mean by (very roughly) 2 per cent. This particular
solution was not examined by Jones and Mackay, but from the
observations given it would appear that its actual conductivity
is less than the arithmetic mean. While the conductivity
would be greater than the arithmetic mean if there were no
double salt in solution, it is found to be less ; and it is in this
direction that it would be affected by the association of some
of the molecules.
   The possibility of determining what the ionization co
efficients in a solution of double salt would be, if none of the
molecules were associated, suggests obviously that in investi
  ations of the kind under consideration, we should abandon
#. volume mean method of study, and, instead, should calcu
late what the conductivity of such a solution would be on this
assumption and compare the result with the observed con
ductivity.

   According to the dissociation theory, if a solution contain
n1, m2 gramme-equivalents of two salts capable of forming a
double salt, and if a., a, are the ionization coefficients and
Aux 1 and a2 . . the molecular conductivities at infinite dilution,
the conductivity, if no double molecules are formed, will be
ania.c.14 asnº<U+017F>. 2. The 2's and u2 's involved in this ex
pression can, it is true, be determined rigorously only for
extremely dilute solutions, and only approximately for solu
tions of moderate dilution. And therefore there will always
be a difference between the observed and calculated values of
the conductivity of solutions of moderate strength, even if no
double salt be present as such. But we may acquire informa
tion as to the magnitude of the difference due to the errors
involved in the determination of the a's and the poo’s, by
comparing observed and calculated values of the conductivity
of a sufficient number of mixtures of solutions of salts which
do not, according to other sources of knowledge, form double
salts; and that having been done, the observation, in solutions
of double salts, of considerably greater differences, such as
would be occasioned by the presence of double molecules,
would establish a greater or smaller probability of their
presence. It should be noted that in taking this course we do
not base upon the dissociation theory but upon the (supposed)
generalization that calculability by means of the dissociation
º characterizes solutions              which do not contain double
salt.
   We already possess a certain amount of knowledge as to
the closeness with which the conductivity of solutions con
taining two electrolytes with a common ion, but not suspected
of forming double salts, may be calculated, viz. in the case of
solutions containing sodium and potassium chlorides ", sodium
and hydrogen chlorides f, sodium and barium chlorides t, and
|. and            sodium sulphates §. In all these cases it has
  een found that up to a concentration of about 1 grim.-equiv.
per litre the conductivity can be calculated about as accurately
as it has been measured.
    Although this amount of knowledge is of course not suffi
 cient to afford a sufficiently wide basis for the present purpose,
 we have thought it well to find out how closely it is possible
 to calculate the conductivity of solutions of a double salt,

    As a full account of the experiments is being published
 elsewhere *, we need not give details as to methods. The
 following statement will be sufficient. The water employed
 in preparing the solutions was carefully purified and tested by
conductivity measurements. The salts used were obtained as
chemically pure from reliable makers, were re-crystallized
several times, and tested. The double salt was prepared by
mixing equi-molecular solutions of the constituents and eva
porating the mixture at a temperature below 70° C.; and after
preparation it was analysed. The constitution of the solutions
was determined by the analysis of standard solutions, which
were subsequently diluted, the dilutions being checked by
occasional analytical tests. All solutions were prepared and
all observations made at 18°C., so that Kohlrausch's deter
minations of the molecular conductivities of simple solutions
at infinite dilution might be used in the calculations, and his
observations at moderate concentrations used as checks. Obser
vations of density were made both of the complex solutions
and of their mixture constituents, of sufficient accuracy to
show that no change of volume would occur on mixing the
latter such as would need to be taken account of in the
calculations. Kohlrausch's telephone method was used in
measuring the conductivity, his experience and that of other
observers with this method being fully utilized. The obser
vations of conductivity might i. in error by about 0.25
per cent. The ionization-coefficients were determined by the
method referred to above.
   The following are the observations made on simple solutions
for the purpose of securing the requisite data for the calcu
lations. Dilutions are expressed in litres per gramme-equi
valent. Conductivities are specific molecular conductivities
(i. e. per gramme-equivalent), and are expressed in terms of
10-8 times the conductivity of mercury at 0°C.

       It will be seen that in the case of both series of mixtures
  the differences between observed and calculated values are
  within the limits of error of the observations up to a concen
  tration of 1 gramme-equivalent per litre. . They have neither
  the large values found in the case of the double salt solutions
  nor the slightly smaller values observed in the case of the
  equivalent mixtures. In the calculation of the conductivity
  of each of these series of mixtures one set of the values of the
  a's and u.'s used in the calculations of the double salt
  solutions were of course employed. If, therefore, the differ

         the Conductivity of Solutions of Double Salts.     519
ences in their case were due to the errors in the values of the
a’s and u.’s, we might expect to find similar differences,
though possibly not so large, in at least one of the latter
series of mixtures. It seems probable, therefore, that the
differences observed both in the double salt solutions and the
equivalent mixtures, are not due to defects in the data for the
calculations.                                   -
    The case therefore stands thus:–
    (1) In all cases investigated so far the conductivity of
solutions containing two     §º          with a common ion is
calculable by means of the dissociation theory up to a con
centration of about 1 gramme-equivalent per litre.
    (2) The conductivity of solutions of the double sulphate of
potassium and ‘. is similarly calculable only up to a
concentration of about 0:1, and has at concentration 1 a con
 siderably smaller value than that calculated on the assumption
 that no double molecules are present.
    (3) The solutions of double salt have at concentration
 unity an appreciably smaller conductivity than the equivalent
 mixtures.
     (4) The conductivities of mixtures of equi-molecular simple
 solutions of zinc and copper sulphates and of potassium and
 sodium sulphates are calculable within the limits of obser
 vational error up to a concentration unity; and therefore the
 non-calculability in the case of the double salt solutions is
 probably not due to defective data.
     (5) The differences between the observed and calculated
 values of the conductivity of the double salt solutions and of
 the equivalent mixtures, and between the observed values in
 these two sets of solutions, are such as would be accounted for
 by the presence of double molecules in both, and their presence
 in slightly greater number in the double salt solutions than in
 the equivalent mixtures.
    A complete study of the existence of complex molecules in
 solutions requires the application of other methods as well as
  the conductivity method. What we wish to draw attention
  to in the present paper is the increased utility of the con
 ductivity method due to the possibility of calculating the
 conductivity of mixtures of solutions, by the aid of the disso
 ciation theory, in cases in which   tº        molecules are not
 formed.

LVI. Instruments for Measuring Small Strains in Bars
      Subjected to Twist. By E. G. CoRER, B.A., B.Sc.,
      M.I.M.E., Late Scholar of Peterhouse, Cambridge*.
Th; advances made within recent years in the scientific
       testing of engineering materials have caused great
attention to be paid to the design of instruments for mea
suring small strains. By far the greater number of such
instruments have been devised for measuring the small strains
of extension or compression in bars subjected to a direct pull
or push; and but little attention has been paid to instruments
for the use of engineers in the measurement of the small
strains in a bar subjected to twist.
   The object of the present paper is to describe two arrange
ments of apparatus intended for use in engineering labora
tories and testing-houses for measuring such strains, and for
the determination of the Modulus of Rigidity.
   Each instrument is wholly supported by the test bar, being
secured thereto by screws which grip the bar at two trans
verse sections separated by a known interval, and the relative
angular displacement between these two sections is measured
directly. The instruments are adapted to measure both large
and small strains, and are self-contained, while they can be
used in a horizontal, vertical, or inclined position.
    One form of the apparatus is shown by fig. 1, and consists
of a graduated circle, A, mounted upon a chuck-plate, B,
provided with three centering-screws adjustable by hand.
A ring, C, secured to the test-bar by set screws at a known
distance away carries a swivel-arm, D, in which slides a tube,
E, so that the contact-ball, F, at its outer end can be brought
into position touching the centre of the faced end of a screw
micrometer gauge, H, provided with a divided head. This
micrometer-screw is mounted upon a vernier-plate, J, of the
graduated circle, and can be clamped in any position, the
final adjustment being effected by a screw N.
   A silk-covered wire connects an insulated binding-screw,
K, upon the ring with the contact-ball, and this wire is
joined up in circuit with a simple form of galvanometer, L,
and cell, M, to a second uninsulated binding-screw on the
ring. If the contacting pieces are touching, a circuit is
completed through the test-bar, and the galvanometer-needle
is deflected. If now a twisting movement is applied to one
end of the test-bar, the contacting pieces are separated, and
the micrometer-screw must be advanced until the circuit is

Meeting of the British Association, 1898.

          Small Strains in Bars subjected to Twist.         521
again completed as indicated by the galvanometer-needle.
The number of divisions through which the screw has been
turned affords a measure of the angular displacement, and it
only remains to calibrate these readings in terms of angular
measurement.
                             Fig. 1.
   The calibration is effected by reference to the graduated
circle and vernier-plate.
   The micrometer-screw is set tangentially to the radial arm,
and therefore its indications are nearly proportional to the
tangent of the angle moved through; but if the faced end of
the screw is always maintained at or about its central position,
the error introduced by taking the readings as directly pro
portional to the angular displacement is relatively small
compared with the quantity under measurement, and may be
neglected.

522       Mr. E. G. Coker on Instruments for Measuring            |
   To calibrate the instrument it is therefore only necessa
to measure the number of divisions corresponding to a ...]
angular displacement of, say, 10'; and this is easily accom
plished by setting the instrument in position with the circuit
complete, and afterwards following up a known angular dis
placement of the vernier-plate by the micrometer-screw.
   A simple form of detector-galvanometer, in circuit with a
single dry cell, has been found to be a convenient arrangement
for indicating when contact takes place, and the feeble current
required does not injure the contacting surfaces.
   It is essential that the graduated circle be set accurately
upon the bar, with its plane     <U+017F>º             thereto and its
centre coinciding with the longitudinal axis of the bar. An .
arrangement has been devised to effect this, consisting of two
similar and equal clamp-bars, the eyed ends of which take
over outwardly projecting cones arranged diametrally upon
the chuck-plate and ring. Each main piece has one degree
of freedom with respect to the clamp-bars, and therefore two
degrees of freedom with respect to the other; these degrees of
freedom are suppressed by projecting plates fitting against
corresponding projections on the main pieces; and this con
nexion makes the apparatus a rigid whole. The bar is now
inserted and the screws adjusted by hand as accurately as
possible.
   The clamp-bars are afterwards removed, leaving the two
main pieces accurately spaced on the bar, while the graduated
circle remains perpendicular thereto and very approximately
centred. The light contacting arm is then   º       in position,
and the bar may now be set in the testing machine.
   An improved clamp described with reference to the second
form of apparatus may be used instead of the arrangement
described above, and the hand-operated chuck-plate may be
replaced by a form of self-centering chuck described below.
An example of tests made with this apparatus is given
below.
   The test-bar was adjustably secured at one end and a
balanced lever of fixed length secured upon the free end, and
hung from the arm of a scale-beam. The load was applied
by placing equal weights in the suspended pans of the balanced
lever and scale-beam, so that bending movement was as far as
possible eliminated. Before making a reading the torsion
arm was brought to a horizontal position by aid of a spirit
level.
   The mean of the calibration tests gave 18-6 divisions of the
micrometer-screw as corresponding to an angular displace
ment of 1 minute of arc.

and we have for this test-bar
                C = 11,790,000 lb. per square inch.
   A second test gave almost identically the same results.
   The performance of the instrument is limited by the accuracy
of the micrometer-screw, and in the present instrument the
smallest angular displacement capable of measurement is about
four seconds of arc. As the contacting bar is not heavy, no
difficulty is experienced in balancing it, and therefore its length
may be considerable. This form of instrument is therefore
adapted for measuring the strains in long test-bars.
   The second form of apparatus differs from the preceding in

524       Mr. E. G. Coker on Instruments for Measuring
employing a reading-microscope to observe the relative angular
displacement of a radial line upon the vernier-plate. The
edge of a thick wire is a very convenient line for observation,
and has been used with notable success in an extensometer
designed by Professor Ewing (Proc. Roy. Soc. May 1895).
The instrument is shown by fig. 2, in which A is the graduated
circle mounted upon a chuck, B, and furnished with a vernier
plate, J, an arm, O, of which carries a wire, P.
   A reading-microscope is carried in the sleeve, R, of an
arm, S, mounted upon the short cylinder, C, which latter is
gripped upon the test-bar by screws.
   The reading-microscope has an eyepiece, T, provided with
a glass scale, and a right-angled prism, U, is interposed
between this and the objective, W, so that readings can be
easily taken. The tube, Q, is free to slide or rotate in its
guide, R.; but in order to readily focus the wire this latter is
carried in a frame, X, pivoted on the vernier-plate, J, and
adjusted by a screw.
   The microscope arm, S, is secured to the cylinder, C, by a
divided collar, the two halves of which are pivoted on one
side and the free ends are clamped by screws. If it is desi
rable that the telescope be turned round or released altogether,

             Small Strains in Bars subjected to Twist.         525
the screw may be thrown out of engagement. Since the
difference between an arc and its corresponding chord is an
infinitely small quantity of the third order when the arc is an
infinitely small quantity of the first, the readings of the micro
scope-scale may be taken as directly proportional to the angular
displacement, and the calibration is effected by moving the
wire through a definite angle of, say, 10", and noting the
equivalent reading of the micrometer eyepiece.
   This instrument is furnished with an improved form of
clamp (fig. 3), consisting of a pair of divided collars, a, the
halves being pivoted together at b, and secured by nuts c.
                               Fig. 3.
    The collars are wedge-shaped in radial section to engage
with corresponding wide-angled grooves upon the chuck
plate and cylinder, only the angled sides being in contact, so
that the collars are readily freed when required.
    The lower halves, d, of the divided collars are connected
by one or more distance-pieces, e, so that when the former
 #.    their respective grooves each piece has one degree of
  reedom with respect to the clamp; and this can be suppressed
 by a pin or by the frictional grip of the collars, thereby
 causing the parts to act as one rigid whole for setting the
 instrument on the bar.
    The two main parts of the apparatus are set in their respec
 tive collars; the bar is then passed through and the screws
 adjusted. The clamp is then removed, leaving the two pieces
 at the correct distance apart, while the graduated circle has
 its plane perpendicular to the bar, and is chucked accurately
 thereon.
    The graduated circle of this instrument is carried by a self
 centering chuck of somewhat novel form, and a section through
 this is shown by fig. 4, while a perspective view of the arrange
 ment is shown by fig. 5.
    There are three centering-screws, A', the outer cylindrical
 ends of which are supported in guides, B', and prevented from

bearing, K', so that the stresses are borne by the body, L', of
the chuck, and the bevel ring is prevented from seizing by
bearing-plates and an adjustable ring, M', at the back. This
bevel ring can be slid back to allow any screw to be separately
adjusted. Other modified arrangements of the chuck have
been tried in which the guide-pins have passed bodily through
slots cut through the inner ends of the screw, and the screw
pairs have been inverted; but these modifications have not
answered well.

LVII. On the Charge of Electricity carried by the Ions produced
    by Röntgen Rays. By J. J. THOMson, M.A., F.R.S., Caven
    dish Professor of Earperimental Physics, Cambridge".
 Th;       following experiments were made in order to deter
        mine the magnitude of the charge of electricity carried
 by the ions which are produced when Röntgen rays pass
 through a gas.                        -
    The theory of the method used is as follows:—By mea
 suring the current passing through a gas exposed to Röntgen
 rays and acted upon by a known electromotive force, we
 determine the value of the product nev, where n is the number
 of ions in unit volume of the gas, e the charge on an ion, and
 v the mean velocity of the positive and negative ions under
 the electromotive force to which they are exposed.
     Mr. Rutherford (Phil. Mag. vol. xliv. p. 422, 1897) has
 determined the value of v for a considerable number of gases;
 using these values, the measurement of the current through a
 gas gives us the product ne; hence if we can determine n,
 we can deduce the value of e.
     The method I have employed to determine n is founded on
 the discovery made by Mr. C. T. R. Wilson (Phil. Trans. A,
  1897, p. 265) that when Röntgen rays pass through dust
 free air a cloud is produced by an expansion which is incap
  able of producing cloudy condensation when the gas is not
 exposed to these rays. When a determinate expansion is
 suddenly produced in dust-free air a definite and calculable
  amount of water is deposited in consequence of the lowering
  of the temperature of the air by adiabatic expansion. When
  the gas is exposed to the rays the ions caused by the rays
  seem to act as nuclei around which the water condenses. I
  have shown (“Applications of Dynamics to Physics and Che
 mistry, p. 164) that on a charged sphere of less than a certain
                    * Communicated by the Author,

        carried by the Ions produced by Röntgen Rays.      529
radius the effect of the charge in promoting condensation
will more than counterbalance the effect of surface-tension in
preventing it. So that a charged ion will produce a very
small drop of water which may act as a nucleus. If each ion
acts as the nucleus for a drop, then if we know the size of the
drop and the mass of water deposited per unit volume, we
shall be able to determine the number of drops, and hence
the number of ions in unit volume of the gas. One part of
the investigation is thus the determination of the size of the
drops: this gives us n; and as we know from the electrical
investigation me, we have the means of determining e.
   The measurement of the size of the drops in the cloud gave
a great deal of trouble. Two methods were tried ; at first
I attempted to measure the size of the drops by an optical
method ; when a narrow beam of light from an arc lamp is
sent through the cloud, and the light after passing through
the cloud received on a screen, several coloured rings are
visible. If we assume that these rings arise entirely from
diffraction the size of the rings would enable us to deduce the
size of the drops. The method, however, failed in practice
from two causes. In the first place, in order to get the rays
bright enough to allow their diameter to be accurately
measured the fog must be dense, in order, however, to get a
dense cloud the number of ions produced by the rays must
be large ; when, however, the number of ions is large ex
perience shows that they are not all brought down by the
first cloud formed by a sudden expansion. This is proved by
 the fact that if after the first cloud has subsided, the rays
 having been cut off immediately after the first expansion,
 another expansion be made, a second cloud will be formed,
 and though this is less dense than the first cloud it may
 require two or three expansions to remove the effects of
 previous exposure to the Röntgen rays. It is only when the
 ions are so few that no cloud is produced by the second
 expansion that we can feel any confidence that the number of
 drops in the first cloud is equal to the number of ions formed
 by the rays, and in this case the cloud is so thin that the
 coloured rays are not bright enough to allow their diameters
 to be accurately measured. Though this objection is fatal
 there is yet another reason against using this method of
 measuring the size of the drops, as observations made on the
 dimensions of the various coloured rings seemed to indicate
 that the rings are not produced entirely by diffraction, but
 that they are influenced by the interference of rays which
 have passed through the transparent drops with those which
 have not done so, and that therefore we could not employ the

530       Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Charge of Electricity
usual formula connecting the size of the rings with the size
of the drops.
   The method finally employed to measure the size of the
drops was to observe the rate at which the cloud sank and
then to determine the radius of the drops from the formula
                              _2 ga”
                            v = 9 a.
where v is the velocity with which the drops fall, a the radius
of the drop, u the coefficient of viscosity of the gas through
which the drops fall, and g the value of gravity.
   The velocity was determined by observing º time the top
layer of the cloud, which was illuminated by an arc light, took
to fall a given distance; observations made on the times taken
to fall different distances showed that the rate of fall was
uniform, so that the drops had reached their limiting velocity.
   I began by making experiments to test whether the drops
in the cloud formed        expansion were deposited round the
ions which gave to the gas its electrical conductivity; this
point is fundamental, as the method used in this paper to
determine the charge carried by an ion depends on the
 ssumption that it is the ionization of the gas which causes
the fog produced by expansion, and that each ion can act as
the nucleus for a water drop.
   In the first place we have direct evidence of the power of
an electrified particle to act as a nucleus for a drop of water,
inasmuch as condensation takes place in a steam-jet when
placed near an electrode from which electricity is escaping,
and, further, Mr. Wilson has shown that a cloud is produced
by expansion in dust-free air when an electrode discharging
electricity is placed in the air. A more direct proof of the
point under consideration is afforded by the following experi
ment:--If the ions produced by the Röntgen rays act as
nuclei for the drops, then, since these ions can be withdrawn
from the gas by applying to it a strong electric field, it follows
that a cloud ought not to be formed when the air which is
expanded is exposed to a strong electric field while the ravs
are passing through it. This was found to be the case, and
the experiment is a striking one. Two parallel plates were
placed in the vessel containing the dust-free air; these plates
were about 5 centim. apart, and were large enough to include
the greater part of the air between them. The plates could
be connected with the terminals of a battery of small storage
cells giving a potential-difference of about 400 volts. Röntgen
rays passed through the gas between the plates: this gas had
previously been freed from dust. When the plates were dis

            carried by the Ions produced by Röntgen Rays.         531
   connected from the battery expansion produced a dense cloud;
   when, however, the plates were connected with the battery
  only a very light cloud was produced by the expansion, and
  this cloud was almost as dense when the     <U+017F>º         rays did not
  pass through the air as when they did.
     Another point which had to be investigated was whether
  the cloud produced by the expansion caught all the ions. In
  this connexion it is necessary to point out that it is only
  possible to use expansions comprised within somewhat
 narrow limits.      The ratio of the final to the initial volume of
 the gas has to be between 1:25 and 1:40. For, as Mr. Wilson
  (loc. cit.) has shown, when the expansion exceeds the larger
  of these values a dense cloud is produced even when the gas
 is not exposed to Röntgen rays, with these large expansions
 the cloud is so dense that the increase produced by the
 Röntgen rays is barely perceptible ; while wº the expansion
 is less than the smaller of these values no cloud at all is pro
 duced. With expansions comprised between these limits it
 was found that when the Röntgen rays were strong an increase
 in the strength of the rays did not increase the number of
 drops in the cloud, as determined by the rate of fall of the
 drops, nearly so fast as it increased the number of ions as
 measured by the electrical conductivity of the gas. But with
 these strong rays it was found that the effect of the Röntgen
 rays in producing a cloud was not exhausted by the first
expansion, even when the rays were cut off immediately after
that expansion took place ; for a cloud was produced when a
second expansion was made, and with strong rays it some
times required six or seven expansions, occupying perhaps
five or six minutes, before the effect of the rays had dis
appeared. In the face of this it is evident that when the rays
are strong we are not entitled to assume that all the ions are
brought down by the cloud produced by the first expansion.
The first expansion, however, though it does not bring all the
ions down, seems to increase the size of those left and makes
them more permanent, for the ions which are left after the
first expansion exert an appreciable cloud-producing effect
for several minutes; whereas if no expansion had occurred
the effect of the rays in producing a cloud would only have
lasted for a few seconds after the rays had been cut off.
Again, these modified ions are able to cause a cloud to settle
with an expansion less than 1:25, the minimum expansion
which gives a cloud with the original ions. When once a
cloud has been produced the secondary clouds produced by
subsequent expansions are but little affected by an electric
field, this again indicating that the modified ions are larger.

532       Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Charge of Electricity
and more sluggish than the original ones; the presence of
these modified ions does not seem to give any appreciable
conductivity to the gas. Mr. Wilson found that when in gas
not exposed to Röntgen rays a dense cloud was produced in
dust-free air by a large expansion and then allowed to settle,
a subsequent small expansion (which under ordinary circum
stances would not produce a cloud at all unless dust were
present) would produce a cloud, and that it was necessary to
produce several clouds and allow them to settle before the
gas returned to its normal state. In this case Mr. Wilson's
experiments seem to show that the original nuclei were
excessively minute drops of water, and the formation of the
subsequent cloud would seem to indicate that on those drops
which did not grow large enough to be carried down by the
first cloud some moisture was deposited, and that this was
prevented from evaporating by some kind of chemical change
at its surface such as the formation of hydrogen peroxide.
   Whatever the explanation of these secondary clouds may be
it is evident that when the rays are strong enough to produce
them we cannot deduce the number of ions from observations
on the primary cloud. In the experiments described below the
intensity of the rays was weakened by interposing screens of
aluminium between the bulb and the gas exposed to the rays
until there was no more cloud produced by the second
expansion than would have been produced if the gas had
never been exposed to the rays.
   Another point which had to be investigated was whether the
expansion used was sufficient to bring down all the ions, or
whether the number brought down increased with the amount
of the expansion. To test this measurements were made of
the rate of fall of the clouds formed under exposure to the
rays by different expansions. The results of these experiments
are shown in the following table :-

                          = 1-2 approximately.
   Thus the number of the ions produced by the rays which
are caught by the larger expansion is slightly greater than
that caught by the former. I think that the greater rapidity with
which the larger expansions are made, in consequence of the
greater time the driving force acts on the piston whose motion
produces the expansion, is sufficient to account for this ; for
when the expansion is slow the drops first formed can grow
before the expansion is completed, and thus rob the others of
the water-vapour, so that we should expect to get slightly
more drops as we increased the    º        of the expansion.
   Some experiments made with smaller expansions seemed
rather to indicate a considerable increase in the number of
ions deposited when the expansion was taken from below 1-3
to above it. An increase which seemed rather too large to
be attributed wholly to the increased velocity of expansion,
and to suggest that the ions had not all the same power of
acting as nuclei. I hope to make an independent investigation
of this point, as it is evidently one which might have con
siderable bearing on the problems of atmospheric electricity;
for if the negative ions, say, were to differ in their power of
condensing water around them from the positive, then we

534      Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Charge of Electricity
might get a cloud formed round one set of ions and not round
the other. The ions in the cloud would fall under gravity,
and thus we might have separation of positive and negative
ions and the production of an electric field, the work required
for the production of the field being done by gravity.
   To return, however, to the experiments under consideration.
The method employed for making the cloud and for measuring
the expansion is the same as that used by Mr. Wilson and
described by him in the ‘Proceedings of the Cambridge Phi
losophical Society,' vol. ix. p. 333. The gas which is exposed
to the rays is contained in the vessel A; this vessel communi
cates by the tube B with the vertical tube C, the lower end
of this tube is carefully ground so as to be in a plane perpen
                                                                i.
dicular to its axis, and is fastened down to the indiarubber
stopper D. Inside this tube there is an inverted thin-walled
test-tube, P, with the lip removed and the open end ground
so as to be in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the tube.
                                                                   *
                                                                   -

        carried by the Ions produced by Röntgen Rays.         535
The test-tube slides freely up and down the larger tube and
serves as a piston. Its lower end is always below the surface
of the water which fills the lower part of the outer tube. A
glass tube passing through the indiarubber stopper puts the
inside of the test-tube in connexion with the space E.       This
space is in connexion with an exhausted vessel, F, through the
tube H. The end of this tube is ground flat and is closed by
an indiarubber stopper which presses against it; the stopper is
fixed to a rod, by pulling the rod down smartly the pressure
inside the test-tube is lowered and it falls rapidly until the
test-tube P strikes against the indiarubber stopper. The
tube T, which can be closed by a stop-cock, puts the vessel E
in connexion with the outside air.     The tubes R and S are
for the purpose of regulating the amount of the expansion.
To do this, the mercury-vessel R is raised or lowered when the
test-tube is in the lowest position until the gauge G indicates
that the pressure in A is the desired amount ... the atmo
spheric pressure. The clip S is then closed, and air is admitted
into the interior of the piston by opening the clip T. The piston
then rises until the pressure in A differs from the atmospheric
pressure only by the amount required to support the piston,
this is only a fraction of a millimetre.
   If II is the barometric pressure, then the pressure of the
air before expansion is                        -
                            P1–II—t,
where tr is the maximum vapour-pressure of water at the
temperature of the experiment. The pressure of the air after
the expansion when the temperature has risen to its former
value is                    P. = P1-p,
where p is the pressure due to the difference of level of the
mercury in the two arms of the gauge.

   A is the vessel in which the rate of fall of the fog was
measured and the electrical conductivity of the gas tested.
It is a glass tube about 36 millim. in diameter covered with an
aluminium plate ; a piece of wet blotting-paper is placed on
the lower side of the plate and the current of electricity passed
from the blotting-paper to the horizontal surface of the water
in this vessel. The blotting-paper was placed over the alu
minium plate to avoid the abnormal ionization which occurs
near the surface of a metal against which Röntgen rays strike

536       Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Charge of Electricity
normally. M. Langevin has shown that this abnormal ioni
zation is practically absent when the surfaces are wet.
   The coil and focus-bulb producing the rays were placed
in a large iron tank elevated on supports; in the bottom of
the tank a hole was cut and closed by an aluminium window.
The vessel A was placed underneath this window and the
bulb giving out the rays some distance behind it, so that the
beam of rays escaping from the tank were not very divergent.
The rays were reduced in intensity to any required degree
by inserting different numbers of layers of tinfoil or sheets
of aluminium between the bulb and the vessel.         The tank
and the aluminium plate at the top of A were connected with
earth and with one pair of quadrants of an electrometer. The
other pair of quadrants were connected with the water-surface
B; this surface was charged up by connecting it with one of
the poles of a battery consisting generally of two Leclanché
cells, the other pole of which was connected with earth.
After the surface was charged it was disconnected from the
battery and the insulation of the apparatus tested by observing
whether there was any leak when the Röntgen rays were not
on : the insulation having been proved to be good, the rays
were turned on, when the charge began to leak; by measuring
the rate of leak, the quantity of electricity crossing in one
second the gas exposed to the rays can be determined if the
capacity of the system is known. The effective capacity of
the system consisting of the discharging vessel, the connecting
wires, and the quadrants of the electrometer depends to a large
extent on the charge in the electrometer, and increases so
quickly with the charge that the rate of movement of the
spot of light reflected from the mirror of the electrometer
increases but slowly when the charge in the electrometer is
increased beyond a certain value. The reason for this is
shown by the following investigation.
   Let Q be the charge on the system consisting of the pair
of quadrants and the apparatus connected with it, Vi the
potential of this pair of quadrants, V, the potential of the
other pair, and Vs the potential of the needle; then we have
                    Qi = quV1+qiaW2 + qis Va,
where qu, qiz, qis are coefficients of capacity. Let 6 be the
azimuth of the needle, then if the two pairs of quadrants and
the needle are at the same potential, Qi will not depend upon
6 if the quadrants are symmetrical with respect to the axis of
the needle.   Hence

     If, when the rays are on, the movement of the spot of light
  indicates a change in the potential equal to V per second, then
  the quantity of electricity flowing in that time across the cross
  section of the vessel exposed to the rays is CW. But if n is

also equal to neu,EA, hence we have

so that if we know n and uo we can from this equation deduce
the value of e.
   The method of making the experiments was as follows:—
The aluminium plate and the water-surface were connected
with the poles of two Leclanché cells, and the rate of fall, ri,
of the drops produced by an expansion when the rays were
not on measured ; the rays were now turned on, and the rate
of fall, r, of the cloud now produced by the expansion deter
mined ; the rays were now turned off, and a third expansion
taken, and the rate of fall of the cloud, rs, found ; if rs was
appreciably less than ri, it was taken as indicating that the
ions produced by the rays were too numerous to be caught by
one expansion, and the intensity of the rays was therefore cut
down by inserting aluminium foil between the bulb and the
vessel; this process was repeated until rs was equal to ri, and
then it was assumed that all the ions were caught by the
cloud  F.".       by the expansion. From the rate of fall the
size of the drops was calculated from the formula
                            ºx = 92 ga”
                                     a'
where v is the velocity, a the radius of the drop, and u the
coefficient of viscosity of the gas through which the drop
falls. If q is the mass of water deposited from a cubic centi
metre of the gas, we have
                             q=nº tra".
The method used to determine q is that given by Wilson in
his paper on the formation of clouds in dust-free air (Phil.
 Trans. 1897, A, p. 299). We have the equation
                         Lq=CM(t—t,),
 where L is the latent heat of evaporation of water, C the
 specific heat of the gas at constant volume, M the mass of
 unit volume of the gas, tº the lowest temperature reached by
the expansion, t the temperature when the drops are fully
 grown.
    Since
                             q=p1-p,
 where pi is the density of the water-vapour before conden

                        p=p- T. (t-t').
   Since p is a function of t, this equation enables us to
determine t.    If w is the ratio of the final to the initial volume
and to the temperature before expansion, then, since the mass
of unit volume of air is 00129 grim. at 0° C. and under a
pressure of 760 mm. of mercury, we have
                     M = •00129    X    273

     Since a occurs in the denominator in the terms involving
 1/8, the influence of slipping on the motion of very small
 spheres such as those we are considering will be much more
 important than its influence on the motion of spheres of the
 size used for the bobs of pendulums, for which the influence of
 slipping has been shown to be too small to be detected. We
 cannot, therefore, without further consideration neglect in
 our case the terms involving 1/8a. Some light is thrown on
 the question by the Kinetic Theory of Gases, for according to
  that theory (see Maxwell, “Stresses in Rarefied Gases;”

     In the preceding investigation we have assumed that the
 nuclei producing the cloud are those which cause the con
 ductivity, and are produced by the rays; there is, however,
 a small cloud produced even when no rays are on ; if we
 assume that the nuclei which produce this cloud are still
 active when the rays are on, it follows that in the preceding
 investigation we have over-estimated the number of ions
 engaged in carrying the current by the number of nuclei
 present when the rays are not passing through the gas. As
 the cloud fell three times faster when the rays were not on
 than it did when the rays were on, the number of nuclei
 when the rays are not on is to the number when the rays
 are on as 1 is to 33, or as 1 : 52; hence 1/52 of the nuclei
 are not engaged in carrying the current, so that to get the
 charge on the ions we must increase the value just given in the
 ratio of 1 + 1/52 to 1; this makes
                                e=7.4 × 10-10.

  Another correction has to be made to allow for the conduc

  with which it is coated. Though the walls are insulated from
  the aluminium plate at the top of the vessel, and there is no
  leak between them when the rays are not passing through the
  glass, the conductivity of the glass when the rays are on
  causes the current to travel partly from the aluminium plate
  and along the walls of the vessel instead of wholly through
  the air as has been assumed in the calculations.            To estimate

 the correction two vessels were made of the same shape and
 size, the one precisely similar to that used in these experi
 ments with water at the bottom, while the other had the walls
 covered with shellac varnish, and the water at the bottom was
 replaced by an aluminium plate of the same area, and at the
 same distance from the top plate as the upper surface of the
 water in the other vessel.        The aluminium covers for the two
 vessels were cut from the same sheet of metal.              When these
 vessels were exposed to the Röntgen rays the current through
 the vessel containing water was to that through the other
 vessel as 9 to 8. Thus the current passing directly between
 the plates was 8/9 of the current observed.               Nº.         this

    A series of experiments of a similar kind were made, using
hydrogen instead of air. The number of ions in this gas was
smaller than in the case of air, and the smaller viscosity of
 hydrogen made the drops fall much faster ; the drops formed
without the rays fell so fast, only taking a second or two,
that the rate could not be determined with accuracy, nor was
 it certain that they had reached a steady state. The velocity
 of the hydrogen ion through hydrogen under unit potential
gradient is . as three times that of air and the coefficient
 of viscosity as 9.3 x 10-".

    The value of e for hydrogen has not been corrected in the
way that the value of e for air has been by allowing for the
part of the cloud formed independently of the rays. Allowing
for this the experiments seem to show that the charge on the
ion in hydrogen is the same as        *

   evident bearings on the theory of the ionization of gases pro
   duced by the Röntgen rays.
       In obtaining the above values certain assumptions have been
   made to simplify the calculation which would have the effect of
   making the value of e differ from the true value. Thus, for
   example, we have assumed that the potential gradient is con
   stant between the plates. Prof. Zeleny has shown (Phil. Mag.
   July 1898) that this is not strictly true; the potential fall near
   the plates is greater than the average, while that in the body of
   the gas is less. Thus the potential gradient in the gas is less
   than the difference of potential between the plates divided by
   the distance between them, which is the value we took in the
    preceding calculations. For the very much enfeebled rays
    we used in these experiments the difference between the true
    and the assumed value is so small that it did not seem worth
    while making the elaborate experiments necessary to calculate
    the correction, especially as the variations in the coil &c.
    produced disturbing effects far greater than would result from
    this cause. We have assumed, too, that all the ions produced
    by the rays are brought down by the cloud ; if there were
    any left behind then the value we have deduced for the
    charge would be greater than the true value. The value we
    have found for the charge on the ion produced by Röntgen
    rays is greater than that usually given for the charge on the
    hydrogen atom in electrolysis. There seems, however, to be
     no valid reason against the latter charge having as high a
     value as that we have found. We get from the laws of
     electrolysis, if e is the charge on the hydrogen ion in electro
     static units, N the number of molecules in 1 cub. centim. at
     standard temperature and pressure,
                                Ne= 129 x 10°
     (see Richarz, Bonn Sitzungsberichten, 1891, p. 23); if we
     take e=6.5 x 10-" we get
                                N=20x10°,
     where N, deduced from experiments on the viscosity of air, is
     21 x 10°. Though the measurements of the coefficients of
     viscosity of other gases give in general higher values of N,
     yet the agreement between the value of N deduced from these
     experiments and the value of N got by the Kinetic Theory of
     Gases by viscosity experiments is sufficient to show that
     that theory is consistent with the value we have found for e
     being equal to, or at any rate of the same order as, the charge

 LVIII. On the Forced Precession and Nutations of a Rotating
    Ellipsoidal Shell containing Liquid.           By Prof. W. McF.
    ORR, M.A., Royal College of Science, Dublin *.
 1.  Th; object of the following analysis is mainly to deter
            mine the difference between the precession and
 mutation of a spinning body like the earth subject to external
couples such as those which act on the earth on the hypotheses
 that it is perfectly rigid and that it is a shell filled with liquid.
The liquid is supposed to be homogeneous, incompressible,
and frictionless, the shell to be rigid, and the inner and outer
surfaces to be surfaces of revolution about a common axis.
 Owing to these suppositions the bearing of the results obtained
on the question of the internal liquidity or solidity of the
earth is probably remote. Results for the problem to be
discussed here have been stated long ago by }. Kelvint,
but without any indication of the analysis by which he obtained
them. It will appear that while the results here obtained for
the precession and the nineteen-yearly mutation agree closely
 with Lord Kelvin's, those for the half-yearly and the fort
 nightly nutations differ.
    2. The method employed in specifying the motion of the
shell and contents is due to Greenhillf, and has been already
applied to the discussion of the free oscillations of such a
system by Hough $ in illustration of the free nutations of the
earth.
    We refer to axes fixed with respect to the shell, the axes of
w, y being at right angles in the      º       of the equator, and the
axis of 2 being the polar axis. Let the motion of the shell
and its contents at any instant be the same as if at that instant
the whole system were instantaneously set rotating like a
rigid body with velocities #, m, , and immediately afterwards

    If the shell and contents formed one rigid body this
denominator would be replaced by n(C+C)—a (A+A).
We will suppose that C is greater than A, which is the case
if the outer surface, like the inner, is oblate. It thus appears
that if a be positive (and a be less than n, which is true in the
particular cases to be considered) the disturbance of the shell
is always of the same sign as if the whole were rigid but
greater in amount.        If a be negative, then, when a is
numerically less than en; the disturbance is of the same sign
as if the whole were rigid, but less in amount ; when a is
numerically equal to en the disturbance is zero; when a is
numerically greater than en the sign of the disturbance
depends on the thickness of the shell ; when the thickness is
zero the disturbance is of sign opposite to what it would be if
the whole were rigid, and of amount which may be either greater
or less; the magnitude increases with the thickness of the shell

       a Rotating Ellipsoidal Shell containing Liquid.        549
until for a certain thickness it becomes infinite (the speeds of
the forced and free oscillations then coinciding); then the sign
changes again, and as the thickness is still further increased
the disturbance decreases in magnitude, but is always greater
than if the whole were rigid, and is of the same sign. It
also appears that if a.<U+017F>en be small the disturbance is nearly
the same as if the whole were rigid whatever be the sign
of a .
   3. If the mass of the shell be neglected and e and ea/n be
small, the denominator in (13) and (14) is by (16) approxi
mately Cen”/(a + en). If the whole were rigid the corre
sponding denominator would be Cºn–A'a, in which, if an be
small, the latter term may be neglected. Comparing these
results, it appears that the disturbance of the shell may be
obtained from the disturbance it would experience if the
whole were rigid by multiplication by 1 + a <U+017F>en. It should be
noted that a may be either positive or negative. This result
agrees with Lord Kelvin’s for a negative value of a only; he
appears to have overlooked the distinction in sign.
   4. We will now consider the application of the two hypo
theses to the case of the earth ; it may be well to repeat,
however, that it is not intended to suggest that such an appli
cation is of much practical interest. i. this case the plane
of the ecliptic will be supposed fixed and Z its pole. If ZC
produced through C intersect the equator in A', and B' be the
first point of Libra (B' lying between A and B), the dis
turbing couples are more readily specified with respect to
the axes OA’, O.B'. They consist, of course, of the sum of
a number of terms each of which varies as the sine or cosine
of an angle increasing uniformly with the time; we may take
as typical terms the couple about OA' to be –L' sin st, and
that about OB' to be M’ cos st, the origin of time being properly
chosen. Replacing these couples by equivalent couples whose
axes are OA, OB, that about OA is therefore

     Comparing these couples with those which enter into

 spond to a disturbance whose speed in the sense of the rule of
 Art. 3 is a =s+ $o cosa, and the second terms to one whose
 speed is a '--s 4 jocosa.
     5. For the case of precession L' is zero, s is zero, and
 the two disturbances just mentioned have coincident speeds,
 the value of a being jocos a. From the known value of
 Wºo and the preceding results it appears that if e be large
                        COS a.
compared with 365. 26000' the precession is almost the same
as if the whole were rigid, whatever the thickness of the shell
may be. Actually jº, is negative, and accordingly the rate
of precession of the shell is <U+017F>º than if the whole were rigid.
It should be noted, however, that if the applied couples were
of such a nature as to make the polar axis revolve in the same
direction as that of the rotation, the precession of the shell
would be greater in amount than if the whole were rigid.
    If the mass of the shell be neglected, and if e be supposed
to be sho, the period of precession of the shell would exceed
that of a rigid earth by        [co- (-1) =]

see that the nutation of the massless shell may lºbtained
approximately from the value it would have if the whole were
rigid by multiplying by (1 + s/en) (1–s/n).
   7. In the case of the nineteen-yearly nutation the couples
about OA’, O.B', denoted above by —L' sin st, M'cos st, are
of the forms –K cos a sin pt, — K cos 22 cospt, where p is the
mean speed of the nodes of the moon's orbit along the ecliptic;
so that here s- –p and L'/M/=cos 2/cos 22. Replacing this
ratio by unity, we obtain Lord Kelvin's result that if e=sºo
and the shell be without mass its nutation would be about
# times the value it would have if the whole were rigid.
More accurately, the semiaxes of the ellipse described by the
polar axis of a rigid earth being taken as 9":22 perpen
dicular to and 6'86 parallel to the plane of the ecliptic,
those for the shell would be (9'22 x '966=) 8”91 perpen
dicular to, and (6'86 x '945=) 6'48 parallel to the plane of
the ecliptic.
   If the mass of the shell be taken into account, a conside

552 On Forced Precession &c. of a Rotating Ellipsoidal Shell.
ration of the values of 6, & given in (18), (19) shows that
with the actual values of L'/M', an and the supposed value
of e, for all thicknesses of the shell the semiaxes of the ellipse
described by its polar axis have values between those given
above from the two extreme hypotheses, i. e. the semiaxis
major lies between 8”91 and 9”22, the semiaxis minor
between 6/.48 and 6'86.
   8. In the case of the half-yearly mutation the couples about
the axes OA’, O.B' are of the forms –K sin st, Kcos a cos st,
s denoting twice the earth's mean angular velocity round the
sun". Here L'/M/= 1/cosa. If we replace this ratio by unity we
see from Art. 6 that the nutation of the massless shell (e=º0)
would be approximately 5 times what it would be if the whole
were rigid, and would not be reversed in direction. This
differs from Lord Kelvin’s result. More accurately, taking
the semiaxes of the ellipse described by the axis of a rigid earth
to be 0°55 perpendicular to and 0^51 parallel to the plane
of the ecliptic, those for the shell would be (0^55 x 2.49–)
1":37 perpendicular to, and (0°-51 x 2.77 =) 1":41 parallel to
the plane of the ecliptic.
   If the mass of the shell be taken into account, as now s is
greater than en, the sign of the denominator of the second of
the two fractions in (18), (19) depends on the thickness of
the shell. Accordingly, if the thickness be gradually increased
from zero, for a certain value the nutation perpendicular to
the ecliptic vanishes and changes sign; for a certain greater
value the mutations both parallel and perpendicular to the
ecliptic become infinite and change sign; for another greater
value the nutation parallel to the ecliptic vanishes and
changes sign; and for all greater values the nutations in both
directions remain of the same sign as if the whole were
rigid.
   9. In the case of the fortnightly mutations the couples are
of the same type as in that of the half-yearly; but s is twice
the moon’s mean speed in longitude. Taking the period to
be 13; days, it appears that the nutation of the massless shell
(e=3&o) is approximately 21 times what it would be if the
whole were rigid, and is not reversed in direction. This differs
from Lord Kelvin's result.
   It may be pointed out that for the fortnightly and other
short-period mutations of a rigid earth s cannot be neglected
in comparison with n in equations (22), (23), without intro
ducing a sensible proportionate error; the calculations of
   * See e. g. Routh, “Rigid Dynamics, 4th edit. vol. ii. p. 275, where
the couples causing the half-yearly mutation are given along with that
causing the solar precession.

Peters* involve an approximation equivalent to thus neglecting
s in comparison with n, and the values he obtains for these
mutations are therefore on the whole too small, that for the
fortnightly, which is the most important, being about 1% of
what it should be.                                          - -
     Taking the more accurate expressions for 6, <U+017F>º in (20),
 (21), it appears that the semiaxes of the ellipse in the case of
 a rigid earth being calculated by Peters, with the above error
 as I think, to be 07-0885 perpendicular to and 0"-0812 parallel
 to the plane of the ecliptic, those for the massless shell (e= 3,0)
 would be, with the error corrected, 1"-87 perpendicular to
 and 2'-03 parallel to the plane of the ecliptic.
     If the mass of the shell be taken into account, as its thick
 ness gradually increases from zero the fortnightly nutation
 goes through a series of changes somewhat similar to that in
 the case of the half-yearly.

          LIX. On the Orientation of the Slit in Interference
             Erperiments. By JAMEs WALKER, M.A.f
  IN a paper published in the Phil. Mag. for November 1898
          I considered the question of the admissible width of the
  slit in interference experiments, as carried out with Fresnel's
  mirrors, the biprism, and the divided lens, on the assumption
  that the slit was in its most favourable position, that is,
  parallel to the intersection of the mirrors or to the edge of the
  biprism, or perpendicular to the plane through the principal
  axes of the two halves of the lens.
       M. Fabry, in a general discussion on the visibility of Inter
  ference Fringest, has given an expression for the visibility in
   the case of a faulty orientation of the slit, and has shown that
   the effect is the same as that of a slit in its most favourable
   direction, having a width equal to the projection of the actual
   slit on a plane perpendicular to that direction S. This result
   assumes that the actual slit is so narrow that the visibility of
   the fringes, when it is properly adjusted, may be taken as
   unity, and also that it is not tilted either towards or away
   from the interference apparatus. The effect of such a tilt
   M. Fabry has indeed considered | from a different point of

554               Mr. J. Walker on the Orientation of
 view; but it may perhaps not be out of place to deduce the
 results from a general expression of the visibility of the fringes
 for the case of any orientation and any width of the slit.
    In my former paper I showed that at a point a, y of the
screen the relative retardation of the interfering streams from
a point distant # from the central line of a properly orientated
slit is (measured in length)

Where a, b are the distances of the interference apparatus
             from the slit and the screen respectively;
           20 is the acute angle between the mirrors;
          a1, as are the acute angles of the prism;
          2e is the separation of the halves of the lens;
          F is the absolute value of the focal length of the lens.
    Suppose now that the slit is turned first round the line
 bisecting its length through an angle p, and then about its
 centre round a normal to its new plane through an angle 6;
 then if u, v be the distances of a point of the slit from lines
 bisecting its breadth and its tººl. we have to             write
                   a-sin p(usin 6+ v cos 6) for a,

proportional to

   * This neglects small terms arising from 2 in the case of the biprism,
and —y sin & sin q should be added to the coefficient of u and y'cos 6 sin ºp

   independent source of light, the intensity due to the whole

   bands.
      When 6=0, the visibility is independent of the length of
   the slit at the point a = 0, and is given by the absolute value
   of sin (Tyk/A)/(Tyk/A). On moving away from this point
   the bands become less and less distinct, disappear when
   w=X/(8' sin ºp. l), and then reappear as a set of bands com
   plementary to the former, and so on.
      At a given point c of the field the visibility is independent
   of the length of the slit only if

 and the visibility at the point is then the absolute value of
 sin (tyk sec 6/X)/(Tyk sec 6 A).
    It thus follows that if the slit be inclined with its upper
 part towards the interference apparatus, a rotation of the slit
in its own plane in a direction from y towards a causes the
 point of maximum distinctness to move in the direction of
 positive a *.
   If p=0, the visibility is given by the absolute value of
                sin (Tyk cos 6/A), sin (Tyl sin 6/N).

result that is obvious from other considerations; and when k
is a small fraction of X/y, the visibility is given by the
absolute value of sin (Tryl/sin 6/X)/(Tyl sin 6/A), so that the
slit acts as a slit properly orientated of width equal to the
projection of the actual slit on a plane perpendicular to its most
favourable direction. This is M. Fabry's result mentioned
above.
   If 6=0, b=0, the bands disappear when k=\<U+017F>y, and in
this case a rotation of the slit increases the visibility, and
would theoretically cause a reappearance of the bands. A
consideration of the magnitude of the quantities involved
shows, however, that the increase of the visibility is too slight
to be noticed.
   When the slit is properly adjusted (0=0, b=0), the
bands attain their second maximum of distinctness when
k=1.4303X/y, their visibility being about ; ; if then we take
Lord Rayleigh's resulti that the limit of visibility is reached
when the ratio of the illuminations at the darkest and brightest
parts of a system of bands is '975, which corresponds to a
visibility of sº, the bands will disappear when the slit is rotated
  * It is obvious that these phenomena cannot be observed in all cases.
Thus with a biprisin and sodium light, if l- 1 cm., q=10°, the point at
which the bands would first disappear falls outside the field common to
the two streams, unless b tan 8 (a+b) exceed 026, where 6 is the deviation
produced by the biprism. M. Fabry has, however, observed the phe
momenon with Fresnel's mirrors (loc. cit. p. 33).

    of brightness of the field the limit of visibility may be regarded
    as constant. It might be of interest to test this point, em

     IN a course of lectures recently delivered at the Cavendish
           Laboratory, Prof. J. J. Thomson described a mechanical
     model which obeyed the formula given by Helmholtz for the
     velocity of propagation of waves in a medium capable of
     absorption.

560    Dr. J. H. Vincent on the Construction of a Mechanical
                   Description of the Model.
   The model used to obtain the results given in fig. 2 is a
modification of that of Prof. Thomson.
   The cord is replaced by a loaded spiral spring, about two
metres long when kept under a small tension equal to the
weight of two or three grams. The spring was wound in one
piece on a cylinder about 75 centim. thick. The cylinder
was chosen by trial until the released spring was just large
enough to receive a number of leaden bullets (see fig. 3).
                             Fig. 3.
    Each bullet was provided with a pair of hooks and cemented
 into the hollow of the spring.   One hook served to attach a
 weight hanging by a thread, the other to fasten the bullet to
 a long thread suspended from a plank fastened to the ceiling
 (fig. 4). The spring was made of thin brass wire (No. 30,
 Birm. W. G.). There were about 40 bullets inserted in the
 spring, each being distant five turns from its neighbours.
    The length of the supporting threads was 271 centim.,
 while those attached to the lower system of weights were
 56.5 centim. long. The hanging weights were about twice
 as heavy as the bullets, the values of the constants being
                Mass of bullet = 13.8 grams.
                             a = 1'12 per sec.
                             b=      66 per sec.
    The motion was in a horizontal plane transverse to the length
  of the model. Without the hangers the model is suitable for
  illustrating sound and light; the motion in this case may be
  made either longitudinal or transverse, and is so slow as to
  be easily followed by the eye.

                    Method of Observation.
   The model was driven by means of pendulums, and also by
an ordinary metronome.         e latter is on the whole more
convenient; the frequencies must, of course, be determined
by timing and not from the graduations of the instrument.
   The motion becomes regular very soon after the metronome
is started. Standing waves are set up which enable the
velocity to be readily found.
                             Fig. 4.

                          3% mat. size.
                  Results of the Experiments.
   The results obtained are given in fig. 2.
   The ordinates are the reciprocals of the velocities, and
hence proportional to the refractive index. All the velocities
determined are inserted.

  562 Dr. J. H. Vincent on the Construction of a Mechanical
      The unbroken vertical lines represent the values of b and a.
  The free frequency of the suspended weights (which are a
  series of simple pendulums) is '66 per sec. The value of a
  is obtained by multiplying this number by the ratio of the
   sum of the masses of bullet and hanger to that of the bullet.
       As the frequency increases from 0 to b, the wave-length
   and velocity decrease. The lower system moves in the same
   phase as the upper system in this part of the curve. When
   n=l, the lower particles are thrown into violent agitation ;
   but when n is a little greater than b the model refuses to
   propagate the motion at all. The effect is most striking
   when n approaches a. In this case the model presents a
   most curious appearance; the metronome may be left driving
   the model for a long while, but the only effect is a slight
   bending near the point of attachment to the driving apparatus.
   The whole model comports itself as if made of some pliable
   non-elastic material.
        When n is a little greater than a, the waves can again be
   observed. As n increases, the wave-length and velocity
    decrease. The upper and lower system move in opposite
   phase in this portion of the curve near a ; when the frequency
    is higher the hanging weights are unaffected, and the velocity
    becomes independent of the frequency.
          Comparison of Theoretical and Experimental Curves.
        The former has been drawn so as to coincide with the
    latter when n=2. Although the two curves are in general
     alike, a marked discrepancy occurs when the frequency is
     low. This is due to the controlling influence of the threads
     by which the bullets are hung from the roof. One would
     expect the effect to become noticeable when the frequency
     of the waves traversing the model begins to approach the
     value of the free frequency of a particle suspended from the
     roof at the same height as the bullets. This frequency is
      '3 per second, and is shown in fig. 2 as a broken line. The
      effect is in the direction to be expected, as an extra force of
      restitution would increase the velocity of propagation.
                     The Apparatus as an x-Ray Model.
         Soon after the discovery of w-rays, Sir George Stokes
      suggested that they consisted not of periodic vibrations but
      of pulses. Prof. J. J. Thomson has lately given a mathe
      matical theory, according to which the Röntgen rays consist
      of very thin electromagnetic pulses of great intensity, due to
      the sudden stoppage of the cathode carriers.
         In this theory the thickness of the pulse may be regarded
      as analogous to wave-length in optics.
f

   Model to illustrate Helmholtz's Theory of Dispersion. 563
   We have seen that waves of high frequency are propagated
along the upper system of particles in the model with a
velocity independent of the     wº           and that for such
waves the lower system remains undisturbed during their
passage. Similarly, when pulses of short duration are sent
along the upper system, the hanging weights remain at rest,
the velocity of propagation being independent of the inertia
of the hangers, .." only influenced by the latter inasmuch as
their weight increases the tension of the threads.
   Thus the way in which the model propagates such short
pulses illustrates the passage of a-rays through media which
are dispersive for light.
                            Conclusion.
   If another model similar to that described above had to be
constructed, the changes most desirable would be to increase
the length of the whole apparatus, and to set it up in a lofty
room so that the influence of the supporting threads would
be lessened. The object of these threads is simply to counter
act gravity, and so enable small velocities to be used.
   Although more troublesome to construct, either of the
following arrangements might be used. Still employing
transverse waves, the bullets might be fastened to the lower
ends of a series of light rods. These rods could be vertical
and free to move about a horizontal axle through their centre
and parallel to the spring. The free end of each rod would
carrry a bullet like those in the spring.
   If compressional waves were used, a similar arrangement
could be employed, the rods being in this case horizontal, and
their free ends loaded with a mass equal to the sum of the
masses of a bullet and hanger. The rods would be supported
at their centres on pivots.
   It need scarcely be pointed out that the values of a and b
would have to be computed before the construction of the
model, and the masses chosen so as to have the interesting
portions of the curve in a region of accessible frequency.
   I am indebted to Prof. J. J. Thomson for having recom
 mended this work to me, and also for many valuable sug
gestions.

  LXI. An Influence-Machine.       By W. R. PIDGEON, M.A."
    N June 23rd, 1893, I showed an influence-machine at a
      Meeting of this Society, which was described in the
Phil. Mag. for September 1893, but which had the disadvan
tage of being an expensive machine to make. I now show a
form of  ...i. which       not only gives better results, but is
both cheap to manufacture, and has qualities which may, I
think, interest the Members of this Society, especially in
regard to its suitability for exciting Röntgen-ray tubes.
   The machine consists of one or more pairs of glass disks
mounted on a spindle and running in opposite directions,
with earthing-brushes arranged similarly to a Wimshurst
machine. The disks are of ordinary glass, and are covered
with sectors about an inch or an inch and a half wide at the
circumference, and placed about one-eighth of an inch apart.
These sectors stand radially, and each carries a small brass
contact-knob K. The disks are covered with wax composed
of half paraffin and half rosin by weight. The wax covers up
and insulates the whole of each sector except the small brass
    * Communicated by the Physical Society: read Oct. 28, 1898.

         Mr. W. R. Pidgeon on an Influence-Machine.            565
contact-knob which peeps above it. Each of the earthing
brushes, E, passes through and supports a fixed insulated in
ductor, I, which is formed of tinfoil stuck to an ebonite backing
and insulated with wax.      The surface of the wax on all the
inductors and disks is carefully varnished several times with
filtered shellac to protect the wax and give it a hard surface.
Each inductor is kept charged by a stationary point, P, con
nected to it and placed so as to collect, from the revolving disk,
shortly before the main collecting brushes C. The sectors on
each of the disks are earthed at the moment when they are
passing between the opposite disk on the one hand and the
fixed inductor on the other, both of which carry a charge of
the same sign. The sectors therefore receive their charge at
a moment when their capacity is at a maximum owing to
their standing between two charged inductors. As each
Sector moves away from the brush to the right and out of the
influence of the inductor its capacity decreases, and therefore
its potential rises, and when it is opposite the point at which
its fellow disk is being earthed, its potential is proportionately
much higher than in the Wimshurst form of machine; and it
therefore induces a proportionately higher charge on the
sector being earthed. This sector, as it moves away from its
inductor to the left, again rises in potential; and on arriving
at the earthing-brush induces a still higher potential on the
sectors moving to the right. This cumulative action goes on
in a sort of geometrical progression until, as a matter of fact,
the output of this form of machine rises to about four times
that of a Wimshurst of a similar size when measured by the
overflow of a leyden-jar (25 oz.).
    It may help to make the action of the machine more clear
if we regard it from the point of view of its being a condenser,
the  <U+017F>º      of which can be charged in one position, then
shuffled, to bring the positives and negatives together, and
thus discharged. For the fact that each sector is imbedded
in an insulator enables it to receive a charge on each face as
it stands between the disk and the inductor, like a plate in a
 condenser. It therefore carries forward a double charge, so
 to speak, as compared with that carried forward by a machine
 without inductors. Again, the drop of capacity and con
 sequent rise in potential of the sector as it moves away from
 the inductor is so great, that the induction of the machine is
 also practically doubled, and hence the total output is mul
 tiplied by four. That is to say, a machine having inductors
 which act upon numerous insulated sectors is equivalent in
º to four machines of the same size of the ordinary
  ype.

   Mr. Wimshurst's 8-plate 15-in. machine, which he kindly
tried for me himself, requires 97-07 sq. ft. per spark.
   The length of spark between knobs is approximately the
same as in a willº, of the same size, but, if anything,
slightly less. If, however, the fixed inductors are taken away
and the wax disks run with the brushes on alone, the machine
gives much longer sparks; but its output is then decreased to
a little less than double that of a Wimshurst.
   My machine, 19 in., without inductors, requires 45 sq. ft.
per spark.
   The wax which covers the disks prevents the sectors leaking
from any point except the small brass contact-knobs, and
thus enables the machine to work in the dampest weather;
in fact, it may be sponged with water, or have water squirted
at it, and yet will work if only it is first wiped up with a
duster. Dirt, likewise, makes almost no difference; and
usually the induction starts up before the disks have made a
revolution, even though the machine may have been left
standing for weeks. It will, moreover, ". on short circuit;
and in all but the very worst weather, or after standing idle
for a long time, it is not necessary for any of the brushes to
actually touch the contact-knobs.
   The fact that the only place from which a sector can leak
electrically is from its small brass collecting-knob, makes it
possible to run disks so large as to almost touch the first
motion-shaft below or the collectors on either hand.                        This
obviously allows the machine to be snugged up, and so save
cupboard-room.
   The collectors have been covered with ebonite, and every
thing has been done to expose as little naked surface as pos
sible, partly for convenience in handling, but chiefly to enable
the machine to be used in bad weather.
   When exciting a Crookes or Jackson tube the knobs of the
dischargers should be brought to either end of the tube, the
terminals of which should also be capped with brass knobs
to prevent any brush-discharge.

LXII. On Iso-periodic Systems. By Lord RAYLEIGH, F.R.S.*
 IN general a system with m degrees             of freedom vibrating
       about a configuration of equilibrium has m distinct
 periods, or frequencies, of vibration, but in particular cases
 two or more of these frequencies may be equal. The simple
 spherical pendulum is an obvious example of two degrees of

 Thus every point of the system describes an elliptic orbit in
the same periodic time.
    An interesting case is afforded by a line of similar bodies
of which each is similarly connected to its neighbours”.

A1, A2 . . . to the kinetic energy. Here C1, A1 represent the
influence of immediate neighbours distant a from one another,
C, As the influence of neighbours distant 2a, and so on.
 Further, k denotes 27:/\, X being the wave-length. If
 CI, C, ..., A1, A2 . . . vanish, each body is uninfluenced by
its neighbours, and the case is one considered by Reynolds of
a number of similar and disconnected pendulums hanging side
by side at equal distances. It is obvious that a vibration of
any type is normal and is executed in the same time. If
we consider a progressive wave, its velocity is proportional to
 A. A disturbance communicated to any region has no ten
 dency to propagate itself; the “group velocity’ is zero.
    Although the line of disconnected pendulums is interesting
and throws light upon the general theory of wave and group
propagation, one can hardly avoid the feeling that it is only
by compliment that it is regarded as a single system. It is
therefore not without importance to notice that there are
 other cases for which n assumes a constant, and the group
velocity a zero, value. To this end it is only necessary that

 If this condition be satisfied, the connexion of neighbouring
bodies does not entail the propagation of disturbance. Any
number of the bodies may remain at rest, and all vibrations
have the same period.

interesting to draw an illustration from the case of continuous

 Die Optik der elektrischen Schwingungen. By A. RIGH1, Professor
    of Physics in the University of Bologna. Translated into German
    by B. DEss AU, Privatdocent in the University of Bologna.
   Leipsic, O. R. Reisland, 1898.
TIE object of Professor Righi in writing this treatise on electric
        waves was principally to set forth the experimental evidence
of their identity with light waves. After a preliminary section,
devoted to a description of the apparatus used in producing and
detecting electric oscillations, he gives an account of the phenomena
of interference, diffraction, reflexion, refraction, and polarization
exhibited by the waves, in each case pointing out the analogy
between the visible and the electric waves.        The author has done
 excellent work in this field of research, and many of the experi
 mental arrangements described are those which he has found
 most satisfactory, while the experiments on elliptic polarization
 and double refraction of electric waves, and the comparison of
their results with optical theory, are almost entirely his own work.
The present translation contains an account of two papers pub
lished since the issue of the Italian original, the subjects being
the principal refractive indices of gypsum for electromagnetic
waves, and the orientation of a selenite disk in a uniform electric
field. The translator has had the advantage of access to the
author's apparatus, and of conference with him; he has thus been
able to avoid many of the ambiguities frequently occurring in
descriptions of experimental work when the translator has not
 witnessed the experiments which he describes. To those who find
difficulties with the Italian language the present volume may
prove a useful introduction to Professor Righi's work.            J.L.H.

   Edition. Pages viii and 256, with numerous Illustrations.
   Small 8vo. Murby: London, 1898. Price 1s. 6d.
   Mr. Sydney B. J. Skertehly originated this little book on Geology
more than twenty years ago, when he was one of H.M. Geological
Surveyors. He was impressed with the necessity of teaching that
the earth is an integral part of the universe, and that its past and
present conditions have resulted from the action of heat upon
matter in its different states. Hence the leading idea of this work
is that all geological agencies can be resolved into heat; and that
the origin of the Earth itself, of the rocks which constitute it, and
of the forms which the surface presents, are all either due to, or
have been influenced by heat, either internal or external.
   With these principles in view, there is a continuous line of
thought, and a well-linked chain of facts and notions, connecting
the scientific details in the history of the Earth and the description
of its structure and conditions.      Its inhabitants, too, of all kinds,
both in past and present ages, have been vitally affected by the
Earth's caloric, however distributed in time and place. “This
work therefore traces the history of the evolution of the Earth
inductively, and assigns to Geology its true place as a branch of
celestial kinetics, . . . . and places the subject in the light of a
living science, instead of a collection of dry details concerning
rocks and their contents.”                       -
   With the foregoing reasons for the classification of its subject

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             571
matters, this text-book treats of Division I.-(1) the Earth's origin
and the Nebular Hypothesis. (2) Igneous action; internal heat.
(3) Wolcanoes and volcanic rocks; intrusive and plutonic rocks.
(4) Metamorphism of rocks. (5) Earthquakes, and earth-movements.
Division II. (6) Aqueous action ; its results in forming strata
derived from rocks denuded by rain, rivers, frost, snow, ice, and
glaciers. (7) Climate; its changes and effects. Division III. (8)
Life; fossils. (9) Stratigraphical Geology; the successive groups
of strata and their fossils. Division IV. (10) Petrology; structure
and conditions of strata and other rock-masses; mineral veins :
mineralogy; crystallography. (11) The classification and methods
 of recognizing and distinguishing minerals and rocks.
     The fourth Division or Section has been added to this edition,
 “ embracing all the more recent requirements of the South
 Kensington Syllabus, which now includes under the name of
 “Geology’ many topics which were formerly confined to Mineralogy
 and Crystallography. The new matter comprises chapters on rock
 forming minerals, their composition, distribution, characters, and
 the methods of their identification; on crystallography; on volcanic
 and plutonic rocks, and the microscopic examination of rocks.”
     Further chapters give a glossary or instructive explanation of
  some technical terms relating to common and important pheno
  mena met with by the geologist; also a table of the range in time
  of important fossil genera (this will bear improvement); appendix
  on Geological Surveying; and some examination-papers set at
  South Kensington in 1895-98; there is also an index.
      This is one of “Murby's Science-and-Art-Department Series of
  Text-books"; and doubtless it is far better, in both construction
  and contents, than many of the small manuals of geology that are
  in the hands of students; and it rivals in value some of the more
  costly text-books. Besides the good arrangement of the manifold
  aspects and evidences of the science, the statements and description
   are clearly and tersely given; the leading words are well distin
   guished by proper types in the text; and the technical terms are
   etymologically explained at one place or another (but at page 67
   “strechan, the stretch,” should be strechen, to stretch).
       The letterpress and, in some cases, the woodcuts are not clearly
   printed. The zoologist might easily find fault with some of the
   figures of, and references to, the lower animals: there are some
   misprints, as “Syenetic”; siliceous rocks, a<U+017F> p. 78, are not at all
   well defined; and calcite is omitted from the hexagonal system at
    p. 198; there are several slips in the latinity, such as “folia,”
   instead of folium, a leaf; and the false concord of Echinoidea
   regulares et irregulares Nevertheless this is a good and useful
   text-book, and we recommend it for use in schools and colleges.

    1. THE teeth of the wheels of the model described in my pre

    constituent wheels themselves are divisible into two classes accord
    ing as the screws are left-handed or right-handed.

    2. Models of the kind described may therefore likewise belong
 to either of two classes—one constructed with wheels whose teeth
 form left-handed screws; the other with wheels whose teeth are
 right-handed.
    3. The properties of models of the two kinds are, when con
 sidered each by itself, identical; but relatively to each other they
 exhibit symmetrical inversion.
    4. On attempting to combine a constituent of one of the above
 classes with one of the other class, it is found that it is possible
 to make them gear into each other only when their axes of
 revolution are parallel. Such a combination of helical-toothed
 gearing with parallel axes has a similar property to a combination
 with axes at right angles (the separate wheels being consequently
 of the same kind): a limited positive or negative acceleration of
 the rotation of one of them causes the rotatory motion of both to
 be partially transformed into motion of translation: the wheels
 move in opposite directions along their axes of rotation until the
 acceleration ceases or is replaced by one of opposite sign, and so
 on (vid. Phil. Mag. loc. cit.).
    5. By combining with each other in different ways pairs of right
 handed and pairs of left-handed helical-toothed wheels (thus forming
 at the same time one or more of the pairs mentioned in the last
 paragraph), various closer combinations can be made, each of
 which is distinguishable from the rest, and can in turn serve, as a
unit of a higher order, for building up a wheel-model with a regular
 distribution in space, and with the described properties of trans
forming rotatory motion into motion of translation.
   6. The number of possible models of this latter kind is, in general,
dependent upon the number of elements which go to the formation
of their constituents, the more numerous these are, the longer in
each case is the series of the possible resulting combinations.

IN the May number of this Magazine (pp. 432–447) Mr. A. P.
 Wills has described a method of measuring with the balance the
susceptibility of diamagnetic and feebly magnetic substances. I
venture to point out that the same method was described by me
so long ago as 1889 (Tageblatt der 62 Versammlung deutscher
Naturforscher und Aerzte in Heidelberg, pp. 209–211), as used for
measuring the magnetic constants of Iron, Nickel, Cobalt, Oxide
of Iron and Bismuth, parallel and perpendicular to the lines of
magnetic force. The method effects for solids precisely what the
method I have given of measuring magnetic forces by means of
hydrostatic pressure does for liquids (Wiedemann's Annalen, xxiv.
pp. 347–416, 1885), and has for ten years past been repeatedly
used in my Laboratory here, as for instance by Herr Paul Meyer
(Dissertation, Heidelberg, 1889 : Electrotechnische Zeitschrift, X.
pp. 582–587); Max Weber (Wiedemann's Annalen, liv. pp. 30–43,
1895), and Ernst Seckelson (Dissertation, Heidelberg, 1898).
