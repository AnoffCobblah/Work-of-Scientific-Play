    IN       a memoir published last yeart, I derived for the motion of
            a material point about a fixed centre of attraction, and for
    the motion of two material points around each other, some new
    relations between period of revolution,                           vis

    place      closed paths.

    to   me important              to  extend the same method    treating the subof
    ject  to the case            in   which the paths    not form closed curves;

   This is very similar to equation (1); in some relations it is
more general.     First, Lipschitz has given it a more general sig
nification, as he advances it not merely for free systems, but also
for systems which are subject to certain conditions; and, secondly,
for each point a special defined position is assumed, which is
subject to further arrangement, while in (1a) the corresponding
position marked out for each point is the initial point of the
coordinates.       In other relations, on the contrary, it is more
limited, as in it the forces are presupposed to have a force-func
tion, which is not the case in (1a).
    Further than this equation (numbered 6 in his memoir) the
agreement of Lipschitz's considerations with mine does not ex
tend, as from this point he gives quite another turn to the inves
tigation.     While even equation (1), which is more general than
             I
 (1a), have applied to stationary motions, and for these have
derived equation (2), Lipschitz proceeds as follows.                 First he
gives to his equation another form, in that he eliminates from it
the vis viva by means of the relation which subsists between this
and the force-function.         Then he goes on to further specialize
 his equation     by  making     definite suppositions concerning the
 nature of the force-function, particularly this—that it is an alge
 braic homogeneous function of the elementsa,—a,y,-ba,2,-ca.
 For the cases limited by these presuppositions, he then inquires
 what condition is necessary and sufficient in order that the mo
 tion may be stable.        This investigation              account is,      on
                                                                           the                 of

   2. As for my second equation, will here quote it only in the I
form which it has for a single movable point, since that form is
sufficient for the following considerations, and the extension of
it to a system of any number of points would require analyses
of too great a length.
   This equation stands in connexion with those which express
the proposition of least action and Hamilton’s amplification of
the same; yet in an essential point it is different from them, as
will be immediately evident when I put here the two latter
equations,         so that          all   three may             be   seen together.

   Under the microscope this rock is seen to consist of a felsitic
base containing crystals of orthoclase.     The base is composed
of highly  altered felspar, pseudomorphs,   apparently after horn
blende, and numerous sphaerulites exhibiting a radial structure.
These sphaerulitic bodies are not terminated by sharp outlines,
but become gradually blended with the surrounding base; their
radial structure, however, is perfectly defined, particularly when
examined by polarized light.     There is a green flocculent sub
stance disseminated throughout the base; and many small patches
of quartz are observed, which, by polarized light, appear to break
up into granules. There are also prisms of a green colour,
which are apparently altered hornblende; in a few cases one
portion of a crystal is seen to be composed of some hornblendic
mineral, while the remainder has been replaced by felspar.              In
some of the sections examined minute             spots  and   microscopic
crystals of iron pyrites were observed.
    This rock would be generally described as a porphyry; but
Mr. S. Allport, who at my request had the kindness to cut and
examine a section of            it,

     A    microscopical
                      examination of this rock does not afford
much information not to be obtained by a close inspection of
hand-specimens.      A large proportion of the felspar is seen to
be monoclinic; but triclinic felspar is also present in considerable
quantity. The outlines of the crystals are not in               cases                            all
sharply defined, and they are sometimes rendered slightly cloudy

     My friend, Mr. W.                   J.
                           Henwood, has called my attention to
the fact that so long ago as 1827 waters rich in chloride of
sodium had been found in some of the Cornish mines by Mr. R.
W. Fox. This gentleman says+, “In some instances have de                                   I
tected common salt, particularly in the water from the bottom of the
 United Mines, the Consolidated Minest, Huel Unity, and Poldice.
 Out of the 92 grains of residuum from the latterf, 24 grains
 proved to be the muriate of soda, 52 grains the muriates of lime
 and magnesia, and the remainder muriatic acid with iron and
 sulphate of lime.   The water from another part of the same
 mine contained 5% grains of common salt.         All these mines are
in “killas’ or primitive slate, and several miles from the sea.
It may be inferred from such facts as these that the sea
water must in some places penetrate into the fissures of the
earth.”
    Previously to discussing whether the water in question is or
is not the result of infiltrations from the sea, it will be instruc
tive to compare, by calculation,                      its
                                        composition with that     sea                           of

     If theHuel Seton spring be regarded as only yielding modi
fied and diluted sea-water, it will be found, on comparing the
two columns of the foregoing Table, that the percentage of chlo
rine in the second has been considerably augmented, that the
sulphuric acid has almost entirely disappeared, silica and alu
mina have been taken up, and the amount of calcium has been
greatly increased, whilst magnesium has, on the contrary, been
abstracted.    The amount of alkaline chlorides has thereby been
much reduced ; but a considerable quantity of lithium has
entered into solution.
    It would at first appear that the presence of a much larger
amount of chlorine in the waters of the saline spring than should
be found in dilute sea-water holding an equal quantity of solid
constituents in solution affords an argument against the proba
bility of the Huel Seton waters having had such an origin.                                           If,

      The analyses of the different rocks in the vicinity of the spring
    have shown     that the granite only could have furnished the
    lithium, of which the waters have taken up a notable amount.
º       A consideration of the various phenomena connected with the
    occurrence of this and other apparently similar springs which
    have at different times been discovered in the district, would
    seem to lead to the inference that they       have some more            all                              or
    less direct communication with the sea, and that they are either

truths by induction, was reserved for the experimental sciences,

tions, such as suburaction and division, when regarded as opera
tions upon unitates, involve mathematical investigation and a
rigid comparison of results.    These results used for comparison,
may either consist of the separate determination of unitates by
totally distinct processes, or of individual examples obtained by
the application of unitation to checking calculations that are
known to be correct.

which is borne out by the Table of reciprocals calculated by
means that are totally independent of series.
   From the values that have been thus obtained and verified for
the unitates of the reciprocals of 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, it follows that,
in any division sum which has these unitates in the divisor, the
corresponding unitates of their reciprocals may be written as
multipliers to find the unitate of the quotient. For instance, in
               given, the following is the readiest process of
# =5, as above
unitation—the                 unitate of
                                           * =7 x2 = 14=5,                          and the unitate of
5=5.          This substitution of multiplication for division cannot
be made in the case of the unitates of the reciprocals of 3, 6, or
9; therefore in the cases in which 3, 6, or 9 is in the denomi
nator, and in these cases only, it is necessary to preserve the
fractional form of the unitate during the whole of the process of
unitation.
   Thus, considered in eatenso, subtraction gives birth to co-uni
tates or negative unitates, and inverse powers, or the operation
of division, to fractional unitates, or unitates that are irreducible
to the whole number form.

Phºtº                   to a discussion of some questions connected
      with the earth’s contraction, I here present a statement of
the views which I have entertained with regard to the prominent
results of this agency.    They first appeared in 1846 and 1847,
in volumes ii., iii., and               iv.   of

    1. The defining of the continental and oceanic areas began
with the commencement of the earth's solidification at surface,
as proved by the system of progress afterward.
    2. The continental areas are the areas of least contraction,
and the oceanic basins those of greatest, the former having
earliest had a solid crust.   After the continental part was thus
stiffened and rendered     comparatively  unyielding, the oceanic
part went on cooling, solidifying, and contracting throughout;
consequently it became depressed, with the sides of the depres
sion somewhat abrupt. The formation of the oceanic basins and
continental areas was thus due to “unequal radial contraction”.
    3. The principal mountain-chains are portions of the earth’s
crust which have been pushed up, and often crumpled or pli
cated, by the lateral pressure resulting from the earth’s con
traction.

     1. Have subsidences been produced by lateral pressure ?
   The theory of Professor James Hall, that the great subsidences
of the globe have been made by the gravity of accumulating
sediments, has been shown elsewhere” to be wholly at variance
with physical law.
    Another theory is presented by Professor LeConte in his
recent paper in the last volume of the American Journal of
Science, to which the reader is referred.   Admitting, with Pro
fessor Hall,  that the mean thickness of the accumulations in the
Appalachian region of Pennsylvania is 40,000 feet, and therefore
that this is the measure of the gradual subsidence that attended
their deposition, he shows that the temperature in the bottom
deposits would have been, supposing the usual rate of increase
downward (1°F. for 58 feet of descent) 800°F., and at 10,000
feet           230°F.;            that hence there would have re
                            and he argues
sulted below, first, “lithification and therefore increasing den
sity, and therefore contraction and subsidence pari passu with the
deposit;” next, or at a greater depth, “aqueo-igneous softening”
or “melting,” the temperature of 800°F. being “certainly suf
ficient to produce this result as well as metamorphism, and
during this process the subsidence would probably continue;”
and, in addition, the underlying strata on which the sediments
were deposited would have participated in the “aqueo-igneous
fusion ” and thus have added to the resulti.

46               Prof.      J.   D. Dana    on some Results       of
     No other cause of the gradual subsidence than that here cited
is appealed to.
   Now the whole of this contraction took place, if any occurred,
in the underlying Archaean rocks (Azoic, or Laurentian and Hu
ronian); for in obtaining by measurement this thickness (40,000
feet) the contracted rocks were measured.
   The 40,000 feet of subsidence required was therefore wholly
independent     of contraction in the stratified sediments.     But
these   underlying    Archaean rocks were    probably  crystallized
before the Palaeozoic era began ; for in New York and New
Jersey they are in this condition, and they underlie the Silurian
rocks unconformably; and the New-Jersey Archaean or High
land region is but a northern part of that of Pennsylvania and
Virginia. They would consequently have expanded with the
heat instead of contracting.      Even if not crystallized,    they
would have been well compacted under the enormous weight of
40,000 feet of strata; and no experiments on rocks that I have
met with authorize the assumption that the ordinary law of ex
pansion from heat would have been set aside.
                                                       I
   For further argument on this point refer to the subsidence
in the Connecticut valley during the era of the Connecticut
river sandstone (supposed to be Triassico-Jurassic).    The                      thick
ness of rock produced in the era was probably about 4000 feet;
and this is the extent, therefore, of the registered subsidence.
The sandstone strata, as is apparent in many places, rest on
the upturned metamorphic rocks (gneiss, mica-schist, &c.) of
Palaeozoic or earlier age.     As shown in the preceding para
graph, the contraction, under Professor LeConte's principle,
must have been confined to the underlying rocks; and since
these are crystalline metamorphic schists, and the depth of sand
stone was not sufficient to raise much the temperature within
them (the rocks are in general little compacted and often feebly
solidified), the heat ascending from below as accumulation went
on above would have produced expansion instead of contraction.
   Without further reference to facts, it                  is,
                                                 think, clear that

one that could        do
                      work its spite    opposition

 2. Have elevations          been produced                   directly by lateral pressure ?
  The theory of Professor Hall denies that mountains are a
result of local elevations, or of any elevation apart from a general
continental. This hypothesis I have elsewhere discussed”.
    Professor LeConte makes the elevation of mountains real;
but after explaining that the crushing effects of lateral thrust
would necessarily cause a lengthening upward of the compressed
strata (as in the compression of slate rocks attending the pro
duction of slaty cleavage), and thereby produce a large amount
of actual elevation, arrives at the view that there is no perma
ment elevation beyond what results from crushing. With crush
ing, in this action, plication is associated; but it should have a
larger place than his words seem to give it (in           plication the                  all
 rocks over   a region being pressed into        narrower space, which
                                                                    a

 tenfold more work         this kind than crushing.
     But are plication and crushing the only methods             produ                               of
 cing, under lateral pressure, the actual elevations          mountain                         of

  same time   at  least 300 feet, and the coast       Maine 150      200       of

  cation of  the upper rocks occurred; and none         the under rocks             in
  could well have taken place without exhibitions           the surface;                  at
  and this  cause,  therefore, cannot account for the elevation.    The
  elevated sea-border deposits         the region are

48                 Prof.     J.   D. Dana on        some Results         of
larger part, or all, of the Tertiary era. But the local crushing
or plication of these beds cannot account for the elevation; and
no other crushing among the surface-rocks of the mountains
can be referred to this era.     There may have been a crushing
and   crumpling   of the nether rocks of the mountain. But it
must also be admitted that there might have been, under tan
gential pressure, a bending of the strata without crushing, espe
cially if there is beneath the earth's rind along the continental
borders a region or layer of “aqueo-igneous fusion,” such as
Professor LeConte recognizes.
   In the course of the geological history of the North-American
continent, there were many oscillations of level in the land.
Portions that were raised above the sea-level in one era, in
another subsided again and sank beneath it; and Professor
LeConte, in the course of his discussion, admits the existence
of an elevated region along the Atlantic border which afterward
disappeared.     Had the elevation in the case of such oscillations
been dependent on plication and crushing beneath, so complete
a disappearance afterward would have been very improbable.
   Such facts as the above appear to prove that elevatory move
ments have often been, like those of subsidence, among the direct
results of lateral pressure.   The facts are so well known and
the demonstration so generally accepted as complete, that I have
suspected that there is here an unintentional omission or over
sight in Professor LeConte’s paper.

geosynclinal monogenetic mountains.
   And the statement of Professor Hall may be made right if we
recognize the same distinction, and also reverse the order and
causal relation of the two events, accumulation and subsidence;
and so make it read:—
   Regions of monogenetic mountains were, previously and pre
paratory to the making of the mountains, areas each of a slowly
progressing geosynclinal, and consequently of thick accumula
tions of sediments.
   The prominence and importance in orography of the moun
tain individualities described above as originating through a
geosynclinal make it desirable that they should have a distinc
tive name; and I therefore propose to call a mountain-range of
this kind a synclinorium, from synclinal and the Greek Špos,
mountain.
    This brings us to another important distinction in orographic
geology, that of a second kind of monogenetic mountain. The
synclinoria were made through a progressing geosynclinal.             Those
of the second   kind,  here referred       were   producedto,     progress

under the designation of a polygenetic mass. Thus the Con
necticut-valley sandstone beds, which must have been but little
raised by the slight upturning they underwent at the epoch of
their disturbance (since there was then neither plication nor
crushing), are now 700 feet higher above the sea-level in Mas
sachusetts than near New Haven, Connecticut; and this is
owing, not to denudation, but to a subsequent elevation in which
much of New England participated—a true geanticlinal uplift.
So it has been the world over. The great uplift of the Rocky
Mountain region of more than 8000 feet, which began after the
Cretaceous, had nothing to do, as I have said, with crushing or
plication, although there was disturbance of the beds in certain
local Cretaceous and Tertiary areas; it appears to have been a
true geanticlinal elevation of the Rocky-Mountain mass, itself
mainly, if not wholly, a combination of synclinoria.
   Geosynclinals and geanticlinals of low angle, like those of the
present day, graduate insensibly into horizontal surfaces.      The
later oscillations in the world’s history have taken in a vastly
wider range of crust than those of early time.     We cannot point
to any geosynclinal in progress that is probably on the way to
become the site of a new synclinorium.       This comes from the
fact already stated, that the completion of a synclinorium has
generally consisted in the solidification as well as plication of
the rocks, and the addition of the whole mountain-region to the
more stable portion of the earth’s crust; and the further fact
that this process has been often repeated in past time, until the
crust has been so stiffened above, as well as below, that only
feeble flexures of vast span are possible, even if the lateral pres
sure from contraction had not also declined in force.

the opposite directions, the oceanic and continental,         beyond                   is

something peculiar along such regions.            Again, the border

larger ranges of uplifts and effects of heat occur on the oceanic
slope of the principal border mountain-chain instead of the con
tinental slope, favouring the view that this lateral thrust was
more effective in the direction from the ocean against the con
tinents than in the opposite.     Finally, there is the fact that the
disturbances or effects of lateral thrust have been very much the
greatest on the border of the largest oceans.
   But has this greater effectiveness of lateral thrust from the
direction of the ocean been due to a proportionally greater con
traction and subsidence of the oceanic crust than the continental f
—the sinking causing the oceanic arch to press against the sides
of the basin.             I
                  formerly made this the chief means of moun
tain-lifting; and now, while not giving it so great prominence,
I believe it to be a true cause.  It is certain that the depressing
of the ocean’s bed, like the raising of the continental areas, has
been in progress through the ages.     The great principal rise of
the continent and continental mountains took place after the
Cretaceous period or during the Tertiary, and some of it even
in the Quaternary; and this is almost positive demonstration
that the bottoms of the oceans were tending downward contem
poraneously. It is not possible in the nature of contraction

The angle of slope of the deep-water sides of the oceanic basin is
generally above five degrees”.
    This conclusion is further sustained by the known univer
 sality of oscillations over the oceanic basin. The central Pacific
 area of coral islands (“registers of subsidence”) stretches from
 the eastern Paumotus to the western Carolines, 90 degrees in
 longitude, and it indicates that the comparatively recent coral
 island subsidence involved a region stretching over more than
 one fourth the circumference of the globe. The fact teaches
 that the movements of the globe, which have been in progress

Thººl.                   considerations  have opportunely been ap
       plied by Carl Neumannt to the proposition that if a
limited portion of a gas enclosed in a tube of unlimited length
 (or one that returns into itself) be different in density from the
rest of the gas, an artificially produced difference of tempera
ture at the two ends of this portion must occasion a continuous
motion throughout the endless cylinder of gas in a determined
direction—and, indeed, from the cooler to the warmer end
through the limited portion in question, if the gas in this be in
the state of condensation.
   By experiment I have answered, in a simple manner, to the
requirements of the theory.        Already in the beginning of this
year (1872) I found that experiment confirmed that theory, in
that without exception the expected direction of the motion
could be recognized.      My experiments, however, did not per
mit the deduction of definite laws—partly because they were in
reality only qualitative, in order to prove the fact generally, and
partly on account, as it appears, of manifold disturbing influ
ences which were not further ascertained.                    I
                                                    therefore thought
I  must defer their  publication    until I should have an opportu
nity of furnishing more exact data. Meanwhile the publication
of the results of an investigation by M. Louis Dufourt has                       in
duced me already, although I have only a few, properly speak
ing, qualitative results, to publish what I have hitherto disco
vered, because my observations are the converse of Dufour's and
in harmony with them.
   My experiments were performed in this manner:—A substance
in the form of powder was stuffed tight into a glass tube so as
to form therein an immovable plug. This tube was fixed in a
horizontal position; and the two ends which projected on each
side of the plug were each connected air-tight, by Imeans of
caoutchouc,    with another horizontal glass tube, which was
stopped by a drop of liquid at any place in                 its
                                                                         in In

observation, the drop once moved 195 millims. away from the

   After the last observation the bent end of the tube on the cold
side was immersed in sulphuric acid. The displacements ceased
as soon as the acid had risen about 6 millims. in the tube, in
which position it remained until, at the end of an hour and a
half, I dismounted the apparatus.         The capillary rising of the
acid in the tube did not amount to one millimetre; so that the
difference of pressure produced by the difference of temperature
on the two sides of the plug corresponded to a column of sul
phuric hydrate of at least 5 millims. height.
    Spongy palladium.–In most of my experiments with this 1
introduced it into an atmosphere of oxygen; but the results ob
tained were the least regular of any.         had contrived a special          I
arrangement of straight and T-tubes to bring oxygen into the
plug-tube as well as into the accessory pieces.         In the experi
ments a movement      always   showed itself in the    expected  direc
tion, but with extraordinary variability. The singular irregu
larities appeared to be provoked chiefly by the variability of the
 absorption by the palladium with oscillations of temperature;
 but probably the aqueous vapour, which always formed when
 the atmospheric air was expelled from the tube by oxygen, was
 a further cause of the irregularities.    Nevertheless the direction
 of the  phenomenon    was  by     this not reversed.         all

  After this, the bent end of the tube on the cold side was im
mersed in sulphuric hydrate.    The sulphuric acid rose quickly
to 53 millims. height, while the drop received a displacement
corresponding to the dimensions of the closed spaces. The po
sition remained unchanged during the first hour; but after the
lapse of the second hour the acid had risen to 62 millims., and after
another 1, hour to about 80 millims., where the bend of the
tube commenced; and so any further diminution of pressure in
the tube could not be observed.       Sustained blowing with the
mouth into the open end on the warm side very soon reduced
 (as was to be expected) the column to zero.
    The numbers observed with magnesia, again, point to an ab
 sorption of the gas by the substance in the form of powder.
   From the preceding experiments with the most heterogeneous
substances it appears to follow that it is a universal property of
porous bodies, when in the form of diaphragms, to draw gases
through them in the direction from the cold to the hot side.
We have thus a phenomenon of diffusion which, contrary to
ordinary diffusion, occurs even when the same gas under the
same pressure is found on both sides of the diaphragm.    This
is a singular, hitherto unknown   phenomenon; and we are there
fore justified in giving it the name of
                                Thermodiffusion.
  Whether this kind of diffusion depends also on the nature of
the gas, so that with mixed gases a selective diffusion might take
place (that       is,
                  mechanical separation        the gases), analogous

artificially produced difference of temperatures, if we apply the
laws discovered by Dufour, is diminished by the process of dif
fusion itself. Accordingly we find between thermodiffusion and
Dufour's discovery a reciprocity analogous to that between heat
and electricity in the ordinary thermo-current and Peltier's phe
nomenon.
     If the    forces set free by thermodiffusion appear mostly to be
trifling, yet it cannot be forthwith maintained that this pheno
menon plays only a quite subordinate part in the economy of
nature; for the conditions of        occurrence may      its

    Besides the connexion between heat and electricity which is
expressed by Dulong and Petit's law, and by Faraday's electro
lytical law, and which we have used in establishing a definition
of the absolute degree of heat, there is another connexion, which
found      its

                                of

however, that this ratio changes with the temperature, and
therefore that the law                              its

66                 Prof. L. Lorenz              on the Determination               of
     If wenow observe that electrical conductivity for the various
pure metals is nearly inversely proportional to the temperature
calculated from absolute zero, while their thermal conductivity
approaches more to constancy, and further that in the case of
iron the deviations for both kinds of conductivity are in the
same direction, then we may say that the preceding facts esta
blish, with as great closeness as can be expected, the law that
the conducting-power of a pure metal for heat and for electricity
is proportional to the temperature calculated from absolute zero.
   This ratio must obviously more or less vary in several cases.
If, for instance, the metal is not homogeneous, or contains ad
mixtures of foreign metals, and, generally speaking, in cases in
which, owing to unequal heating in the interior, thermo-electric
currents may be formed, then the thermal conducting-power will
probably be increased, or at                all
                                   events the relation between the two
kinds   ofconductivity  will     altered.  beThis    doubtless the case  is
when heat can be transmitted as radiant heat            the interior of       in
bodies.    In this kind             of
                             transmission we must seek the reason
why thermal conductivity for                       all
                                         transparent and translucent
media, and generally for                   all
                                  non-metallic bodies,       apparently              is
far greater than that which would correspond              their electrical    to
conductivity.    Lastly,      the body    liquid, the ratio must alter,
                                   of if
                                                         is
owing    tothe mobility       the parts.       for instance,  If,  column                 a
of liquid    heated from
              is             below,  this mobility  will,     course,   in          of
crease the observed conductivity.                  heated from above,
                                                          If  it    is
currents      the interior cannot
              in                          entirely avoided; for every

part   ofthe liquid           in
                          the same horizontal section cannot have
quite the same temperature; the colder parts will then sink,
and the warmer ones rise toward the source                heat; and the       of
conducting-power must therefore            diminished    be  consequence           in
of the motion      the parts.

   We must hold, then, that the law,                        valid,

    The ratio between the thermal and the electrical conductivity
(which is designated by q) is greatest for brass and German silver.
This is not accidental, but probably a consequence of the fact
that they are not pure metals.              In like manner we obtain, in
agreement with what has been said above, a discordant and ob
yiously too low value for mercury; we find for this metal, from
Angström's experiments, q=0.617, taking as the electrical con
ductivity of mercury 1:72.
    The mean value of the quotients q for copper, zinc, and iron
is 0.914 according to Neumann's experiments.                        Whether, in

the British Association Committee, a difference which actually
amounts to 8 per cent., points to errors which cannot be ascribed
to accidental faults of observation, but must rather be ascribed to
animperfect theory. It is here to be observed that the experiments
were made with induction-currents of varying intensity; yet we
may at present undoubtedly state, both from theoretical and ex
perimental investigations, that we know only the elements of
the theory of variable induction-currents, and that the results
can only be regarded as a first approximation. Hence, notwith
standing the great care with which these measurements have
been made, we must not ascribe too great a weight to them.
   The determination of the electrical resistance by means of the
disengagement of heat which a constant current produces in a
conductor is theoretically far simpler and more certain than the
induction method in the manner in which this has hitherto been
applied.   Fortunately we possess a large series of experiments
carefully executed and calculated by Quintus Icilius+.         This
physicist determined the heat which a given intensity of cur
rent disengages in a second in various copper and platinum
wires, the electrical resistance of which was determined by means
of a standard measured by Weber in absolute units. If V de
notes the number of relative units of heat (1 mgrm. water 1° C.)
which are developed in a second in a Siemens's unit of resistance
by the current-intensity S, we obtain by these experiments a
determination of the constant a in the equation
                       W=as”      x 1.0257 x        1010,
if with Quintus Icilius we use Weber’s determination of electrical
resistance; while with the former signification of A as the abso
lute equivalent of work for the relative unit of heat (1 mgrm.
water 19 C.), and of s as the absolute value of Siemens's unit
of resistance, we have
                                  AW =s*S.
From the two equations we have
                       S=a. A     x 1.0257 x        1010.
In   the experiments    in question three several liquids were used
in the  calorimeter,   namely   water, alcohol, and         oil

 that this may completely be the case, the heat developed (which

the corresponding suppositions applied to the motion of heat in
a body; that these suppositions cannot in fact be fulfilled may
in this case be disregarded.
    We consider a body in which the motion of heat is kept per

the conditions which actually obtain for the permanent motion

second series, it will be our object to draw the attention of the
reader to the mental process which he ought to perform while
perusing the familiar essays presented to him: he must gather of
every kind of opinion; indeed he cannot fail to do so; but it is
incumbent on him to store up that which is good and to cast the
bad away.
   These thoughts have been suggested by the controversial spirit
which generally pervades the essays. So important is it to present
the truths which science seeks in a familiar form to the uninitiated,
that, after carefully perusing the volume, we pondered for some
interval of time over the title itself, “Light Science” for “Leisure
Hours,” and were almost inclined to come to the conclusion that it
partook of the nature of a misnomer. Turning to the essays entitled
“The ever-widening World of Stars” and “Movements in the
Star-depths,” we could not find in either the characteristic of
lightness.   With so masterly a hand have they been written that
every step the author takes to establish the point he aims at (that
of the unity of the sidereal universe) is of the most sterling cha
racter.    To regard either of them as light is doing injustice to the
sublime science of which they form a part; and we feel certain
that if our leisure hours are to be occupied by that which is “light”
(we cannot help adding the concluding part of the sentence, “and
trifling”), then Mr. Proctor's Essays are not the pabulum for minds
that seek for light reading in their leisure hours; for there is not
one essay in the volume but requires thought, and deep thought
too, ere the reader can gather up the good and cast the bad away.
Perhaps Mr. Proctor adopted the title from a desire to catch the
nets that they might catch the truths.
    In the author's sketch of the life and works of Mrs. Somerville,
we find him giving expression to his conviction that, as respects the
main purpose of her great work, ‘The Mechanism of the Heavens,’
Mrs. Somerville failed entirely; and as explanatory of so remark
able a conclusion, one, be it remembered, opposed to the opinion of
the late Sir John Herschel, which is quoted by Mr. Proctor, the
author alleges that in his opinion success was altogether impossible,
and also that “the thorough training, the scholarly discipline which
can alone give to the mind the power of advancing beyond the
point up to which it had followed the guidance of others, had un
fortunately been denied to her.”       Otherwise, and under happier
auspices, our author intimates that Mrs. Somerville might have
done original work. Mr. Proctor, we apprehend, has had the
advantage of this thorough training, and has experienced this
scholarly discipline, and therefore is on the road for executing
much original work; but has he ever heard of men or women
being beyond the age in which they lived and worked? Have all
who occupy niches in the great temple of Science had their names
enrolled in the records of universities? or have the pioneers in the
perpetual siege which has been for ages and is still carried on with
the view of acquiring a knowledge of the great forces operating in
the Natural World, always been men who have first distinguished

themselves by their proficiency in their academical studies? Where
are the self-taught men who have even left behind them in the race
others who have had the advantages of which Mr. Proctor speaks?
We cannot agree with the author even in the slightest manner
depreciating the work of so gifted a woman as Mary Somerville;
and it might have been that, had she undergone the discipline of
which he speaks, she might have found herself hampered, even as
when she endeavoured to please Mr. Murray she considered that
 she departed from clearness and simplicity. We fully agree with
 her own estimate, that the truths of science are in themselves not so
 formidable as most persons imagine; and, as regards the popular
 izing of science, so dear to Mr. Proctor, we much question whether
 the course adopted and greatly patronized in the present day is one
 calculated to extend the basis of the pyramid of knowledge.      Is it
 not rather aiming at increasing       height? andits                              do

would deviate in the same direction, and an equal deviation in
visible direction would be associated with every other point in the
visual field.
   Hence we are fairly landed upon the conclusion that visible di
rection, which has already been tracked backwards to the optic nerve,
is a function of its terminal direction, being identical with it at the
centre of the optic disk, both in the equable use of the eye and in
                                                                          -
the unequable.
   Finally, it is clear that if the eyeball be twisted round the axis
of the optic disk the terminal portion of the nerve will be twisted
in the same direction; and thus the opposite twisting of the visible
field in certain experiments related are explicable by the same hy
pothesis—an hypothesis that accounts for             the phenomena              all                               of

    This investigation was undertaken to ascertain if the laws of
derived circuits apply to the currents of induction, which are re
presented by equations of which the above is a type.                   A reflecting
 galvanometer of large resistance was included in the secondary
 circuit, and connected by                wires of very small resistance with
 the coil in which the         secondary    currents were produced: the re
 sistance of these wires was infinitesimal in comparison with the

 resistance of the galvanometer.               The galvanometer was then
 shunted.     The first two columns of the following Table show that,
 with an   inappreciable      resistance outside of the                       coils,
 the shunts made no difference in the deflection of the             galvanometer
needle when the shunts were not less than three ohms. Below this
the current divided.          The resistance of the galvanometer was 5880
ohms; and the last numbers in the second and third columns show
that an equal impulse was transmitted through both the shunt and

one course in preference to the other. Two galvanometers, there
fore, of the same resistance, one forming the shunt to the other,
 will give the same deflection, which is equal to that given by the
 undivided circuit.
    Resistances were then introduced into the circuit exterior to the
galvanometer-coils, and a shunt of 588 ohms was used.
    The fifth column shows that no effect was produced by the
 shunt until the exterior resistance was appreciable in comparison
 with that of the galvanometer.

appreciable in comparison with the galvanometer-resistance.                    The

lated on the assumption that           i="; (where         k" is a coefficient)   is
equivalent     to   i= E.    and that the laws of Kirchhoff hold.              The

Note oN GASEoUs PREssure. By Rob ERT Moon, M.A., hono
      RARY FELLOW of QUEEN’s college, CAMBRIDGE.
   As Mr. Strutt appears indisposed to continue the controversy

 88              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
    Through the kindness of Mr. Rutherford         I have recently come
 into possession of one of them, having a ruled surface of something
more than a square inch, the lines being spaced at intervals of gilso
of an inch. Combining this with the collimator and telescope of a
common chemical spectroscope, we get an instrument furnishing a
spectrum of the first order, in which the D lines are about twice as
 widely separated as by the flint-glass prism of 60° belonging to the
 original instrument.      In the neighbourhood of C the dispersion is
 nearly the same as would be given by four prisms.
     The spectra of the higher orders are generally not so well seen,
 on account of their overlapping each other; but fortunately with
 one particular adjustment of the angle between the collimator and
 telescope, the C line in the spectrum of the third order can be
 made to fall in the vacant space between the spectra of the second
 and fourth orders, and we thus obtain an available dispersion nearly
 the same as that of the instrument     I am accustomed to use.
    On   applying  the new instrument to the equatorial,  I found (under
 atmospheric conditions by no means favourable, though the best
 that have presented themselves as yet) that in the first-order spec
 trum   I could easily see the bright chromosphere-lines C, D, and F;
 I  could also, though with great difficulty, make out Hy, (2796 K).
 On opening the slit the outline of the chromosphere and the forms
 of the prominences were well seen in the spectra of both the first
                                    I
 and third orders, quite as well, think, as with my ordinary instru
 ment in the same state of the air. The spectra are, of course,
 fainter; but as this loss of light affects the background upon which
the prominences are projected as well as the objects themselves, it
 does not materially injure their appearance.
    The grating is much lighter and easier to manage than a train of
prisms; and if similar ruled plates can be furnished by the opticians
at reasonable prices and of satisfactory quality, it would seem that
for observations upon the chromosphere and prominences they
might well supersede prisms.-Silliman's American Journal, June
 1873.

       GENTLEMEN,
    It may be as well to say that the plan of duplex telegraphy by
means of two batteries, working together on the receiving instru
ment, but counteracting one another on the instrument at the send
ing end, was patented by me some months since. It is one of the
many instances in which a plan occurs to two different people
nearly at the same time.

X.      Fluorescent Relations of certain solid Hydrocarbons found
     in Petroleum Distillates.    By HENRY MoRron, Ph.D., Pre
     sident of the Stevens Institute of Technology*.
    a previous paper embodying the results of some observa
IN tions upon the fluorescent relations of commercial anthra
cenet, I have alluded to the existence of an analogous body
among the final products of some petroleum-distillations; and                                   I
now propose to relate more fully the facts developed in a study
of these bodies.
     Nearly      since, Professor E. N. Horsford placed in my
                a year
hands a small  specimen   of petroleum-distillate, from which                                   I
succeeded in separating a crystalline solid, fluorescing in a re
markable manner with a bright green colour.
    The amount of material at my command was too small (being
in fact but a few grains, extracted from less than an ounce of
the substance sent me) to admit of more than a preliminary ex
amination.        Isucceeded, however, in establishing      optical                its

  After encountering some difficulty                  in tracing        up   the supply        to
its   source, I    was introduced            by   Professor

nishing me with every facility that could be wished.
   The preliminary history of the material with which we have
to work is as follows:—
   When the residues left in the distillation of petroleum for the
manufacture of illuminating-oils are redistilled to obtain lubri
cating-oils and paraffine, there passes over near the end of the
operation, and when the still is at the bottom almost or even
quite red-hot, a thick resinous matter of a dark honey- or light
sepia-colour,   which is used as a lubricant for the necks of
“rolls” in iron mills. This is the material from which the new
body is extracted by the following process.
    The tarry matter above described is mixed with about       own                                        its
volume      benzine (petroleum-naphtha), and

          solid Hydrocarbons found in Petroleum Distillates.    91
following arrangement was made.
The porte-lumière A being at
tached to the shutter of a win
dow facing towards the south, a
beam of sunlight was thrown by
it horizontally into the room and
concentrated by a lens of 12-inch
focus placed at B.        At C was
placed an apparatus (fig. 2) con
sisting of a circular horizontal
table adjustable up and down on
a vertical rod and turning with a
“click.” Around the circumfer
 ence of this table were eight little  “stalls” capable of holding
 test-tubes    or specimen-bottles.             Fig. 2.
 By this means eight different
 specimens could be rapidly com
 pared, each in succession, being
 brought by the action of the click
 into an identical position with re
 ference to the exciting light and
 the spectroscope.     This whole ap-              |
 paratus was so placed that an
 image of the sun was formed on
 the tube or bottle nearest to the
 lens B. A glass tank filled with
  a strong solution of ammonio
 cupric sulphate was placed, as   in
 dicated, between B and C ; and to
  this was sometimes added a plate
  of violet glass. The spectroscope
  D employed in these observations
  was generally one of Browning's
  with a single prism of very high
  dispersion, giving a range of
  3° 54 between C and S of the
  solar spectrum; but a spectro
  scope with two similar prisms by
  the same maker        and one by
  Desaga of less dispersive power
  were also

    In this   we find a very strong narrow band having the line      F
 in its centre, then a less-defined double band at 100 and 110 of
 the scale; another, yet less sharply defined, from 120 to 130
 connected by a shade with the point about 140, where the ab
 sorption becomes total. The marked difference between this
and the absorption-spectrum of commercial anthracene consists
 in the double character of the second band, and in the much
lower position of the third band, which ends, above, about where
that of the anthracene begins.
    We will now pass to the method           of observation indicated
already in fig. 4.
    The screen upon which the pure solar spectrum was thrown,
located at E (see fig. 4), was prepared as follows:—A piece of
filter-paper was coated with pure thallene by rubbing it on in
powder with the finger.       It adheres very well to the paper, and
produces in this way a very regular and beautiful surface.
    A strip of this is attached with gum to a piece of white card;
and this slides in horizontal grooves in a frame E (fig. 3), which
is pierced by a large opening.

    The spectrum is so adjusted as to fall on the fluorescent strip,
and also on the adjacent part of the card; and we have the ap

pearance indicated in fig. 7, where S T represents the part of the
spectrum which falls on the thallene-covered paper, and RV that
portion which falls on the card.        The spectrum upon the card
runs, of course, from red to violet, but even below the fixed
line G becomes very dim, and between G and H ceases to show
any decided light.        Where these higher rays fall upon the

          solid Hydrocarbons found in Petroleum Distillates.                                                            95

   The fluorescence excited by rays about and above H does not,

to me to surpass any heretofore known as a screen for the study

     If nowwe observe the absorptive action of these                           solutions in
the manner indicated in fig. 3, we shall find that                            the      absorp
tion-bands, like those of fluorescence, are displaced                          upwards in
the spectra of the solutions as compared with their                            position in
that of the solid.
     This will be illustrated by comparing fig. 9, which represents
the absorption-spectrum of thallene dissolved in benzole, with
fig. 6, which is the absorption-spectrum of solid thallene.
   The absorption-bands of the solutions in benzole, chloroform,
and olive-oil do not appear to differ in any important degree;
but in the etherial solution the bands are higher than in the
others.    In the solution in turpentine the lower band especially
is exceedingly faint, so as to escape recognition entirely in the
method of observation employed in the other cases, even when
a pint bottle of solution was used; but when the tube of a
Duboscq saccharimeter was filled with this solution, this line
could be detected with a direct-vision spectroscope.
   In carbon-bisulphide solution a similar difficulty was encoun
tered, so that in a preliminary publication I spoke of these bands
as not appearing; but renewed observation has enabled me to
assure myself that in this solution                     all
                                             the bands exist, and                                at

and olive-green; b is very bright and of a vivid green; c is bright
sky-blue; and dis of an indigo tintrunning into violet towards H.
   The appearance is indeed exceedingly beautiful, from the rich
ness of the colours and the delicate manner in which they fade
off and blend.
   The brightest bands or trails (b and c) are each penetrated, as
it were, from the further side of the tank by a long blade of
darkness, the result undoubtedly of the absorptive action of the
fluid for the corresponding rays, which causes them to be more
rapidly exhausted; while those at either side, being less energe
tically active and acted upon, penetrate further before their mo
tion is converted into fluorescence.    Near H, where the actions
of  absorption  and fluorescence are most intense, the light hardly
seems to pass beyond the actual surface of the liquid.
   Exact parallels to      all
                            these actions were observed      Stokes   by
in chlorophyl (Phil. Trans. 1852, Part II.    489); but though

necessary result from Stokes's law, that fluorescent                                light never
contained  rays of higher refrangibility than that by which it was
excited; for the exciting light of b was only a little above F,
or 9 to 9:15 of the scale.
   Turpentine dissolves only a small portion of thallene, which,
however, communicates to it a blue fluorescence. When examined

    I should therefore conclude that no true combination had
occurred, and that the change from a yellow to a green colour
resulted from the presence of minute black particles produced
by the action of the sulphuric acid upon some small portion of
an adherent impurity.         This view is confirmed by the fact that
with petrollucene, which is almost colourless, sulphuric acid pro
duces a dark green colour, approaching to black.                Continued
application of heat causes thallene, treated as above, to dissolve,
forming a compound perfectly soluble in water.
   The picric-acid compounds, both of anthracene and thallene,
show no fluorescence; so that this gives us a convenient method
of determining the point of saturation.
   Examined with Becquerel's phosphoroscope, the duration of
fluorescence in solid thallene was found to be about slo of a
second; but that of               its
                             solution was too brief            appreciable      to    be

XI.   On the Form of the Cells of Bees.   By J. W. L. GLAish ER,
           B.A., Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge*.
Th;       following account of the history of the problem of the
       bee-cell is extracted from pp. 428–430 of “Homes with
out Hands,’ by the Rev. J. G. Wood (London, 1869):—
  “If   a single cell be isolated, it will be seen that the sides rise
from the outer edges of the three lozenges above mentioned; so
that there are, of course, six sides, the transverse section of which
gives a perfect hexagon.      Many years ago Maraldi, being struck
with the fact that the lozenge-shaped plates always had the same
angles, took the trouble to measure them, and found that in
each lozenge the large angles measured 109°28', and the smaller
70° 32', the two together making 180°, the equivalent of two
right angles.  He also noted the fact that the apex of the three
sided cup was formed by the union of three of the greater angles.
   “Some time afterwards, Réaumur, thinking that this remark
able uniformity of angle might have some connexion with the
wonderful economy of space which is observable in the bee-comb,
hit upon    very ingenious plan. Without mentioning his rea
              a
sons for the question, he asked Koenig, the mathematician,     to
make the following calculation:—Given       a hexagonal    vessel
terminated by three lozenge-shaped plates, what are the angles
which would give the greatest amount of space with the least
amount of material?     Koenig made his calculations, and found
that the angles were 109° 26' and 70° 34', almost precisely
agreeing with the measurements of Maraldi. The reader is re
quested to remember these angles.    Réaumur, on receiving the
answer, concluded that the bee had very nearly solved the diffi
cult mathematical problem, the difference between the measure
 ment and the calculation being so small as to be practically
negatived in the actual construction of so small an object as the
 bee-cell.
    “Mathematicians were naturally delighted with the result of
 the investigation; for it showed how beautifully practical science
 could be aided by theoretical knowledge; and the construction
 of the bee-cell became a famous problem in the economy of
 nature. In comparison with the honey which the cell is                     in
 tended to contain, the wax is a rare and costly substance, secreted
 in very small quantities, and requiring much time for            pro its
 duction;     it therefore essential that the quantity
                   is                                         wax em

 ployed     making the comb should
             in                                little, and that
                                                   be   as         the of

                                     possible.
    “For long time these statements remained uncontroverted.
             a
                        *    Communicated     by   the Author.

 104       Mr.   J.   W. L. Glaisher     on the Form   of the Cells of     Bees.
Any one with the proper instruments could measure the angles
for himself; and the calculations of a mathematician like Koenig
would hardly be questioned.      However, Maclaurin, the well
known Scotch   mathematician,   was not satisfied. The two results
very nearly tallied with each other, but not quite; and he felt
that in a mathematical question precision was a necessity.     So
he tried the whole  question  himself, and found Maraldi's mea
surements correct, namely 109°28' and 70° 32'.
   “He then set to work at the problem which was worked out
by Koenig, and found that the true theoretical angles were
109°28' and 70°32', precisely corresponding with the actual
measurement           of the bee-cell.
     “Another question now arose.     How did this discrepancy
occur?    How could so excellent a mathematician        as Koenig
make so   grave a mistake? On     investigation it was found that
no blame attached to Koenig, but that the error lay in the book
of logarithms which he used. Thus a mistake in a mathema
tical work was accidentally discovered by measuring the angles
of a bee-cell—a mistake sufficiently great to have caused the loss
of    a ship whose captain happened to use a copy            of the   same    loga
rithmic tables for calculating his longitude.”
    It is proper to add that Mr. Wood prefaces the above narra
tive with the words,          “I
                             must acknowledge my thanks to the
Rev. Walter    Mitchell,  Vicar and Hospitaller of St. Bartholo
mew's Hospital, who has long exercised his well-known mathe
matical powers on this subject, and has kindly supplied me with
the outline of the present history.”
   The last sentence in the first extract, viz. that about the loga
rithms (in which the italics are Mr. Wood's), induced me to ex
amine the original memoirs that relate to the history of the
problem of the form of the bee-cell; and although the story as
given above is on the face of it erroneous, as the determination
of the angles that occur in a bee-cell by measurement to the
nearest minute is clearly impossible, still I was not prepared to
find that the whole story narrowly escapes the verdict tot sen
tentia, quot mendacia”.
   As, however, the manner in which so elaborate and     romantic
a fable has gradually grown  up  out of simple and even common
place facts possesses interest, and as moreover most of the mis
statements have received the sanction of previous writers, I think
  *    It is
           only fair so far to anticipate matters as to remark at once that
Mr. Wood    (or Mr. Mitchell) is not chargeable with the origination of the
false statements that occur in the narrative quoted, for most of which in the
above shape Lord Brougham seems to be chiefly responsible; but the con
cluding paragraph about the logarithms (which will be seen to be totally
without foundation), as far as I know, first makes     its

Maraldi's theoretical values.     Maclaurin read Maraldi's memoir
correctly, and understood the angles                                      by   measurement              to    be   110°

founded; and                   it   therefore follows (1) that Maraldi did not find

The historian of the Academy states that Réaumur also proposed
the question to other mathematicians, from whom, however, he

error to the trifling amount of    and adds that the “grande           2',

Bees deposit their Honey,” appears in the Philosophical Transac

question, he gives a geometrical proof of Koenig's proposition to
disprove the assertion that any “higher geometry than was
known to the Antients” was necessary, and correctly finds the
angles to be 109° 28' 16" and 72° 31' 44".         He proceeds,
“Though Monsieur Maraldi had found by his mensuration these
obtuse angles to be of about 110 degrees, the small difference
between this and the 109°28'16", just found by calculation,
seems to have been either accidental, or owing to the difficulty
of measuring such angles with exactness.         Besides that he
seems to admit the real equality of the several plane angles, that
form as well the apex, as the other solid ones we have been treat

In the space of sixpages and a quarter he has treated the matter

they  differ from one another will agree with Boscovich in his
surprise that Maraldi should have been able to obtain by mea
surement the typical angle correctly to within one ninetieth of
a right angle.    Of course Boscovich does not impute the slight
est insincerity to Maraldi; he merely points out that the know
 ledge      of the solution of the theoretical question may have exer
cised an unconscious                         bias over his mind, so as to make him
announce 110° with more confidence                                          than he might otherwise
have felt.
   Boscovich gives two solutions of Koenig's problems, the one
by pure geometry, the other by differential calculus. The latter
is obtained in exactly the way any one to whom the question was
proposed would probably now proceed (at        events     nearly                    all                   it

clined to one another at this angle, and so is each trapezium to
the planes it cuts. This leads to the belief that the bees have
some means (instrumenta) of constructing planes inclined to one
another at this angle.      Ellis (who had not seen what Boscovich
had written)    practically  remarked the same thing, and made a
guess at what the instrumenta were a century later (“Writings,”
p. 356).     It thus appears that Boscovich discussed the whole
subject with completeness, penetration, and (but for the one trivial
slip) accuracy.      Had his remarks been published in a work
better known and more accessible to naturalists, a detailed refu
tation of Réaumur and Koenig a hundred and thirteen years
later would have been rendered superfluous.
    The next memoir” that I know of in which the form of the
bee-cell is considered is by Lhuillier, and occupies pp. 277–300
of the Berlin Memoirs for 1781 (published 1783). The                                                 in
troduction (of two pages) and conclusion were written by Cas
tillon, who presented the memoir to the Academy.                 Lhuillier
gives a short account of the history of the subject without ad
verting particularly to Réaumur's misreading of Maraldi.               He
argues with Boscovich “que l’égalité supposée des angles des
rhombes du fond et de ceux des trapezes des faces d’un alvéole,
est le principe qui a guidé M. Maraldi dans l'estimation de ces
angles;” and adds a new fact, viz. that Cramer, his fellow
citizen (of Geneva) had given some developments on the subject
to Koenig which had not been published. After stating that
one of Boscovich's methods is very similar to Maclaurin’s, he
begins the next paragraph: “Tous les mathématiciens ont re
gardé cette matière comme passant les forces de la Géométrie
élémentaire,” which is untrue, as the solutions in question are
geometrical: the error is a curious one for Lhuillier to have
made, as he had certainly read Boscovich's remarks, and in                                               all
probability seen Maclaurin's paper.          He very properly regards

that the ratio of the radius of the inscribed circle of the hexagon

real cell is as 1} to 5, we have for this depth (viz. the longest side

the bee-cell; and when the base is square the roof is formed of
four rhombs, which happen to be of the same form as in the bee
cell (viz. ratio of diagonals = x/2), with the only difference that
when the base is square they are placed with the shorter dia
gonals horizontal, and when the base is hexagonal the longer.
He thence concludes that with twelve such rhombs a regular
figure of twelve sides could be made exhibiting both the roofs of
the 4- and 6-angled buildings, and therefore also of the bee-cell;
after which he adds that this last fact was noted by Kepler in
 his Harmonice,                      Réaumur proposed to Koenig
                           so that the question
was not so new as he      thought (nicht mehr so ganz neu, als es
Reaumur geglaubt zu haben scheint).       Lhuillier says Lambert’s
assertion about the bee-cell is contrary to the contents of his
(Lhuillier's) paper (meaning that certain other forms would be
preferable for the house); and he is right. In fact Lambert has
not at      all
             considered the general problem, what would         the                                          be

1858 shows any discrepancy it will be pointed out either in the
text or a note.   As a résumé of moderate length was given in the
Comptes Rendus for 1858, it seemed not unlikely that some one
might have anticipated the ensuing remarks; but an examina
tion of the Comptes Rendus from 1858 to 1871 showed that only
one communication had in this time been made to the Academy
on the subject, viz. by the late Mr. Willich (vol.     633, 1860),                             li.   p.

 t.  Lord Brougham does not mention the fact                                            of   Koenig having errone
ously calculated the saving.

tables, has been developed into it by persons not very careful
about the truth.   The story given by Lord Brougham was suf
ficiently romantic; but the person who added the climax, and
gave it point by the sensational allusion to the ship, certainly
deserves to have his services remembered.
   Maclaurin suggested that Koenig did not carry his approxi
                                                   I
mations far enough; but imagine that he either felt a delicacy
about saying in so many words that Koenig had made a blunder,
or that he had in his mind (like Boscovich) the probability of
his having obtained a complicated equation and solved it by ap
proximation.    But Lord Brougham could not have felt this
delicacy a century later; and he certainly did not attach Bos
covich's meaning to the word approacimations.
   Lord Brougham objects most strongly to the results obtained
by Lhuillier; and his arguments are of so remarkable a charac
ter that           I
            hope I shall be excused for quoting his exact words,

                          have tried it by weighing equal parts in

base in different combs.     But any considerable difference be

did say will see at a glance how much is and how much is not
correct.       I
             pass over also one or two minor slips.    Of course
Lhuillier deserves Lord Brougham's censure for having failed to
 notice that Maclaurin's and Boscovich's proofs were geometrical.
     I have not hesitated to state plainly the value of Lord
Brougham's arguments in my opinion, as the frankness with
which he has expressed his sentiments with regard to the
 writings of those with whom he did not agree renders any par
ticular display of courtesy towards his own views unnecessary.
Even Leslie Ellis writes, “Either the habit of an advocate’s
mind—for Lord Brougham may be regarded as counsel for the
bees—or his not having read Maraldi’s paper must have been
the cause of this omission” [viz. of Maraldi’s statement that the
angles measured were 110° and 70°: this is partly supplied, as
 has been noticed, in the French memoir]; and I must say
that the quiet dignity of the mathematical writings on the sub
ject contrasts most favourably with his violent advocacy.    The
impression any one would receive from reading Lord Brougham's
remarks on Lhuillier and Castillon would be that they had treated
the matter ignorantly and unfairly; whereas their memoir seems to
me (and        I
            believe it would to any one else) an impartial (though
not very brilliant) attempt to add to our knowledge and advance
truth.    As the result of a tolerably careful examination of the
whole question, I may be permitted to say that             agree with               I
Lhuillier in believing that the economy of wax has played a very
subordinate part in the determination of the form of the cell;
in fact I should not be surprised if it were acknowledged here
after that the form of the cell had been determined by other
considerations, into which the saving of wax did not enter (that
is to say, did not enter sensibly; of course I do not mean that
the amount of wax required was a matter of absolute indifference
to the bees).    The fact of                   all

it    not unlikely, the cause that determined the form

view the problem is simple, not to say trivial, and possesses but
slight interest to a mathematician; and to the naturalist it is
too mathematical to be pleasing.      A mathematician cannot
sometimes help feeling some regret that the great discoveries
and advances in his science can be only known to the very few
who have learnt to read the language that can alone express
them; but from the contents of this communication more than
one argument might be drawn to show that it is any thing but
an unmixed gain to a science to admit of popularization.

To obtain

mountain-elevation has taken place after immensely long periods
of quiet and gentle oscillations. After the beginning of the
Primordial, the first period of disturbance in North America of
special note was that at the close of the Lower Silurian, in
which the Green Mountains were finished; and if time from the
beginning of the Silurian to the present included only fifty
millions of years—which most geologists of the present day
would consider much too small an estimate—the interval be
tween the beginning of the Primordial and the uplifts and
metamorphism     of the Green Mountains was at least ten mil
lions of years. The next epoch of great disturbance in the same
 Appalachian region was that at the close of the Carboniferous
 era, in which the Alleghanies were folded up—by the above
 estimate of the length of time, thirty-five millions of years +
 after the commencement of the Silurian; so that the Appala
 chians were at least thirty-five millions of years in making, the
 preparatory subsidence having begun as early as the beginning
 of the Silurian. The next on the Atlantic border was that of
the displacements of the Connecticut-river sandstone, and the
accompanying     igneous ejections, which occurred before the
Cretaceous era—at least seven millions of years, on the above
estimate of the length of time, after the Appalachian revolution.
Thus the lateral pressure resulting from the earth’s contraction
required an exceedingly long era in order to accumulate force

also the local disturbances in the Primordial   of Newfoundland,
as well as the facts relating to minor changes of level.
           a. Mountain-making on the    Atlantic border.
   1. At the close of the Lower Silurian, or a little earlier, a
culmination of the great Appalachian geosynclinal resulted in
displacements, plications, and metamorphism, and the making
of a synclinorium along the Green-Mountain region, these
mountains (some summits at present over 4000 feet high
above the sea) being the result. The depth to which the region
subsided during the Lower Silurian era, and the thickness of
the accumulations, are not ascertained ; probably the extent was
not less than 20,000 feet.
   2. Simultaneously a permanent anticlinorium was made over
the Cincinnati region, from Lake Erie into Tennessee, parallel
to the Alleghanies of Virginia, 250 miles to the north-west.
   3. The Acadian region (embracing western Newfoundland,
St.-Lawrence Bay, the Bay of Fundy, and part of Nova Scotia
and New Brunswick adjoining, and probably the sea south-west
between St. George's Bank and the coast of Maine, with also an
area in Rhode Island) was the course of a great geosynclinal,
or a series of them, parallel in general direction to that of
the Appalachian region; it continued in progress, but with
mountain-making interruptions and some shift of position to
the eastward, from the Silurian to the close of the Jurassic.
   At the close of the Lower Silurian no general disturbances
occurred in this Acadian region, so far as is known.       In the
Anticosti seas, or northern part of St. Lawrence Bay, limestones,
 as Logan states, were uninterruptedly in formation from the
beginning of the Hudson period of the Lower Silurian to the
middle of the Upper Silurian, showing that the Acadian geo
synclinal was then in regular progress.     It so continued until
the close of the Devonian, when disturbances, plication, and
metamorphism took place in eastern Canada, Nova Scotia, and
the bordering region of New Brunswick, and the most exten
sive of Acadian Palaeozoic synclinoria resulted, according to
the observations of Dr. Dawson and others.
   4. The close of the Carboniferous age was an epoch of moun
tain-making in the Alleghany region—the Alleghanies from
New York to Alabama having been then made, as already
explained.
   5. At the same time there were disturbances and synclinorian
plications in the Acadian region. During the Carboniferous
era, according to Logan and Dawson, 16,000 feet of rock had
in some parts accumulated; and therefore a geosynclinal of
16,000 feet formed—the rocks in their many coal-beds and root

volving an intermittent but progressing subsidence. The syn
clinorium, the resultant, was much less marked than that at the
close of the Devonian.
   6. During the Palaeozoic, along the sea-border, a more or less
perfect barrier was made by ageanticlinal uplift (anticlinorium),

  The other geosynclinal belt of the Cretaceous era was to the
west of the Sierra Nevada, as described by Whitney.  This coast
geosynclinal ended in extensive displacements and plications,
much metamorphism, and a high synclinorium.
   6. The intermediate region, the Great Basin, which had been
widened at the close of the Jurassic by the annexation of the
plicated and consolidated Sierra and Wahsatch, was the era of a
geanticlinal, or at least of absence of subsidence; for King says
no Cretaceous rocks occur over it.
     7.   With the close of the Cretaceous, or when the Cretaceous
synclinorian movements of the sea-coast and mountains were
ending, a geanticlinal movement of the whole Rocky-Moun
tain region began, which put it above the sea-level, where it
has since remained.     This upward movement continued through
the Tertiary.
   8. During the Tertiary age, until the close, probably of the
Miocene Tertiary, another pair of parallel geosynclinals, but
geosynclinals   of Tertiary formation, were in progress.    The
Cretaceous synclinoria had given still greater breadth and sta
bility to the relatively stable region between them; and one of
these new troughs is hence further east on the mountain side,
and the other further west on the coast side.
   In the coast geosynclinal, marine tertiary beds were accumu
lated to a thickness of 4000 to 5000 feet; and then followed the
epoch of disturbance ending in another coast synclinorium, a
coast range of mountains, in some places metamorphic,       and
having ridges, many of which are at present 2000 feet or more
in height above the sea, and some in the Santa-Cruz range,
according to Whitney, over 3500 feet.
basin, and that over this basin between the Green River and the Wahsatch
no single instance of conformity occurs between the coal-beds and the over
lying horizontal freshwater strata. As stated above, he makes the epoch
of Cretaceous uplifting to have followed, not the Cretaceous period, but
the earliest period of the Tertiary, Eocene beds being, in his view, included
with the Cretaceous in the folds referred to. .

disturbances were local and slight.
   There were hence two parallel series, contemporaneous in
steps of progress, situated on opposite borders of the Great
Basin, a coast series and a mountain series, each having                                                           its
highest member toward the basin—the coast series the grandest
in    its
      three parts and leaving evidences  the profoundest dis                  of
turbance and the greatest amount        metamorphism.    The              of

   We gather from these facts how it is that a general submer
gence, or an emergence, might characterize cotemporaneously
large areas of North America and Europe—as, for example, in
the Subcarboniferous, Carboniferous, and Permian periods, du
ring which the rocks show that there was a general parallelism
in the movements.     If a geanticlinal were in progress over the
middle of the Atlantic crust as a result of the lateral thrust in
the continental and oceanic crusts there might also be a reverse
movement or general sinking along the continental borders, as
well as a rise of water about the continents from the diminution                                            i
in the ocean's depth; and when the oceanic geanticlinal flat
tened out again through subsidence, the subsiding crust would
maturally produce a reverse movement along one or both con
tinental borders.
   From the various considerations here presented, derived from
both the continental and oceanic areas, it is apparent that the
earth has exhibited     oneness itsindividuality  ofnothing more              in
fundamentally and completely than       the heavings     in   con                   of   its
tracting crust.

riation of k ; but he plots it with reference to R as abscissa
instead of R x, and thus fails to determine the law.  His method
of experiment is much more complicated than mine, so that he
could only obtain results for one ring; while by my method
I  have experimented on about a dozen rings and on numerous
bars, so that I believe I have been enabled to find the true form
of the function according to which p varies with the magnetism
of the bar or the magnetizing-force.
    Many experiments have been made on the magnetism of iron
without giving the results in absolute measure.        Among these
are the experiments of Müller, Joule, Lenz and Jacobi, Dub, and
others. The experiments have been made by the attraction of
electromagnets, by the deflection of a compass-needle, or, in
one case, by measuring the induced current in a helix extend
ing the whole length of the bar. By the last two methods the
change in the distribution of magnetism over the bar when the
magnetism of the bar varies is disregarded, if indeed it was
thought of at all: even in a recent memoir of M. Cazin+ we
have the statement made that the position of the poles is inde
pendent of the strength of the current. He does not give the
experiment from which he deduces this result.        Now it is very
easy to show, from the formula of Green for the distribution of
magnetism on a bar-magnet combined with the known variation
of k, that this can only be true for short and thick bars; and it
has also been remarked by Thomson that this should be the
caset.     An experiment made in 1870 places this beyond doubt.
A small iron wire (No. 16), 8 inches long, was wound with two
layers of fine insulated wire; a small hard steel magnet 3 inch
long suspended by a fibre of silk was rendered entirely astatic
by a large magnet placed about 2 feet distant; the wire electro
magnet was then placed near                     it,
                                       that the needle hung

                        2                           On now exciting
the magnet with       weak current, the needle took
                        a                                     certain        up
                                                                          of a
definite position, indicating the direction      the line   of
                                                            force                      at
that point. When the current was very much increased, the
needle instantly moved into       position more nearly parallel
                                                a                                      to
the magnet, thus showing that the magnetism was now distri
buted more nearly        the ends than before.
                                at                 This shows that
nearly  all the experiments hitherto made      bar-magnets contain
                                                           on
 an error; but, owing          small amount, we can accept the re
                                     to   its
sults as  approximately true.

144                Mr. H. A. Rowland on Magnetic Permeability,
apply only to endless solenoids, and to those which are very long
compared with their diameter.       The unit of number of lines of
force I have taken as the number in one square metre of a unit
field measured perpendicular to their direction. As my data
for reducing my results to these units, I have taken the hori
zontal force of the earth's magnetism at Troy as l'641, and the
total force as 6'27.
   The total force, which will most seriously affect my results,
is well known to be nearly constant at any one place for long
                       **
periods of time.
    From the analogy of a magnet to a voltaic battery immersed
in water I have obtained the following, on the assumption that
p is constant, and that the resistance to the lines of force passing
out into the medium is the same at every point of the bar.
   Let R =              to lines of force of one metre of length of
                          at".

                          ar.

a small horseshoe magnet, on one branch of which was a coil
of wire; and by sliding this back and forth, induced currents
could be sent through the wire, which, when properly timed,
soon brought the needle to rest.      This arrangement was very
efficient; and without it this form of galvanometer could hardly
have been used.      To compare the magnetism of the ring with
the known magnetism of the earth, and thus reduce it to ab
solute measure, a ring G supported upon a horizontal surface
was included in the circuit; when this was suddenly turned
over, it produced an induced current, due to twice cutting the
lines of magnetic force which pass through the ring from the
earth's magnetism.      The induced current in the case of either
coil, For G, is proportional to the number of the lines of force
cut by the coils” and to the number of wires in the coil, which
latter is self evident, but may be deduced from the law of Gau
gaint. It is evident, then, that if c is the deflection from coil
G, and h that from helix F, the number of lines of force passing
through the magnet E, expressed in the unit we have chosen,
will be
                        Q=2'(627              in   74°50)-Rºž,                .    .       .   ()
where n! is the number of coils in the ring G, n the number in
the helix F, R the radius of G, 6-27 the total magnetism of the
earth, and 74°50' the dip. The quantity 2n! (6-27 sin 74°50')TR*
is constant for the coil, and had the value 14:51. This is the
number of square metres of a unit field which, when cut once
by a wire from the galvanometer, would produce the same de
flection as the coil when turned over.
    The experiments being made by reversing the magnetism of
 the bars, a rough experiment was made to see whether they had
 time to change in half a single vibration of the needle; it was
 found that this varied from sensibly 0 to nearly 1 second, so that
 there was ample time.       was also proved that the sudden im

with the addition of the residual or permanent magnetism, which
shows the general features of these curves as drawn from any of
the Tables. It is observed that the total magnetism of the iron
at first increases very fast as the magnetizing-force increases,
but afterwards more and more slowly until near the maximum
of magnetism, where the curve is parallel to the axis of Q. The
concavity of the curve at                        its

proximations. We might indeed solve with reference to Q; but
in this case some values of X as obtained from experiment may
be accidentally greater than A, and so give an imaginary value
to Q.
   By plotting any Table in this way and measuring the distance
O  C,  we have the maximum of magnetism.
      I
      have given in the same Plate the curve drawn from the ob
servations on the nickel ring with Q on the same scale, but X.
on a scale four times as large as the other. The curve of nickel
satisfies the equation

quite well, but not so exactly as in the case of iron. This ring,
when closely examined, was found to be slightly porous, which
must have changed the curve slightly, and perhaps made it
depart from the equation.

   In Table VIII. have collected some of the values of the
constants in the formula when it is applied to the different rings
and bars, and have also given some columns showing the maxi
mum of magnetism.       When any blank occurs, it is caused by
the fact that for some reason or other the observations were not
 sufficient to determine                      it.    The values          of   a,   H,   D, and the value

square inch, and for nickel 63,000 times, or 22:9 lbs. on the
square inch.   For pure iron, however,    think it may reach          I
 180,000, or go even above that. It is seen that one of the
 Norway rings gave a very high result; this is explained by the
following considerations.    All the iron rings were welded except
this one, which was forged solid from a bar 2 inches wide and
then turned. Even the purest bar iron is somewhat fibrous; and
between the fibres we often find streaks of scale lying length
wise in the bar and so diminishing the section somewhat if
the ring be welded from the bar; when, however, it is forged
solid, these streaks are thoroughly disintegrated; and hence we
find a higher maximum of magnetism for a ring of this kind,
and one approaching to that of pure iron.       But a ring made in
this way  has to be  exposed  to so much     heating and pounding
that the iron is rendered  unhomogeneous,      and a tail appears to
the curve like that in Table III.       It is evident that this tail
must always show itself whenever the section of the ring is not
homogeneous throughout.
   Hence we may conclude that the greatest weight which can be
sustained by an electromagnet with an infinite current       for                         is,
good but not pure iron, 354 lbs. per square inch   section, and                of
for nickel 46 lbs.
   Joule+ has made many experiments     the maximum sustain      on
ing-power     magnets, and has collected the following Table,

   On Objections to the received principles of Hydrodynamics.    159
 system    of electrical measurement by which, from the simple de
 flection of a galvanometer-needle, we are able to predict how much
an electromagnet will sustain without actually trying the expe
 riment.
     In looking over the columns of Table VIII. which contain the
 values of the constants in the formula, we see how futile it is to
 attempt to give any fixed value to the permeability of iron or
 nickel; and we also see of how little value experiments on any one
kind of iron are. Iron differs as much in magnetic permeability
as copper does in electric conductivity.
     It is seen that in the three cases when iron bars have been
 used, the value of a is negative; we might consider this to be
 a general law, if I did not possess a ring which also gives
this negative.         All these bars had a length of at least 120
times their diameter.
    The mathematical theory of magnetism has always been con
 sidered one of the most difficult of subjects, even when, as
heretofore, u is considered to be a constant; but now, when
it must be taken as a function of the magnetism, the diffi
culty is increased many fold. There are certain cases, how
ever, where the magnetism of the body is uniform, which will
not be affected.

XV.     On Objections recently made to the received principles of
    Hydrodynamics.          By Professor CHALLIs, M.A., LL.D.,
    F.R.S., F.R.A.S.*
A       LARGE proportion of my scientific labours having been
          devoted to researches respecting the principles and appli
cations of Hydrodynamics,        I have naturally taken much interest
in the discussion carried on in this Magazine between Mr. Moon
and the Hon.       J. W. Strutt (Lord Rayleigh) relative to points
affecting the very foundations of that department of science.
After considering the arguments on both sides, it appears to me
that the questions raised demand additional elucidation, to sup
 ply which is the purpose of this communication.
     Mr. Moon's equation (1) in page 117 of vol. xxxvi. of the
Philosophical Magazine, viz.
includes the principle of constancy of mass, as is shown in the
 Note in p. 101 of vol. xlv., and for motion in one dimension is
perfectly general.        Respecting that equation Mr. Moon remarks
                       * Communicated  by the Author.

that       “it
          holds without reference to any hypothesis as to the law
of pressure.”      I should rather say that it involves no specifica
tion of a  particular   fluid, and is therefore applicable to        per                                              all

 the  density   and the     velocity.   Now   evidently  this general theorem
 includes the more          particular   case      which the pressure      in                                               is

it  wholly depends             the fluid being

    We may now suppose, in order to make the problem more

 with a given velocity V, and that the two masses subsequently
 move on together.     Hence their initial common velocity is

of account as being indefinitely small. The same is the case
with respect to the impact of one solid body on another, if im

mentum of the impinging body is altered by degrees, beginning
with zero, by the reaction of the other, and it is after an interval,
however short, that the permanent alteration of           momentum                            its

164              Prof. Challis on Objections recently                       made to
remarks on the parts respectively performed by reasoning and
by eageriment or observation, in establishing the truth of the re
sults obtained in applied mathematics, not having seen in modern
scientific productions sufficiently precise information as to the
relation between these two parts.
   (1) The experimental results obtained by Galileo and Atwood
respecting the vertical descent of bodies acted upon by gravity,
and the experimental proof that the vertical acceleration of a
projectile is independent of the motion in a curvilinear path, and
and that its horizontal motion is uniform, establish the laws
which govern constant accelerating forces.     It was absolutely
necessary to ascertain these laws by experiment before any abs
tract reasoning respecting accelerating force was possible. But
the laws relating to constant accelerating forces having thus
become known, it can be proved by means of Taylor's theorem,
or some equivalent process, that an accelerating force, whether
variable or constant, estimated in a given direction, is quantita
tively expressed by the second differential coefficient of the func
tion which gives the distance at any time of the accelerated par
ticle from a fixed plane perpendicular to that direction. Taylor's
theorem is legitimately employed for this purpose on the general
principle that abstract calculation is comprehensive of          concrete              all
physical relations. This,       fact,     in

being verified directly by eageriment; but generally the verifi

                XVI. On the Nodal Lines of a Square Plate.

IN short
    a recent Number of                  Annalent there is a
         paper by Strehlke, complaining of the inaccuracy with
which the nodal lines of vibrating square plates are depicted in
certain elementary works, and drawing attention to the results
of his own careful measurements.          His remarks relate princi
pally to that mode of vibration which has for nodal line a closed
curve not greatly differing from a circle, but which has been erro
neously regarded by some as a slightly modified form of the
inscribed square.
   On the experimental determination of nodal lines there is no
greater authority than Strehlke; and if there were no light from
theory, his results might be considered to exhaust the question.
Strehlke, indeed, quotes Professor Kirchhoff as expressing the
opinion that there is at present no prospect at              theoretical                   all   of
solution      the problem—an opinion which may

of vibration at the ends is decidedly (more than in the ratio of
3:2) greater than at the centre, from which it follows that the
nodal line does not pass through the centres of the sides, and
the nodes of a vibrating bar deviate sensibly from the positions
assigned to them.    It will be observed that the four points in
which the required locus intersects the diagonals of the square
are determined by a knowledge of the nodes of the component
vibrations; for a point which lies on both these systems neces

170      Lord Rayleigh on the Nodal Lines of a Square Plate.
(on the scale adopted).      The first curve proceeding outwards is
the locus of   points at which z= 1. The next is the nodal line,
separating the regions of opposite displacement.       The remaining
curves taken in order give the displacements           – -2, -3.
                                                         1,
The    numerically  greatest  negative   displacement  does not occur
until the corners of the square, where it amounts to 2 x 1:6448
=3°2896.
    The same calculations and constructions give the theoretical
solution for another and even better-known mode of vibration of
a square plate.     We have hitherto supposed that the two com
ponent vibrations were in the same phase.         If we take them in
opposite phases, the curves of equal displacement become
                           2.-2,- const.,       . .   . . . .      (5)
which are to be found     by  crossing  the same network of  straight
lines along the other diagonals.       In this mode of vibration the
nodal lines are the diagonals of the square; and the hyperbolic
curves in the figure (when completed on the opposite side) are
the loci of points where the displacement amounts respectively
to 1 and 2. The curves similarly situated in the other two por
tions cut off from the square by the diagonals would correspond
to displacements —l and –2. The maxima of vibration occur
at the middle points of the sides of the square, and amount nu
merically to 1+1-6448=2.6448.
    Other modes of vibration of a square plate may be obtained
by starting from the higher fundamental modes of a bar with
three or more nodes.      Some of these I hope to examine in my
work on Acoustics, now in preparation.
    Strehlke expresses the form of the nodal line as given by his
observations by means of polar equations, the origin being taken
at the centre of the square.       This was a natural course to take
in view of the approximate circular form, but does not commend
 itself to the theorist. The equations representing the results
obtained with three different plates are
             r= 40143+.0171 cos 4t +        00127 cos 8t,
             r='40143+.0172 cos 4t + 00127 cos 8t,
             r="4019 + 0.168 cos 4t-H 0013         cos 8t.
 From these we obtain for the radius vector parallel to the sides
 of the square '41980, 41981, 4200, while the theoretical result
 is 4154.     The radius vector measured along a diagonal is .3856,
 '3855, 3864, but from theory 3900.
    The agreement between theory and observation is not so good
 as might have been expected from the case of a circular plate,
 for which the theoretical results were calculated by Poisson and

                         Notices respecting New Books.                                             171
Kirchhoff, and tested experimentally by Strehlke; and the latter
may therefore be disposed to reject the theory in toto.    But it is
necessary here to distinguish two distinct questions: it is one
thing to deduce the logical consequences of premises generally
admitted, and another to inquire how far those premises are
really applicable to the case in hand. With respect to the first
                         I
point there can, apprehend, be no doubt that the theory deve
loped in the present paper stands on as high a level as that of
Kirchhoff relating to a circular plate. It satisfies the same dif
ferential equation over the area, and the same boundary-condi
tions, and is indeed in one respect+ even less open to doubt.
But it may be that the fundamental equations are for some
reason less applicable to a square than a circular plate, though                                      I
do not see why this should be the case. On the other hand it is
possible that, in spite of              all
                                 Dr. Strehlke's care, some error may

The transit-instrument         mural circle were under the charge of
Professor Yarnall; and Professor Eastman had charge of the Me
teorological Observations.
   The attention of Professor Newcomb has been given chiefly to the
theory of the moon, for the purpose of revising both the theory and
the tables, in the course of which a new and more exact method of
computing the effect of the attraction of the planets has been
worked out. The results of the Professor's work indicate that the
positions of the moon at the total eclipse of 1715 and at the epochs
of two occultations of Aldebaran observed at Greenwich and London
in 1680, are better represented by the old tables of Burckhardt than
by those of Hansen.
   The introductory part of the volume contains very full descrip
tions of each instrument, its various adjustments, method of ob
serving adopted, determination of corrections, &c. These notices
embody various important practical details which it is next to im
possible to find in any popular treatise, but which are essential for
the training of an efficient amateur astronomer. We need not en
large on the high value of the observations recorded.
   The volume contains four appendices. Appendix I. embodies
the operations for determining the difference of longitude between
Washington and St. Louis. The work was effected by the aid of
the Western Union Telegraph Company in exchanging signals—
the observations and        uctions at St. Louis being made by the
officers of the United-States Coast Survey, and those at Washing
ton by the officers of the Observatory.
   Appendix II., “Reports on Observations of Encke's Comet during
its return in 1871,” has already been noticed in our pages.
   Appendix III., “On the Right Ascensions of the Equatoreal
Fundamental Stars,” by Professor Newcomb, contains much valuable
information. The object the Professor had in view was to reduce
the right ascensions of different catalogues to a mean homogeneous
system.    We may possibly return to this Appendix on some future
OCC:18.1011.
   Appendix         IV.
                  contains the zones of stars observed at the Naval
Observatory   with the meridian transit-instrument in the years
1846 to 1849—a portion of the great work originally contemplated,
but discontinued on account of the difficulty experienced by the
computing staff in endeavouring to keep pace with the observing,
a difficulty which threatens the extinction of our own system of
meteorological observations.
  We cannot close this notice without directing attention to the
progress of Astronomy in America. Our own National Observatory,
under the able management of the Astronomer Royal, continues to
maintain its position as the most important astronomical establish

THE
      1." Further Notes on the Punfield Section.” By C.J. A. Meyer,
Esq., F.G.S.
   This paper was supplementary to one read before the Society by
the author in March of the present year (see Quart. Journ. Geol.
Soc. xxviii. p. 245), and contained the results of a fresh examination
of the section at Punfield, and of the Wealden and Neocomian strata
of the Isle of Wight. He described the section exposed at his visit
to Punfield as presenting:—1. True Wealden beds; 2, a grit-bed
with limestone and paper-shales, containing fish-bones and Cyprides;
3. apparently argillaceous beds; 4. a thin band of hard ferruginous
sandstone with Atherfield fossils; 5. a clay-bed, the upper part re
garded as representing the “lobster-clay” of Atherfield, the lower
sandy portion containing an abundance of marine fossils belonging
to common Atherfield species; 6. the so-called “marine band;” and
7. laminated clays and sands with lignite.      The author indicated
the accordance of this arrangement with what is observed elsewhere,
and maintained that the grit-bed (No.2), with      limestone and paper
                                                                 its
 shales, containing Cypris and Cyrena, was really           regarded    to       be               as
the passage-bed between the Wealden and the Neocomian.
    2.   “On the Coprolites        of   the Upper Greensand Formation, and                        on
Flints.” By W. Johnson Sollas, Esq.
   The first part this paper was principally occupied
                      of                                                          in   an   endea

bodied animals.       It was shown that the hypothesis which considered
that sponges had become silicified            by   an

silica was altogether untenable. Mr. Hawkins Johnson's supposititious

facts    ofchemistry.     The author's explanation was not intended                               to
     final. The first fact pointed out was the very remarkable way
in be
    which the silica       calcic phosphate

   The Blackdown silicified shells were next explained; and it was
reasoned that the state of their silica offered arguments tending to
prove a passage of silica from the colloidal to the crystalline state.
   The second part of the paper discussed the Coprolites specially.
Their exterior appearance is extremely sponge-like, almost exactly
resembling some species of modern sponges.        They are marked by
oscules of peculiar characters.
   The so-called “pores” of palaeontologists are well marked. Spi
cules,    triradiate,     sexradiate,      sinuous,       defensive and connecting,
have been observed.     They are siliceous in composition. On dis
solving the coprolites in acid, the spicules are set free, associated
with Polycystina (Haliomma heavacantha &c.) and Xanthidia (X. fur
catum). The genera and species of coprolites described were as
follows:–Rhabdospongia communis, Bonneyia bacilliformis, B. cy
lindricus, B. Jessoni, B. scrobiculatus, B. verrongiformis, Acantho
phora Hartogii, Polyacantha Etheridgii, Retia simpler, R. costata,
 Ulospongia patera, U. calya, U. Brunii. The external appearance of
these forms, which constitute a vast number of the coprolites, their
curious oscules and siliceous spicules, were said to leave no doubt
as to their spongious origin.

A NEW METHOD FOR EXAMINING THE DIVISIONS OF GRADUATED
                           CIRCLES.        BY G. QUINCKE.
      task of examining a graduated circle by which the position
THE
  of two telescopes, with microscopes for reading off, was to be de
termined accurately to a few seconds, has led me to a method of
examination combining convenience and accuracy; and, as far as                    I
am aware, it has not yet been described.
   The telescopes are provided with a Gauss's ocular (Astron. Nachr.
579. 31.10, 1846), in which the cross-threads can be illuminated by
a plane glass placed between them and the lense of the ocular and
inclined at an angle of 45° to the axis of the telescope.
   The axis of the telescope is placed normal to a plane-parallel
glass plate, if the cross-wires coincide with the reflected image pro
jected by the rays reflected from the plate.
   The glass plate can be set up normal to the graduated circle by
being fixed with wax upon a little turntable in          centre.   its

perpendicular      each other,
                     to            the cross-wires and their reflected
                                          if
image coincide also after the telescope has been turned through
 180°. With different positions        the plane glass firmly united

the circle, we thus obtain also the excentricity        the axis  of rota   of

         of                     light make use         Steinheil's plane

table, perpendicular        to

perpendicular      to each other, if the angular mirror which they con
stitute makes the two images (produced by double reflection) of the
cross-wires of one of the telescopes coincide with the cross-wires
themselves.
    If  the axes of the telescopes 1 and 2 are, through reflection of
the illuminated cross-wires, set normal to the two faces of the
mirror, they make exactly an angle of 90° with each other. Different
positions of the angular mirror then determine every four points
of the circle-division which are 90° distant from each other.
   Two plane glasses make exactly an angle of 120° or 60° with
one another, if two telescopes, placed each normal to one of them,
show simultaneously, through double reflection, the cross-wires of
telescope 1 in the cross-wires of telescope 2, and vice versä.
   By putting, with different positions of the angular mirror of
120° or 60°, the two telescopes normal to the respective faces of
the mirror, we obtain, by reading-off the circle, points exactly 60°
or 120° distant from one another.

  ON A CONVENIENT         EYEPIECE-MICROMETER         FOR    THE SPECTRO
                  SCOPE.     BY PROFESSOR    O. N.  R.O.O.D.
   I  have recently contrived a very simple eyepiece-micrometer for
the study of spectra produced by prisms and “gratings,” which,
while quite inexpensive, is capable of yielding results that are not
easily surpassed except by the use of an eyepiece provided with a
micrometer-screw.         A thin semicircular plate of silver is made
quite smooth, and rendered black by holding it over the flame of a
lamp; it is afterward flowed with a drop of weak spirit-varnish to
cause the lampblack to adhere. Crossing the straight edge of this
dead-black surface, lines 3 millim. &c. are ruled with a dividing
engine, and the necessary figures added with the help of a lens.
The opaque semicircular plate is then introduced into the interior
of a negative, or preferably in front of a positive eyepiece, so that
it is in focus and does not occupy quite half of the field of view.
Opposite it and somewhat nearer the eye an opening is made in
the side of the eyepiece, whereby the lines are brightly illuminated
—as a general thing, merely by the diffused light of the room; but
if this is quite dark, the small flame of a distant lamp easily accom
plishes the same end. This arrangement, it will be seen, furnishes
a set of bright lines on an almost perfectly black ground with the
least possible outlay of expense or trouble in manipulation; and the
degree of their brightness, it will be found, can readily be regulated
merely by shading the opening more or less with the hand.                The
distance of the lines apart should not be too small, as is often the
case in the photographic scales of ordinary spectroscopes, but such
as will facilitate the estimation of tenths of a division.         Two such
eyepieces have been constructed and employed by me with much
 satisfaction in the mapping of a large number of spectra furnished
by prisms and gratings, particularly in those cases where the spec
tral lines were quite faint.—Silliman's American Journal, July
 1873.

       GENTLEMEN,
    Is not  the method of making powerful compound magnets pub
lished   by M. Jamin substantially identical with that employed by
 Scoresby, and fully set forth in his “Magnetical Investigations’ so
long since as 1839? . He shows that thin hard steel plates may be
superposed on the other with great advantage if separated by thin
slips of wood or cardboard, and states that the power of such plates
accumulated efficiently “to the amount of 192, and might have
been carried much further.”

    As the result of numerous determinations made on various
 parts of the screw, I found that 150 of a rotation of the screw
 equalled 1737 division of the telescope-scale,     which gives
 0.00011 inch as the value of one division of the scale. This
 value, however, applies only to the experiments on the rods of
iron Nos. 1 to 6 inclusive. Before commencing the experiments
on the rods of steel, the distance of the scale from the mirror

firm the result arrived at by those experimenters.          Recently
Cazin   (Comptes  Rendus,   vol. lxxv. p. 1265) has shown that “the
heat thus produced is proportional to the square of the intensity
of the magnetism and to the polar distance;” and Moutier
 (Comptes Rendus, vol. lxxv. p. 1620) * deduces this result from
a thermodynamic theorem established by Clausius, and thus
concludes his paper:-"The increase of vis viva which the bar
experiences from the effect of magnetization is therefore propor
 tional to the square of the intensity of the magnetism and to the
polar distance.    The effect of the demagnetizing corresponds
 to an equal loss of vis viva, which is the measure of the thermal
 effect produced; and this effect is the only one which accompanies
the demagnetization.”
    The fact that an iron bar is heated by successive magnetiza
 tions and demagnetizations has been known for a long time; but
only recently have experiments been made which indicate that
 this heat is produced at the moment of demagnetization.        In a
 paper “On the Calorific Effects of Magneto-electricity, and on the
 Mechanical Value of Heat” (Phil. Mag. S. 3. vol. xxiii. 1843), Dr.
Joule first showed that heat was developed in an iron bar when
it was rotated between the poles of a powerful magnet, and also
determined that the heat thus produced was proportional to the
square of the inductive force.  These experiments will ever be
regarded with interest; for they led Joule to the first experi
mental determination ever made of “the mechanical value of
heat.”    It may here be of interest to present the following ac
count of the experiments made by Van Breda and Grove, taken
from Daguin’s Traité de Physique, 1861, vol.             621:—“M.                  iii.   p.

  In   exp. No. 1 we passed the current for the first time round
the  unmagnetized    rod, and observed an elongation of 1:6 of a
division of the telescope-scale; immediately after the observa
tion we broke the circuit, which had remained closed about five
seconds, and observed a retraction of 1:2 division; the rod now
remained at a constant temperature for three hours, and the
scale-reading remained steady at 38.0—thus showing that the
rod had received a permanent elongation of 4 of a division on
receiving       its

188         Prof.         A. M. Mayer              on the Magnetic Elongations
junction of the wires exposed. This apparatus was introduced
into the rod so that the uncovered point of the wire was about
one millimetre from the bottom of the hole; and the space                                           in
cluded between the point of the wire and the bottom of the hole
was filled in some experiments with fine iron filings, in others
with mercury.     The terminals of the thermo-electric couple were
connected with a delicate galvanometer.      With the apparatus
thus arranged I successively made 50, 100, 200, 300, and 400
break-circuits, taking care that the closed circuits preceding the
break-circuits should all be of the same duration. After each
series of break-circuits the elongation produced in the rod and
the permanent deflection on the galvanometer-needles were noted;
and the observations showed that the elongations and the incre
ments of temperature in the rod were proportional to the number
of break-circuits.
On the elongations and retractions    observed in the iron rods as the
     strength of the magnetizing-current   is gradually increased and
     diminished; and on the equality in the elongations produced by
     a definite current when it is gradually and when it is suddenly
     brought up to             its
                        maximum strength.

elongation is yet 65 of a division, whereas when the circuit is
at once formed with this same interposed resistance the rod was
elongated only 05 of a division.
   The discovery of this most remarkable phenomenon was con
tained in the above experiments; but to be sure that my expe
riments should not mislead me                            I
                                      repeated them several times,
using every precaution to ensure their accuracy, and obtained
results almost identical with those formerly observed.             am                                           I
                                       I
therefore confident that have discovered a phenomenon worthy
of minute study; and I purpose to make it the subject of a spe
cial investigation.
   Unfortunately, during the above experiments I did not make
a parallel series of determinations of the magnetic intensities of
the rod during the successive stages of passing a current of                                                        in
creasing and of decreasing strength.         Yet I can hardly believe
that the magnetic intensity will be kept up with the persistent
elongation of the rod when it is slowly demagnetized; I
think it will be found that the magnetic intensity of the rod
depends alone on the strength of the current traversing the
helix. The phenomenon indeed shows that, the molecules of
the rod on           its

                                     I
presenting the facts; for have not yet been able to command
the time which their investigation will require.
    In experiments (3) and (6) the times of retraction were respec
tively 11% of a second and 11% of a second; and the slow
ness of these motions allowed me to obtain an insight into their
character.       In each of these experiments the rod retracted with
a gradually diminishing velocity, and the motion reminded one
forcibly of that pertaining to a body projected vertically upwards.
 The coefficients     of    elongation   and   of retraction of     seven rods  of
   different   species     of iron, and of three steel rods of various         de
   grees of hardness.
   It   remains to give the determinations                 I  have made of the
coefficients of elongation and of retraction.                   These measures
were made on rods of circular             section,   60:1 inches long and '5
inch in diameter.             As   previously   stated,     the iron rods were
thoroughly annealed, and the steel rods were carefully tempered.
On the ends of the rods numbers were stamped; and these marks
corresponded to the rods as follows:—
                    .    .     Scrap iron.
               .    .    .     Ulster iron.
               .    .    .     Norway iron.
                              English refined iron.
                         .     Low-Moor iron.
                               Fall-River iron.
                               Steel, soft.
                                  ,, hardened and drawn to blue.
               -    -    -        3x        xx          yy          yellow.
    The method of determining these coefficients was as follows:—
 When the rod had attained a fixed temperature, so that the
 scale-reading      remained constant for an hour,                I recorded this
 scale-reading.        I   then passed the current from the 25-cell bat
 tery; and as soon as the new scale-reading thus produced was
 read,   I broke the circuit and obtained the corresponding scale
 reading. These readings were now written in the note-book;
 and immediately after recording them                 I  again made and broke
 the  circuit,  and noted the two        corresponding       readings of the tele
 scope-scale.       I then continued making and breaking the circuit
 and recording the scale-divisions until the rod began to elongate
 from the heat produced on demagnetization.
     The Tables following (see p.200) consist of six columns, A, B,
 C, D, E, and F. Under A are designated the rods. B contains
 the elongations or retractions produced on first passing the cur
 rent; C the retractions or elongations observed after the first

                     and Retractions of Rods of Iron and Steel.                       197
  The phenomena of elongation and retraction                    observed    in rods of
                                       steel.
   The phenomena observed on the magnetization and demag
netization of the rods of steel have not been referred to. Here
we have presented to us remarkable results.        On first passing
the current round rod    000,   of soft steel, it elongated  8 of a
scale-division, behaving like a rod of soft iron; but on breaking
the circuit, to my astonishment it again elongated 6 of a divi
sion, thus leaving this rod with a permanent elongation of 1:4
of a division; and this elongation exceeds the permanent elon
gation given to any of the soft-iron rods when similarly experi
mented on.       On passing the current round the rod for the
second time the soft-steel rod again did not act like a rod of iron;
for it retracted 25 of a division, instead of elongating as did the
rods of iron in like circumstances; and on breaking this circuit
the rod elongated 25 of a division instead of retracting, again
exhibiting a phenomenon the reverse of those observed in the
rods of iron.    And it is here important to remark that all the
steel rods behaved in the same manner on the making and break
ing of the second and subsequently formed circuits.
   The results just described differ from those obtained by Dr.
Joule. Referring to his memoir (Phil. Mag. vol. xxx. p. 85),
we find that experiments on a rod of soft steel, 1 yard long and
# of an inch in diameter, showed that the rod elongated on first
passing the current; but on breaking this circuit the rod re
tracted, while in my experiments the rod again elongated on
breaking this circuit.   Indeed the experiments of Dr. Joule in
dicate that a rod of soft steel behaves like one of iron, except
that the elongations and retractions are of less extent than in the
case of an iron rod.    It is important, however, to observe that
Dr. Joule did   not,  in his first experiment on this rod, pass
round it a current sufficient to “saturate”          but graduallyit,
increased the intensity         of
                           the current     successive experiments;

           to        be
                remarked  that,    the intensity
                                           as       the current  of                   in
creased, the retractions and elongations came nearer and nearer
to equality; but          in   no
                            instance did         he
                                                 observe     retraction
                                                                    a                 on

                                                  cessation.
     Inhis subsequent experiments Dr. Joule worked                     steel
                                                                                on

rod   of the same dimensions          as
                                    that used         his former experi

                 was “hardened

subsequently passing the current with successively increased                          in

The fact that     eminent

                            a          bar    hard steel, results a
similar      to
            those obtained    me with my bar    bysoft steel, leads                     of
me      suspect that the rod experimented
       to                                      may have retained

                       of                had been annealed; but       it
even this fact granted does not explain why     the steel rods                          all                       I

of the current.

Dr. Joule states:–“From the above experiments we find that the
induction          of
               permanent magnetism produces           sensible effect                      no                          on
the   length       bar of  perfectly
                            a             of
                                       hardened   steel, and that the
temporary shortening effect          the coil    proportional
                                                     of               the           is                           to
magnetism multiplied                           by
                              the current traversing the coil.      The
shortening effect does not       this case sensibly increase with the
                                                in
 increase of tension.”    We have no reason to doubt the truth of
this statement when applied      rods subjected       tension; but
                                                         to                                     to
my experiments show that when the rod 000 (of soft steel) and
the rod 00 (of hard steel “drawn       blue”) were not subject           to                                            to

they were permanently elongated after they had received their
permanent magnetism, and also that the rod           (of hard steel                             0
“drawn       yellow’’) had

which is in translatory motion in consequence of forces acting
upon it at one end of the tube.         now,      one place

 wire in which the section is n times as much, there come in the
 thicker wire, at every cross section, n times as many molecules
 of aether into motion; for it is inconceivable that in the thicker
 wire any more aether remains at rest than the inconsiderable
 portion which appears as electroscopic tension. Yet, because
 the strength of the current is the same in both wires, the velo
 city in the thicker one must be only one nth part of that in the
 thinner wire.    Then each molecule of aether in the thinner wire
 goes  in the unit of time n times as far as those in the thicker.
 We   cannot, therefore, hold it an impossibility that the resistance
 is greater in the former case than in the latter, because the re
 sistance may be dependent on the velocity.      How it is with it
 in  reality is decided  by  experiment,  which teaches that the
 resistance is inversely proportional to the transverse section of
 the conductor.

ance r in a conductor of length 1 and cross section a when the
current s passes through                       it:-

where k is a constant dependent on the temperature and on the
physical and chemical constitution of the conductor. The con

   4. Ohm’s law can be deduced, in accordance with the general
principles of mechanics, in the following manner:—Electromo
tive force is measured, just like other motive forces, by the acce
leration which it can impart to the unit of mass in the unit of
time. If no galvanic resistance existed to obstruct the motion,
the velocity would increase perpetually.       But there is a resist
ance in the conduction, which sets a limit to this increase.        If
the velocity has become constant, the acceleration    by  the electro
motive force is annihilated by the resistance.       The two must
therefore be equal.    If ds is the increment of the current-inten
sity in the time                     dt,
                         the electromotive (accelerating) force,

terior, still remain facts, and present apparently a greater diffi
culty than ever to the geologist. Professor LeConte's views (Am.
Journ. Sc. vol. iv.) were offered by him as a method of meeting this
difficulty; yet (as he admits in his concluding remarks) the
oscillations over the interior of a continent, and the fact of the
greater movements on the borders of the larger ocean, were left
by him unexplained.      Yet these oscillations are not more real
than the changes of level or greater oscillations which occurred
along the sea-border, where mountains were the final result;

solidity of the earth's interior,                the question comes up, how are

   The geological argument on    the subject (the only one within
our present purpose) has often   been presented.     But it derives
new force and  gives clearer revelations when the facts are viewed
in the light of the principles that have been explained in the
preceding part of this memoir.

 and Jurassic marine fossils and the presence of Cretaceous species
 in great numbers are well accounted for.
    Professor Hunt has recognized the existence, on the Atlantic

                                                                                  he its

   The facts thus sustain the statement that lateral pressure pro

could hardly have been due simply to radial contraction from
cooling; for this would make the cooling over the tropical part
of the ocean in this small part of geological time sufficient to
produce there a sixth of the oceanic depression.          Is it not
proof that even then the plastic layer had enough of extent
beneath the tropical part of the oceanic crust to permit of such
a sinking under the irresistible lateral pressure at work? How
ever this may be, it stands as a fact to be explained.
   In view of the conclusions here reached with regard to the
earth's interior,                I
                   present the following statements:—
     l.That this restriction of the interior liquidity of the earth
to an undercrust layer does not require in itself any modifica
tion of the views                    I
                    presented more than twenty-five years since
on the results of the earth's contraction, since there is still a
flexible crust and mobile rock beneath it.

     Afinal word on Mountain-making.—From the above we
learn that in the work of mountain-making in eastern North
America there was first the commencing and progressing
geanticlinal on the sea-border, and, as a concomitant effect
of the lateral pressure, a parallel geosynclinal further west
along the border of the continent. Concurrently the deepen
ing trough of the geosynclinal was kept filled to the water
level, or nearly, by sedimentary accumulatious until these
had become seven miles in thickness; and, as a consequence,
the lines of equal temperature (isogeotherms) in the crust be
neath gradually rose upward seven miles; and further, the geo
synclinal crust, owing to this rising of heat from below, lost part
of   itsthickness                 by
                          melting-off  a       under portion, and also

                             the best geologists      the world, Logan             in
and Dawson, the bottom temperature must have been, when the
series was completed,       least 330°F.    at     still better sustainedIt   is

by the observation that the lower of the forty thousand feet of
strata in the Appalachian region were, where measured by the
Professors Rogers, not metamorphic, the Chazy and Trenton
limestones being ordinary uncrystalline limestones.    And yet
the temperature in these inferior beds, marked by the ascending
isogeotherms, must have been before their disturbance, as calcu
lated by Professor LeConte, not less than 800°F., and much
above this if more heat escaped from the earth then than now.
Thus seven miles of accumulations were not sufficient to bring
about metamorphism or crystallization even in the lowest stratum,
or any change beyond that of ordinary solidification *.
   It seems certain, therefore, that this method of obtaining the
heat, by blanketing the surface with strata, is not sufficient.
   Neither, as Mallet has observed (p. 303 of the last volume
of Silliman’s American Journal), can heat be derived from simple
pressure or “mechanical compression,” as the language of Vose
suggestst.    But with movements in the strata, or progressive
plications, such as the metamorphic rocks themselves show they
have experienced, then, according to the principle of the trans
formation of motion into heat, first suggested with reference
to metamorphism by Professor Henry Wurtz of New York in
1866f, and recently applied to volcanoes and demonstrated by
Robert Mallet, Esq., the conditions for metamorphism might be
complete even with comparatively little help from a rise in the
isogeotherms.    This result would certainly follow if the heat
from motion is great enough, as Mallet appears to show, to
produce fusion. Such a cause is capable, as others have urged,
                                                        I
   * The arguments here presented are the same that urged in 1866 (Silli
man’s American Journal, vol. xlii. p. 252).
  f   Wose could hardly have intended to say in place of pressure the motion
produced by pressure;      for in one of his paragraphs he attributes the
changes distinctly to “the enormous pressure generated in the folding of
masses of rock the depth of which is measured by miles;” and this pres
sure was that of gravitating sediments alone, while the additional heat re
quired came from a rise in the isogeotherms in consequence of surface ac
cumulations.     The truthis, that instead of folding generating pressure, the
pressure generated the folding; and the movement attending folding was
essential to the existence of the heat requisite for metamorphic changes.
Thus the views of Wose and Hunt are set aside by Mallet, instead of being,
as Professor Hunt says (the last volume of Silliman's Journal, p. 270),
“confirmed ” by him. In a letter of May 10th to the writer, Mr. Mallet
refers to his opposition to Herschel's theory, and adds that he was “rather
amused '' at finding himself brought forward by Professor Hunt in support
of it.  Mr. Wose's views are contained  in   his work  onOrographic Geology,
published   in Boston in  1866 (136 pp. 8vo).

viz. the description     space and the generation

be properly measured by the momentum                                        created or destroyed             in
that time.*.
    The measure thus proposed, in fact, differs from the received
measure enunciated by Professor Maxwell less than might at
first sight be supposed; for when T is very small, (1) becomes
                                           work=Fs=Mv. Wi.
Thus, while I contend that the work done in a short interval of
time under the above circumstances is properly measured by the
momentum generated during the time, according to the views
upon the subject which are generally received it is measured by
the product of the momentum generated and the initial velocity
Wi–a position the reasonableness of which, apprehend, it will                      I
be found difficult to establish.

222             The Astronomer Royal's Experiments on
ones by Coulomb in the French Memoirs for 1789 and other
years.   It appeared to me that it might be desirable to make
experiments of a rather more extensive character, and to add
some measures of the magnetic effect of galvanic currents, both
directly by their immediate action, and indirectly by the annount
of magnetic power which they produce inductively in soft iron.
   For the measure of permanent magnetism               I
                                                   selected a bar
magnet 14 inches long, 1.4 inch broad, 0.35 inch thick; it has
not been touched by a magnet for several years, and is likely to
be  in a state of very permanent magnetism.            For the galvanic
currents a    cylindrical  coil was used 13.4 inches long, l'4 inch
in external    diameter,  and about 0.9 inch in internal diameter;
it has, I believe, four layers of wire, each layer having 160 re
volutions of the wire.         The battery used with it consisted of
three  cells,  with sulphuric    acid diluted in the proportion of 1 to
6; the plates were of zinc and graphite, each exposing on each
side about 8 square inches; the circuit was always completed
about half an hour before the experiments were begun; and a
delicate galvanometer was placed in circuit, by which the steadi
ness of the current was established.          A core of iron 0-8 inch in
diameter and of the same        length   as the coil, removable at plea
sure, fits well in the inside of the coil; the iron is quite soft,
and can with ease be entirely freed from any subpermanent
magnetism.
   The first step in the experiment was to neutralize terrestrial
magnetism within the area of magnetic experiment.         For this
purpose two powerful 2-feet magnets were placed below the
table on which the experiments were made, with their red or
north-seeking ends directed to the magnetic north, at a distance
(determined by trial) such that the experimental compass was
sensibly uninfluenced by terrestrial magnetism.     It is possible
that some small residual  magnetism   was perceptible  in the com
parison with the feeble galvanic action; but none could be cer
tainly discovered in the other experiments.
   The compass used for register of the magnetic action is a
small and very lively pocket-compass, with needle 1-0 inch
long, not loaded with a card.     The box of this compass is
circular; and when positions had been selected for the centre of
the compass (as will be mentioned), a circle somewhat larger
than the compass-box was described in pencil with each of those
positions for centre; and the compass could then be planted
with     its   centre   very   accurately   placed    above   the intended
point.
   The compass-positions were thus prepared:—Upon      sheet   by       of
strong paper the plan          of
                          the magnet,     inches 14 1-4 inch,    a
was laid down.   On each side were drawn two parallel lines,            of

                   the Directive Power                    of Magnets,                  &c.                   223
the same length as the magnet, at distances respectively 1.5
inch and 3-0 inches from the near edge of the magnet; these
lines were divided each into ten equal parts; and thus in each
line eleven points were obtained at intervals of 1:4 inch. From
each of the four angles of the magnet as centre, two quadrants
were swept:—one with radius 1-5 inch, at whose extremity
and bisection points were taken for the compass-centre;         and
one with radius 3-0 inches, which was twice bisected, and of
which the extreme point and the three bisection-points were
taken for the compass-centre.      These points were used for the
magnet both with             its
                         edge and with       flat side towards the     its
compass.      A similar process was adopted      using the galvanic          in
coil, with this difference only, that the longitudinal separation
of  the points taken for compass-centre was only 1:34 inch.
  A  solid piece      wood was provided,
                        of                       which was cut       con
                                                                       in                               a
cave channel, less than half          cylinder, such that when the

galvanic coil,    the large magnet with
                   or                             flat side towards the its
compass, was laid        the channel,
                             in              axis was sensibly its     the                              at
same   height      as
                   the needle       the small compass.

magnet’s edge towards the compass, that condition was suffici
ently secured          by
                    merely laying                        its
                                          flat side upon the board.
The   paper  with   station-points,  being   laid        proper position          in
upon the board and scCured                  by
                                    nails, was cut along the middle
of the channel and crosswise           its ends,        that     could            so                              be
                                                 to at

to take     its
             proper position. When observations were finished,
the paper was detached from the board, and the edges which
had been cut were reunited              cementingby       piece     paper          a               of
behind.
   The observation (as will                be
                                  seen) consisted,      every case,                    in                         of

axis transversal to the direction which the compass-needle had
taken before the constant      magnet was introduced, and to
observe the deflection produced.   The measure of the force of
the large magnet was then the cotangent of the angle of devia
tion. The observation of the deflected needle by dots &c. was
the same as before; but the angle of deviation was never
measured by degrees.     Instead of that measure, a circle upon
semitransparent paper was graduated by cotangents, and thus
the measure of the force of the large magnet was read off at
Once.
   The arrangements in this state were confided to Mr. Carpenter,

                            in                 Mr. Carpenter selected
a ahorse-shoe magnet about        inches long, consisting
                                             4                   sixteen                of
plates, each 0-06 inch thick; these were retouched             few days                 a

was   placed            in
                    vertical position,

                                                                              of

magnet.     But when the coil was used without core, the force
        enormously reduced that the arrangement which applied
          in so
was

    With so great inequality the results are necessarily irregular.
I  use ++g as the proportion for comparison, without asserting
that it is accurate.    All results obtained for the coil without
core ought therefore to be divided by 120, to make them
comparable with the other results.
   The results obtained for the direction of magnetical force now
consisted of lines drawn upon paper.        Upon examining these,
some very small irregularities were found, generally of syste
matic character—partly arising from minute failure in the
neutralization of terrestrial magnetism, partly from a difference
in the intensity of the poles of the great magnet; these were
eliminated by the following graphical process:–The paper was
bent upon        its
                longitudinal axis, and exposed          strong light  to   a
passing through the two folds         paper; the lines drawn upon
                                                  of
both sides       of
                the magnet      coil were visible, and
                                             or            mean line            a
bisecting the small angle between each pair was easily drawn.
Then the paper was unfolded and was bent upon             transversal          its
axis, and    similar operation was performed upon the mean lines
             a
mentioned above.      Thus for one fourth part          the circum         of
ference   ofthe magnet     series    lines was obtained representing
                                     a            of
the mean       the four parts; these mean lines, repeated for the
                 of
four divisions         of
                   the magnet’s                   or
                                  coil's circumference, are alone
used    in further graphical deductions and         the subjoined         in
figure (p. 226).
   The results, however, for magnitude                   of
                                            force were obtained                                  in
numbers.         The means                of   these were taken           in    an   analogous
order—first     taking the sums       those       of         on
                                                opposite sides      the                 of
magnet       coil, then taking the sums
            or                                          of
                                             the last-found sums for
                                                  by
opposite ends.      The division         was omitted; and thus the
                                                  4

of deviation. At two stations the     proximity     the coil-terminals
made   it difficult    obtain actual observations; but there was
                            to                                                                   no

    The agreement is not satisfactory; but                I   am unable to
 suggest the nature of the change that ought to be made in the
 assumed law.
    I  shall add only one remark, of a somewhat practical charac
 ter. In a paper published originally by Dr. Lamont in Pog
 gendorff’s Annalen, vol. cxiii. p. 239 &c., and of which a
 translation, by W. T. Lynn, Esq., of the Royal Observatory, is
 printed in the Philosophical Magazine, 1861, November,

Dr. Lamont inferred the proportion of the effects of different
steel magnets from the proportion of the effects of different
soft-iron bars under the influence of induction. The remark
No. 4 (above) goes far,               I    think, to justify this assumption.

   Remarking the singularity of the experimental result as to
the apparent localization of the attractive pole of a galvanic coil
at the very extremity of the coil,                     I
                                     commenced an investigation
of the theoretical attraction of a  coil, on the laws of galvanic
attraction usually received.  On my mentioning the subject to
my friend James Stuart, Esq., Fellow of Trinity College, Cam
bridge, he kindly undertook, at my request, to prepare a
complete theoretical investigation.   am happy in being per  I
mitted by Mr. Stuart to place before the Royal Society his
mathematical   discussion of the attraction of the coil, which                                      I
am confident will be found to be very complete and of great
elegance.   I append to it a comparison of the numerical results
of the theory with the numerical results of experiment; and
the agreement will be found to be so great as to justify entire
confidence in the assumed law of galvanic action and the mathe
matical treatment of     and         it,

glance at these will show that they explain the apparent posi
tion of the pole at the very extremity of the coil; for in order
to ascertain the values of the forces in a plane at right angles to
the axis passing through the extremity of the coil, we must make
a = 90°, sin a = 1, cos a = 0; and if the other end of the coil be
very distant, 8 may be taken =0, sin 8=0, cos Á= 1.         Substi
tuting these values, it will be seen at once that X, the longitu
dinal force, =0, while Y, the transversal force, has a value which
indicates a force directed to the extremity of the coil.

 extension.

238            Prof. R. Clausius            on    a new Mechanical Theorem
   The case is still more general where the points do not describe
closed paths, but, though the coordinates of the points change
in a periodical manner, the periods have various durations, and
the durations may change in different proportions at the transi
tion from the one motion to the other.
   This case can be further enlarged thus—that periodical changes
are not ascribed to the coordinates themselves, but it is merely
assumed that the coordinates can be represented as functions of
some quantities which undergo periodical changes.
   Finally the treatment can be made still more general, by not
directly assuming concerning the quantities by which the coor
dinates are determined that they accomplish their changes pe
riodically, but fixing a less limiting mathematical condition,
which is satisfied by periodical changes, but can also be satis
fied without the changes needing to be periodical.   This is the
method we shall select.
   3. Before proceeding to this treatment of our subject, some
mechanical considerations may be premised which will facilitate
the understanding of                 it.

tion of which may be defined thus: 84, is the difference between
the value which q, has with the original motion at a certain                                                           in
stant and the corresponding value of q, with the deviating motion.
But now it is doubtful which of the infinity of values successively
taken by q, with the deviating motion is to be regarded as the
corresponding value.   Hamilton has certainly said nothing defi
nite on this point;  but, by a closer consideration of his deve
lopments and equations, one can easily perceive how the varia
tions therein occurring are to be understood.     If we commence
                                                                                          q2,
with the values which the quantities               ... with the                  q1,               q,
original motion have                 at
                          certain timea  the corresponding values       t,
with the changed motion are those which the quantities have                                                             at
a  time +8t—in which the variation
          t                                  not determined, but           8t   is
the same       for    all
                       quantities.
     That      a   common value           is      indeed           to   be attributed              to   the      varia
tion   8t   throughout the system                                atonce evident from this, that
                                                         as is
in  equation         (I.a)      8t   appears                  a   quantity valid for the entire
system.
   Another circumstance which leaves no doubt about this the                                                     is
following.     Hamilton presupposes,     the derivation     his equa  in                            of
tions, the proposition               of         energy, according               of
                                                                                                                        of to
                          the conservation

above-considered             variable has the value                      Z in the original motion
at the time t, and in the deviating motion the value Zºº at the
time tº, Z and Z” are corresponding values of this quantity, and
the difference Zºº —Z is their variation. This kind of variation,
in which  p is taken for the measuring quantity, shall be de
noted  by 8, Z. Therefore the difference t—tº, which according
to the two preceding equations has the value ºf ($), has also to
be denoted by 8,t.
   We have previously represented the time by an undetermined
function of p, which on the transition from the one motion to
the other undergoes an infinitely little variation. In the nearer
determination of this function we can be guided by the nature
of the subject of investigation. In the subsequent investiga

closely connected with the conception of the phase introduced
in my previous memoir.

                          the Coal-measures in co. Tyrone.                                                                 245

considerable variability appeared to exist in their composition, so
as to show the extremes of this variation, the results of three
analyses of three different pieces of each have been given, these

them.
        been selected from a number of others closely resembling
   The analyses were made in the usual way, in a current of oxy
gen gas, the apparatus being swept at the end of the operation
by a current of air. To avoid any loss from the potash-bulbs,
the precaution was taken to attach two U tubes, one containing
marble and caustic potash, and the other pumice moistencd with
sulphuric acid. The combustion-tube was more than half filled
with copper oxide; and in the remaining part was placed the pla
tinum boat and a long copper boat containing copper oxide, the
platinum boat lying between the copper boat and the column of
copper oxide.   It was found most convenient to use a platinum
boat at least 80 millims. long, as the combustion of the coal was
thereby greatly facilitated.  Not more than 15 to 3 grim. was
employed for an analysis; and this was taken from a large quan
tity that had been powdered and well mixed. Before calculating
the carbonic anhydride and water from the increase in weight of
the potash-bulbs &c., certain corrections were applied. The
amounts of these corrections had been previously ascertained by
a number of blank experiments, in which known quantities of
air and oxygen had been passed through the apparatus, and the
weight of carbonic anhydride and water present determined.
Though the air and oxygen were first purified by being sent
through large U tubes containing caustic potash and sulphuric
 acid, there was always an increase in weight in the calcium
 chloride-tube and the potash-bulbs; it is therefore necessary to
apply this correction in accurate experiments.

  ON THE PAssage of GASEs THROUGH COLLOID MEMBRANES OF
             vegetABLE             origiN.        BY A. BARTHELEMY.
         purpose of these experiments was to prove that those of
THE    Graham on the dialysis of gases through caoutchouc could be
verified on natural vegetable colloid films, and principally on the
cuticular surfaces of the leaf, and thus to justify the important
part which     I  make the cuticle play in the absorption of carbonic
acid by plants.
 . Every body knows the Begoniaceae with leaves spotted with white,
which are cultivated in greenhouses, and the white spots of which
         I
are, as have convinced myself, only elevations of the epiderm
upon a layer of nitrogen.               The leaves of certain varieties, very thin
on the living plant, are reduced, on fading during the winter in
darkness, to the condition of a pellicle endued with elasticity and
representing almost nothing but the cuticular layers.                 It was these
colloid membranes which served me in repeating Graham's experi
ment.     I followed strictly the course of the illustrious physicist,
save a few modifications of detail.
    One commences by ascertaining that the membrane is intact,
presenting no rents, by the dialysis of air alone. Three experi
ments, made on the 16th, 17th, and 18th of March, gave the fol
lowing results at the end of six              hours:–

Proportion of oxygen .. 36 per cent.                   41 per cent.   31 per cent.
    Although the proportions of oxygen present a rather wide devia
tion, due to the difficulty of repeating the experiments under the
same conditions of external pressure, temperature, and, especially,
of hygrometric condition, it may be concluded that oxygen passes
more rapidly than nitrogen, and that air thus dialyzed contains on
the average 36 per cent. of oxygen.                  This number is a little below
that found by Graham with caoutchouc.
    Having made this verification and obtained this important result,
I  proceeded to the comparison of the velocities of the three gases
which most interest us. For this purpose, having set up a current
of carbonic acid above the membrane,                   I noted the point to which
the mercury had descended at the expiration of an hour; then,
passing nitrogen or oxygen,
to descend to the same level.
                                         I  noted the time taken by the mercury
    In four experiments, with different                membranes,   I obtained      the
following results:—
                                • 1st exp.    2nd exp.     3rd exp.        4th exp.

   These experiments, made under conditions of pressure, tempera
ture, and hygrometric condition which cannot have been identical,
are nevertheless sufficiently concordant with those of Graham, and
permit me to conclude that the natural colloid surfaces of vege
tables have for carbonic acid an admissive power which is from 13
to 15 times as great as that which corresponds to nitrogen, and six
or seven times as great as that which refers to oxygen.
   A few days afterwards                       I
                                 operated with perfectly dry carbonic
acid, and only found, as the velocity relative to nitrogen, numbers
varying between 9 and 11. It appears, therefore, that carbonic
anhydride passes less quickly than hydrated carbonic acid.
   On replacing the vegetable membrane by caoutchouc, obtained                                     I
a similar result.    The difference produced by dried oxygen and
nitrogen is less pronounced.
    I will remark, in conclusion, that these experiments prove the
dialysis of carbonic acid through the cuticle of leaves, just as much
as the experiments of Dutrochet on membranes and aqueous solu
tions prove endosmose by cellules, or the experiments on absorp
tion made by M. Dehérain with porous vessels, to which the
Academy accorded one of                        its
                                 highest rewards.         word, cuticular            byIn

  depending on the thickness of the metal,” and also “that
                                                                        the change
  of phase in refraction must vary also with the position of the plane
  of polarization.”                              I
                            At the same time, showed how, independently
  of the sources of error of the formerly usual methods, a thin lamella
  of metal displaces interference-streaks as if the refraction-index
  in the interior of the metal were 3.1 $. On the same occasion it
   was explained how far it is justifiable to assume an acceleration of
  the phase when light passes through thin, transparent layers of
   metal, which M. Potier seeks to establish on
                                                            theoretical grounds.
      When a lens is pressed upon a glass plate partially covered with
  a thin layer of metal, Newton's colour-rings upon the metal appear
   displaced towards those upon the glass plate. The
                                                                      thickness of
   the metal cannot be calculated from this displacement, unless, as is
   correctly remarked in the communication mentioned,
                                                                       the changes
  of phase with reflection at the surfaces of the metal and the glass,
   or the difference between the two, be known.
      Hence    I   have never made use of this method for determining
  the thickness, but have pressed the lens upon the uncovered part
  of the glass plate until the lower surface of the lens touched the
  margin of the sharply bordered layer of metal.
                                                               Contact was shown
  by the distortion of the colour-rings on the glass.
                                                                       The colour
  which was exhibited by the layer of air of the same thickness as
  the metal on the glass plate gave then the thickness of the latter|.
  It  is at once seen that in this determination the knowledge of the
  change of phase with normal reflection is not requisite;
                                                                        and there
  fore ignorance of it could not occasion any error in the rest of the
  conclusions deduced by me.
      Finally,   I   have also shown, how, in reflection from the same
  metal, the principal angle of incidence and principal azimuth,
                                                                                  as
  well as the qualities generally of the reflected light, depend on the
..nature of the transparent medium in which the reflection takes
  place", and to what depth light of different colour and plane

moist is    quite   harmless,    yet  as soon as it is dry it detonates with
great violence on the slightest friction.             But what is most remark
able        is,
           this violent decomposition can                 called forth      certainbe                             by

258             Mr. F. Guthrie      on a Relation between
the leaves.    It is in fact impossible to use a white-hot iron ball
as a “proof   plane”    for + electricity.
   § 2.  Eaperiment.—A       white-hot iron ball being hooked out of
the fire, as in § 1, by the insulating hook, is made to touch the
–   conductor of the machine; it is then found to be incapable
of influencing the electroscope by induction or by contact.. The
white-hot ball cannot serve as a proof plane for — electricity.
   § 3. Experiment.—On the top of the electroscope is placed a
wooden block covered with tinfoil.         Above this are a few sheets
of metal plate.   Upon these is a tripod stand inverted, to which
a metal chain is fastened.  The other end of the chain can be
connected    with the + or — conductor of an electric machine.
A white-hot iron ball is placed on the tripod, and the chain is
fastened to the + conductor.      As long as the machine is worked
the leaves diverge; but on ceasing, they immediately droptogether.
   § 4. Eaperiment.—The arrangement being precisely the same
as in § 3, the chain is fastened to the        –
                                              conductor of the ma
chine. As before, the leaves only remain divergent    -
                                                          while the
machine is being worked.
   § 5. Eaperiment.—The chain in § 3 being removed, the white
hot ball is placed upon the tripod. It is found impossible to
make the leaves diverge by a charge from a proof plane of 24
inch surface which has been charged by either the + or         –con
ductor and then brought into contact with either the white-hot
ball or any other part of the electroscope’s system.
   § 6. Experiment.—A white-hot iron ball on a metal hook (so
as to be in earth-connexion)   is held above the top of an electro
scope charged with + electricity. When at the distance of one
or two inches, the leaves rapidly and completely collapse, and do
not recover their divergence on the removal of the ball.
   § 7. Eaperiment.—The electroscope is charged with           –elec
tricity, the conditions being otherwise as in § 6. When the ball
is at a distance of three or four inches the electroscope is rapidly,
completely,    and permanently      discharged.
   § 8. Eaperiment.—The electroscope being charged with +
electricity, the white-hot iron ball is hooked out of the fire with
the insulating hook and brought above the electroscope. Perfect
and permanent discharge takes place when the interval between
the two is about one inch.
   § 9. Experiment.—The electroscope is charged with — elec
tricity, the experiment being otherwise as in § 8. The electro
scope loses    its   charge    completely   and permanently   when the
interval  istwo      or
                      three inches—that        is,
                                              sensibly greater than
with  +  electricity.

sulphide of carbon; the liquid is ignited, and the flame is held
above the electroscope charged with + electricity.    At a dis
tance of three or four inches immediate perfect and permanent
discharge takes place.
   § 11. Eaperiment.—The same flames are found to discharge
the   – electricity of an electroscope at about the same distance.
   § 12. It will be noted that these flames included white lumi
nous smoky (benzol), white luminous (ether), feebly luminous
(alcohol and bisulphide of carbon). They are             water-forming               all
but the last. There       little,  any, difference noticeable

    § 31. Eaperiment.—The 8-cell battery which               used was notI
 sufficient to heat twelve inches of the wire when in a single loop
 even to dull redness.     Such a non-luminous hot loop discharged
 an  electroscope  of —  electricity, when at a distance of one inch, in
 seven or   eight seconds.    A+     charge  is not perceptibly affected.
    § 32. It   appears,  on  comparing    the experiments of
 with those of §§ 28–31, that the behaviour of red- and white
                                                                       1–21

 hot earth-connected iron balls is precisely analogous to the
 behaviour of red- and white-hot platinum wires heated by gal
 vanism.      In experiments $$ 28–31 the battery was not                             in
 sulated from the ground. T may mention that repeated and
 varied attempts by insulating the battery to detect a difference in
 the discharging-power between an earth-connected and insulated
 galvanically heated wire (similar to the difference between the
 discharging-powers of earth-connected and insulated hot iron
 balls) failed, presumably on account of the considerable amount
 of neutral matter in the battery, which must be electrically con
nected with the wire.
    § 33. Experiment.—When the black bottom of a pan of boil
ing water is brought within 4 inch of the top of an electroscope
charged with + or — electricity, ordinary temporary inductive
discharge takes place: the leaves recover their divergence com
pletely on the removal of the pan. Yet the actual quantity of
heat, as measured by air-expanding power radiated by the bot
tom of the pan upon the electroscope at the distance of # inch,
is far greater than that radiated upon it at a distance of 6 inches
by the 4-inch long white-hot platinum wire. This is clearly
enough shown by employing the differential air-thermometer
with conical copper air-chambers blackened above. The pan
has a base about 700 times as great as the orthographic pro
jection of the outline of the spiral, and indefinitely greater
than the projection of the wire itself. Immediately the spiral
is heated white-hot above one cone, the pan of boiling water
(containing an immersed “heater”) is brought so near to the
other that the liquid in the bent stem remains for a time sen
sibly at rest. The wire is 6 inches from                          its

   § 34. Experiment.—If a series of dielectric non-conductors,
such as a series of plates of varnished glass, be placed on an
electroscope which is then charged with — electricity, a dull
red-hot ball or platinum wire a few inches above the electroscope
causes the leaves to collapse, but does not discharge the system.
On removing the plates in succession (after the removal of the
heated discharger), the leaves diverge more and more, till the
withdrawal of the last leaves them nearly fully charged.      The
bottom of each plate is found to be charged with + electricity.
A similar effect is produced, changing the changeables, by a
white-hot ball or wire above the upper of a series of varnished
glass plates on the top of a positively charged electroscope.
     § 35. The experiments   with electroscopes may be repeated
almost one for one with the condensed electricity of a Leyden jar.
Owing,      I
            presume, to the closeness of the two condensed elec
tricities to one another on the metallic coatings, and to that pe
netration of the two kinds into the glass which furnishes the
potential residual charge, the discharge of a jar is never so rapid
or complete under the same circumstances as that of an elec
troscope.
     § 36. Experiment.—A     Leyden jar of about 1% square foot
outer foil surface is fully charged with + electricity.   A white
hot earth-connected iron ball, at a distance of 3 inches above the
electroscope, discharges the jar, but by no means completely, in
thirty seconds (when the ball had become dull red).            A     jar
charged with — electricity is discharged under like conditions
almost completely in thirty seconds.      The remaining charge is
not greater  than the first residual charge under ordinary circum
stances (the  glass being  about $ inch thick).

                                     -

charge in a minute, while a

   § 38. Eaperiments.-A platinum spiral of wire 4 inches long
and 01 inch thick is fixed 4 inches above a charged jar. The
latter loses little of    its

                                       one minute.    When the cur
rent passes through the wire from eight platin-zinc cells the
wire becomes white-hot, and the charge, whether       +   or   —,     is
lost  inone minute.      For the success      of
                                             this experiment, especi

tance of 2 inches, (3) at which there is no sensible difference
between the discharge of + and —.          These experiments were
checked  by examining   the temperatures  at which an insulated iron

repeats his conclusion, and then considers the possible steps                the process               he in
of  refrigeration.     Among the different conditions discussed,            supposes                                            as

                                    to
should probably have the condition under which solidification would com
mence       at the centre.                 In

of  our globe, that “under the condition here assumed, with the observed
 rate  of  increase          of

278                   Prof.   J.     D. Dana on              some Results          of
movements and flexures of the crust, and the opening of fissures
for the escape of the mobile rock, great regions of it may have
been pressed up and become isolated fire-lakes at a higher level.
Or, as Professor Hopkins suggests, the subterranean sources of
volcanic action may have been in shape like inverted cones ex
tending far up into the crust, and may have finally been divided
off into “smaller ones by a process similar to that by which the
larger cavities were themselves formed from the general fluid
mass, the position of each minor cavity being determined by the
points in the roof of the larger one, where previous fractures had
left the most perfect volcanic vents.” This last explanation
holds if regions of volcanic vents date back to early geological
time, so that modern volcanoes in an area are successors to                                                  in
definitely older ones, but is less applicable where the vents of
a region are of Caenozoic origin (as appears to be true of most of
them) and a consequence of the later movements of lateral
pressure.
     The inference that igneous eruptions have generally been
derived from a    deep-seated  source is sustained by the great
lithological uniformity of ejections over widely distant ranges of
surface.   The eruptive rocks (or trap) of the Triassico-Jurassic
areas of the Atlantic border from Nova Scotia to the Carolinas,

that the trap of this region in Connnecticut and New Jersey is

the density varies little from 3. The dolerite of East Rock,

anhydrous dolerite of West Rock and the Palisades; the pro
portion is less instead of greater. There is hence a close simi
larity to the other dolerite, notwithstanding the presence of
Water.
   Since the dikes of this hydrated dolerite occur as parts of the
same series as the others and in the same regions, and are of the
same epoch and system of ejections, and moreover are exceptional
instead of the prevailing kind, it is apparent that the hydrous
character is owing to some exceptional condition attending or
subsequent to the eruption.     The source of liquid rock was                                                       all
one; and the material must therefore have been essentially one
    kind;     could not have been locally hydrous.

                                            or
contemporaneous with the eruption; for the vesicular character
was undoubtedly then produced, and       was probably dependent           it
on  the same moisture that, penetrating the rock, caused the me

    There is hence mothing in the relations of the different kinds
of dolerite in the Connecticut valley or any part of the Triassico

position or chemical composition, that favours the idea of differ
ence of original subterranean source.
    Now such a similarity of product occurring at intervals over
a region 1200 miles long, and in several parallel lines, shows
some unity of origin.           It evinces that the source must have
been either the undercrust fire-sea, like the under-Appalachian

   It will be perceived that the hypothetical viscous layer of
Hunt lies between   a rind made out of sedimentary      formations
and a solid nucleus which is at surface of sedimentary origin;
and the viscous layer which Professor Hopkins regards as be
longing to a stage in the process of solidification is supposed to
have been closed up, or some way put hors de combat.
   This substitution appears to be quite unnecessary, and the
process incapable of producing the result claimed.     As has been
already explained *, the pressure from the gravitation of sedi
ments cannot produce the heat needed for the fusion, any more
than it can cause the plications alleged to attend            then,                            it.      If,

and showings and crushings which must at times take place, it
should be sufficient; and acting at infra-Archaean depths, it
would give uniform results over wide areas, or, on the other

gives a reasonable source for the heat occasioning fusion.

vast undercrust fire-sea by this method.

cause has aided in the great  majority of eruptions in non-vol
canic regions.
   Another cause of ejection appealed to is pressure from the
vapours imprisoned in the regions of fused rock.  It must have
often given  efficient aid. But such   vapours may  not exist to
the extent sometimes                    supposed          about       the deep sources of the
material of fissure-eruptions.    Non-volcanic igneous rocks are
usually solid throughout, without the minutest vesicle; and
similar complete compactness characterizes many fissure-ejec
tions even of volcanic regions when they have taken place at a
considerable   distance from the volcanic vent+.       This would
hardly be so generally the fact if vapours were abundant about
the sources of the ejected material; for such vapours would imply
the existence in the mobile rock itself ordinarily of vapori
zable ingredients capable of easy vaporization under the pres
sure there existing. The fact seems to be that the great pres
sure is in the way of vaporization of the sulphides that may
exist in the plastic material; for pyrites is often found in the
solid basalt.   And, further, the deep-seated sources of igneous
rocks must be mostly or wholly below the regions accessible to
moisture; for if not, they would show        presence    hydration   its           by

the variations which the spectrum of a luminous gas at a constant
temperature undergoes through variations of pressure do not de
pend on the value of the pressure or the density at a determined
point in the mass, but only on the quantity of the luminous par
ticles which send their light to the eye and therefore (no matter
how distributed) are situated in the observer's line of vision.
   This principle of the spectroscopic equivalence of density and
thickness of a radiant gas stratum diminishes, as is readily per
ceived, the previously assumed values of the pressure at the base
of the chromosphere, because at that time the modification of
the hydrogen-spectrum, as observed under terrestrial conditions,
was presupposed as a function of the pressure only, and not as a
function of the density and thickness of the luminous stratum.
    Hence, if we wish to infer, from the accordance of the regular
variations exhibited by the spectra of incandescent gases under ter
restrial conditions with changes of pressure, the ratios of pressure
or density in the atmospheres of incandescent heavenly bodies, we
must always take into account the quantity of luminous particles
which, lying in the observer’s line of sight, simultaneously emit
their light to his eye.

It must consequently be an admissible hypothesis that the tem
perature and the quantity of hydrogen particles lying on the
visual line in a Geissler's tube agree with the analogous quanti
ties at those places in the chromosphere the spectrum of which
corresponds with that of the Geissler's tube.
   It was shown above, in relating Wüllner's experiments, that in
general an increase of temperature operates in the same direction,
in relation to the widening of lines in the hydrogen-spectrum,
as an increase of density.    So long, therefore, as the magnitude
of the effect of each of these two causes by itself is not more ex
actly known, it would be conceivable that the same appearance
of the spectrum may take place with different values of the tem
perature, if the corresponding values of the density and thickness
are present.    But if one reflects on the considerable brightness
of the lines which in the chromosphere, in the immediate proxi
mity of the brilliant margin of the sun, yet stand out distinctly
from the strongly illuminated ground of the spectrum, he will
be compelled to admit that the temperature of the glowing hy
drogen in the chromosphere is at           events not below thatall                                   at

        GENTLEMEN,
   MAX I       trespass on your kind indulgence for a portion of
           your columns to rectify a mistake into which, as it ap
 pears to me, Mr. Proctor has fallen in preparing his work on
 the Moon, recently published, or at least to supply an omission ?
 In his preface he says, “In Chapter III. give amongst other               I
 matters a full explanation of the effects due to the lunar libra
 tions.        I
            have been surprised to find how imperfectly this inter
 esting and important subject has been dealt with hitherto.       In
           I
 fact have sought in vain for any discussion of the subject with
 which to compare my own.”        If Mr. Proctor confines his atten
 tion to the effects (I have italicized the word in my quotation)
 of libration only, the portion of the work which treats of them
 is not entirely original as he would indicate, inasmuch as the
 operation of libration in producing the elliptical motion of the
 point of intersection of the moon’s first meridian and equator
 round the centre of the apparent disk was shown by me in
 Appendix              II.

centre; and this inquiry is perhaps the more important as show

for               of the two librations differ in amount, the circle
      as the values
W E N S is not a true representation of the excursions of the
intersecting point E and W, N and S; so when the greatest
deviation from mean libration occurs, the real path of the inter
secting point on the apparent disk is a wide ellipse, which gra
dually contracts to a narrow ellipse as the epoch of mean libra
tion is approached.    This will be the case proportionally with
every point on the apparent disk, and the displacement will be
in every possible direction and at every conceivable angle with
the centre of the apparent disk. This suggests that by far the
most effective mode of determining positions on the moon's surface
is by measures for points of the first order; for     x'y' represent                let

    For liquids, however, which are violently decomposed by the
air, and especially those in which thick clouds are also formed
(e.g. the zinc compounds of the lower members of the alcohol
radicals), this plan, from the practical impossibility of adjusting
with accuracy to the given mark and the required temperature,
is not so satisfactory as might be desired.
    To suit liquids of this class I have devised the following im
provement upon Regnault’s bottle:–The neck is of as even bore
as possible, and divided into as many equal parts as can        becom
veniently read.        The bottle” actually
employed, which answered perfectly, has
a capacity of 2-6 cubic centims., the neck
being about 3 millims. internal diame
                                                          i
ter and 13 long, divided into half mil
limetres. Just beyond the graduations
the neck is widened somewhat for the
stopper and for pouring in the liquid.
       hen once the water-values      have been          |l
determined for each division on the neck,
it will be seen that it is only necessary to
fill the bottle so that the surface of the
liquid shall fall within the range of the
graduations. Another advantage is that
the contents can be raised or lowered to the
normal temperature, and the volume read off without addition or
subtraction of liquid.
    The half-millimetre divisions of water weighed 5 milligrms.
As it is easy to read to a half of one of these divisions, and with
care to a quarter, the error need not be more than the weight of
liquid equal to one or two milligrammes of water.
    A pipette with a capillary tube will be found convenient for
introducing the liquid; and of course the operation of filling
with liquids of the character of zinc-ethyl should be done in the
absence, as far as possible, of free oxygen.

louring-matter of the Emerald.” By Greville Williams, F.R.S.
    A considerable amount of discussion has taken place at various
times regarding the cause of the colour of the emerald.     Klaproth
concluded from his earlier   analyses that it was due to  iron*;  but
the results of his later experimentst, made after he became aware
of Wauquelin's discovery of the presence of chromium in emeraldst,
confirmed the observations of that chemist.
    From the time of Wauquelin's analyses, the colour of the emerald
 was always regarded as due to the presence of oxide of chromium,
 until the publication of the memoir of Lewy $, who, having burnt
emeralds in oxygen in a similar apparatus to that employed by M.
Dumas in his researches on the atomic weight of carbon, ascertained
 that they contained that element, and concluded that the colour was
 due to the presence of some organic substance.   Lewy also affirmed
 that the deepest-tinted emeralds contained the most carbon. The
 small quantity of chromium contained in emeralds he considered
 to be insufficient to account for the colour. Wöhler and Rose|,
 on the other hand, having exposed emeralds to a temperature equal
 to the fusing-point of copper for one hour without their losing
 colour, and also having fused colourless glass with minute quanti
 ties of oxide of chromium and obtained a fine green glass, consi–
 dered chromium and not organic matter to be the cause of the
colour.
     Boussingault", in the course of an investigation of the “moral
lons”**, arrived at the  same conclusion as Wöhler and Rose; and
although admitting them to contain carbon, denied that it was the
cause of their colour, inasmuch as they endured heating to redness
for one hour without loss of colour. This result has been confirmed
by Hofmeisterft, who found that an emerald endured a red heat
for hours without destruction of the colour, except at the edges,

bulb of F, and after half an hour in the second bulb : finally, a
decided precipitate was obtained; it was collected, washed, and on
analysis proved to be carbonate of calcium.      The experiment was
repeated in a modified manner several times.            It having been
found that a faint   turbidity in the lime-water was sometimes ob
tained before the addition of the beryl, it was traced to the pre
sence of minute quantities of organic matter in the chromate and
sulphuric acid. To eliminate this source of error, the chromate
and acid were mixed at the commencement of the operation, and
the current of air was kept up until every trace of carbonic anhy
dride was removed; at this point the beryl was added, and the
effect noted. The results, both with emeralds and the beryl A, how
ever, were always precisely the same.
   The apparatus was then recharged; and when half an hour's pas
sage of the air produced no milkiness in F, 5 milligrammes of char
coal were introduced into D; in two minutes the first bulb, and in
four minutes                 all
                  the bulbs were rendered milky.

   In working on such minute quantities, it is not easy to speak
with certainty as to the proportion of hydrogen contained in eme
ralds and beryls which is not due to the water present; and the
difficulty is increased by the fact, insisted upon by Boussingault”,
that these stones do not give off all their water below a red heat.

       be considered permissible, which    cannot admit, to calculate    I
the  hydrogen   on the principle   of deducting the water found on
ignition in a crucible from that formed during the combustion in
oxygen, and then calculating the percentage of hydrogen on the
difference, as Lewy has done, the results would be as follows:–

         ON THE EFFECTs                   of FUSION           UPON EMERALDS AND BERYLs.
   On the Effects of Fusion upon Opaque Beryls.-In order to study
the effects of fusion upon beryls or emeralds,     found it necessary               I
to use the    oxyhydrogen   blowpipe.      Beryls and emeralds were
amongst the numerous substances fused with this instrument by
Clarke * as long ago as 1816.      He states that the Siberian beryl
fuses to a clear  glass containing   bubbles. The Peruvian emerald
he found to melt very easily to a round, extremely beautiful bead
free from bubbles; it lost                     its
                                green colour, and became like    white                                      a
sapphire.
   My first experiments were made upon the beryl A;           weighed                                  it
62.54 grms., and its density was taken with great care previous                                                       to
fusion.          In
             the first experiment the whole crystal was suspended
from the balance-pan, and weighed          water;    the second    in
                                                                  few                   in                   a

The coal-gas having been lighted and the oxygen turned on, the
beryl at once begins to melt, and froths or, rather, boils violently.
By careful regulation of the supply of oxygen, the boiling entirely
disappears;    but the slightest excess of oxygen causes it to be
renewed.    This property of oxygen, which is found to occur with
other substances besides beryls and emeralds, I hope to study in
greater detail.    Having so adjusted the flame that the beryl fuses
tranquilly, and is yet at the exact point of maximum heat             the                                  (if

   The beryls have, therefore, lost nine per cent. of their density in
passing from the crystalline to the vitreous state.
    I  was desirous of carefully comparing this loss of density under
gone by beryls with that of rock-crystal fused under the same
circumstances.          According to an experiment quoted by Forbes",
the specific gravity of quartz of undoubted aqueous origin, and also
of quartz from granites, is 2:6, and that of rock-crystal, fused before
the oxyhydrogen blowpipe to an amorphous glass, 2-2. According
to the experiment ...}. Royer and Dumast, the specific gravity
of rock-crystal determined at 4° in vacuo was 2.652. The value
found by the Austrian Commission was 2.651223f.                                 I  have repeated
with great care the determination of the specific gravity of rock
crystal, both before and after fusion, with the annexed results:—

     Conclusions.—The evidence given in this paper, showing that co
 lourless beryls may contain as much carbon as the richest-tinted
 emerald, taken in conjunction with the ignition experiments, and
 the results of the fusion of chromic oxide with colourless beryls and
 with an artificial mixture of the same composition, leaves me no
  room to doubt the correctness of Wauquelin's conclusion, that the
 green colour of the emerald is due to the presence of chromic oxide.
     The fact that emeralds and beryls lose density when fused
 cannot properly be cited as proving that they have been made in
 nature at a low temperature; for it is quite possible that they were
 crystallized out of a solution in a fused mass, originally formed at
 a temperature high enough to keep the constituents of the emerald
 in a state of fusion, and that the crystals developed themselves du
 ring a slow process of cooling or evaporation. The method employed
 by Ebelmen” for the artificial production of chrysoberyl, namely
 heating alumina, glucina, and carbonate of calcium with boracic acid
 in a porcelain furnace until a portion of the menstruum had eva
 porated, yielded crystals of the true specific gravity, showing the
density of minerals to be less dependent on the temperature at
which they are produced than upon their crystalline or amorphous
state.
    One crystalline gem (the ruby) has undoubtedly been produced
 in nature at a high temperature.                           I
                                            have frequently repeated
Gaudin'st experiment on the artificial formation of this stone, and
can confirm most of his results. I did not, however, find the densit
to be quite the same as that of the native ruby or sapphire, whic
 is,    different specimens, from 3:53

colour of the gem, is not effected at low or even moderately high
temperatures, but requires a heat as high as that of the oxyhydrogen

of the Moray Firth, in the counties of Caithness, Sutherland, Ross,
Cromarty, and Elgin. The preservation of these is shown to be
entirely due to the operation of faults of enormous magnitude, which
have let down the Mesozoic strata against the various Palaeozoic
rocks.   Owing to an insufficient examination of the palaeontological
evidence, much misconception has hitherto prevailed concerning the
geological age of most of these patches; but a careful study of their
faunas enables us to reconstruct an almost unbroken history of the
Triassic and Jurassic periods in the north of Scotland; while even
concerning the Cretaceous much important evidence is afforded by
the boulders, which abound in the drifts.
   The Keuper is represented by the Reptiliferous Sandstone and the
overlying calcareous rocks; the Rhaetic by conglomerates in Suther
land, and probably elsewhere by estuarine beds, which are now,
however, only preserved in great boulders.

   The following communication was read:—
   “On the Glaciation of Ireland.” By J. F. Campbell, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author stated that almost the whole of the surface of Ireland
consists of glaciated rocks less or more weathered, or well preserved.
The polished surfaces are covered in low grounds with drift. Boulder
clay, unstratified, is next to the rock; sands and gravels and peat
bogs are above the clay. The solid rocks have been greatly worn
away since the formation of the Antrim basalt; the drift since the
Glacial period. The hills and hollows in the rocks are the result of
wearing and “denudation;” the débris is the “drift” partially
rearranged.
   This was shown by examples in:—1st, chalk and basalt in Antrim;
2nd, mountain-limestone &c. in Sligo; 3, older rocks about Valentia
and the south-west; 4, granites and metamorphic rocks in Donegal
and the north-east.         The effect of the Atlantic on cliffs at Slieve
Liag in Donegal, and elsewhere on the Irish coast, was noticed.
   It was shown from these large coast-sections that the upper surface
now has no relation to the older contortion, fracture, and folding of
these disturbed and faulted rocks, which lie under newer and less
crumpled beds, up to the peat. The probable dimensions of the ice
engines which worked on the surface of Ireland was shown by com
parison of glaciers in Iceland, Norway, and elsewhere, with the Irish
marks, which indicate ice of equal size. Beginning with the smallest
and rising to larger systems, Irish marks indicate ice of equal
dimensions, till horizontal grooves at 2000 feet above the sea indicate
ice more than 2000 feet thick, moving over Ireland into the Atlantic
in a south-westerly direction.         It was shown that the ice at      max its
imum probably extended from the Polar Basin                   Cape Clear.
                                                                  to                    In

Finland, and the United States, were shortly noticed. The question
whether these extensive tracks were made                     by
                                                          glaciers        ice

Ireland, as I believe. Rivers and weathering have done little to
obliterate the tool-marks of ice and the sca since the end of the

        ON SOLUTION         OF NITRATE OF NICKEL AS AN ABSORPTION
                        PREPARATION.   BY DR. H. EMSMAN N.
        MONG the colour-spectra exhibited by coloured liquids, that of
       the beautiful apple-green solution of nickel in nitric acid ap
pears to me especially worthy of notice.      Having filled a hollow
prism with this solution,                    I
                             found that the terminal colours (red and
violet) in the spectrum were absorbed. This was new to me; but
in Mousson's Physik auf Grundlage der Erfahrung this peculiarity
of the solution of nitrate of nickel is cited as a thing known.
   Now, while with most coloured liquids the colour results as a
mixture of             all
                the spectral colours under the predominance     that                                           of

                  of                                                    the red                      of
and the violet.     This fluid    therefore particularly well adapted and
                                                  is

 A   REM ARKABLE INTERFERENCE-PHENOMENON                                           OBSERVED BY
                         M. seku L16.
I     was sitting one evening opposite    looking-glass.   Happening
                                                            to  a

            As tobacco was being smoked in the room, at first be
lieved that the smoke had produced a similar phenomenon as slightly
moist air when it forms a halo round the moon or the sun, and that
in consequence of this the appearance was seen.          I could not, how
ever, perceive those halos round the flames, either in the looking
glass or in the air.      Abandoning the attempt to fathom the cause,
I   occupied myself with the phenomenon itself, and perfectly recog:
nized it as a phenomenon of interference, because the streaks widened
as the angle of reflection increased.      In the observation the flame
images and the image of the eye had the following position            :-
     A is the image of the eye, L, that
of the petroleum-flame before the
looking-glass,     L,  that of a second

 candle   burning   on the table. The       A
interference-streaks at L, and       L,
 are represented in their situation.
 As the phenomenon was observed in
a public place, where there were             2%
 many other glasses and lights,        I
 could not pursue the matter further;
 but   I resolved to repeat the experiment at home or in my study.
                 I
 To this end, placed opposite to the looking-glass in my room, at
 about 6 metres distance, a petroleum-lamp;        I then took a stearine
 candle in my hand, and so endeavoured to get the position which             I
 had had in the first observation.      After looking from several differ
 ent points, and shifting the candle several times,         I at length re
 marked faint streaks round my chin; on further moving backwards
 and forwards, the streaks were very beautifully developed, but not
  so brilliant as on the first occasion.     I now noted the             1,
  position. L, was the light of the petroleum-lamp, L,
                                                                         e
  that of the candle, and A the eye (of course seen in the
                                                                 .A.
  glass).    The streaks attained the greatest intensity e
  when L, was situated exactly under L, and A was to
  be seen a little sidewards between the two.     The streaks
  widened out above      L-not    nearly as about a slit, but
  quite uniformly around the flame, so that it seemed to
  have no further influence on the streaks than to illumi
                                                                     %
  nate them. The flames were now left in their position, the glass
  taken down and carefully wiped and hung up again in the same
  place. The streaks were again visible.       I had then carefully to      in
  vestigate whether dampness adhering to the glass, or particles of
  dust, called forth the phenomenon; for       I could not derive it from
  the laws of refraction and reflection in the clean mirror.           I next
  dusted the mirror with lycopodium in such manner that around the
  light-images splendid halos appeared. The marked position was
  then taken, from which gorgeous interference-streaks were to be
  seen; nay, they arose not merely around the lower, but also around

result was a coloured picture of crossing waves, than which none
more beautiful can be imagined.         It was exactly, in form, like that
which ensues when two stones are thrown upon the surface of still
water; but it is distinguished by the magnificence of                  colours.                         its

         blown against any hard body, rapidly wear it away—that
it acts in what may be called a systematic and not merely in a
casual manner (that is to say, each grain produces        effect, and           its
not merely one grain here and there just scratches the surface)—
that the material         of
                      the sand      not necessarily harder than the

 338                   Prof. O. Reynolds on                              the    Action of a Blast of
  penetrate or fracture the body it strikes, or will itself be frac
  tured, is a matter of such common experience, and may in some
  cases be so simply explained, that we have so far contented our
- selves with the simple explanation, and have not endeavoured to
  distinguish between the different cases which occur. Up to the
  present time the laws of impact have been considered mainly
  with reference to the motion of the centres of gravity of the
  bodies, and very little attention has been paid to what actually
  occurs at the point of contact.       Hence it is that the fact which
  it is my object in this paper to point out has been so far over
  looked. This        that           is,

I formulated   my view of the cause of the eruptive protuberances,
and their connexion with the spots and faculae, as follows”:-
   “The eruptive protuberances are produced by differences between
the pressure of a quantity of gas enclosed in or absorbed by the
liquid, and the external pressure of the atmosphere increased by
the cohesion and weight of the upper layers of the liquid.
   “Accordingly eruptive protuberances will most readily arise
in those places where the pressure to be overcome is the least,
most rarely or not at       where this pressure all   the greatest.                       is

          at                                  as
                           every descending current augments                                                            it.
Now,       as   in
             the environs    the spots there are strong ascending
                                                 of
currents and      like manner the faculae are occasioned
                          in                                 currents                                 by
of  the same kind, these places must       peculiarly favourable for   be
the development        eruptive protuberances”t.

clouds in the penumbra a somewhat darker background becomes
visible than in the other parts of the solar surface. Hereby is
explained the less brightness of the penumbra in general, as well
as the reversal of the relative brightness of the spectral lines
which has often been observed in it and at its boundaries. A
more precise reason for this phenomenon is obtained from the
above-cited experiment of Kirchhoff, and from the causes, fully
discussed in the description of                              by

determination         by

The rays sent out by the wires were divided into two groups by
the employment of a red and a green glass; and the variations
of intensity of each were determined separately.           The red glass

sorbed those from the red end            the same line.   toAccordingly,
for the intensities employed, the two glasses were nearly comple

to pass through Nicol's prisms the sections of which are per
pendicular to one another, so that the two spectra in the field of
the spectroscope would consist of lights polarized perpendicu
larly one to the other. A Nicol's prism brought into the ocular
of the spectroscope would then alter, according to the known
law, the ratio of intensities of the two spectra proportionally to
the square of the tangent of the angle of rotation. The method
indicated, however, is applicable only on condition that equally
great portions of the apparent surfaces of the bodies to be com
pared send their light into the spectroscope, and also that the
rays from the two bodies do not suffer different degrees of ab
sorption before they enter the slit. The first condition, as
already remarked,      will be satisfied by sufficient apparent
magnitude of the body; the second, on the contrary, will in
general only be realizable for terrestrial substances, because
the light of the heavenly bodies only reaches our apparatus after
the loss of the light absorbed by the atmosphere, and, with the
exception of the sunlight, is radiated from objects of vanishingly
little apparent magnitude.
    To remove this limitation of the method, may briefly remark         I
as follows.    Suppose that in the field of view of the above-men
tioned  apparatus  there are two spectra close together, the light
of which is emitted from bodies at different distances, and the
rays from which on their way to the spectroscope undergo differ
ent degrees of absorption.    So long as the latter is not elective

  XLIV.       On the Vibrations of Approximately Simple Systems.                             ..

   HE     meaning of the words “approximately simple” in the
        above title will be most easily explained by an example.
Suppose that the “system” is a perfectly flexible string stretched
between two fixed points.    If the longitudinal density is uniform,
the problem of determining the vibrations can be thoroughly
.
solved.    We know that in each of the fundamental modes the
string vibrates as a curve of sines, and that the periods form a
harmonical progression.     These fundamental modes of vibration
       coexist; and we know how to determine their amplitudes
and phases so as to suit arbitrary initial circumstances.        But
when the density of the string varies from point to point, the
solution of the problem cannot in general be effected; for it de
pends on a differential equation which has hitherto proved intrac
table.    The question arises whether, when the string is nearly
uniform, an approximate solution cannot be obtained which shall
be correct so far as the first power of the deviation from uni
formity.     In this case the system may be called approximately
 simple, in the sense that a small alteration would make it simple,
 and bring it within the domain of exact analysis. The object of
 the present paper is to show that such cases admit of a perfectly
general treatment by means of Lagrange's method of generalized
coordinates.                                                          --
   Since the vibrations are supposed to occur in the neighbour.
hood of a configuration of stable equilibrium, and to be infinitely
small, the potential and kinetic energies are expressed by homo
geneous quadratic functions of the coordinates and velocities.

  W. Formation       of the Continental Plateaua and Oceanic De

                                                I
IN ofmythe papers of 1846 and 1847       attributed the formation
             great plateaux called continents, and of the oceanic
depressions, to unequal contraction, observing that the oceanic
crust, by being the later in consolidation, became more depressed
through the continued contraction than the already firm or less
contracting continental crust. The steps in the process      pro         I
pose now to consider, as a means of further elucidating the
subject.
                     1. Unequal contraction a fact.
   The fact of unequal contraction is manifest from the inequa
lity of level that exists over the sphere, dividing it into oceanic
depressions and continental plateaux; and unequal contraction
(the material of the crust being essentially the same over the two
kinds of regions) implies an unequal rate of cooling. Moreover
it is a necessary conclusion that the great areas first consolida
ting should have been first free from that chemical activity and
those ebullition-like movements due to escaping vapours which
are inseparable from the fluid condition of rocks under merely
atmospheric pressure.
                  2. Location of the continental areas.
   The areas first to become quiet, and first to cool and consoli
date, would be the shallowest areas—that                  is,
                                                   those beneath

face; for this approach     the surface would have been favoured
 by the chemical quiet, and the less depth would ensure more
rapid cooling.

366             Prof.   J.   D.   Dama on some Results       of
tuents one or more of the iron-bearing minerals (augite, horn
blende, and chrysolite, and often also magnetite), and are divided
into two groups—the doleritic, containing pyroxene, and the sye
mitic, containing hornblende in place of pyroxene.
     The latter comprise those mostly (seldom wholly) free from
these iron-bearing minerals, as the trachytic and granitic kinds.
     (d) The presence of quartz among the chief constituent mine
rals of the true crust is not certain.        Of the above-mentioned
rocks, the basic iron-bearing (or doleritic) kinds are far the most
abundant among acknowledged igneous rocks; and this fact
seems to indicate that quartz or free silica was not abundant in
the original liquid rock of the globe.         Its absence, which Mr.
Hunt urges, is seemingly opposed by the fact that it is present
in so many trachytes, as well as in syenite and granite and the
related rocks.     But Hunt is right in holding that in general
granite and syenite (the quartz-bearing syenite) are undoubtedly
metamorphic rocks where not vein-formations, as I know from
the study of many examples of them in New England; and the
veins are results of infiltration, through heated moisture, from
the rocks adjoining some part of the opened fissures they fill.
These rocks, although common, present therefore no positive
testimony on the side of the presence of quartz.              Mr. Hunt
urges, in support of his opinion, the experiment of Rose, in
which fused quartz on cooling had the low density and other
characters of the form of silica called opal, and not those of
quartz. But the evidence is inconclusive, since a laboratory
experiment cannot inform us what would be the condition of
 silica on cooling from fusion, provided the process of solidifica
tion took some millions of years.         But Rose's experiment does
 seem to settle the   question   as  regards      all
                                                  quartz veins, since,       if
of   igneous origin, their little width would have ensured compa
 ratively rapid cooling; and       thus sustains the evidence
                                   it                                   in

of   the view that such veins, like most mineral veins, were filled

 soda species, Labradorite and oligoclase.          Granite and syenite

likely to have been formed over the earth's surface after the
action on the crust of the foul atmospheric vapours that settled
upon it as it began to solidify.  If there were mainly doleritic
material and other Labradorite mixtures in that crust, the
result of the conflict would be a removal of part of the bases
and the liberation of silica, making free quartz and quartz
bearing rocks.
   Again, the general fact that the doleritic rocks, and even most
trachytic, contain disseminated grains of uncombined oxide of
iron in the form of magnetite (Fe"O"), adds to the strength of
the argument against the general diffusion of quartz (that                                                        is,

                                    In
age was its earliest.    Now, since these great iron-ore beds are                                                of
sedimentary               or
                 marsh accumulation (for they occur interstrati
fied with  quartzite,  chlorite, schist, syenitic schist, and other
metamorphic rocks), the iron was gathered from the preexisting
crust-rocks; they therefore prove that iron was        very common                       a

   (f) We hence have reason for the inference that the original
fused material contained largely the ingredients           the iron                            of

           4.    Change         of Density and Volume in Solidification.
     Allthe rocks above mentioned have a higher density in the
solid state than when in fusion. According to Delesse”, gra
nite decreases in density in passing from the stone to the glass
conditiont 9 to 11 per cent. ; syenite, syenitic granite 8 to 9
per cent. ; diorite 6 to 8 per cent. ; dolerite and melaphyre 5 to
7 per cent.; basalt and trachyte 3 to 5 per cent. The difference
in volume is thus large between a rock in the solid and glass
states. As to the difference between the glass and liquid states,
we have no precise observations, and only know that it is ex
ceedingly smallf.
   From the above facts, sustaining the nearly total absence of
quartz-bearing rocks from the crust, and therefore of granite or
syenite, and the other considerations presented, we may take 8 per
cent. as the probable average change of density for the earth's
crust between the stony and the liquid states; which is equivalent
to a change of volume from 100 to 92 per cent. in passing from
the liquid to the stone condition.
         5. Process of Solidification and Continent-making.
   The crust over the areas of solidification, after attaining a
thickness that would enable it to overcome by                  gravity the                          its
cohesion         in
                the  liquid   rock  beneath,    would sink          masses                                in
and then             be
                 remelted                        by
                                 the heat beneath, and this remelt
ing would cool somewhat the liquid layer.                     this process                      So

                                      forward until the masses could

resistance from viscidity) they would sink.   It may be that

 add to the solidifying material.                                                                 -

     I findno explanation in the present state of science where
fore most of the dry land of the globe should have been located
about the north pole, and of the water about the south.          Physi
cists say that it indicates greater attraction, and therefore a greater
density, in the solid material beneath the southern ocean.         But
why the mineral ingredients should have been so gathered about
the south pole as to give the crust there greater density is the
           j,
unanswered query.         It may be that magnetite is much more
abundantly diffused through the antarctic crust than the arctic.
This is       one of many possibilities, and it is at present with
out a satisfactory fact to stand upon, beyond the general truth
that iron was universally present.

874.    On   some Results   of the Earth's Contraction from Cooling.
    (7). That the locus of the region of subsidence on a conti
mental border was in general along side of a region of thickly
stiffened unyielding continental-crust, and that pressure against
the stable area beyond was one source of the catastrophe of
mountain-making.
   (8) That each epoch of plication and mountain-making ended
in annexing the region upturned, thickened and solidified, to
the stiffer part of the continental crust, and that consequently
the geosynclinal that was afterward in progress occupied a
parallel region more or less outside of the former, either land
ward or seaward, and commonly the latter.
  (9) The principle adopted from LeConte, that the bottom of
a geosynclinal becomes weakened as subsidence and surface sedi
mentary accumulations go forward, through the access of heat
from below or the rise of the isogeotherms (the change of level
in a given isothermal plane having been seven miles in the Appa
lachian region), and that this in an important degree has made
possible the catastrophe from which synclinoria have resulted.
   (10) That while igneous eruptions and metamorphism have
each attended the formation of synclinoria, still in cases where
the plication was greatest the igneous eruptions have been least
in amount or absent; and that the most extensive igneous erup
tions have taken place on continental borders after the crust
had become too much stiffened to bend freely before the lateral
pressure.
   (11) That in the upturning and plication attending moun
tain-making the heat from the transformation of the motion was
sufficient (in connexion with other heat from a rise of the iso
geotherms due to previous surface-accumulations) to cause
metamorphism,       and also the pasty fusion which obliterates                  all
stratification and gives origin         granite, and which may fill
                                         to

forward, through the rise of the isogeotherms, and that “this in an
important degree has made possible the catastrophe from which
synclinoria have resulted,” is attributed (p. 374) to Professor
   Conte. I should have credited to Professor T. Sterry Hunt the
idea of the weakening of the bottom of a geosynclinal in the man
ner stated. To this idea Professor LeConte added the view that,
through such a weakening, lateral pressure from the earth’s
contraction (a force not appealed to in Professor Hunt’s hypo
thesis) was enabled to produce the catastrophe referred to ; and
this is the important principle adopted from his memoir.—J.D.D.]
  XLVII. On the “Black Drop" in the Transit of Venus.
 By T. K. ABBott, M.A., Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin”.
Th;          recent discussion      in the British Association respecting
        the “black drop” observed in the transit of Venus,                      in
duces me to send you an account of a simple experiment which
furnishes a very striking illustration of that phenomenon, and
may be considered as affording an experimental proof that the
moment       of formation of the “drop" is the moment of optical
contact.      A
              common penknife and a threepenny piece (the
thinner the better), or any two even edges, provided one is
curved, constitute a sufficient apparatus.     Bring the two edges
into contact and hold them between the eye and a tolerably
bright light, such as the flame of a candle, or better a lamp
globe, or even a window.     At the moment of actual contact the
edges appear to be, not touching, but joined by a short liga
ment, precisely as in the case of the transit.      It is necessary
that the eye be so  adjusted  that the point of contact shall be the
point of most distinct vision; otherwise the ligament will appear
longer but less distinct, and crossed by one or more short dark
lines. If a coin with a milled edge be used, or a torn edge of
paper &c., an appearance like Baily’s beads is presented.           It
is easy to arrange the objects in such a manner that they can be
fixed at any required distance from each other short of actual
contact; and it will be found that the ligament is not formed
until contact (actual or optical) occurs.       Indeed it is only ne
cessary to bring the fore finger and thumb together and hold
them up to the light in order to observe the phenomenon; but
it is less easy in this case to determine when optical contact oc
curs.         is,
         It however, easier “fix” the eye
                                      to             the fingers than

  2. The object of his second memoir"                                   is (I.) to furnish an
additional number of facts by observers of                              repute bearing on the
subject in hand (for which the author is                                in great measure in
debted to the Royal Society's Catalogue                                 of Scientific Papers),
(II.) to meet certain objections that have been advanced against
the theory, and (III.) to supply a few more experimental proofs.
   3. In noticing the more remote facts, which are for the most
part stated by Professor Van der Mensbrugghe in a very brief
form,     I
         must on several occasions enlarge considerably, since my
own labours, begun so long ago as 1838, have in some cases
anticipated more recent results. Many of my experiments have
been already given in the two papers referred to above (see note'),
so that in the present communication                           I
                                          shall endeavour as far as
possible to avoid repetition.
   4. And first as to the additional facts, omitting mere guesses,
such as that of San Martino”, who, in 1793, attributed the mo
tions of camphor to electrical action, we come to Sir H. Davy",
who, in 1802, noticed that fragments of acetate of potash (then
called acetite) move on the surface of water somewhat after the
manner of camphor.       The more irregular fragments rotate most
quickly, whence it is concluded that the shifting of the centre of
gravity had something to do with the phenomena, while the
rectilinear movements were attributed to currents descending
from the salient points of each fragment and so producing on it
unequal pressures.
    5. Carradori, in 1805, noticed” that when a large drop of the
milky juice of a euphorbiaceous plant is placed on the surface
of water in a large vessel, a portion of the drop spreads, while
another portion descends in threads which accumulate at the
bottom.        If,
              then, the vessel    inclined     be    spill some    so
                                                                    the as   to                   of
water and           so
                renew the   surface,      returning      on
                                                     the vessel      its                              to
first position the agitation will cause some      the milky filaments   of
to  rise    the surface, where they spread like the first portion.

378               Mr. C. Tomlinson                      on the     Motions of Camphor
“superficial attraction” (attrazione di superficie), which Dutro
chet afterwards developed into the “epipolic force” (force épi
 olique).
   # In 1819 Barlocciº covered fragments of camphor with gold
leaf, and found that they did not move on the surface of water.
The idea was that by preventing the formation of vapour, Wen
turi’s theory, which attributed the motions to the escape of
vapour, would be supported.       It is further stated that perfect
cubes of camphor do not move on the surface of water, on account
of their perfect symmetry.       This, however, is a mistake which
several observers have fallen  into;  and we suspect that the cutting
and   shaping and  handling   of the camphor so as to confer upon
it a geometrical form made it dirty, and that this was really the
cause of     want its motion.   of   have frequently placed beauti

perties of camphor pointed out by Mr. Lightfoot, and from which
he derives his well-written explanation of the cause of these mo
tions when he says, “the water upon which it floats, being ca
pable of diffusing this vapour more readily in certain directions
of the crystalline axis, thereby removes sufficient vapour-pressure
at these points for the opposite side to drive about (by recoil)
the nicely suspended particle.’”
   10. In my reply to Mr. Trachsel",      state that nearly two        I
years before        I
               had pointed out the more rapid solution of cam
phor on a broken than on a natural surface, and also that the
vapour theory was three quarters of a century old. It was first
started by Volta in 1787, adopted by Prevost in 1799 under the
term jet gazeur, and is now being revived without any experi
mental basis being provided for                            it.

some flies that had been drowned in the oil.       These flies pre
sently began to move, and turned round on the water very ra
pidly as if they were vigorously alive.” The experiment was
repeated before Dr. Franklin, who says, “To show that it was
not any effect of life recovered by the flies, imitated it by little                   I
bits of oiled chips   and paper cut in the form of a comma of the
size of a common fly, when the stream of repelling particles
issuing from the point made the comma turn round the contrary
way.” The Doctor adds that “this is not a chamber experiment;
for it cannot well be repeated in a bowl or dish of water on a
table.” The reason for this is want of chemical purity in the
bowl or dish. The effect may be well shown in a clean glass 5
or 6 inches in diameter, by moulding small coracles of paper on
the rounded end of a glass rod, pouring into one of these coracles
a few drops of a volatile oil, and placing it on the surface of
water.   The paper-comma experiment is sometimes referred to
as originating with the brothers Weber; but in truth their
labours added nothing to the subject, nor does it appear that
they intended to do more than glance at          They      not settle              it.                   do

382             Mr. C. Tomlinson                         on the     Motions           of Camphor
nied by volleys of minute globules which extend to the edge of
the water in radial lines. Other similar cases of essential oils
might be cited; and even in the case of solid fats the evidence
of a thin invisible film covering the surface and arresting the
camphor motions, seemed to be irresistible before the promulga
tion of the surface-tension theory.     A stick of common mottled
soap, or of tallow or lard, lowered into a large surface of water
previously dusted over lightly with lycopodium powder, instantly
clears away a large circular space (extending nearly to the edge
of the glass). This effect is much more satisfactorily explained
on the surface-tension theory than on the existence of a thin
invisible film.   But in the case of oils, whether volatile or fixed,
it must be considered that a much greater tensile force is ex
erted in spreading some oils than others. When a film formed by
a drop of a volatile                   oil
                          nearly covers the surface       the water,                             of

384          Mr. C. Tomlinson                 on the   Motions       of Camphor
    19. Considering the mode in which surface-tension acts, it will
naturally be supposed that the motions in question are not con
fined to camphor and a few other solids, nor to creosote and
a few other liquids.     In fact fragments of any body that act by
suddenly lowering the surface-tension at the spot on which they
fall are liable to these camphor motions.     Many salts act in this
                        I
way, the last that have observed being sulphate of aniline.     The
following solids also rotate:—Borneol, naphthol, thymol, nitro
toluol: this was inactive on water at 56°F., but very active on
water at 90°, a crystalline needle sweeping over the surface at
right angles to the length of the crystal. Binitrotoluol on water
at 96°.      Hydrochlorate of toluidin: a crystalline fragment
darted to and fro in short jerks, as if surprised at the novelty of
its situation, and then, accepting the conditions, moved rapidly
                        circular sweeps and quickly disappeared.
                        inin
over the surface
Acetamid behaved           similar manner.
                                a            Lactid and oxamethan
also rotate  rapidly.  Sulphaldehydrotates   rapidly   wide sweeps            in
and soon becomes motionless.                       The same phenomena are exhi
bited   by benzoic anhydride.         Amidobenzoic acid also rotates
rapidly, and quickly disappears; while the crystalline portion                                   of
nitrobenzoic ether sails round and round near the edge, and con
tinues  to   do    for long time.

few drops of valerianic acid poured into water rise to the surface,
go through a variety of contor

observer  that dead matter

endowed with such active mo

formed    this experiment, and
had a    drawing    made of one
stage of the contortions.        If

admits,      as
            established      previous   by
                                        researches,  that “sometimes
two catenaries can       drawn, sometimes only one, and sometimes
                                  be
mone,” and then finds,                  by
                             carrying the investigation further, that
“when two catenaries can                         be
                                  drawn the upper corresponds                                                 to    a

minimum and the lower does not, and that when only one ca
tenary can be drawn it does not correspond to a minimum.”
According to these results it would seem that the problem does
not always admit of a continuous solution. To prove that this
conclusion cannot be true, it suffices to remark that it is possible
to draw through the given points any number of continuous
curves which by revolution about the axis would generate sur
faces of different magnitudes—and that, as the decrement of
magnitude from one surface to the next inferior cannot go on
unlimitedly, a limiting minimum surface must eventually be
reached, the magnitude of which the Calculus of Variations
ought to be capable of determining.      Consequently there must
be some fault or defect in the usual process of solution.       It is
true, as Mr. Todhunter has pointed out, that a discontinuous
solution may be deduced from the equation y=cv/1+p”; for if
c=0, and p be not infinite, y=0, and, c being zero, if p be
infinite y has arbitrary values.   Hence the conditions of the
problem might be satisfied by the two ordinates to the given
points and the portion of the axis of a between them.      But this
discontinuous solution affects in no manner the validity of the
foregoing argument for a continuous solution.
   The difficulty thus encountered will, I believe, be found to be
completely removed by the new process of integration I have
proposed, which rests on the principle that if a differential equa
tion containing         F   and
                                   dF    vanishes when      F=0       and    *=0, an

integral of that equation of an order lower than that of                              F is      an
integral of F-0.     In the present instance the function                             F    is
                                    *——–4–

and it has been shown that the equation (8), which belongs
to any involute of the evolute of the catenary obtained by inte
grating          F=0, is    satisfied    if F=0   and
                                                           #        =0.   Consequently,
 bythe rule just stated, such involute     integral   is   an              of   F=0,        and
may     employed for solving the proposed problem.

above enunciated.
   The history of the various attempts that have been made to
solve this problem is very instructive relatively to the principles
of the Calculus of Variations, especially as regards the distinc
tion between continuous and discontinuous solutions. With
respect to the principle of discontinuity, it may first be remarked
that the integral of the equation designated as M=0 in Mr.
Todhunter’s work (the same that                             I
                                         have usually called A=0)
may either give one line, or two or more lines.         But in such
cases there will be, according to Algebraic Geometry, a factor
corresponding to each line, and the answer to the question may
be given by parts of lines terminating at points where two lines
cross each at finite angles of inclination.   This is the case in the
              I
solution gave of the Problem of the Brachistochronous course
of a Ship, which is considered by Mr. Todhunter (Chap.                                                   I.,
art. 12)      to      be

that the connecting curve joins on to the ordinates continuously.
The discovery of this discontinuous solution, which differs in kind
from that discussed above, is due to Mr. Todhunter.
   We have not, however, as yet arrived at a solution which gives
a single continuous curve joining the given points—although,
from considerations exactly like those adduced in the case of the
preceding problem, it is certain that such a solution exists.
The difficulty, as in that case, is overcome by employing the
proposed new method of integration, which in the present in
stance consists in first deducing from the equation          the dif                         (8)

scendant importance in the economy of intellectual effort, an
answer is imperatively required.   Moreover, as in every science
the same demand      springs up, how vast must be the interests
concerned, how great the value of a right response !
   The question stated presupposes that a deficiency or a require
ment does actually exist—in other words, that the science from
which the question comes in some respect differs from the general
scientific level. Now in Part I. of these papers+, I pointed out
what is the universal criterion of progress—namely, “the most
general idea existing at a given time as a factor in every branch
of science.”   My position may be illustrated by an experimental
usage.    Suppose a phenomenon has to be observed by reading
off a number; this is done, not once, but many times, and the
average result is calculated.  The average is certainly more va
luable than either of the observations taken singly; and, if these
are regarded as combining towards an end, it is contained to a
greater or less extent in each of them.   The idea of pure motion
is asserted to be the mean or general idea sought.     I now pro
pose to explain more fully in what sense this assertion is made,
and to discuss more at large than was possible in Parts II. and
 III. the nature of the criterion itself.
                                                                                         to its
   The general nature of the criterion establishes           universal
applicability.   But address myself more especially

                              f
it humorously, the sport is rather at the expense of his auditors’
intelligence than concerning his subject. Herakleitos pointed out
the illusory nature of the seeming permanence or stationary condi
tion of things: “everything moves, and nothing remains,” he said.
The flowof a river is an apt illustration of the fleeting nature of the
world; in which,indeed, the only reality is the act of transition, or
the “becoming;” not inception and results, but process. In the
instant of “becoming” he conceives the contrary determinations
of being and not-being united,—a notion which Professor Ferrier
has beautifully illustrated by the well-known geometrical expla
nation of two opposite forces combining in a continuous curvi
linear path. The sophists, especially Protagoras, applied this
doctrine, though not with the highest success, to justice and
morals, chiefly in the interest of the freedom of the individual
will. In the Aristotelian philosophy, the conditions of nature
are summed up as motion, space (the possibility of motion), and
time (the measure of motion); but, in Aristotle, the idea becomes
less pure, is circumscribed with limits in the detail, and loses in
elasticity and vigour. The same is true of the Epicureans; but
it formed the latent basis of their philosophy, as likewise of the
Skepticism of every age.
    In much more modern times, the idea of motion was most
distinctly grasped by Hobbes, as may be seen by referring to his
“Humane Nature,” 2nd edition (1650), from which work I have
taken the following statements.      “That the Subject wherein

Colour and Image are inherent, is not the Object or thing seen.
That there is nothing without us (really) which we call an Image
or Colour.     That the said Image or Colour is but an apparition
unto us of the motion, agitation or alteration which the Object
worketh in the Brain, or spirits, or some internal substance of
the head. That as in Vision, so also in conceptions that arise
from the other Senses, the subject of their inherence is not the
 Object, but the Sentient.” (p. 9.)
    Hobbes also says that the reflex stroke from the brain to the
impressing object constitutes our sense of colour, form, sound,
etc.    What is really outside is “motions, by which these seem
ings are caused.” (p. 18.)                                              -

        “Why should not
                      nature take a sudden leap from structure
 to structure? On the theory of natural selection we can clearly
 understand why she should not; for natural selection acts only
 by taking advantage of slight successive variations; she can
 never take a sudden leap, but must advance by short and sure
 though slow steps.”
    “On the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand
the full meaning of that old canon in natural history, “natura
non facit saltum.”     This canon, if we look only to the present
inhabitants of the    world,  is not strictly correct; but if we                                          in

This strange phenomenon of the destruction of a science has
been witnessed by the present generation; it is as rare in human
history as the extinction of a star.
   With regard to other departments of practical philosophy,                                                       I

    Second Edition, Revised and Enlarged.           London: Longmans,

           noticed the first edition of this book, shortly after its pub
 WFlication,       about  a  year and  a half ago (April 1872). There is
therefore no need to say much on the present occasion. The revi
sion to which the work has been subjected consists partly in a change
of arrangement of some of the articles (e.g. the chapter on           La
grange's Theorem, which was Chap. 20 in the first edition, is Chap.7in
the second), partly in the addition of articles here and there through
out the volume (e.g. the articles on Linear Transformation, Nos.
292–294 added to the chapter on Change of the Independent Wa
riable), partly in the insertion of additional Examples.         The total
number of changes is considerable, and the result of the whole
is to increase the volume by 24 pages; still the changes do not make
what can be regarded as a substantial alteration in the work.
It only remains, therefore, to congratulate the author on the rapid
sale of the first edition, and to express a hope that his very useful
book will continue to find many readers.

THE“On        the Effect of Pressure on the Character      of the Spectra
of Gases.”      By  C. H. Stearn and G. H. Lee.
   The variations in the spectra of gases which accompany changes
of density have been studied by Plücker and Hittorf, Frankland
and Lockyer, Wüllner and others.
   It  appears to us that one cause to which these changes may be
due has been overlooked, and that many of the observed variations
are entirely independent of the density of the gas.       If a Leyden jar
be  placed  in the  circuit,  and the current from an induction-coil be
passed through a Plücker's tube containing nitrogen with the traces
of hydrogen generally present, the following well-known pheno
mena are observed.
   When the gas is near atmospheric pressure, the line-spectrum
of nitrogen is brilliant, and the F line of hydrogen is broad and
nebulous.      As the pressure is reduced, the lines of nitrogen gra
dually fade out, and the band-spectrum appears, while at the same

time the F line of hydrogen becomes narrow and well defined.              If
fresh gas be admitted, the line-spectrum reappears, accompanied
by a widening of the F line.
   That these changes are not dependent on the density of the gas,
appears from the following experiment:-
   A sealed tube containing nitrogen, with traces of hydrogen at a
pressure of about 2 millims., was placed before the spectroscope.
A   second tube was connected with the air-pump, and the current
passed through both tubes, a Leyden jar being placed in the circuit.
    When the pressure in the second tube was high, the line-spec
trum of nitrogen appeared brilliantly in the sealed tube, and the F
line was broad and nebulous; as the exhaustion proceeded these
lines faded out, and the F line became narrow, in precisely the same
manner as if the sealed tube had been in process of exhaustion.
The explanation appears to be that the production of the line
spectrum of nitrogen, and the expansion of the F line of hydrogen,
depend entirely on the intensity of the charge communicated to
the Leyden jar. When the pressure of the gas between the elec
trodes is high, the discharge does not take place until the jar is
fully charged; but as the exhaustion proceeds a less and less charge
 is communicated to the jar, and the discharge at last is virtually
not more than that of the simple current.
    The same effect may be produced by interposing a break in the
 circuit, the length of which may be increased as the pressure in the
 tube is reduced.     Plücker and Hittorf appear to have used a break,
 as in their paper  in the Philosophical Transactions, Nov. 1864, they
 speak of the expansion of lines obtained by increasing the charge of
the jar by an interposed stratum of air. They do not, however,
 appear to have noticed that the reduction of pressure in the tube
 was only equivalent to a diminution of the charge of the jar, and
 that to this cause many of the changes of spectra which accompany
 the reduced pressure ought to be ascribed.
    We are continuing our experiments on the effect of temperature
on the spectrum, but prefer to reserve this portion of the subject
 for the present.

series; 2nd, those in which the associated elements varied in each
series.  The following salts were mapped:—
   Pb F., PbCl, Pb Br, Pb L.; Sr F, Sr Cl, Sr Br, Sr I, ;
     Ba F., Ba Cl, Ba Br, Ba I, ; Mg F., MgCl, Mg Br,
     Mg I, ; Na F, NaCl, Na Br, Na I.
The conditions of the experiments are described. The same alu
minium cups, described in the first paper, were used; and the poles
were arranged in such a manner that they could at will be sur
rounded with any gas or vapour.       Hydrogen was used in some of
these  experiments;  it was purified in the usual manner by drying
and  freeing  from traces of  sulphuretted  hydrogen; it was then
passed over clean-cut pieces of sodium, and admitted to the poles.
An induction-spark from 5 one-pint Grove cells was used, the
 circuit being without the Leyden jar.
    The lead compounds behaved (in air) as follows:—
    The fluoride gave the eleven longest lines of the metal; but four
 were very faint.                                               -
    The chloride gave nine lines; one of these was very short.
    The bromide gave six lines; but one was a mere dot on the pole.
    The iodide gave four lines distinctly and two as dots, one of which
 was scarcely visible.
    It is pointed out that the decrease in length and number of
 lines follows the increase in the atomic weight of the non-metallic
 element, the lines dying out in the order of their length.
    Barium was next experimented on, the same series of salts being
 used. A marked departure from the results obtained in the case
 of the lead compounds was observed, especially in the case of the
 fluoride,      its
                spectrum being much the simplest;         factin  consisted
                                                                        it
of  only    lines.
            4         Strontium behaved like barium; and           did mag
                                                                        so

 probably due       the exceedingly refractory nature      these fluorides,

 all   of
        them   being  quite infusible,  and non-volatile   any spark that
 was used.
    Sodic fluoride, sodic chloride, sodic bromide, and sodic iodide
 exhibited     behaviour exactly the reverse
                a                                   that of lead;

                            the metallic  spectrum.

short branch.
     I  have in this way obtained several cubic centimetres of pure
liquid chlorine.      On taking the tube out of the bath, the liquid
chlorine commences spontaneous ebullition, and again condenses on
the charcoal, while the short branch becomes covered with a frost.
     This succession of phenomena can be reproduced, so to say, inde
finitely; and the experiments, easy to perform at public lectures,
permit the audience to observe the various phases.
     Although   I  can only consider my experiments a trial,   I have ex
tended them to the liquefaction of several gases absorbed by the
charcoal when cold and disengaged by a temperature not rising
above 100° C.:—chlorine, ammonia, sulphurous, hydrosulphuric,
 and hydrobromic acids, chloride of ethyle, and cyanogen.             The
 liquefaction of each of these gases can be demonstrated in lectures
 when explaining the history of those bodies.
     Reflecting on the feeble thermic effects ascertained by Pouillet
 when pulverulent mineral matters are soaked with water, oil, alco
 hol, or acetic ether, and on the somewhat greater effects exhibited
 when the same liquids are absorbed by organized substances,             I
 asked myself if we could not succeed in ascertaining pronounced
 thermic effects by placing in contact with cellules of charcoal liquids
 which do not act upon it—water, alcohol, ordinary ether, sulphide
 of carbon, and bromine.
     The experiments exceeded my expectation.          For example, with
 1 part of charcoal and from 7 to 9 parts of liquid bromine, the rise
 of temperature exceeds 30°C., operating on only from 5 to 10
 grammes of charcoal.                                -
     With charcoal well freed from gas, heated and cooled in vacuo,
 the heating due to the imbibition of bromine would doubtless be
 much more considerable.
     The volatile liquids condensed in the pores of the charcoal (bro
 mine, cyanhydric acid, sulphide of carbon, ordinary ether, and
 alcohol) are not expelled, or only partially, by a temperature of
 100° C. at the ordinary pressure.        I  made the experiment with a
 Faraday tube, operating as described for the liquefaction of the
 gases. A tube filled with charcoal saturated with alcohol does not
  permit any to distil at 100°.
      [The tubes were exhibited to the Academy; and with them the
  principal experiments (the liquefaction of chlorine, cyanogen, &c.)
  have been repeated in the laboratory of the Ecole Centrale.
     The condensation of liquid bromine by charcoal, effected upon
 a few grammes, gave rise to a brisk rise of temperature, the mix
 ture passing in a few minutes from 20° to 45°.]—Comptes Rendus de

    NOTE ON THE POSSIBLE EXISTENCE OF A LUNAR ATMOSPHERE.
                              BY E. NEISON, Esq.
      Owing to the many difficulties with regard to the constitution of

412             Intelligence and Miscellaneous    Articles.
the lunar surface involved in an assumption as to the absolute
non-existence of a lunar atmosphere, it would appear of far greater
probability that some such atmosphere, however limited, exists.
Not only, as Dr. De La Rue has remarked, is it difficult to conceive
any chemical formation of matter without an atmosphere, but it is
also difficult to even find matter exhibiting the features and proper
ties of that constituting the lunar surface, which under the known
conditions would not either yield an atmosphere, or require for
formation the presence of substances that would.
   The absolute absence of any atmosphere has never yet been de
monstrated, but only the fact that it does not exceed certain limits,
generally supposed much more restricted than is actually the case.
     consequence it is usually granted that some atmosphere might
exist; it is also assumed that it must be of most extreme tenuity;
and the subject is dismissed as a matter of indifference, without
inquiring whither the admission might carry us, so far as relates
to this atmosphere's power of fulfilling the same purposes as our
own terrestrial one.
   But it would be of interest to ascertain how far this possible
lunar atmosphere might not effect for the lunar surface those
changes &c. that our own does for the terrestrial surface, and
whether in fact it might not amply suffice for maintenance of at
least some form of vegetable life. For the present, however, this
must be deferred.
   The only point restricting the extent of a lunar atmosphere of
the nature supposed appears to be its refractive power, more
especially as shown by the occultation of stars by the moon. Irre
spective of the circumstance that these do not invariably answer
conclusively in the negative, it does not appear to be generally
recognized that we may have an atmosphere whose maximum power
of refraction would not be equal to one second of arc, and yet be of
very considerable amount.         For, of however great tenuity in com
parison with our dense terrestrial atmosphere, it would be in reality
present in large quantity—to be estimated in fact, with regard to
each square mile of surface, by very many thousands of tons.
   There can be but little doubt but such an atmosphere would
exert a very considerable influence on the lunar surface, render
possible the existence of many substances that appear to constitute
a great portion of that surface, and explain many selenographical
observations of great interest that at present appear to point to
some such solution, and thus support the hypothesis of the exist
ence of a definite lunar atmosphere.—Monthly         Notices of the Royal
Astronomical   Society,   June 1873.
  A CONTRIBUTION TO THE HISTORY OF THE HORIZONTAL                  PEN
                       DULUM.      By prof. SAFAkik.
   As it is for the most part only some time after date that get a I
sight of scientific journals that do not treat of my special depart
ment (chemistry),      I first became acquainted recently, through the

                 Intelligence and Miscellaneous                    Articles.                       413
Philosophical Magazine, with M. Zöllner's great memoir “On the
Origin of the Earth's Magnetism, and the Magnetic Relations of
the Heavenly Bodies.”         In § 24 of this (like everything that comes
from M. Zöllner) ingenious and thoughtful treatise, there is a de
tailed account of a new instrument, which in November 1869 had
been brought by M. Zöllner to the notice of the Saxon Royal Society
of Sciences, in a memoir “On a new Method for measuring Attract
ing and Repelling Forces”—which had remained unknown to me.
He proposes to name the new instrument “horizontal pendulum,”
mentioning also that, in 1863, M. Perrot had proposed for the same
purposes, and described in the Comptes Rendus of the Paris Aca
demy, an instrument resting on the same principles.
    It is of high interest, and will certainly interest M. Zöllner to
learn, that, more than a generation since, in Germany his instru
ment was not only described and figured, but also applied to expe
riments, although no particulars of the results are given.
    Singularly, the matter goes back to a man whose name has no
good sound in connexion with the exact sciences, and from whom it
certainly would be least expected—Gruithuisen of Munich.                   feel                I
so much the more obligation to render him this late justice, as seven
years since, in a longer memoir published in the Böhmische Museum
zeitschrift, vol. xxxix., “On the present State of Lunar Investiga
         I
tions,” took the fanciful philosopher of Munich somewhat sharply
to task—in fact, designated him as selenoprotophantast.                   feel                I
 now myself, in somewhat riper years, that this asperity towards one
far advanced in age, and so much my senior, who, with                  his ex           all
travagancies, always proceeded             good faith, was perhaps not

place; and hereby gladly retract, not the substance

will    be read only with surprise.            I
                                       can here intimate only that Gruit
huisen   proposes,   partly,  to sink perpendicular shafts of several
thousand feet    depth,  and  partly to drive horizontal galleries in the
direction of a chord (under the    Alps!  to a length of 15 miles) through
the   ground,   and,  together  with  practical   locomotive purposes, to
apply them to physical-astronomical investigations.          L. c. p. 21, we
read, “But it is moreover incalculable what the astronomer in such
a tunnel, provided with a shaft as dry as possible, for observations
deserving attention, could accomplish.        Common people would set
up a terrible roar of laughter, if told that, under the mountains,
at such depths an excellent observatory could be built, in which to
make observations of a peculiar sort, which would furnish us with
data in the highest degree desirable and to be expected, and a quan
tity of useful data at present unknown, which must supply to both
practical and theoretical astronomy new aids for still greater geo
metrical accuracy and a great number of new results.           To this sub
terranean observatory I will give the name of catachthonic observa
tory or catachthonium.”      Now           I
                                     believe that at the time when the
above was printed others besides merely common people would have
set up a terrible roar of laughter, if they had seen Gruithuisen's
dissertation.
    The chief instruments of the catachthonium were, according to
Gruithuisen, of two kinds:–first, large, accurately turned rings at
the mouths of the shafts, in order on them as on ring micrometers,
from a distance of from 100 to 2000 feet, to observe the transits of
the stars by day also (in consequence of the presumed visibility of
the stars from deep pits), and (p. 22) “to obtain immediately clear
geocentric observations perfectly free from refraction.”    On this it says,
at p. 28, “What even these few instruments could accomplish and
settle in relation to the proper motions of many fived stars, the sol
stice, precession, mutation, aberration, the course of the moon, and the
like, may be expected to be so much the more, as the position of the
most simple instruments must be the most invariable possible, because
here the variations of the temperature are almost =0; so that the
necessary clocks do not require even a compensation-pendulum; and,
besides, there is absolutely nothing present which could be sub
ject to  so much as a slight variation of temperature; wherefore
the place of such an observatory cannot be supplied by any observa
tory above ground, however efficient.”  Here we have Lamont and
Carrington's    subterranean           observatories anticipated     a generation
previously.
    The second principal instrument         of the catachthonium was to
consist of fine plummets suspended on wires from 150 to 1500 feet
in length, in order thereon (according to p. 32) to make “observable
the motion of the earth in       its
                                 orbit,” “and perhaps even the difference
                 velocity                      Namely,     pp.        30     31

on the double difference of the two velocities.    With a plumbline
of  only 10 feet length, Gruithuisen made some observations which
(l.c. p. 33) had been related in his work entitled “Lieblingsobjecte
auf dem Felde der Naturforschung” (Munich, 1817), pp. 69 et seq.,
26, 77, 128.      I
                  have not been able to procure a sight of this work.
In the Analekten, l.c. pp. 33, 34, it says of these observations:—
“In my very first experiments it proved that this instrument
(which   I named   elkysmometer) exhibits effects which depend not on
accidental causes,  but on the actions of the gravity and motion of the
earth and the  increasing  nearness of other large heavenly bodies, which
latter would announce themselves through the plummets so posi
tively and distinctly, even if we had no ebb and flood. The eastern
deviation of the elkysmometer-thread was most striking from 8 to
9 o'clock in the morning . . . . . It was also unmistakable that the
moon exerted an attraction on the elkysmometer, especially in the
morning, when she was just between the sun and the earth.”      Also
the elkysmometer indicated to him “earthquakes, even from other
parts of the world” (l.c. p. 34); and on p. 37 the superiority of
long plumblines to short ones is demonstrated in detail; indeed a
table is given at the end for the reduction of very small sines to arcs
for the sake of observations on very long elkysmometers.
   With the rough arrangements described, there is no doubt that
Gruithuisen's results depended on accidental external disturbances,
and perhaps in part on illusion, as a short calculation is sufficient to
show that, here, plummets would scarcely ever lead to any result.
Only the name proposed by him (&Akvapa = traction, £Akw= draw),                    I
though it is not correctly formed and should have been “helko
meter,” deserves to be adopted.
   But the most remarkable thing        comes last.     In his Neuen Ana
lekten   für Erd- und Himmelskunde, Band i. Heft 1, published at
Munich in 1832 (finished, according to p. 72, “am 27 Juli 1832”),
pp. 39 & 40, there is a memoir entitled, “Ritter Bessel's Experi

LIV.  On Diffraction-Spectrum Photography. By HENRY DRA

  [Illustrated by   a Photograph         (Plate IV.) printed by   the Alberttype
                                         process.]
    HERE    are, as is well known, two methods by which spectra
     may be obtained;—lst, by the action of a prism; 2nd, by a
system of closely ruled lines.   In the latter case it is convenient
to speak of the contrivance employed as a grating, and of the
spectrum as an interference- or diffraction-spectrum.       A casual
inspection shows that there is a great difference between the
spectra produced by these two methods; and close investigation
proves that the diffraction-spectrum is by far the more suitable
for accurate scientific work.   For this reason it has seemed de
sirable to make a trustworthy map of those parts of the diffrac
tion-spectrum which can be photographed on collodion, and to
attach to it a scale for reading the wave-lengths of the rays.
   The Plate (Pl. IV.) accompanying this memoir is from collodion
photographs made by myself, transferred to a thick plate of glass,
the latter process being known as the Alberttype.    For the entire
success of this transfer I am indebted to my friend Mr. E. Bier
stadt, the owner of the patent in America.      The glass is then
used in a   printing-press in the same manner as a lithographic
stone.    The picture is absolutely unretouched. It represents,
therefore, the work of the sun itself, and is not a drawing either
made or corrected by hand.
    It consists of two portions—first, the upper, which gives                      all

 4350 ten-millionths of a millimetre to 3440. Above that is
 placed a scale which is a copy of Angström’s, from just below G.

 are those which       may  have arisen from       mal-adjustment          the                    of
 scale.     The precautions that were taken               avoid such errors to
 will     be
           described.     With      certain correction,

from below G (wave-length 4307) to above O (wave-length 3440),
of about 12 inches (305 metre long).             have succeeded, how           I
ever, in photographing from near b (wave-length 5167) to T
 (wave-length 3032), by resorting to a ruled speculum plane and
a concave speculum mirror; but the photographic and optical
difficulties in securing an enlarged spectrum of that length are
great”.
    Of course in such a research as this an essential is a finely and
evenly ruled plane of glass or other material.           Those which I
have used were made       by  a machine devised and constructed      by
Mr. L. M.       Rutherford,    whose beautiful lunar and       prismatic
spectrum-photographs are so well known to the scientific world.
The plate generally employed is of glass ruled with 6481 lines
to the inch; the ruled part is 1156 inch ('027 metre) long and
1% (0.16 metre) wide. It is unquestionably much more nearly
perfect than similar gratings made by Nobert and others; for
the character of the photographs and the uniformity of the
orders on either side of the normal, together with            behaviour                            its
under      searching examination, show that

tographic part of the operation is the device for avoiding the un
equal action on the sensitive plate of different rays of the spec
trum.    It has been commonly supposed until the recent memoirs
of J. W. Draper, that there are in the spectrum three different
types of force in three different but overlapping regions.    Heat
was supposed to be principally found at the less refrangible end,
light in the middle, and actinism at the more refrangible. But
he showed that this error has partly arisen from using pris
matic spectra, which condense the red end and dilate the violet,
and do not present the rays in the true order of their wave
lengths, and partly from the nature of our ordinary photographic
substances.     He proved that actinism, or the power of chemical
decomposition, does not particularly belong to the violet end of
the spectrum, but is found throughout                whole length.  its But

however, the subject of providing a scale for these diffraction

    The wave-lengths of the ultra-violet rays have never, so far as
I  know, been either determined or published except by         W.                                                J.
Draper in 1844, Mascart in 1866, and Cornu in 1872. J. W.
Draper's memoir has a steel engraving of some of the principal
lines, from which the wave-lengths may be approximately read.

minations of Mascart and Ångström and Thalen differ nearly to
the extent mentioned above. The same remark is true of Äng
ström compared with Ditscheiner, while the difference between
Ångström    and Van der Willigen is more than three times the
amount   necessary to remove my discrepancy.     In any case the
photograph is correct, as it is the work of the sun, and is only
open to errors arising from imperfect flatness in the field of
a fine lens, and that field only subtending an angle of about 4°.
The angular aperture of the lens viewed from the sensitive plate
is 20'. I trust, therefore, that the photograph may be of perma
nent value to physicists; for any one can affix another scale if
this be erroneous.
   An examination of the photographed spectrum shows many
points of interest, some of which are best seen in the spectrum
with the scale above, and some in the portion enlarged below.
The latter is magnified about twice, and comprises the region
from wave-length 8736 to 4205. I have also made photographs
on the same scale as Angström's map, but have not as yet printed
them. The capital letters which are attached to the region
above H are according to the nomenclature of Mascart, although
the wave-lengths assigned by him to those letters do not coin
cide exactly in           all

that is both necessary and attainable.         The diffraction-spectra
of metalline   vapours                    I
                        that have made are not yet ready for use.
    The probability is that each of these groups will be found
to be due to several elements, as is plainly seen in the group H.
This compound line, which is commonly spoken of as being
caused by calcium, iron, and aluminium, is in reality much more
complex; for there can readily be counted in it more than fifty
lines in the original negative; and a careful inspection of the
accompanying paper picture shows a large proportion of them.
This observation leads us to a more general statement. The
 eract composition of even a part of the spectrum of a metal will
not be known until we have obtained photographs of it on a large
scale. The coincidences which were so thoroughly examined by
 Mr. Huggins (Trans. Roy. Soc. Dec. 1863) will only disappear
 when we can, in addition to the position of a line, have a clear:

    Dr. H. Draper on Diffraction-Spectrum Photography.           425
fine lines is seen. In the group L he shows 12 lines, while
even in the Alberttype copy of my photograph 25 can be counted,
and in the original negative many more. From H to L he shows
70 lines; in my Plate 138 can be observed besides many unre
solved bands.
    In the earlier part of this memoir it was stated that the rela
tive intensities of the lines in the spectrum were correctly repre
sented if a certain allowance was made.      If an unshielded col
lodion   plate were presented to the   image of the spectrum, there
would be produced a stain very dense from G to H, fainter above
H, and still fainter below G. But this stain would not represent
the actinic force of the sun, it would merely be an index of the
decomposability of a mixture of iodide and bromide of silver.      I
have for this reason adopted the idea of J. W. Draper, that force
is equally distributed through the spectrum, and have tried to
 produce a photograph of equal intensity throughout.       This has
 been accomplished,     as   Ihave before stated, by suitable dia
 phragms. But whether this view be correct or not, lines which
 are not far distant from one another are presented virtually with
 out any interference by diaphragms, and must therefore be cor
 rect both as to shading and intensity.
     Besides the points above mentioned, there are many theore
 tical considerations suggested by the photograph which it does
 not seem expedient to enter upon fully at present. Among such
 is the possibility of arriving at an estimate of the sun's tempe
 rature by interpreting the apparent bands, such as those near
 G and H, by the aid of Lockyer's researches on the temperature
 of dissociation of compounds.          No one has yet ascertained
 whether there are or are not unresolvable bands in the solar
 spectrum.     If they do exist, the compounds to which they be
 long, and the necessary temperature for dissociation, remain to
 be determined.
    It would seem also to be possible to find out whether, as as
 serted by Zöllner, there is a liquid envelope round the sun, by a
 search for more diffused bands in     its
                                        photographed spectrum.
   In  the hope that this photograph may prove    to   be   of
                                                          value    to

of the mechanical theory of Heat is in complete agreement with
the dynamical equation which is named after Hamilton, and
that, accordingly, in reply to the question “To which equation
in dynamics can the second proposition of thermodynamics be
reduced 7” we must point directly to Hamilton’s equation.
     Iwas moved to the publication of my considerations on this
subject chiefly by the circumstance that neither Boltzmann nor
Clausius, in their memoirst, has once mentioned Hamilton's
principle; and they are the only writers who up to that time
had occupied themselves with the above question.           Both seem
to consider   that, in order to bring  in  accordance,  it was neces
sary to deduce an equation yet unknown in dynamics; both
remark that the equations deduced by them exhibit a certain
affinity with the principle of least action; but neither of these
two philosophers has taken any notice of Hamilton’s principle -
and      its
         close relations    the equations
                                        to     question.                    in
   Hereupon M. Clausius published         memoir     which refers ex   a               S
clusively         to
              mine above   mentioned;    and     the very  cominence             at
ment      therein readily acknowledges that the connexion sought
          he
becomes much more striking when one compares the proposition
in  question, not (as     and Boltzmann had done) with the prin
                                    he
ciple    of
         least  action,  but with Hamilton’s.      At the same time
Clausius suggests the cause which prevented him from turning

      On Hamilton's Dynamic Principle in Thermodynamics.                                   427
it is indeed true that it is not very conceivable how any con
nexion capable of being clearly indicated can exist between that
equation and the second proposition of the mechanical theory of
heat.
   Clausius then quotes the original form of Hamilton's equation
used by me, and proves that Boltzmann's equation (23a), rightly
interpreted, perfectly corresponds with Hamilton’s, is indeed
identical with it. But what he concedes in relation to Boltz
mann's equation, that he decidedly questions in reference to his
own; nay, he declares without hesitation the correspondence
impossible. Thus the same question is again raised which has
been discussed in the Annalen, between Clausius and Boltz
mann”, on the occasion of the claiming of priority by the latter,
namely:-Does there actually exist a difference, and, if this is
the case, what is the difference, between the equation of Clausius
and that of Boltzmann? I believe that I am now entitled—nay,
after the reply of Clausius, am bound to enter into the discussion
of the question, at least in regard to Hamilton's equation.
   I will first discuss the equation which Clausius claims as his
OWn.
    For the more convenient elucidation of the matter, we will
first of all, as Clausius does, confine ourselves to the considera
tion of the periodic motion of a single point.     Given, therefore,
a material point which with the original motion describes a closed
path, or moves between two given points. The only forces act
ing on the movable point shall be such as possess a force-func
tion (or, as Clausius is accustomed to express        ergal)—that         it,   an
is, forces   which the components can

partial differential quotients, taken negatively,          function        of   a           of
                     the point.                      us
                                          now suppose that this mo
                       an of
the coordinates                    Let
tion undergoes        infinitesimal alteration. With the changed
motion    letthe point likewise describe        closed path,    a move               or
between two points, which latter may                            be
                                                 either identical with

Clausius in his answer appeals, and which he marked (18) in his
first memoir on this subject”, is the following:—
                dU              dU             -   dU                      --

   Now this is the equation to which Clausius refers as his own,
and which, he quite correctly remarks, has a more general appli
cability than Hamilton's.    It is also indeed impossible to find
complete accordance between this and Hamilton's equation.                                                               I

Clausius's and designated it as such; neither can      now so de                               I
signate it; for this equation was known five years since, as it
was given and demonstrated in the first volume of Sir William
Thomson's work, so widely diffused and frequently cited amongst
physicists, the ‘Treatise on Natural Philosophy,’ Oxford, 1867
(translated into German by G. Wertheim : Brunswick, 1871).

  Thomson’s equation is therefore only then in complete accord
ance with the second proposition of the theory of heat, when the
equation of condition (equation 6) is satisfied.
   Let us now see in what manner this condition is fulfilled, on
the one hand, in Hamilton's, and, on the other, in Clausius's
equation.
   Hamilton founded his equation on the assumption* that the
form of the force-function does not change with the change of
the motion, that hence 8U depends solely on the variation of the
space-coordinates—that     that         is,

   In    consequence           of   this,
                                               SF=0,
and equation (5) takes the following form:—

   Now,    what consists the assumption made
              in                                   Clausius’ He           by
admits that even the form     the force-function may change;

only lays down this conditiont, that the variation which results

                                         of              its mean                   at
value,   is   equal       0, of   and therefore

                                              SF =0.
  Consequently equation (1) takes the form                            of   equation      (3), viz.

     This is Clausius's equation.
   Now I affirmed that this equation, and not Thomson's, is iden

longs to the latter class.  It is only by the introduction of limi
tations, such as attributing to various parts absolute rigidity,
that the position of the whole is reduced to dependence on a
finite number of coordinates.     But even after every permissible
simplification has been made, there remains a large and import
ant class of systems whose configuration cannot be defined with
out the specification of an infinite number of coordinates, or,
which comes to the same, of a function of one or more indepen
dent variables.   Under this head must be included         strings,                                all
bars, membranes,               plates,        &c. which are treated                          as    capable       of
continuous deformation.

from which u is found as the sum of four distinct functions of z.
 (which it is not necessary to write down), each multiplied by a
coefficient, which is up to this point arbitrary.  The four equa
tions expressing the terminal conditions determine the ratios of
the four coefficients, and cannot be harmonized without ascribing
special value to p. The condition expressing the compatibility
of the four equations limits p to certain definite values which
appear as the roots of a transcendental equation.     Correspond
ing to each admissible value of p there is thus a normal function
in which every thing is definite except a constant multiplier.

normal component vibrations, it follows that the most general

            this purpose          I employ           only a single prism of the                         least
absorbent material and the greatest dispersion attainable. It
seemed to me that a prism of pure transparent ice-spar would
best fulfil this condition, as its index of refraction                                      is:–

    his recent paper Professor Challis reiterates, in a slightly
             form, his argument derived from the equation
p=funct. (p,v), without taking any notice of my refutation
of it.
   Putting u, v, w for the resolved parts of the velocity, and
w, y, 2 for the coordinates of a particle at the time t, he assumes
that the motion in three dimensions of any fluid may be repre
sented by the five following equations; viz.
     p=f(r,                                      p=f(x,                        t),        =f(x,

attention.
   Waiving this consideration, however,      join issue with Pro        I
fessor Challis on the point of our being able to assign to the
relation F(p, p, u, v, w)=0 a definite form which is independent
of the particular problem. By assigning a definite form to the
arbitrary function F(p, p, u, v, w)=0, it is not true, as assumed
by Professor Challis, that we simply define the fluid.    We do a
great deal more.   We define the fluid, and at the same time
impose conditions on the motion existing in                                      it.

the motion which would take place under the circumstances sup
posed might be evolved by having recourse to considerations
similar to those which Professor Challis has suggested—viz. by
considering first what would happen if the column of air were a
perfectly rigid bar, next by considering the effect of a slight
deviation from perfect rigidity, and finally by inferring from
that analogy what would take place in the actual case.   I hope
hereafter to have an   opportunity of developing what has been
thus briefly sketched.

     of Mines, Lecturer on Experimental  Science, Winchester College,
     and the Hartley Institution, Southampton”.
    reading the able paper               on the above subject by Dr.
ON Guthrie  in the October               Number of the Philosophical
Magazine, it occurred to me that the relationship might be
most satisfactorily and easily explained by the assumption that
currents of air passing over an electrified body carry off their
electricity.     The necessity for the assumption of a coercive force
existing between these two physical forces (as suggested in the
“Proceedings of the Royal Society’) is thus removed.
    The following experiments seem to me to prove in a most de
cisive manner the correctness of my hypothesis.                               -

electroscope was observed.              After the apparatus had again
attained the normal        temperature,     the current was sent continu
ously, the rise of the thermometer being noted every minute”,
and the brass ball being electified and left unelectrified in alter
nate minutes. The thermometer indicated on the average a
rise of one degree when the ball was not electrified and five
degrees when it was electrified—thus proving the existence of a
downward current of hot air when the ball was electrified.
   Each time the machine was worked the sudden rush of air
from the white-hot spiral caused                temperature its      appreci            to   be
ably lowered.      On     filling  the vessel with smoke, the upward
convection-currents             heated air showed themselves plainly.

fined within any definite limits, but work their way through
the whole mass, even when that mass is not disturbed by any
visible motion.
   This process of diffusion, as it is called, which goes on in gases
and liquids and even in some solids, can be subjected to expe
riment, and forms one of the most convincing proofs of the mo

    Now the recent progress of molecular science began with the
study of the mechanical effect of the impact of these moving

                       conceive the molecules
 flying about                 in
                      directions       rate     about    seventy

a   minute.
        If     all
           these molecules were flying         the same direction they     in
 would constitute      wind   blowing a     the rate        seventy miles

a    minute; and the only wind which approaches this velocity is
that which proceeds from the mouth of a cannon. How, then,
are you and I able to stand here? Only because the molecules
happen to be flying in different directions, so that those which
strike against our backs enable us to support the storm which is
beating against our faces.         Indeed, if this molecular bombard
ment were to cease even for an instant, our veins would swell,
our breath would leave us, and we should literally expire.
   But it is not only against us or against the walls of the hall
that the molecules are striking.         Consider the immense number
of them, and the fact that they are flying in every possible                                                 di
rection, and you will see that they cannot avoid striking each
other.     Every time that two molecules come into collision the
paths of both are changed and they go off in new directions.
Thus each molecule is continually getting              course altered;     its                                so
that,     spite             its

   This property        gases, that they diffuse through each other,
                            of
was first remarked                by
                            Priestley.     Dalton showed that           takes                      it
place quite independently            any chemical action between the
                                             of
interdiffusing gases.       Graham, whose researches were especially
directed towards those phenomena which seem                    throw light               to
on   molecular motions, made           careful study
                                                  a         diffusion, and       of of
obtained the first results from which the rate            diffusion could
be calculated.
     Still more recently the rates                       of
                                                        diffusion                of
                                                                    gases into each
other have been measured                         with great precision      Professor      by
Loschmidt,        of
              Vienna.
   He placed the two gases                        in     two similar vertical tubes, the

                          Prof.     J.   C. Maxwell on Molecules.                                     459
lighter gas being placed above the heavier, so as to avoid the
formation of currents. He then opened a sliding valve so as to
make the two tubes into one; and after leaving the gases to
themselves for an hour or so, he shut the valve, and determined
how much of each gas had diffused into the other.
    As most gases are invisible, I shall exhibit gaseous diffusion
to you by means of two gases (ammonia and hydrochloric acid)
which when they meet form a solid product. The ammonia,
being the lighter gas, is placed above the hydrochloric acid with
a stratum of air between; but you will soon see that the gases
can diffuse through this stratum of air and produce a cloud
of white smoke when they meet. During the whole of this
process no currents or any other visible motion can be de
tected. Every part of the vessel appears as calm as a jar of un
 disturbed air.
    But, according to our theory, the same kind of motion is
 going on in calm air as in the interdiffusing gases, the only dif
 ference being that we can trace the molecules from one place to
another more easily when they are of a different nature from
those through which they are diffusing.
   If   we wish to form a mental representation of what is going
on   among    the molecules in calm air, we cannot do better than
 observe a swarm of bees, when every individual bee is flying
 furiously, first in one direction and then in another, while the
 swarm, as a whole, either remains at rest or sails slowly through
 the air.
    In certain seasons swarms of bees are apt to                 off      great      fly        to

   Another branch of molecular science           that which relates    is

                    of                         belong  the relative masses
of  the molecules              of

     Inthe second rank we must place the relative size              the mo                     of
lecules    ofdifferent gases, the length           their mean paths, and

as yet of the nature of a probable conjecture. These are:—the ab
solute mass of a molecule, its absolute diameter, and the number
of molecules in a cubic centimetre.         We know the relative
masses of different molecules with great accuracy; and we know
their relative diameters approximately. From these we can de
duce the relative densities of the molecules themselves. So far
we are on firm ground.
   The great resistance of liquids to compression makes it pro
bable that their molecules must be at about the same distance
from each other as that at which two molecules of the same sub
stance    in the gaseous form act on each other during an encounter.
This conjecture has been put to the test by Lorenz Meyer, who
has compared the densities of different liquids with the calcu
lated relative densities of the molecules of their vapours, and has
found a remarkable correspondence between them.
   Now Loschmidt has deduced from the dynamical theory the fol
lowing remarkable proportion —As the volume of a gas is to the
                                                                                    it,

path  of     molecule
              a            one eighth        the diameter     of   molecule.
   Assuming that the volume                           of
                                         the substance, when reduced                                     to
the   liquid form,      not much
                             is     greater    than the combined volume
of  the molecules, we obtain from this proportion the diameter                                           of
a  molecule.          this way Loschmidt,

It  leaves him in possession of methods which nothing but scien
tific work could have led him to invent; and it places him in a
position from which many regions of nature, besides that which
he has been studying, appear under a new aspect.
    The study of molecules has developed a method of its own,
and it has also opened up new views of nature.
   When Lucretius wishes us to form a mental representation of
the motion of atoms, he tells us to look at a sunbeam shining
through a darkened room (the same instrument of research by
which Dr. Tyndall makes visible to us the dust we breathe), and
to observe the motes which chase each other in all directions
through        This motion
              it.             the visible motes,    tells us,

sible atoms which knock the motes about.      In his dream of
nature,    Tennyson tells us,

   This of course is not the only method of studying human
nature.  We may observe the conduct of individual men and
compare it with that conduct which their previous character and
their present circumstances, according to the best existing
theory, would lead us to expect.   Those who practise this
method endeavour to improve their knowledge of the elements
of human nature in much the same way as an astronomer cor
rects the elements of a planet by comparing actual position                      its
with that deduced from the received elements. The study                                                        of

    We can procure  specimens of oxygen from very different
sources—from the   air, from water, from rocks of every geo
logical epoch. The history of these specimens has been very
different; and if during thousands of years difference of cir
cumstances could produce difference of properties, these speci
mens         of oxygen would show                       it.

THEsuring              by
                   means of the differential galvanometer and
Wheatstone’s bridge, the latter having been probably suggested
by the former, must have struck every one who has had any
thing to do with them.     In each case do we make one resistance
a fourth proportional to three others, and, knowing the three,
deduce the fourth.    As in the bridge for every resistance to be
measured there is a certain arrangement of the three other sides
which gives the most sensitive balance, so with the differential
galvanometer there must be a best arrangement        for any parti
cular case, which it is the object of this paper to point out.
   The expression for the strength of the current through the
galvanometer in Wheatstone's bridge is

   It is an evident conclusion that differential galvanometers                   in
tended for measuring resistances comprised within wide limits,
both high and low, should have coils of long fine wire, having
necessarily a high resistance; for a galvanometer with coils of
short and thick wire is only suitable for measuring small resist
ances; whereas if it have coils of fine wire it is suitable for both
high and low resistances—for the latter by shunting.
LXII.     On certain remarkable Molecular Changes occurring in
     Iron Wire at a low red Heat.   By W. F. BARRETT, F.C.S.,
     Professor of  Eaperimental Physics in the Royal College of
     Science, Dublin”.
TN     the ‘ Proceedings of the Royal Society’ for January 28,
       1869, Mr. Gore published the important fact, that when
an iron wire is heated to bright incandescence and then allowed
to cool, a momentary elongation, or, as Mr. Gore believed,                       di
minution of cohesion, of the wire occurs just after it has begun
to contract by cooling. The main points in Mr. Gore’s paper
are as follows:—A thin iron wire fixed at one end to a binding
screw is attached at the other to an index which multiplies any
motion of the wire; the wire is strained horizontally by a feeble
spring; and matters are so arranged that the wire can be heated
by an electric current or by a row of gas-jets.          When heated,
the wire   expands  and the  spring   pulls the index  over.    A sketch
of the instrument is   given  in the  Philosophical   Magazine   for July
1869. Mr. Gore states that no anomalous action is observed on
heating the wire to bright incandescence;       but when the heating is
discontinued and    cooling   begins,  the index moves back until a
moderate red heat is attained, when suddenly the pointer gives
a jerk or kick, indicating a momentary elongation           of the wire
during the progress of            its
                                contraction. This effect        perfectlyis
certain, and always occurs        this particular
                                        at          temperature.      Mr.
Gore states that iron wire              of

been heated       redness; and the result showed that the iron bar
“suddenly increased         magnetic capacity during cooling

paratus.     By attaching to the movable cross piece a light
mirror, from which a brilliant ray of light was reflected to a
scale on a distant wall, the effect sought was not only vastly
magnified, but one or two new facts also revealed themselves.

                    to                                     cooling: some                       on
smaller  tremblings                of
                         the beam were noticed          higher  and lower                 at
temperatures; but these seemed due                irregular heating and         to
cooling.    (ii)   was evident that the anomalous deportment
                         It                                                                                                of
the iron occurred approximately               the critical temperature  at

promptly retreated to 22, then steadily passed onwards to 34,

476        Prof. W. F. Barrett on certain remarkable Molecular
                                         IV.
   On September 12th I was examining the condition of the
wire in a darkened room, when a new and unexpected change
revealed itself.    During the cooling of the wire it was found
that  just as it reached a very dull red heat, a sudden accession
of  temperature    occurred, so that it glowed once more with a
bright red heat.     Illuminating the index and scale of the appa
ratus, which was watched by an assistant, it was at once found
that the reheating of the wire occurred simultaneously with the mo
mentary elongation.     Necessarily no change of this kind can be ob
served on heating; but the reglowing of the wire on cooling is
most uniform and conspicuous *. The wire must first be heated to
whiteness; and then, being allowed to cool, just as it reaches a
point of barely visible redness a sudden cherry-red glow takes
place, passing as a wave of heat from one end of the wire to the
other, or from both ends to the centre.      The measured progress
of this wave of   temperature  along  the wire is extremely beautiful
to observe.    On first sending the current through the wire, the
heating begins at one extremity and runs along to the other; on
breaking contact, this reheating sweeps along the wire in the
contrary direction. This peculiar movement, therefore, may be
caused by the unequal thickness of the wire; though          do not      I
think this is the  explanation,  as the reheating   would then move
in the same direction as the heating (namely, from the thinner
to the thicker parts of the wire), and this is not the case.   hope          I
shortly to investigate this further.
   When the wire is heated by a row of gas-flames, the same re
sults take place, although the heating by the battery is a far
neater and more satisfactory way.
     It   is a real accession   of temperature,          a sudden      increase   in
thermal as well as luminous radiation. This is evident from the
following experiment.      A wide glass tube (fig. 2) was fitted
with corks at each end, so that the iron wire could be enclosed
air-tight within the tube.   At one end the cork was perforated
to allow the insertion of a narrow glass tube bent at right
angles, the lower end of which dipped into coloured water.      On
heating the wire to whiteness by the current, some of the en
closed      air
          was expelled, and        on
                                breaking contact the liquid rushed
up the tube, but midway suddenly stopped                         its
                                                       course, and

                                       this moment the assistant,
who was  watching the wire, gave   notice the wire drooped and
glowed again.   There       difficulty
                            is   no        repeating this experi

possibly have some connexion with the ferricum and ferrosum of

                                   is

on this point. The enormous cohesive power of iron, nickel,
and cobalt in the solid state signalizes these substances as the
most tenacious of metals.         To overcome this cohesion a very
high and somewhat similar temperature is required, and their
melting-point    is only exceeded by the platinum group of me
tals. Their     refractory  character renders them not volatile even
at the temperature of the hottest furnace.           When, however,
they are volatilized by means of the electric spark, their                 in
candescent vapours yield a spectrum which has a close and curious
resemblance.       This teaches us that the molecules of these bodies,
freed from the thrall of cohesion, vibrate in periods which are
closely akin.
    A comparison of the chemical properties of the same metals
furnishes a similar result. The ratio of the combining weight
of the metallic elements ranges from lithium 7, to bismuth as
210, or a difference of 203. When we compare the magnetic
 metals, we find the combining weight of iron is 56-0, nickel
 585, and cobalt 58-5, or a difference of only 2-5. Chemists
 class these three metals in the same group from the similarity of
 their chemical behaviour, and also the identity of their combi
 ning energy or atomicity.
    In strong nitric acid iron becomes endowed with a so-called
 passive condition, not acted upon, as it is in the dilute acid.
 Likewise   I find nickel is capable of assuming a passive state in
 strong nitric acid. Cobalt, it is true, was violently acted upon
 under similar circumstances; but that, I believe, was due to the
 fact that the cobalt contained iron largely, and so an electrolytic
 action was probably set up. I have been unable to obtain pure
 cobalt.—a very difficult matter,       I
                                   believe.
    A series of very similar chemical compounds are formed by
 these metals, mostly characterized by the brilliancy of their co
ºlour. The protosalts of iron are generally bluish green, of
 nickel emerald green, and of cobalt of a rose-colour.        It is
 moreover a well-known fact that this rose-colour of certain co
balt salts passes into     a      bright green when they are warmed.
Now, when the metal cobalt is moderately heated it increases
in magnetic power, thus differing from                its
                                        congeners, iron and
nickel, which are    their maximum magnetic condition

     with the former metals chemically, they are physically charac
     terized by their extraordinary tenacity and difficult fusibility:
     Manganese has lately been used to replace nickel in the alloy of
     German silver, and with excellent results I am informed. It is
     also worthy of note that the compounds of these five metals are
     conspicuous by the brilliancy of their colours,           their salts ex                                  all

ON VARIOUS CASES OF INTERMISSION                     OF THE VOLTAIC CURRENT.
                                     BY A. CAZIN.
   pursuing the researches which I have undertaken on the heat
IN
* of electromagnets, I have had occasion to observe several cases
of intermission of the voltaic current, which,                  I
                                                  believe, have not
Yet been  brought  into notice.
   Experiment 1.—A voltaic circuit is formed of 20 average Bunsen
elements and a coil of 960 turns containing an iron tube 8 centims.
in diameter and about 1 millim. thick. It can be closed or opened
at will by means of a platinum point and a layer of mercury, which
communicate respectively with each of the rheophores.
   When the platinum is not in contact with the mercury, and they
are put into communication with the armatures of a condenser with
a glass plate (armed surface 3 square metres), a continued rustling
is heard in the iron nucleus. The same effect is produced when,
the condenser being omitted, a layer of alcohol is interposed between
the mercury and the platinum point.              The noise ceases when the
alcohol is removed so that the platinum and mercury are sepa
rated by a layer of air, and also when the point is dipped into the
mercury.
   These facts indicate that the current passes through the glass in
the first case, and through the alcohol in the second, and that                 its
passage    is intermittent.     The nucleus          iron undergoes
                                                     of                   rapid
                                                                            a
succession      of alternate magnetizations and demagnetizations; and
each demagnetization occasions             faint sound
                                           a                   in
                                                            the nucleus. The
rapid succession         of
                          these noises constitutes the rustling which           is
heard.
   When the iron nucleus resounds, galvanometer indicates only
                                                a

                                   fact    itcannot indicate any thing else
when the intermissions are very close                to
                                                   one another.

cuit that gives rise to this sound; the closing produces no effect, at
least in my apparatus.
     M. de la Rive, in 1843, discovered that a current interrupted by
means of a rheotome produces a sound in the iron of an electromag
              I                                I
net; but think that the phenomenon have just described has
not been previously signalized.
     Listening for a sound in thenucleus of an electromagnet may be
regarded as a new process of investigation; we have seen that it
reveals the intermission of the current in circumstances in which
 the known methods are insufficient.          I  will mention an instance
which shows that this method accords with the others when they
can be employed simultaneously.
     Experiment 2.—When the spark from the rupture of the prece
 ding circuit is observed with the aid of the revolving disk, after the
 manner made known by me to the Academy on the 7th of April
 last, the spark appears compound.        When it bursts in alcohol, and
 the    platinum  point  and the mercury   are connected with the arma
 tures of the condenser, the revolving disk shows that the spark is
 composed of four or five successive bright strokes; the intervals
  between the strokes diminish from the first onwards.            (I have
  already described the division of this spark by another process,
  Bulletin de la Société Philomathique, 13th May, 1865; and the
  journal l’Institut, 31st May, 1865.)
      The sound produced by the rupture-spark presents a similar
  mode of division; it is the same with that which is heard in the
  condenser, and with that which takes place in the nucleus: these
  three sounds are composed exactly in the same manner.
      The production of a sound in the condenser proves that there is
  a partial discharge through the insulating substance, although at no
                                                  -
  part does this appear to be pierced.
      The sound of the condenser is augmented by increasing its sur
   face, up to a certain limit which cannot be exceeded.      At the same
  time the spark between the mercury and the platinum point is seen
  to diminish.     These modifications indicate a change in the distri
   bution of the electricity—which could be mathematically analyzed
   by regarding the alcohol of the interruptor as the insulating plate
   of a second condenser united to the first by the armatures of the

      I  think there is no essential difference between the intermission
   of the current which accompanies the breaking of the circuit in the
  circumstances    I have just described, and that presented by my first
  experiment.
      Experiment 3–The platinum point of the mercury interruptor
   is screwed into a fixed nut, so that it can be raised or lowered. The
  mercury and the point communicate respectively with the armatures
   of a condenser of 1 square metre surface. The rest of the circuit
  is arranged as before.
      The point being dipped into the mercury, is gradually raised until

the spark springs through the alcohol. The point then remaining
fixed, a succession of sparks is set up and persists for a long
time.    These sparks are lively and sonorous, and can readily be
counted.
    The level of the mercury visibly oscillates beneath the point.         A
possible cause of the oscillation is:—the spark being formed by the
 vapour of the mercury, the elastic force of this vapour depresses
the level of the liquid; this returns to its former level, passes it in
virtue of   itsacquired velocity, and rejoins the platinum point. Fall
ing again, the mercury produces fresh interruption, and the same

          EXPERIMENTS                    ON EVAPORATION.                        BY M. STEFAN.
   Atmometric experiments have hitherto led         results expres                to   no
sible inthe form    laws. The conditions under which they were
                               of
made were not simple enough; yet they were sufficiently varied.

  In   the experiments whose results are here given, the more                  vola
tile liquids, and in the first place ether, were employed. In order
to avoid the great lowering of the temperature at the surface, nar
row tubes were chosen for evaporating-vessels, instead of the wide
vessels hitherto usual.
    1. The velocity of the evaporation of a liquid from a tube is inversely
poportional to the distance of the level of the liquid from the open end
of the tube. This law holds with rigorous exactness when the dis
tance of the level a little exceeds 10 millims.
   2. The velocity of the evaporation is independent of the diameter of
the tube.    This result was obtained from experiments with tubes
the diameter of which varied from 0-3 to 8 millims.
   3. The velocity of the evaporation increases with the temperature,
so far as with this the vapour-pressure of the liquid rises.        If p be
the maximum of      elasticity of the vapour   corresponding  to the tem
perature of the observation, P the atmospheric pressure under
which the liquid evaporates, the velocity of the evaporation is propor
tional to the logarithm of a fraction of which P is the numerator, and
P—p the denominator. If the pressure of the vapour becomes equal
to that of the air, this logarithm becomes infinitely great, and sig
º
nifies that under this condition the liquid boils.
   Experiments were also made on evaporation in closed tubes.
  If   the open end of a tube, the other end of which is closed, be
         in ether, bubbles form and issue continually from the tube,
and, at first, the times in which successively equal numbers of bubbles
form are proportional to the odd numbers.
  If   the immersed tube contains hydrogen instead of air, the same
number of bubbles form in one fourth of the time.             Evaporation
proceeds   in   hydrogen   four   times as   rapidly
                                          as in air.
   The same result was also furnished by an experiment               in apparatus
in which a liquid can be brought to evaporation in an                open tube in
various gases. It consists of a T-shaped glass tube;                 into    its   ver
tical arm enters the tube containing the liquid            to   be   evaporated;
