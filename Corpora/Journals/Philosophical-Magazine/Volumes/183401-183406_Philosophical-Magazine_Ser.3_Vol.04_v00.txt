      Gentlemen,
INmunication
   your last Number my attention was attracted by a com
             of Mr. A. Walker, in which he notices what
he believes to be the prevailing tendency     of the higher por
tions of our continents to their western     boundaries, ranging
north and   south,  with a  steep westerly  escarpment.  This he
ascribes to the effect of the rotation of the globe; and he
states that he believes that these facts have never before
“been brought into connexion, and that he is not aware that
any one has assigned a cause for such remarkable coinci
dences.” Now in order to show him that he has been com
pletely forestalled in every point, I have only to refer him to
our excellent old topographer Stukeley, in his Itinerarium
Curiosum. This most worthy example of the Jonathan Old
buck tribe did not merely confine himself to the antiquities of
the country he traversed, but extended his observations to all
the interesting natural phaenomena which it presented. He
collected many contributions towards the project, which Lister
had before proposed, of a regular geological map (as we
should call    it)   of
                    the soils    the island    and especially no

districts; and with regard to the present question,                             have         I

     “If  we cast our eyes on the geography of England, we
must observe that much of the eastern shore is flat low ground,
while the western is steep and rocky.                   This holds generally
true   throughout     the    globe   as to         great  itsparts, countries                          or

strate the problem               of
                              the earth's motion have neglected this
proof, which         most sensible, and lies before our eyes every
                      is
minute; for             the property
                           is                   matter, that when whirled

round  in         axis, the loose parts are thrown the contrary
way    a on   tangent line.... By this means the elevated parts                                        of
the globe,       they consolidated, while yet soft and yielding,

 beneath which the strata were              deposited,       from east          west,        to
 as   a  consequence                 of
                               the earth's      rotation;       and the similar

           on the Mountain                Chains    of Europe and Asia.                           3
abruptness which he likewise believed to prevail in the southern
escarpments of such chains as run east and west, he ascribed
to a tendency of the tidal currents towards vast abysses
which he fancied to exist in the southern hemisphere. As
the substance of Kirwan's Essay is given at much length in
the Encyclopaedia            Britannica, (Article GEoLogy,)                       I    am   sur
prised that a theory detailed in so popular a work should have
escaped Mr. Walker's notice.
     Having shown that such speculations were familiar at a
much earlier period of geology, it can only be necessary for
me to explain the reasons why they have been generally neg
lected, in the more advanced state of the science, as founded
on a hasty and often erroneous induction.
     The circumstance which invariably determines the position
of the more abrupt escarpments of hilly chains, is really the
direction of the great anticlinal lines of elevation. All the
lateral chains have necessarily—to borrow expressive terms,
commonly understood, from the art of fortification,-an abrupt
counterscarp facing towards the central anticlinal ridge, and
the gentle slope of a glacis, as it were, declining outwards.
                                                                                                 If,
therefore, the anticlinal ridge range north and south, the lateral
 chains    on  the eastern side will have their steepest escarpment
 towards the west, and, vice versä, the western lateral chains
will have   it   towards the east;          the anticlinal ridge should
                                               or   if
 range east and west, the steep escarpments will face respect
 ivelyto   the south      the northern lateral chains, and
                            in                                  the north         to
in    the southern chains. This being the case,              easy     find
                                                                        it   is            to
 examples enough             of
                            steep escarpments       any direction in    fill                to
 up
 a       sufficient induction     favour  in         of
                                             any hypothesis. Stukeley,
 we see, favoured the north and west; Kirwan the south and
 west. Both were equally confident, and            believe both equally
                                                                 I

     Mr. Walker, admitting that, primá facie,         the extension of
the old continent of Europe and Asia appears to be contrary to
his theory, namely, from east to west, is desirous, by taking in
 Australia, to correct              its
                              longitudinal bearings          north and       to
south; but had             he
                        studied Humboldt's admirable Essay on
the Asiatic Mountain Chains, he would have seen demonstra

traced skirting the whole southern coast of the Caspian Sea.
There is here, I believe, some interruption of continuity; but
we must surely look on the subject in a more general point
of view, and regard the general arrangement of nearly con
 tiguous groups as sufficient evidence of the prevailing direction
 of grand lines of elevation without requiring the absolute con
 tinuity of a single unbroken chain. In this immediate neigh
 bourhood the range of the Caucasus is parallel, and probably
 a lateral dependency on the great Himmalayan line, of which,
 however, the ranges of the Taurus, and the general mountain
 country of Asia Minor, present the most direct prolongation;
 and as these are separated only by a narrow strait from the
 great ridge of the Balkan (on which we may consider the
 Grecian highlands as dependencies), we thus trace the system
 into Europe.       It here becomes, indeed, more broken and
 flexuous; but it is still impossible to cast an eye on any accu
 rate map without being struck by the mutual relation and de
pendence of the several chains.
    Crossing the Danube, the Eastern Carpathians of Transyl
vania take up the line, which is here considerably curved, but
resumes       its
               western direction          the Western Carpathians
                                                      in
skirting Hungary; and this           prolonged through the Riesen
gebirge and Erzegebirge.                      In is
                                     circling the basin      Bohemia,         of
another    great   flexure occurs;    indeed,   we can   compare    the
whole configuration          this district only

II.   On the Power    of Glass of Antimony to    reflect Light.   By
                      R. Potter, Jun., Esq.”
INforemythe
          paper on Comparative Photometry, which I read be
             Physical Section of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science at the Meeting at Oxford, and which
is published in the Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Sci
ence for Sept. 1832, I have given a table of the quantities of light
reflected by diamond for several incidences.         I have since re
peated the experiments for a low incidence on another larger
specimen, a triangular larke diamond, which Sir David Brew
ster politely lent me for the purpose. These experiments          in
dicate that this diamond also reflects at 2° to 3° incidence
equally with crown glass at 64°, from which the various trials
differed very little.
    The small surfaces which we have on diamond cannot be
expected to be sufficiently plane to enable us to get results for
high incidences on which we may place entire confidence, and
the smallness of the surfaces, also, is an obstacle, even if they
were truly plane, to our obtaining quantities sufficiently exact
for determining the curve which these reflections form, when
we take the sine of incidence for the abscissa in rectangular
coordinates.
    These considerations induced me to make another attempt
(having failed in a former one,) to give a perfect polish to glass
of antimony, which has a refractive power but little inferior to
 that of diamond.
    I used in this instance, for polishing powder, the fine pre
pared oxide of iron which       I  have described the method of
procuring in a paper on the polishing, &c., of specula in the
 Edinburgh Journal of Science. By using this powder on a
 polishing bed of soft pitch, I succeeded completely; and as        I
 had previously got the surfaces plane on a white German hone,
 which had been very carefully prepared for making the small
 specula of the Newtonian telescope,     I had now a high refract
 ing substance, of which I could determine the reflective power
for any requisite incidences.       The deep colour which glass
 of antimony possesses is also an advantage for these experi
 ments, where we want only the reflection at the first surface.
    I have made two sets of trials, which are given in two Tables
 below. Those in the second Table were obtained on a rather
 more favourable morning for using the photometer than the
 others. The incidences at which crown glass gave illumina

a perpendicular incidence, a quantity of light more than half

every 100 rays incident.     The polarizing angle for this speci

may take the refractive index to be somewhere between 2:1
and 22 for rays of mean refrangibility.        Such rays are how
ever absorbed in refraction in     specimens of ordinary thickness,
from the tendency of the substance to transmit only the rays
of the red end of the spectrum.

   the Use of Chemical Formulae.       By the Rev. W. WHEwell,

   bridge.
  To  the Editors    of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      Gentlemen,
ASdiscussed
       the subject of chemical nomenclature has been already
                   in your pages, perhaps your readers may be
willing to see the view taken of the present state of the ques
tion by one of the persons whose opinion will naturally be
most attended to on this matter.
    In Berzelius’s “Annual Report on the Progress of the
Physical Sciences,” read before the Swedish Academy on
March 31, 1832, the following passage occurs:
   “Some opinions concerning the chemical formulae have
been published       in English Journals. . The learned of that
nation, little acquainted with foreign languages, do not ac
quire till late any knowledge of the progress of science in
other countries, and always find excuses in defence of this
slowness, among which not unfrequently occurs this, that the
thing in question is foreign, and must be either extremely im
portant, or must have become somewhat old, in order to obtain
a more general notice. In the Annual Report for 1824, I have
mentioned the objections which have been made against the
chemical and mineralogical formulae introduced by me: these
have been again brought forward by Whewell, who urges
principally that these formulae are like algebraical ones, with
out being constructed according to algebraical rules,—on
which account they must be disagreeable to any one who knows
a small matter of algebra; and that they are also not a sim
ple representation of the results of analysis, but affect to ex
hibit certain determinate modes of combination. Now he, it
appears, has discovered a system of chemical signs which has
not the same fault.”       I shall not trouble your readers with
the comparison which he gives, and to which he adds, “tot
capita, tot sensus 1". “Whewell concludes his dissertation,”
he continues, “with an admonition to the English chemists “to
purify and improve the foreign system.’...Prideaux has made

10   M. Berzelius and the Rev.W.Whewellon                  Chemical Formulae.
some objections against Whewell's remarks", and rightly en
deavoured to show, that by means of a formula an idea of the
composition of a body is more easily expressed.”
     I
    am by no means going to attempt to open up again this
subject, of which a general discussion, independent of some
particular object, is not likely to be very useful or instructive.
I will only observe, that in the note to the Report of 1824, to
which he refers, Berzelius has not, I think, even attempted to
answer the objections which he quotes in the above passage.
In that note he endeavours to show the convenience of some
chemical formulae, without attempting to compare different
systems.    And both there and elsewhere he views his formulae
merely as modes of expressing his own opinion of certain
compositions, briefly and clearly.      I consider that chemical
formulae are capable of doing more than this, of expressing
the analysis, without adopting any one's hypothesis of the
mode of composition; and of showing how different analyses,
and different views of composition, are necessarily related to
each other.     And this can only be done by using algebraical
formulae constructed according to algebraical rules+.        For
Berzelius's   purpose, the use of the sign + is a wanton and su
perfluous violation of analogy.
    Those chemical formulae are the best which best answer
their purpose; and therefore our judgement of what is best
must depend on our views with regard to the purpose which
these formulae are to answer.       It is easy to make formulae
simple enough, if we want them to mean little.          Berzelius
 compares his formula for garnet, fs--As, which does not
express the quantity of oxygen combined with the bases, and
which does not admit of being put into a form independent of
his assumptions, with a formula which was intended to possess
 these advantages.     A person who was contented to express
 somewhat less than Berzelius, might have “discovered” a
 simpler formula still, and might have denoted garnet by a
 single letter g.   But such simplicity would probably not be
 considered as a merit of a high order.

         My Dear Sir,
     N, a lecture which           I
                           had the honour of delivering before

pointed out, and illustrated by experiment, a general law, which
connects together the splendid discoveries made by Mr. Fara

essential parts of science is the reduction of facts to general
laws, and as the views which                     I

  The law is founded on the universal principle that action
and reaction are equal. Thus, if voltaic electricity induce mag
netism under certain arrangements, magnetism will, by simi
lar arrangements, react on a conductor and induce voltaic
electricity.  Instead of stating the law of magneto-electric in
duction and then illustrating it by experiment, it will be more
instructive to arrive at it by a process of induction.

12      General Law          of Magneto-Electric Induction.
on the conductor will, as Mr. Faraday has shown, take place
in the opposite direction.
    2. If two conductors, having electricity induced on them
in the same direction by means of an elementary battery, be
placed parallel to one another, they will be mutually attracted.
Hence, if we remove one of the batteries and connect the ends of
the wires as in the first experiment, and then imitate attraction,
by making the wires rapidly approach each other in a parallel
position, the same electric influence will be induced on the
closed circuit as it had when connected with the battery.                                      If
the conductors, when connected with the batteries, have their
electricities induced in opposite directions, they will mutually
repel each other. Hence, if we remove one of the batteries,
connect the wires as before, and imitate repulsion, by re
moving the wires rapidly from each other, the electric influ
ence or current will be induced in the same direction as it was
when the wires were connected with the battery.
    3.If   a voltaic conductor be made to revolve round the
pole of a magnet, as in Mr. Faraday's first experiment on ro
tation, and if the battery be removed and the ends of the con
ductors brought into metallic contact, the same electric state
will be induced on the closed circuit, by turning the wire ra
pidly round the pole of the magnet by mechanical force.
    4. If we produce all the rotations described in works on
 electro-magnetism, and if we remove the battery, and bring
the ends of the conductors into metallic contact, and then
continue the rotation by mechanical means, the same electric
 state will be induced on the conductor which it had when
 connected with the battery.
    In a paper of mine read before the Royal Society on the
 21st of March 1833*, I first described the method of making
 a piece of soft iron or electro-magnet, either straight or in
 the form of a horse-shoe, revolve rapidly round                centre,       its
 either by  the action       of
                             the earth           or   of
                                                   horse-shoe
                                                       a       magnet,
 by  changing     its
                    poles twice       every revolution.
                                       in                  Hence from
 the general law      follows, that                                  re be
                                                                                       be to
                        it               the soft iron
                                            if             made
 volve  by  mechanical    force,  the same electric state will                                 in
 duced on the conductor as           had when the ends of the wires
                                       it
 were connected with the battery.
    These facts were known, and the experiments publicly exhi
 bited, months before the large revolving electro-magnet was
 exhibited   inthe Adelaide Rooms. The general law               which            at
 we have arrived may         thus expressed:

I    was certainly not aware        the fact,     of
                                                   had not seen the    as  I

heard     of
           the experiment alluded                           to.
                                           The claim, however,                                             is
indisputable, and with pleasure cede the palm

    My experiments, however, would       seem to be fuller and
more  complete than the  original as mentioned in the Encyclo
paedia, as   had   I
                 injected   the choroides minutely, dissected it
out, and washed it carefully to remove the pigmentum. This,
however, is of no moment, excepting as regards the object                                              I
had in view.
      If
       Sir David Brewster has happened to see the Essay
I  published last year, on the subject of a new membrane in
the eye, he will find that my object has been to prove that
the anatomy of the choroid membrane in animals has not
been hitherto thoroughly understood; that the brilliant colours
we meet with in the eyes of various animals, which we have
been accustomed to consider as appertaining to a peculiar
secretion of the choroid tunic, and which, it may be easily
seen, are so stated to be in standard anatomical and physio
logical works” even to this day,+that these brilliant colours
are not owing to any such secretion, but arise from the peculiar
construction of the anterior lamina of the choroid membrane,
which I have ventured to term the Membrana versicolor.
   That the membrana versicolor is perfectly distinct from the
choroides          is,
                think, satisfactorily shown
                   I                                              by
                                                 direct experiment,
and perhaps particularly                              by
                                      the one above mentioned,
                                                so                                                    in
which the eye       the sheep was minutely injected.
                           of
      In
       conclusion,     may remark that this curious fact,
                               I                                   re                            as
gards the experiment first named, does not invariably hold
good. We find the colours disappear              drying, and reap by
pear       by
         moistening,       the sheep, ox,
                                      in  &c., but   will not      so,  it                       do
 completely,    the   cat,  and probably  not   the fox     the lion.               or

 The reason      this    the much greater thickness
                                  is                      the mem             of

18   Prof. Forbes's Researches on the Vibrations which take place
state that the mere accumulation            of impulses of any kind up
to a certain number in a           second,   produces alone a musical
 sound depending upon that number. This Mr. Faraday readily
 showed to be the true cause of the musical sounds produced
 in this experiment, namely, the number of contacts of the hot
 with the cold metal in a second, and he illustrated the fact by
 putting a cold bar of metal in vibration by means of the cor
 responding expansions and contractions of a pair of sugar
 tongs connected with                       it,
                                 when sounds quite analogous           those                               to

 pletely established the dependence               these sounds upon the
 vibrations.     He did      not,  however,   include      his explanation              in
 the action          of
                 the groove          producing them, which therefore

extent, deny the influence                             of

                                   is           the groove? The answer

                                                       is                                                       by   its
presence.    When both surfaces are smooth, the vibrations are
comparatively slow, and might almost                 counted: sometimes,      be

22 Prof. Forbes's Researches on the Vibrations which take place
intensity and distinctness of vibrating power. In this inquiry
I  found many difficulties, chiefly arising from the apparently
capricious nature of the effects produced, which for a long
time seemed almost to baffle an attempt at classification; and
it was only by reiterated series of experiments, at different
times, and made in different ways, that I could satisfy myself
of the degree of accuracy to which my results were entitled.
    18.   Isoon found that the conditions of vibration depended
simply on the distance between the places of the two metals
employed for the bar or block, in a certain scale required to
be determined. The remarkable case of iron already observed
by Mr. Faraday made me very desirous to extend such a law;
here we have a metal which must be placed towards the mid
dle of such a scale, since a metal above it in the scale vibrates
upon it when hotter than the iron, whilst iron itself vibrates
upon cold lead, which, therefore, must be placed lower in the
scale; and as the intensity of vibration may be expected to
be proportional to the interval in the scale, so we actually find
that silver vibrates on lead much more actively and steadily
than iron does.
    19.   Ifirst prepared bars similar to those which have been
already described, of copper, zinc, brass, iron, tin, lead, anti
mony and bismuth.          My earliest experiments demonstrated
the small number of pairs of metals between which vibrations
took place. The superiority of lead to                other metals,      all                           as
the cold    substance,  was  manifest;  and       order     establish,

      I
way could devise, but almost always got precisely the same
arrangement of vibrators.            Employing a lead bar,        used also            I
blocks of the different metals heated to 212°.                With silver,

gold and platinum, found it difficult to procure considerable
masses of sufficient purity; and when small ones taken out of
boiling water were employed and placed in a vice, I found
that the loss of heat they experienced was so rapid as to de
stroy the comparability of the experiment. The plan adopt                                   I
ed for procuring an approximation to a uniform tempera
ture, and which from reiterated trials I found susceptible of
great accuracy, was the following: The piece of metal under
experiment being firmly held in a vice, a drop of water was
placed upon            it,
                     and     spirit-lamp applied below,

                                          and the vibrations encouraged
 by
 a     gentle oscillation.                 In
                                     this manner      went over not only

     23. The next experiments were made with silver. Even
 with  very unfavourable apparatus it appeared remarkably ac
 tive as a vibrator.     A small block of heated silver placed in a
hot vice, gave indications of being at the very top of the series
of vibrators, a cold lead bar being used ; a result fully con
firmed by subsequent experiments, in which the temperature
of 212° was carefully ensured.
    24. My first observations upon gold led me to the conclu
sion, that it is much inferior to silver in the scale of vibrators.
Subsequent experiments led me to place it third in the scale.
Standard gold was employed.
    25. &inc vibrates with great facility and certainty upon lead,
when it has a temperature of 212°; when hotter, it is subject
to some irregularities.      Zinc and brass, to which it is closely
allied, seem to stand next to gold, being very superior to
platinum and iron, but considerably inferior to silver.
    26. Iron is very nearly allied to platinum, but, from very
careful experiments,             is,

lower.     Tin stands decidedly below iron, and stands                the            in
scale next      lead, the cold metal employed; yet still
                 to                                                vibra       its

is immediately suggested: Is the property of lead as the cold
metal peculiar to it? or does it only require a certain space
between any two metals in this scale to produce the effect?

tin  and antimony, platinum      the third metal above      the

seen that the   vibrating  property       relation    cold lead   in                  to                    is   al
most the same       several consecutive metals. The observation
                             in
stated     by
           Mr. Faraday, forcibly suggests the idea that certain                                       a

   29. The following are some cases            decided vibrations ob       of
tained  among    numerous   experiments.      Upon   cold TIN, heated
silver, copper, gold and iron vibrate           the order just stated,     in
silver being the most intense. Upon cold IRoN, silver vibrates
decisively: my experiments, therefore, confirm the statements
of  Mr. Faraday. With hot copper have likewise obtained                I
distinct vibrations, though           not possible

 all   the metals under               trial none have any vibrating energy with
antimony and bismuth, whether hotter           colder than these                 or
metals, whether used     bars    blocks. There

                        in
one occasion very hot brass was observed         vibrate     cold                 to                   on
ANTIMONY; on another occasion, however, no such effect was
produced. This solitary experiment appears                 one                               to       be         of

and retarded my progress      this delicate inquiry.

                                        it    Faraday's   hypothesis,
that the vibration between two metals depended                 the dif   on
ference  of  their conducting   powers   for  heat  directly,    and                 of
their  expansion    inversely.   Finding   considerable     deviations
from this law,  I  was led     look for some simpler analogy.
                                  to
   34. The first arrangement which presented            striking simia
larity was that       of
                       the conducting    powers       the  metals for
                                                                    of

     between    Metallic Masses having different Temperatures.               27
led me, pointed out another, and perhaps not less important,
analogy, which appeared not to have been before observed,
namely, that when the best data are collected, the order of
conducting powers of the metals for heat and for electricity is
the same.        I did not adopt this conclusion till after a mature
examination of existing statements, and an extensive series of
experiments upon the conducting powers of the metals for
heat, made with Fourier's thermometer of contact, which en
abled me, where discrepances occurred between previous ob
servers, to ascertain the truth, and to add some new metals
to the list.     In the case of electricity, I was a good deal sur
prised to find observers more at one, than in that of heat. The
result of these inquiries, which for a time withdrew my atten
tion from the immediate subject under consideration, is con
tained in a paper read to the Royal Society of Edinburgh on
the 7th of January 1833*.

    35. The general conclusion at which I then arrived is thus
stated in the paper alluded to : That the arrangement of me
tallic conductors of heat does not differ more from that of those
of electricity than either arrangement does alone under the
hands of different observers. I shall here quote the provisional
arrangements which          I  have given in that paper, and compare
them with the order of vibrations which we have recorded

 and the experiments described in the paper      just quoted were made between

 that period and February 1832.
    t On the subject of the conducting powers for electricity, a beautiful
illustration of the application of new discoveries in science to branches    al
ready known, has occurred to me since forming these lists.          Mr. Faraday
has shown, that, according to his beautiful Theory of Magnetism by rota
tion, the Transient Magnetic Energy (as it was formerly termed) of different
metals, should bear a relation to their conducting power of metals for
electricity.   This is most remarkably confirmed by the following Table,
given by Mr. Harris in the                   Transactions for 1831, which most

The analogy is exceedingly striking,      more especially when it
is stated that each arrangement has been compiled alone solely
upon the evidence of experiment, and the ground upon which
each metal has                  its
                        place assigned           fully stated    totheit,   is                             in

IX.  On the Comparative Strength of Salt Springs at different

   turning, the other day, over the pages of a work on the
         of Wirtemberg by Alberti, published at Stuttgard
in the year 1826,             I
                       met with some statements relative to the
comparative strength of the salt springs of that country at
                                    I
different depths, which do not remember to have seen quoted
                                    I
in any English work. , am desirous, therefore, of giving them
publicity, as tending in some degree to elucidate the problem
with respect to the manner in which rocks of salt may have
been formed from water holding it in solution, which has ex
ercised the ingenuity of many naturalists, and especially of
Mr. Lyell in the first volume of his Principles of Geology.
   I  say, it may tend in some degree to elucidate that problem,
because, after all, it does not seem clear in what way a deposi
tion of salt can take place from a strong or even a saturated
brine, without the operation of some assisting cause, such as
pressure, heat, or the like.
   Nevertheless, it is something to be able to show the pro
bability that at the bottom of the sea the brine may be in that
state of concentration which is but one remove from the con
dition in which it would begin to deposit salt; and this will,
perhaps, appear from the following statements.

   The apparatus is merely a hollow cylinder, or a moderately
high margin, with apertures at equal distances, and placed
cylindrically round the edge of a revolving disk. Any draw
ings which are made on the interior surface in the intervals
of the apertures will be visible through the opposite aper
tures, and if executed on the same principle of graduated ac
tion, will produce the same surprising play of relative motions
as the common magic disk does when spun before a mirror.

near the apparatus, but rather the contrary, and the machine

writing it Aq, whereby this ambiguity was avoided. No
practical difficulty, however, is likely to result from the change,
until oxygenated water becomes a subject of more extensive
chemical interest.
     If
     this were all, the interposition or omission of the sign +
and the mode of expression of oxygen, would lead to little
embarrassment in the use of chemical symbols, (amongst
which the mathematical notation of Whewell and Brande can
hardly be classed); but in the specimen given (at p. 445), there
is confusion of another kind, originating, apparently, in the
specimen itself.   The common ingredient oxygen, is repre
sented in very different proportions.

   of the eye, and of the action of light on the optic nerve,
 I was  led to investigate several very curious phaenomena con

work were           dull brick-dust colour, and the spaces between

veyed to my     sight; but I soon recollected that my eyes were
shut, that the lids had not once been opened, and that my
face was directed to the ceiling; the squares, too, of the spec
trum were placed diamond-wise and were of a different co
lour from that of the window-sash so often seen by me.                                                   I
could not make the object return that morning, although I had
the room made dark and closed my eyes again.
     Iinferred from this that during sleep the whole apparatus of
the   eye is relaxed, and that there is a suspension of              effort,                  all

 direction, our image is seen inverted on the margin of the glass,

the impression of outward objects to the mind or sensory. My

   Mr. Parish also describes, in his letter, a submarine forest, which
he traced at low water, from the western extremity of St. Leonard's
to the headland at Bulverhithe, and he is of opinion that it is a con
tinuation of the submarine forest which occurs off Hastings.                The
trees, he says, are chiefly oak, and appear to have fallen towards
the sea.
    In the peat forming part of the deposit he found hazel nuts, a
variety of seeds, and the remains of beetles and other insects.              No
tradition has been    preserved    of the  irruption   of the sea     by  which
the forest was submerged.
   Nov. 20.—A paper was read entitled, “Notes on the Geology of
the North Coast of the River and Gulf of St. Lawrence, from the
Mouth of the Saguenay (Long. 69° 16') to Cape Whittle (Long.
60°),” by Captain Bayfield, R.N., and communicated by George
Bellas Greenough, Esq., P.G.S.
   The line of coast surveyed by the author, and described by him
in this memoir, includes above 500 miles. It is traversed by ranges
of round-backed hills, rarely exceeding 1000 feet in height, and
towards the eastern termination of the district sinking nearly to a
level with the sea. In some parts of the coast the hills approach
close to the shore; but in others they recede to a distance from                                            it,
and the country presents          succession

bogs.
   The formations         which the main land and adjacent islands
                                of
consist, are granitic and syenitic compounds, limestone,                 deposit               a
of clay, sand and gravel, and modern alluvial accumulations.
   The granitic and syenitic rocks compose the whole                    the hilly          of
districts, with the exception          tract opposite the Mingan Islands.

being formed          felspar, quartz, hypersthene and hornblende.

tween the syenitic hills. The clay invariably occupies the lowest
portion, and the gravel generally the highest.       No shells were no
ticed, though the water-courses of the rivers cut through the de
posit.                  º
    The modern alluvial accumulations are of great extent, and in
 some parts of the coast are rapidly increasing.         In Outard Bay
(100 fathoms     deep)  the surface of the water was highly charged
 with   earthy matter,  which the surveying vessel cut through in her
 course, and displayed beneath the pure sea water.
    The peat bogs occur towards Cape Whittle, the eastern part of
 the district examined, and rest upon the syenite.
    During his investigations, the author noticed many evidences of
 change having taken place in the relative level of land and water.
 He mentions, that in the Mingan Islands he traced a succession of
 shingle beaches, the most distant from the shore and covered with
 trees, being 60 feet above the level of the highest tides. In the Bay
 of the Seven Islands, and in almost every other bay, and at the en
 trance of the valleys near the sea, he observed parallel ridges of
 sand, sometimes attaining a height of 100 feet, and occasionally
 containing shells analogous to those now inhabiting the St. Law
 rence. This change the author conceives has been produced, not
 by successive depressions of water, but by successive elevations of
 land; and he supports his opinion by showing, 1st, that no per
 manent depressions could have taken place in the water of the
 River and Gulf of St. Lawrence, without corresponding ones in the
 Atlantic; and 2ndly, that the beach now forming on the Mingan
 Islands presents the same characters as the beaches which he
 traced at a distance from the shore; that the water-worn pillars of
 limestone which accompany each beach, bear evidence of having
 been worn or scooped out at different periods, the successive action
  of the water agreeing in level with the successive ridges of limestone
 shingle; and he states that the distance between these marks of ac
 tion of water on the limestone pillars, exactly agrees with the rise
  of the present tidal waves of the St. Lawrence. He also proves, by
 a minute description of the alluvial accumulations now forming on
 the shore of the main land, and a careful comparison of them with
  the parallel ridges of sand already mentioned, that an identity of
                                                        -
  character exists.
     In conclusion, the author briefly refers to the geological structure
  of the south shore of the St. Lawrence, between the meridian of the
  Saguenay and Cape Gaspé, and states that it consists of alternating
  strata of slate and grauwacké, overlaid conformably, at the latter
  point, by limestone, containing fossils analogous to those of the
   Mingan Islands and Lake Huron.

     Nov. 19 and Dec. 3.-A memoir was read, entitled, “On the De
  gree of Selection exercised by Plants with regard to the earthy Con
  stituents presented to their absorbing Surfaces.” By Charles Dau
   beny, M.D., F.R.S. L.S., Professor of Chemistry, Oxford.
      The author states, that he was first led into this train of experi

                           Linnaean Society.                                           53
ment with the hope of ascertaining by more decisive experiments
than had been hitherto done, whether plants are able under any
circumstances to form those earthy and alkaline matters which they
usually contain, when not supplied with them from without.
     With this view, he planted a known weight of the seeds of certain
vegetables in earths of known composition, introduced in a finely
divided state into boxes cased internally with sheet zinc.          One box,
containing each kind of earth, was placed in a garden exposed to
rain and dust, and a corresponding one of each kind in a greenhouse
protected from both.
      The earths employed were, washed sea-sand, Carrara marble and
 sulphate of strontian.
      The crop obtained from each of the boxes was separately burnt,
 and the ashes weighed and examined chemically.              That from the
 boxes placed in the garden was greater than that from those in the
 greenhouse; but in both cases an increase of earthy matter was ob
 served beyond that which existed in the seeds from which they had
 sprung.
      Having remarked, however, that the plants grown in strontian
 contained none of that earth, he resolved to try whether this cir
 cumstance might be owing merely to the insolubility of the sulphate
 in water, or to some specific power belonging to the plant of re
 jecting the earth in question.           -
       He therefore varied the experiment the succeeding year, by
  planting the seeds in four different soils, namely, sand, marble, suf
  phate of strontian and flowers of sulphur, and watering them with a
  weak solution of nitrate of strontian.       In every instance there was
  an increase of calcareous matter, beyond that present in the seeds,
  greatest in the plants that had grown in sulphate of strontian and in
  Carrara marble, least in those planted in sulphur; but the largest
  quantity of strontian ever detected by chemical means from their
  ashes did not exceed 0-4 of a grain.         From these and similar ex
  periments, detailed in the memoir, the author concludes, that the
  absorbing surfaces, or spongioles, of the roots of plants either do
  not admit strontian earth at all, even in a state of solution, or at
   least receive it much less readily than they do calcareous matter.
       He details an experiment to show, that the absence of strontian
                                                                  its
   from the solid parts of the plants was owing to          remaining unab
           by                                                  them; and ac
                                                             in by
   sorbed        the roots, not    to   its
                                         being excreted
   counts for the difference between what happened             the instance                 of
    the strontian, and that which        he
                                          had himself observed        common in
    with Mons.   de  Saussure, as  holding good with regard             to
                                                                   solutions                of
    substances more directly injurious       the plant,     by
                                                            supposing,

    latter instance, the spongioles     to   disorganized         by
                                                                 the poisonous
    qualityof    the substance, and consequently        have allowed the so

                                                              this latter case
   he     observed, that before the plant       destroyed,
                                                  is            portion

     the roots.
         Upon the whole  he  concludes, that his experiments lend         coun    no
     tenanceto    the idea that plants can form their earthy constituents
     when not supplied with them from without, although they                 not   do
      altogether demonstrate the reverse.

   They seem, however, to show more decisively that plants do,
to a certain extent at least, possess a power of selection, and that
the earthy constituents which form the basis of their solid parts
are determined as to quality [kind?] by some primary law of nature,
although their amount may depend upon the more or less abundant
supply of the principles presented to them from without.

strongly against this conclusion; for it is not conglomerate, it is not
invested with an erectile tissue, and it is without nipples. In Meck
el's time the appearance of the latter was hoped for, the nipples
being frequently developed under the action of sucking; but at
present this can no longer be anticipated. Females have been seen
in full nutritive action, in New South Wales, by Lieut. Lauderdale
Maule and Mr. James M'Arthur, and at London by Mr. Owen
himself; and each observer has insisted on the circumstance that
there were no nipples.

to functions.    In fact the Shrews alone share with the Monotremala
this fact of resemblance,   viz. that the monotrematic glands are more
developed in the female during the period of heat. The circum
stances are different in the Water-Rat, which possesses the same gland
at all seasons and in both sexes.
     “Fourthly, What are we to infer from the distinction drawn from
the nature of the localities, aquatic as regards the Ornithorhynchus,
dry with reference to Echidna 2 And why might it not happen that
the function should be modified according to the nature of the am
bient medium? Let us not establish a general thesis on facts which
are not accurately known.            To acquire a knowledge of these facts
is our  object,   and our   uncertainty    with regard to them forms the pro
blematic    part  of our   controversy.     We are dealing with a new fact;
let us wait till we have seen and learned it before coming to a definitive
conclusion. The Shrews offer us another useful piece of instruction:
they consist, in fact, of several species,               having the same gland,

most have been expected a priori that in that class these organs
should be found in the various degrees of simplicity or complication
of which they are capable. Such appears to be the case; in Cetacea
they are simple caeca (and in this respect the glands of Monotremata
agree with these mammary glands); in higher forms they are con
glomerate, and cannot be misunderstood.
   Mr. Owen added, with reference to the microscopic test of the
nature of the secretion which was proposed by M. Geoffroy, that he
had not been able to procure either from the glands themselves or
the openings of their ducts any portion of their secretions to which
the test could be applied ; globules of                    oil
                                                  alone offering themselves
to his observation, and these existed also           the spirit in  which the           in
animals were preserved.

   In the Cats generally, the connexion of the os hyoides to the cra
nium is not by a long elastic ligament, as in the Lion, but by an
uninterrupted             series                 of bones. This latter structure exists in the
Cheetah. The Cheetah has also the circular pupil of the Lion, Tiger,
Leopard, and Jaguar, and is perhaps the most diurnal of the genus.
    In the form of the aesophagus, and in the transverse rugae of                                                                 its

immaterial differences, into the Windyia, the Ghauts, the Nilgiris, the
Casiah Hills, and in the chain passing brokenly from Mirzapore
through South Bahar and Orissa to the Coromandel Coast.
     Of this race, although so wild as to be rarely seen, Mr. Hodgson
has succeeded in obtaining many individuals; some of which lived in
 confinement many months, and even produced young, having been
 pregnant when they reached him. He is consequently enabled to
 describe not only the form and colours, but the manners also, which
 he does in great detail.          The form he compares particularly with
 that of the Indian Jackal and the Indian For, short notices of which
 he gives as an Appendix, and comparative figures of which with the
 Büäns<U+017F>, he also forwards with his paper. The paper is also accom
 panied by comparative figures of the crania of these several species ;
 and the description given of this important part of the animal structure
 is also comparative.

    had added to science.        These specimens were exhibited.
        In bringing them severally under the notice of the Society, the

well with the figure published by Rondelet.

   Mr. Gray gave some account of the reproduction of Cirrhipeda,
founded on observations made by him on Balanus Cranchii, Leach,
during a recent visit to the coast of Devonshire.  In illustration of
his remarks he exhibited an adult of that species with the eggs at
tached to the body at the base of the shell, and the young in ovo.
He also exhibited numerous very minute individuals of Bal. vulgaris
affixed to rock.
  He described the mode of reproduction as ovoviviparous. On
opening under water, after they had been preserved in spirit, the
eggs attached to the body of the adult, each was found to contain
a perfectly developed animal, which occupied nearly the whole of
its cavity. The form of the young Barnacle at this period of                                                      its

it impossible for any false generalizations to stand for an instant the
test of close examination.     It soon became evident to Mr. H. that
Farey's views on this subject were totally untenable, leading in some
cases to absolute geometrical impossibilities; and in many cases to
results which, it was conceived, ought to be regarded as geologically
impossible.    The mode of investigation adopted by Mr. H. for the
purpose of ascertaining the exact disposition of the toadstone beds,
was the obvious one of tracing their basseting edges, which he was
                º
able to do with clearness and certainty, and thus to arrive immedi
ately at demonstrable results with respect to                                all

   The short time which Mr. H. was able to devote to these inves-,
tigations last autumn, prevented his entering into                detailed exami     a

            other parts           of

  It  is manifest from the above statement, that the western portion

 he  should find any fault coextensive with that boundary.

              proceeded                to

                                the last summer. The communication was
divided into three       parts.
     In the first part were considered the relations                the Forest rocks  of
to   those        of
                the neighbouring districts.          The phaenomena were illus
 trated          by
              sections.         was shown, that the coal fields
                                       It                                     the west             on

          the Forest were under the new red sandstone; that the Forest
is  almost surrounded               plain  by
                                            a  red marl and sandstone, resting

                                           the older strata; and that the lias
and inferior oolites overlie the red marl                regular order, forming
                                                                       in                                            a

author    asserted,     that the works carried                Billesdon Coplow

neral surveyor, the marlstone and lower oolites (though lying over
the regular lias terrace and full                          of
                                               fossils,) had been mistaken for
the new red sandstone.
     Inthe second part the author described the rocks               the Forest, show  of
ing them          to       be
                    composed         greenish slate (like the great middle group
                                            of
of  Cumberland), alternating with, and seeming                   pass into, great ta
bular masses          porphyry
                           of     and   compact    felspar.                       It to
                                                                 was stated that the
porphyry abounded             the N.W. corner
                                      at               the district, almost
                                                                      of             the                        to

exclusion of the slate. Besides these masses of rock, which are more
or less perfectly stratified, there are at several places on the outskirts
of the Forest large protuberances of syenite, sometimes passing into
true granite. Similar masses break out of the red marl at Enderby,
Stony Stanton, and four other places about ten miles south of Charn.
wood Forest. What the author considered most important was the
establishment of a single anticlinal axis, ranging from the neighbour
hood of Bradgate Park in a direction about N.W., through the longest
diameter of the district.       On the opposite sides of this line the beds
have  opposite   dips,  and the whole Forest ridge is therefore composed
of a single  saddle,   the sides of which are generally inclined at a con
siderable  angle.
   In the third part, Professor Sedgwick briefly considered the date of
the elevation of the Forest ridge, and the effects produced by it on the
neighbouring country. In the first place, he showed by sections that
the forest ridge had been elevated, and that many of the valleys be
longing to         its
                 actual configuration existed, prior           the deposit                                   of
                                                                               the  of to
new red   sandstone;     secondly,   from the  position      five highly inclined
            mountain limestone appearing
           of                                                        on

                                                                     a
   the N.W. corner         the Forest ridge, that the movement                                     In of
to                             of                                       elevation
was posterior        the deposit
                         to                    of
                                       the carboniferous series.       short, the
five masses above mentioned were stated               dip under the Ashby dela
                                                                          to

                                                            accounted for      the                           by
prolongation        the anticlinal line above mentioned. Still further

in  Derbyshire       nearly horizontal. Lastly, the author expressed his
                         is
 opinion that the coal field              of
                                    Nuneaton had been elevated                 un                       by   an
 dulation      the lower strata, parallel

 date with, Charnwood Forest; and that both these elevations were
 probably      the same epoch with the disturbing forces which threw

widely different from that usually given. The doctrine of an excess
of carbonic acid in the atmosphere, at the time when the coal was
deposited, being the cause of the very large quantity of carbon which
coal now contains, was alluded to; but difficulties were said to attend
that hypothesis, which by many is considered to be more plausible
than correct.   After the lecture the visitors adjourned to the mu
seum of anatomy, where specimens were exhibited of the anatomical
structure of coal coniferae, and of coal itself, seen under the micro
scope, together with a spirited sketch by Mr. Hardy of the sup
posed appearance of the vegetation of Newcastle at the period of
the coal deposit.

    SCHEELE's ARTIFICIAL MALIC ACID—oxALHYDRIC ACID.
   In our Number for March last we have briefly noticed M. Gué
rin's experiments on artificial malic acid. The author has continued
his experiments, and the results are, that the acid produced by the
action of nitric acid and gum differs from vegetable malic acid, and
for a reason which will presently appear, the author has called it or
alhydric acid. We have given the author's original mode of prepara
tion, but he appears to have improved      and now states      follows:     it,                               it   as

Schemnitz by the following process: Reduce the ore to powder and
wash it to separate the foreign oxides and earthy substances, which, as
they contain tellurium, are not however to be rejected. Then mix

    Tellurium combines with two proportions of oxygen to form tel
lurous and telluric acid: the former is already known as oxide of
tellurium. It has two isomeric modifications: one of them is pro

responding with the modification A of tellurous acid; it differs from
it in giving peculiar and very different salts from those yielded by
the acid soluble in water, or modification B.
   When telluric acid is exposed to a still higher temperature, it is
decomposed, gives oxygen gas, and leaves tellurous acid as white as
snow. Tellurous acid consists of one atom of radical and two atoms
of oxygen, and telluric acid of one of the former and three of oxygen,
or 72.78 of metal and 27-22 oxygen. Like the tellurous acid, it has
a tendency to form salts with one, two and four atoms of acid to
one of base, and the salts of modification B, are at first converted
by heat into those of A: they then, at a red heat, give out oxygen,
                                  -
and become tellurites.
   Telluric acid is not decomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen; it may
consequently be obtained by decomposing tellurate of lead by sul
phuretted hydrogen and water: but if a weak solution of telluric
acid in water, be saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen, and kept
well stopped in a warm place, sulphuret of tellurium is deposited,
which usually covers the interior of the bottle with a blackish grey
crust of a metallic lustre: it is easily detached.—Journal de Phar

gave encouragement           the expectation that many more remains

                              is       of

these immense animals must have existed coeval perhaps with the
very earliest vegetable state       our globe.    of
   We cannot close these remarks without congratulating the stu
dent      natural history upon the discovery
          of                                            deposit     such of     a                    of             in
terest     as   that     of   the Burdiehouse limestone.                        It   is    not exceeded             in

importance by any other ossiferous bed which has yet been described,
and it gives new features to the striking geology of the vicinity of
Edinburgh.
   Mr. Conybeare, in transmitting an account of this discovery, ob
serves, that the formation here described may very possibly be
closely related to the bituminous schist, containing shells, apparently
fluviatile, and fish, discovered in 1830 by Messrs. Murchison and
Sedgwick, in Caithness, and by them considered as occupying the
relative position of the carboniferous group.       This formation has
been fully described by them in the Geological Transactions; and
the fish discovered are there carefully figured, with which it will be
interesting to compare those of Burdiehouse.       With regard to the
discovery of Saurian remains in rocks of this age, Mr. Lyell has
already observed, (vol. i. p. 129,) that amongst other fossils col
lected from the mountain limestone of Northumberland, the Rev.
 Charles V. Vernon had been fortunate enough
                   Unius sese dominum fecisse lacertae,
having found there a Saurian vertebra.
   Although in England the lias is the oldest formation which has
presented any very decided or abundant specimens of Saurian ani
mals, still, on the Continent, especially around the Thuringer wald,
 they are commonly found in the cupriferous schist coeval with
                                       -
 our own magnesian limestone: these remains were referred by Cu
 vier to the genus Monitor, and here also they were associated with
 the remains of fresh-water fish.
    As the whole formation of Zechstein (our magnesian lime) is im
 mediately next in order of age to the carboniferous group,-as the
 cupriferous schist is      its
                             lowest member, and the fossils     the for             of
 mation   generally  present      an
                                 intermediate link between the inferior
 carboniferous and superior muschelkalk and lias, we cannot       much                   be
 surprised   by any new instance        of
                                       analogy between the said schist
 and the coal measures.

of a brass rod once or twice rapidly over                 surface may, by           its

from it: suspend minute weights from the northern arm at
any given point, say, for instance, midway between the centre

the force of the deflection minus the directive influence of the
earth's magnetism on the needle so circumstanced.                Remove

of the terrestrial magnetism on the needle will undergo some
 corresponding change, which will bear a constant ratio to the
 change in the deflecting forces, the extent of which is known.
        If
         the forces of deflection and of the terrestrial magnetism
 should both change, then, from what has been said above, it
 appears that the relative amount of each can be estimated.
    In the foregoing examples, I have assumed that the deflec
 tor and needle suffer equal changes of intensity; and this,                                               I

90    Remarks on Prof. Moseley's Principle of least Pressure.
have taken a wrong view of the matter,(which I confess is not
                                        I
improbable, since what have written is so very obvious that it
must have occurred to Mr. Moseley and been considered by
him invalid,)         I
                 cannot comprehend why we are to consider the
forces as functions of the coordinates of the points at which they
act. If there be a reason, it most certainly does not appear
on the face of the demonstration of the principle.
   In Mr. Moseley’s communication to your Journal of this
month, he mentions, as a valuable instance for showing the                                         in
correctness of the notions which have hitherto been held on the
subject of pressures, the case of a mass supported on three
props, at the angular points of a triangle, whose centre of gravity
is in the same vertical line as that of the given mass. The
pressure upon each prop in this case, as is well known, is
equal to one third of the weight of the body supported.
“Now,” says Mr. Moseley, “this condition continuing to be
satisfied, let us suppose the third point of support to move
into the same with the other two. The fraction          expressing                   §
 the evanescent ratio of each elementary triangle to the whole
 triangle, will then manifestly have the value #. And three
 points of support in the same straight line will each of them
 sustain the same pressure.”             I am, however, of opinion that
 the conclusion from this          reasoning     is not so manifest as Mr.
 Moseley seems to think it is ; for let A, B, C be the angular
peints of the triangle in
                                            at its
                                     finite state, then        we inquire into if
the cause        the pressure
                 of                    any one        them (suppose C), we

erted   any   pressure,        would overthrow the body              turning             by        it

   In confirmation of my views, I beg leave to lay before
your readers the following principle, which I have had nu
merous opportunities of confirming.     If y, a be two quantities
such that y =  q r, and if 3 be an  independent   quantity which
comes into the investigation of the  equation  y = 4 w of neces
sity, although it does not appear in the resulting equation                                             it
self, then, notwithstanding the equation y = 4 w is true in
general, there may happen to be values of 6 which cause
some of the steps of the demonstration to vanish or become
impossible; and in such cases the equation y = 4 w is not ne
cessarily true, though it may happen to be so. This princi
ple   I  have found to be most frequently necessary when p a
= constant.              I
                   shall add two instances.

                        If                                this, we shall        of

of the cyanurets of potassium, sodium and barium, is to cal
cine the anhydrous ferrocyanurets in covered porcelain cru
cibles.   He gives no process for the preparation of the cya
nuret of strontium; but he mentions that the cyanurets of
calcium and magnesium may be prepared by dissolving the
hydrates of lime and magnesia in dilute hydrocyanic acid.
   Thénard mentions two general processes for the prepara
tion of the alkaline cyanurets. He prepares them by saturat
ing the bases with hydrocyanic acid, or by heating the an
hydrous ferrocyanurets to redness in close vessels.
   It is also necessary to state that Dr. Nimmo, in his process
for the preparation of hydrocyanic acid, recommends that the
cyanuret of barium should be prepared by decomposing the
solution of the sulphuret of barium by the bicyanuret of mer
curV.
   However, even the cyanuret of potassium was not obtained
in a pure form until recently; for, according to Mr. Laming,
the cyanuret obtained by heating the anhydrous ferrocya
nuret of potassium to redness in earthen vessels is always more
or less impure. Although this statement does not agree with
the experiments of other chemists, it must be admitted that
the cyanuret obtained by this process is frequently of a yellow
colour, and consequently very impure.               consequence of    |.
Mr. Laming's observations, we endeavoured to obtain the
cyanuret of potassium by some other process; the results of
our experiments on this subject, together with those on some
other cyanurets, are contained in the following paper.          In                             all
probability these processes cannot           employed        prepare

            state the new modes          which   they by
                                                       may        ob                      be

     1.   It   is
            stated     most chemical works that the solution of
                           in

                    potassium      decomposed is     the bicyanuret
of mercury, cyanuret              of
                            potassium remaining       solution, and
the cyanuret          of
                    barium was obtained         Dr. Nimmo        bythe                    by
                                       a no
analogous process; but          other protocyanuret has hitherto
been obtained           by
                       such      process. The following experi
ments show that other     cyanurets  may      prepared      besimilar           by   a
mode.

 one of the bicyanuret of mercury.      The sulphurets of potas
sium, sodium, barium and strontium should be prepared for
this experiment by heating the anhydrous sulphates to red
ness with half their weight of charcoal; and the sulphuret of
calcium by transmitting a current of sulphuretted hydrogen
gas through lime, suspended in recently boiled distilled water
previously allowed to cool in close vessels.      As the protosul
phuret of magnesium cannot be prepared by heating sulphate
of magnesia with charcoal, it must be prepared by transmit
ting sulphuretted hydrogen gas through magnesia suspended in
water, or by decomposing the solution of the sulphate of mag
nesia by means of sulphuret of barium.        In order to obtain a
pure protocyanuret by this process, great care must be taken,
otherwise an excess of the alkaline sulphuret will redissolve
some of the precipitated bisulphuret of mercury, and an ex
cess of the bicyanuret of mercury would also cause serious
mistakes.     The proportion of one equivalent of the bicya
nuret to two equivalents of the protosulphuret must be rigidly
adopted, and before filtration the solution should be tested
to ascertain that it is pure.
   It is not advisable to attempt to crystallize the protocyanu
rets obtained by this process in the open air, owing to the
rapid decomposition produced by the carbonic acid existing
in the atmosphere, and to the tendency which the cyanurets
have to resolve themselves into new compounds.
   All the solutions have an alkaline reaction and evolve the
odour of hydrocyanic acid.
   2. The cyanurets of potassium, sodium and magnesium may
be readily obtained by decomposing the solution of the cy
anuret of barium by a solution of the sulphates of potash,
soda, or magnesia; for sulphate of baryta is immediately pre
cipitated, and a very pure cyanuret of potassium, sodium, or
magnesium remains in solution. Should an easy mode of pre
paring the cyanuret of barium be discovered, this process will
probably afford the most easy mode of preparing a solution of
the cyanuret of magnesium; but the solution cannot be eva
porated by the aid of heat without decomposition.
   3. The following process is not applicable to the formation
of large quantities of the cyanurets of potassium and sodium ;
but it is interesting in a theoretical point of view, being ana
logous to the reduction of chloride of silver by fused earbo
nate of soda.                                   -
   On   projecting  powdered   bicyanuret  of  mercury  (dried by
a  water-bath,)   by small  portions  upon  carbonate of potash,
heated to a temperature just approaching low redness, the
carbonate of potash turns black and enters into a state of semi

fusion; cyanogen is not evolved, but metallic mercury is sub
limed, oxygen and carbonic acid gases are disengaged with
effervescence, and at length the mixture becomes white.        On
the addition of a fresh  portion   of the bicyanuret  of mercury,
the same phaenomena take place; but the mixture then enters
into complete fusion.                                      -      -
   The bicyanuret of mercury employed in this experiment
must be quite pure and well dried, otherwise the cyanuret of
potassium has a yellow colour.        Atomic proportions may be
employed; but as it is better to allow the alkaline carbonate
to be in slight excess, the best proportions are 120 grains of
the dry bicyanuret of mercury to 70 grains of anhydrous car
bonate of potash. When the mass is cold, the cyanuret of
potassium may be separated from any undecomposed carbo
nate of potash by digestion in boiling rectified spirit, and the
cyanuret may be obtained in crystals by concentrating the      al
coholic solution; but this is not often necessary, as cyanuret
of potassium is not very soluble in alcohol.
   The process may be performed in a green glass tube, or in
a clean Hessian crucible.      It cannot be performed at a full
red  heat;  for, under certain circumstances, cyanuret of potas
sium   appears   to be volatile in an open crucible at that tem
perature; thus, on projecting dry bicyanuret of mercury into
fused carbonate of potash, cyanogen gas is copiously evolved
and inflames, whilst the crucible becomes filled with a kind of
mist; but immediately after this appearance cyanogen ceases
to be evolved.     Sometimes the whole of the matter is dissi
pated; but usually after the crucible is cold a yellowish mass is
found at the bottom, much less in weight than the cyanuret
obtained at a low red heat, and the aqueous solution of this sub
stance does not evolve the odour of hydrocyanic acid, but ef
fervesces strongly with acids.     Finally, the process cannot be
performed in platinum vessels, for platinum is attacked. It is
evident that in this process both the bicyanuret of mercury
and the carbonate of potash are decomposed, the metallic
mercury being sublimed, and the carbonic acid and oxygen
gases expelled, whilst cyanogen unites with potassium.            -
   Cyanuret of sodium may be obtained by a similar process,
substituting about 54 grains of anhydrous carbonate of soda
for 70 grains of carbonate of potash. The process requires
to be performed at a temperature rather higher than a low
red heat.     The tube employed must be made of green glass,
or the  process  may be performed in the bottom of a Florence
flask; for a common glass tube is rapidly attacked, blackened,
softened, and finally destroyed.
   The changes which take place during the formation of this

  Messrs. F. and E. Rodgers on certain Metallic Cyanurets. 95
cyanuret are similar to those already described. The cyanuret
of sodium is separated from the undecomposed carbonate of
soda by treating the white residuum with boiling rectified
spirit, and may be obtained in crystals from the solution. It
is not very soluble in alcohol. The carbonates of lime, baryta
and strontia cannot be decomposed by the bicyanuret of mer
cury at a red heat. The bicyanuret is decomposed by heat,
as usual, with the evolution of cyanogen; but the carbonate
does not undergo any change.
   4. Cyanuret of potassium may be prepared by exposing a
mixture of anhydrous carbonate of potash and anhydrous
ferrocyanuret of potassium to a moderate red heat, in a covered
porcelain crucible, for about twenty minutes. When the cruci
ble is quite cold, a dark mass is seen, which adheres rather
firmly to the bottom; on treating this dark mass with hot     al
 cohol, a colourless solution of cyanuret of potassium is readily
 obtained.     The aqueous solution produces no change in the
 solutions of the persalts of iron, but it immediately throws
 down the orange protocyanuret of iron from the solutions of
 the protosalts.    The proportions employed should be nearly
 one    equivalent of anhydrous carbonate of potash to one equi
 valent of the anhydrous ferrocyanuret of potassium.        The
 process is very productive, for the weight of the cyanuret of
 potassium obtained by this process is much greater than the
 weight of the cyanuret obtained by heating ferrocyanuret of
 potassium alone, owing to the cyanogen of the cyanuret of
 iron uniting with the potassium contained in the carbonate of
 potash; and moreover the process occupies less time. Some
 carburet of iron always remains in the crucible.
     5. Cyanuret of potassium may be obtained by heating a
 mixture of anhydrous carbonate of potash and pure Prussian
 blue to redness in covered crucibles.     It appears that ferro
 cyanuret of potassium is generated, and that the cyanuret of
 potassium results from the subsequent decomposition of this
  salt.   The proportion should be about 242 grains of pure
  Prussian blue, and 315 grains of anhydrous carbonate of
 potash.      The cyanuret of potassium may be separated by
 means of alcohol from the undecomposed carbonate of potash.
  After the cyanuret of potassium has been dissolved by alcohol,
  and the undecomposed carbonate of potash by water, the black
  residue dissolves with effervescence in dilute muriatic acid.
  The gas generated during the solution has a most offensive
  odour.
      Cyanuret of sodium may be obtained by an analogous pro
  cess, substituting 243 grains of anhydrous carbonate of soda
  for 315 grains of carbonate of potash. The same changes occur

 96 Messrs.   F. and E. Rodgers     on certain  Metallic Cyanurets.
 when the mass is heated; and the cyanuret of sodium may be
 separated from any undecomposed carbonate of soda by means
 of boiling rectified spirit.
     The quantity of the cyanurets obtained by this mode is ex
 tremely variable: the difference appears to depend upon the
 more or less rapid application of heat.
     6. Cyanuret of barium may be obtained in a pure form by
 the process described by Berzelius and Thénard; viz. by
 heating the dry ferrocyanuret of barium to redness in covered
 porcelain crucibles.    The cyanuret of barium is very soluble
 in  water, but it also dissolves in boiling rectified spirit.
     7. The cyanurets of the common metals, and the double
 cyanurets formed by the union of these compounds with the
 cyanurets of the bases of the alkalies and alkaline earths, are
 described in the system of Berzelius; but the following expe
 riments appear to show that the latter compounds may be
 formed by processes different from those mentioned by that       di
 stinguished chemist.      It appears that Gay-Lussac procured
 the double   cyanuret   of iron and potassium by digesting the
 black oxide of iron in a solution of cyanuret of potassium.
 The cyanuret of potassium dissolved a portion of the oxide,
 but the solution continued alkaline: on the addition of hydro
 cyanic acid a fresh portion of the oxide was dissolved and the
 solution became neutral. Gay-Lussac also obtained the double
 cyanuret of silver and potassium by digesting cyanuret of
 silver in a solution of cyanuret of potassium; part of the cy
anuret of silver was dissolved, and the solution became neutral
on the addition of hydrocyanic acid.       Berzelius, who describes
these   compounds     as the  discovery   of Ittner, does not men
tion the latter important circumstance.
    The following experiments appear to show that cyanuret of
potassium is capable of dissolving many other oxides.
    Hydrated protoxide of copper, prepared by precipitating the
sulphate by pure potash, was digested, whilst moist, in a solu
tion of cyanuret of potassium, which dissolved a certain por
tion, but continued alkaline. On the addition of hydrocyanic
acid, the oxide assumed a yellow colour, an additional quan
tity was dissolved, and the solution, which had a red colour,
became quite neutral.      The presence of copper cannot be de
tected by any of the usual reagents, until the solution is boiled
with a little sulphuric acid.     Berzelius states that the solution
prepared by Ittner was of a yellow colour, and gave little
yellow prisms on cooling, whilst Gmelin prepared a double
cyanuret of copper and potassium in colourless rhombohedral
prisms.
    The solution prepared by the process just described is

  Messrs. F. and E. Rodgers on certain Metallic Cyanurets. 97
usually       red, but in one experiment it was quite colourless.
 Another solution, prepared by precipitating the acetate of
 copper by means of cyanuret of potassium, and redissolving
 the precipitate in an excess of the latter salt, was of a beauti
ful purple tint, similar to the salts of permanganic acid; but
 this solution was instantly changed to yellow, and finally de
 colourized by the application of heat.
     The double cyanuret of copper and potassium, like the cy
 anuret of potassium, throws down a yellow precipitate from
 the solution of the protosulphate of copper; but it is easily                                     di
 stinguished by      its   neutrality, and             by
                                                  causing       white precipi
                                                                           a
  tate   in the solution      ofthe protosulphate        iron,  whilst the cy
                                                                 of
  anuret      ofpotassium     throws down        orangean    precipitate   from
  the same salt.

                                                                      of

cyanuret of potassium, adding hydrocyanic acid as before. The
excess of oxide of nickel assumes a dusky yellow colour. The
solution is yellow, and is not affected by any of the reagents
which detect the presence of oxide of nickel.               The solution
throws down from the sulphate of copper a pale yellow gela
tinous precipitate, soluble in ammonia, forming a colourless
solution; but if the salt of copper is in excess, the solution
is blue: the precipitate, somewhat changed, is thrown down
from the ammoniacal solution by the nitric, muriatic and sul
phuric acids. A white flocculent precipitate is produced in
the solution of the nitrate of silver, which is soluble in ammo
nia, insoluble in nitric acid, and unchanged by the solar
rays.      From the protosulphate of iron a white precipitate is
thrown     down,  which changes to a very light blue after stand
ing some time. The solution precipitates the persalts of iron
reddish yellow, and the precipitate, which is rather bulky, be
comes redder after standing some time, but never becomes
blue. The solution throws down a white precipitate, with
a slight tinge of blue, from the solution of pure sulphate of
nickel, and a flocculent white precipitate, soluble in nitric acid,
from the acetate of lead.
    When a current of chlorine is transmitted through the so
lution, a white precipitate takes place. The filtered solution
is still neutral, but no longer precipitates the salts of lead.
    A double cyanuret of cobalt and potassium may be formed

is taken up, the solution returns to                         its

prepared by digesting the hydrated oxide with cyanuret of
potassium, owing to the oxide of manganese passing into a
higher state of oxidation, and to the rapid decomposition of
the double cyanuret itself.        No experiment was made with
the anhydrous protoxide of manganese; but, as it has been
lately shown that ferrocyanuret of potassium is generated when
the anhydrous protoxide of iron is digested in a hot solution
of cyanuret of potassium, it is probable that the anhydrous
protoxide of manganese is soluble in the same solution.
   The hydrate of the oride of chromium does not dissolve in
the solution of the cyanuret of potassium until hydrocyanic
acid is added; the colour of the oxide is then changed to a
reddish brown, and a very small portion is dissolved. The so
lution continues strongly alkaline.        Acetic acid throws down
a brown precipitate from the solution.            The solution of the
oxide is not assisted by digestion in the alkaline cyanuret.
It appears from these experiments that the sesquioxide of
chromium has very little tendency to form a double cyanuret
when digested with an alkaline cyanuret.
   It appears that the sesquicyanuret of uranium has very little
disposition to unite with cyanuret of potassium. It dissolves
very sparingly in the solution of the cyanuret: the solution,
which is alkaline, has a light yellow colour, and the undissolved
sesquicyanuret of uranium retains                               its
                                           beautiful yellow tint. On

     The double cyanuret of copper and barium may be formed
 by adding a solution of sulphate of copper to cyanuret of
 barium.      The presence of copper in the solution cannot be
 detected until it is digested with a little sulphuric acid; after
 filtration, the copper may be precipitated by ferrocyanate of
 potash.     When a double cyanuret is prepared, by decom
 posing cyanuret of barium by a soluble sulphate, it is abso
 lutely necessary to add the solution of the sulphate to that of
 the cyanuret. It appears that a metallic cyanuret and sulphate
 of baryta are generated; the former then unites with an ex
 cess of cyanuret of barium, and the latter is precipitated.       On
 the addition of a fresh     portion  of the  sulphate,  the  hydracid
 is precipitated in combination with the oxide, or the base of
 the hydracid in combination with the metal.
     9. For experiment, the solutions of the double cyanurets
 may be readily prepared by the following process, which is a
 mere modification of that recommended in the work of Ber
 zelius, who recommends the cyanurets to be precipitated,
 washed, and then dissolved in a solution of cyanuret of potas
sium.       During this process certain cyanurets—for example,
 copper—appear to undergo some change.
     It is better, therefore, to precipitate sulphate of copper by
means of cyanuret of potassium, and immediately redissolve
 the precipitate by an additional quantity of cyanuret of potas
 sium. The solution thus obtained has a yellow colour, simi
lar to the solution described by Ittner: it is quite neutral.
     A double cyanuret of cobalt and potassium may be prepared
by precipitating the nitrate of cobalt by means of cyanuret of
potassium, and dissolving the precipitate as before.
     A double cyanuret of nickel and potassium may be obtained
by decomposing sulphate of nickel in a similar way: the solu
tion is yellow.
     If required, the double cyanurets may be separated from
 the sulphate of potash by evaporation and crystallization.
     10. The experiments mentioned in this paper have as yet
entirely related to the alkaline and double cyanurets; but the
following facts seem to be worth recording, although they re
fer to the pure cyanurets of the common metals, which are
much better known.
    The protocyanuret of lead may be readily thrown down as
a dense, white precipitate, from the solution of the acetate, by
means of hydrocyanic acid.         It is soluble in nitric acid. Hot
water     changes   the white colour of the cyanuret to a faint

flesh colour, and then dissolves it: the filtered solution is
colourless.   A small portion of the cyanuret appears to re
main undissolved, even in a large quantity of water. The
cyanuret of lead is sparingly soluble in cold water.
   The protocyanuret of copper cannot be conveniently preci
pitated from the acetate by means of hydrocyanic acid. The
solution of the acetate becomes turbid, and remains in that
state for a considerable time. The acid employed in this expe
riment was that prepared according to the process of Mr.
Laming.
     The  sesquicyanuret of chromium, according to Berzelius, has
not   yet  been obtained in an isolated form; but it seems that it
may be prepared by the following process. When a solution
of cyanuret of potassium is added to a solution of the double
sulphate of chromium and potash, in cold distilled water, an
immediate grayish white precipitate is obtained, which falls in
distinct masses. The precipitate is broken up by agitation,
and then subsides rapidly in the form of a rather dark green
powder.       On the addition of another portion of cyanuret of
potassium, a fresh precipitation takes place. Finally, after                                               all

 aqueous solution of the crystallized red double cyanuret of
 iron and potassium may be readily decomposed by an alco
 holic solution of tartaric acid : the bitartrate of potash is com
 pletely thrown down, and a yellow solution is obtained, which
 has a strong acid reaction. 65.89 grains of the crystallized
 salt are exactly decomposed by 90 grains of crystallized tar
 taric acid; but as the red cyanuret is very insoluble in strong
 alcohol, it is better to use a slight excess of the cyanuret.
 The red cyanuret employed must be quite free from chloride
 of potassium. The tartaric acid should be dissolved in alco
 hol and then added to the saturated aqueous solution of the
 double cyanuret.     The filtered solution of the hydracid must
 be   preserved in green   glass bottles, well protected from the
 light; but, whatever care is taken, the solution gradually be
comes darker, then assumes a dark green tint, and is at length
 completely destroyed.
    The solution produces in metallic solutions precipitates si
milar to those produced by the red double cyanuret itself.
 Like that salt, the hydracid produces a deep blue precipitate
in the solutions of the protosalts of iron.      The hydracid im
mediately darkens the colour of the solutions of the persalts of
iron; but the solution of the red cyanuret produces no imme
diate change in moderately dilute solutions: gradually, how
ever, it changes the colour to a deep brownish red, and ulti
mately produces a green precipitate.        When the hydracid or
a solution of the red cyanuret is added to a strong solution of
the persalts of iron, the final precipitate is a mixture of blue
and green. The green precipitate becomes blue at the tem
perature of 212°. If washed and dried without exposure to
heat, it becomes a green powder, which is readily decomposed
by a dilute solution of potash; peroxide of iron subsides, and
the supernatant yellow solution throws down a green precipi
tate from the persalts, and a blue precipitate from the proto
salts of iron.
    Perhaps the hydracid just described may be called the per
ferrocyanic acid, as that term will express the analogy which
exists between this compound and the persalts of iron.         It is
difficult to imagine in what manner the double cyanuret of
iron and potassium, which produces green precipitates in the
solutions of the persalts of iron, differs from the red double
cyanuret.
    12. In a paper published in the Glasgow Medical Journal
in the year 1831, Mr. Clarke recommended that hydrocyanic
acid should be prepared for medical use by the decomposition
of cyanuret of potassium by tartaric acid. This process, slightly

modified in the details, has been lately recommended to the no
tice of the medical profession by Mr. Laming.      In the original
process a small portion of bitartrate of potash always remained
in solution, so that the acid was always distilled when required
for chemical use. The alcohol employed by Mr. Laming to
precipitate the bitartrate of potash renders the acid even more
unfit for chemical purposes, although it is highly useful to add
a small portion in the preparation of the medicinal acid.
    However, pure hydrocyanic acid may be obtained at once
by the decomposition of a solution of the cyanuret of calcium
by oxalic acid. Heat is developed during the decomposition.
The oxalate of lime is completely precipitated in a few hours,
leaving the supernatant acid quite pure; but if slight traces
of oxalate of lime are held in suspension, one filtration is suffi
 cient, whilst in the process of Proust two filtrations are re
 quired. The liquid is quite pure, as the oxalate of lime is                                       in
 soluble in hydrocyanic acid. In this process, as well as in
 Mr. Clarke's, the use of a mineral acid is avoided. The chief
 objection to     adoption for the preparation
                  its                                 hydrocyanic             of

because,  from theoretical considerations, which everybody
knows, he halves the combining proportion of hydrogen, and
therefore makes water to consist of one atom of oxygen united
with two atoms of hydrogen.
   The same observations apply to the expression used by me
for phosphoric   acid, namely, P.   I view the phosphorus in
this acid as one  atom, just as                         I
                                view the nitrogen united with
five atoms of oxygen in the case of nitric acid, or with three
atoms of hydrogen in the case of ammonia, as one atom:
Berzelius views it as two, and therefore expresses phosphoric
acid by F.               In       the original paper,                    I   thought     I   had rendered
this evident, by always stating first in words what was after
wards expressed by a formula, and particularly by adopting
the admirable plan of Berzelius of stating the relation between
the oxygen in the acid and that in the base or water; but in
this your remarks prove that I have been unsuccessful.

108      Mr. Beke          on the Former Eatent               of the Persian Gulf, and
silence of the Scriptures as to their identity; but, from other
circumstances, I am fully persuaded,—and the silence of the
Scriptures unquestionably aids the conviction,--that these
three places, although bearing the same name, were totally
distinct from each other.
     I
     proceed to detail my reasons for this conclusion:—The
City of Babylon, of which Nebuchadnezzar was king, is ge
nerally supposed to have been situate at Hillah, on the Eu
phrates, about 200 miles, in a direct line, from        junction                      its
with the  Tigris, and rather more than 300 miles from the point
at  which the united rivers empty themselves into the Persian
Gulf. What the nature         this countryof    the present day,    is   at
will     be

those mighty rivers.    The extent of this alluvial soil can of
course be   easily ascertained,  and we may obtain, conse
quently, the means of determining what was the extent north
ward of the Persian Gulf at some former period; though, from
our inability to calculate the rate at which the new land has
been formed, we may not be able to arrive at any certain con
clusion as to the period when the change from sea to land of
any portion of the country actually took place. Mr. Lyell
remarks”, that “The union of the Tigris and the Euphrates
must undoubtedly have been one of the modern geographical
changes on our earth.”     By this expression it would almost
seem  that Mr. Lyell meant it to be inferred that the union of
the two rivers has not taken place within the historical aera,
as have those                of the Ganges and Burrampooter,                                                and other
rivers instanced by him; but this could hardly, I should
think, have been his intention, when we consider that Pliny
expressly tells us that “between the mouths of these two
rivers where they fall into the sea, were counted, in old times,
twenty-five  miles, or, as some would have
                                                                                               of it,

110      Mr. Beke             on the Former           Ertent of the Persian Gulf, and
establishes the fact that “nowhere were new lands formed
more quickly or in greater quantities,” but would also seem
to determine the actual rate at which the Persian Gulf had
been filled up during the 400 years immediately preceding his
time:—Alexandria (on the site of which Charax afterwards
stood,) having been built by Alexander the Great, at the                                                          di
stance of ten stadia only from the sea; whilst in Juba's time
it was 50 thousand paces, or about 50 miles, and in Pliny’s
own time as much as 120 thousand paces, or about 120
miles, from the sea".
   But whatever may have been the actual rate of advance on
the Persian Gulf of the alluvial tract thus formed, I think
that—taking into consideration the present state of the coun
try in the neighbourhood of Babylon, as described by Mr.
Rich, and keeping in mind the changes which, from the state
ments of the historians above mentioned, must indubitably
have taken place in it,-the legitimate inference            that     the                 is,             in

   Remark.—I have used the revolving mirror for many years
as an instrument of optical and photometrical research ; but
the idea of applying it to determine the velocity of electricity
belongs entirely to Mr. Wheatstone. . The electrical experi
ment which         I
              proposed in this Journal was distinctly stated to
be founded  upon   his experiment exhibited at the Royal Insti
tution, only proposed to be tried upon a much larger scale,
(viz. with a wire of some miles in length,) but since Mr.
Wheatstone says in his letter" (which have only lately seen,   I
having been abroad for some months,) that he had already
tried an experiment upon the same principle,       most willingly               I
yield to him the priority of             trifle, not worth

XXV.       Observations on the supposed Vision of the Blood-ves
  sels of the Eye. By SIR DAVID BREwsTER, L.L.D., F.R.S.*
   N the Number of this Journal for September 1832, I had
    occasion to refer to the remarkable experiment described
by Dr. Purkinje of Breslau, in which the blood-vessels of the
retina are supposed to be exhibited; and though I had in vain
tried to see this phaenomenon, yet it had been so accurately
described to me by Mr. Potter that I ventured to give an
opinion respecting                              its
                         cause. The paper which contained this
explanation was read         the Physical section      the British
                                                      in at

Association Oxford          June 1832, and Mr. Wheatstone, who
                            at
was present, favoured the Meeting with some excellent obser
vations               on
             the subject. These observations have been printed
in the Report      the Association for 1832,

rendered permanently visible.        To apply this explanation to the phaenome
mon in question, Mr. W. observed, that whenever the flame of the candle
changes     its
              place, the shadows                      of
                                          the vessels fall      different parts       theon                            of

 Hence the shadow, being thus made               change      place on the retina, re
                                                                to                 its
 mains, according       the law above stated, permanently visible; but instantly
                            to
the flame
             is
             at   rest, the shadow also becomes stationary, and consequently
disappears.

               Vision of the Blood-vessels of the Eye.                                               117
that the ramifications are nothing more than the new forms
given to the luminous and dark parallel lines produced by the
action of light upon the retina. In order to demonstrate this,
let us use Mr. Wheatstone's own apparatus. The general                                               di
rection of the ramifications is invariably perpendicular to the
direction in which the aperture is moved.         we change this          If
direction from a horizontal to a vertical line the ramifications.
change their direction also, so that we can give them any                                            in
 clination we please.   They cannot, therefore, be pictures or
representations of any blood-vessels in the eye.
    This unequivocal result would have induced me to believe
 that the ramifications seen by the common method had a                                                si
 milar origin, and were owing to the action of the rectilineal
 sides of the flame upon the retina, had I not succeeded in
 seeing this phaenomenon with my own eyes. At the Observa
 tory of Cambridge, last summer, Sir John Herschel pointed.
 out to Mr. Airy and myself the method by which he saw the ra
 mifications, and we were        successful     all
                                              observing the same     in
 phaenomenon. This method scarcely differed from that de
 scribed by  Mr. Wheatstone, but the ramifications which saw                                    I
 were toto calo different from those produced        Mr. Wheat                  by
 stone's apparatus: they had not, indeed, one property       com                                in

 difficulty and occasionally       the middle      brownish red

                          in                         optics; and           on                          it
is   anecessary corollary from the law         oblique vision, that  of
any movement           the object must restore

   So far, therefore, Mr. Wheatstone's explanation               unim                        is

placed at a certain distance in front of the retina, and conse
quently in the vitreous humour, it can have no moving shadow;
and unless it is within the refracted come of rays which pro
ceed from the candle, it can have no shadow either moveable

dle: and I have besides ascertained that it has no focus; for if
it had, it would expand and contract by any variation in the
distance of the candle.    It cannot proceed from any imperfect
transparency in any of the coats or humours of the eye, be
cause it is seen in eyes that have the most pure and perfect
vision.   It must, therefore, be light produced by a physiolo
gical action, or light propagated from, or induced by, the di
rect image of the candle upon the retina; and if this is the
case, the explanation which I formerly gave of the phaenome
non is likely to be the true one. The blood-vessels touching
the retina will deaden, as it were, the part of the retina which
they touch, or make it less sensible to the propagated light, and
hence the blood-vessels will appear delineated in a fainter light
than that which surrounds them.                            The distinctness with which.
the ramifications will thus be seen will vary with the intensity
of the brown light, with the ever changing sensibility of the
retina, and with the varying pressure of the blood-vessels
themselves.            If
                    I could command the vision of these ramifica
tions as Mr. Wheatstone can, it would not be difficult to in
stitute experiments by which the preceding explanation could
be cross-examined; and I therefore hope that he will resume
the subject in reference to the facts and views which               have                    I
ventured to state.
   Before concluding this notice                       I
                                         may mention, as connected
with the     subject,   some curious     phaenomena      which appear
when we throw a condensed beam of light upon the retina so
as to fill the whole eye. This may be done by holding near
the eye a convex lens, about an inch in diameter, and an inch
or so in focal length, so as to see                        its
                                            whole area filled with the
light of   a candle      lamp.  or            If
                                      we move the lens backwards
and forwards quickly, looking steadily              one point         at
                                                                      the                   of

   When the eye has not been fatigued by light, the luminous
ground on which these phaenomena are seen has a minutely
granular appearance; and by the continued action of the light
an apparent effervescence appears over the whole, as if each

Clusters of Stars, made at Slough, with a Twenty-feet Reflector, be
tween the Years 1825 and 1833.”        By Sir John F. W. Herschel,
K.H., F.R.S.
     This paper contains the results of observations begun in 1825, and
 assiduously prosecuted till the commencement of the present year,
 for the purpose of reviewing the nebulae and clusters of stars disco
 vered by his father, the late Sir William Herschel, and also of extend
 ing his discoveries, and enlarging our knowledge of the nature and
 physical constitution of those remarkable and mysterious bodies.
 Since the recent improvements in the achromatic telescope, and the
 increased diligence of astronomers in surveying every part of the
 heavens, and detecting the passage of comets, the want of an exten
 sive list of nebulae has become continually more urgent; and hence
 the author was induced to supply, as far as he was able, that deficiency,
 which he has now attempted by simply stating the results of his own
 observations, in preference to waiting until he could present them to
 the Society in the more complete form of a general catalogue of me
 bulae and clusters visible in this latitude.         All the observations here
 given have been reduced to a common epoch, and arranged in the
 order of right ascension : and in every case where the same object
was observed more than once,                             all
                                         the observations relating             have                                to
been collected    together;        which means by    they  not  only   can     used
as   a catalogue for reference, but each result carries with                    own                         its be it
                                                                                                           it

tions of some very extraordinary objects, which have not hitherto suf
ficiently engaged the attention of astronomers, and many of which
possess a symmetry of parts, and a unity of designs, trongly marking
them as systems of a definite nature, each complete in itself, and sub
servient to some distinct, though to us inscrutable, purpose.
    In an Appendix, the author enters into a detailed account of the
manner in which the reductions have been executed, and how the
numbers set down in the catalogue are concluded from those regi
stered at the moment of observation. For effecting these reductions,
he pursued a method materially different, and much more convenient
and exact, than he employed to reduce his earlier catalogue of double
Stars.
    Various remarks are next made on the figured nebulae. It often
occurred to the author, to notice a peculiar state of the atmosphere,
which is quite independent of fog or haziness, in which             large stars                all
above the seventh      magnitude     appear    surrounded with   photospheres,

       GENTLEMEN,                      -
     THE third anniversary      my election     of
                                                this Chair affords me       to
again the opportunity      expressing my grateful thanks for the kind
                                       of
ness which   I have continued    receive from you.
                                                 to   would willingly                 I

                                                     is                          to
not conscious that           doingby       so
                                      should merely vary the form

to use when    Ihave before had the pleasure    addressing you, whilst          of
the sentiments themselves remain not merely unchanged, but,                                                    I
trust, likewise unchangeable.        am thus brief, therefore, Gentle

 men, in the public declaration of my acknowledgements, from a fear
 of being tedious by their too frequent repetition, I hope that you will
 not upon that account consider them the less sincere, or that the
 long experience which I have had of your support and co-operation
 has made me less sensible of their value.
           I
    When last had the honour of addressing you, it was a source of
 pride and happiness to me to be empowered to announce to you the
 gracious intentions of His Majesty to continue to the Royal Society
 the Annual Grant of two Gold Medals, which had been previously
 conferred on the Royal Society by his Royal Predecessor.
    It must be well known to you, Gentlemen, that these Royal
 Medals were not adjudged during the two first years that I presided
 over the Royal Society; and as there exist many circumstances con
 nected with the original grant and distribution of those Medals, as
 well as causes leading to their temporary discontinuance, with which
 the Fellows may not be generally acquainted, I trust that I may be
 allowed to enter into some details respecting them.
    His late Majesty King George the Fourth announced, towards
 the close of the year 1825, through the medium of the Secretary
 of State for the Home Department (Sir Robert Peel), his gra
 cious intention of founding two Gold Medals, of the value of Fifty
 Guineas each, to be annually awarded as honorary premiums, un
 der the direction of the President and Council of the Royal So
 ciety, in such a manner as should, by the excitement of com
 petition among men of science, seem best calculated to promote
 the objects for which the Royal Society was originally instituted.
 This munificent gift of the Patron of the Royal Society was of
 course accepted by the President and Council with every expres
sion of gratitude for so valuable an addition to their means of pro
 moting the interests of science; and it was resolved that, in con
formity with His Majesty's Commands, the Royal Medals should be
adjudged for the most important discoveries or series of investiga
tions completed and made known to the Royal Society in the year
preceding the day of their award; that their presentation should
not be limited to British subjects; and that His Majesty's effigy, if
such should be the Sovereign's pleasure, should form the obverse of
the Medals; and that two Medals from the same die should be struck
upon each foundation, one of gold and the other of silver.
    Upon proceeding to the distribution of the Medals, it was found
that the limitation of time which these Resolutions fixed was of such
a nature as to interfere most materially with the proper observance
of the object proposed to be secured by their foundation; and the
period was therefore, with His Majesty's sanction, extended to five
years: in accordance with this arrangement the Medals continued
to be awarded until the year 1830, inclusive, when the demise of
His late Majesty took place, and in which year I had the honour of
being elected to fill the Chair of the Royal Society.
    Mr. Chantrey, to whom, in conjunction with Sir Thomas Law
rence, was intrusted the selection of the subject for the Medal, fur
nished the cast for the medallion of the head of His late Majesty,

 130                          Royal Society.
   After having settled that part of the business, and apprized the
King of my    success, I then ventured to petition His Majesty for the
continuance of that protection and munificence which the Royal So
ciety had ever experienced from His Illustrious Predecessors. The
Sovereign, with that just and enlightened zeal for the promotion of
every object allied with the honour and prosperity of this country,
which as a loyal subject I acknowledge with gratitude, while as an
affectionate brother I recognise it with pride, acceded at once to my
request, accepted the charge devolved upon him by the demise of
the late King, and ordered, in consequence, that a fresh die should
be cut, and that his effigy should form the obverse side of the
medal.    This work also is completed. All the dies have been exe
cuted by Mr. Wyon with such boldness of outline, depth, and deli
cacy of finish, as do him the highest credit: and I trust that the
medals will be considered in every way worthy of the exalted rank
and dignity of the Illustrious Personage in whose name this mark of
Royal favour is intended to be conferred.
    I am well aware that a diversity of opinion exists respecting the
advantages which are likely to be conferred upon Science by a fre
quent distribution of medals. It is said that they must either con
firm or contradict the judgement which has been either already pro
nounced, or which posterity will most certainly hereafter pronounce,
upon the merits, pretensions, and influence of the discoveries or
series of investigations which such medals are designed to comme
morate: that in the first case they can confer no additional ho
nour upon their author, whose rank has already been ascertained
and fixed by the sentence of a higher tribunal, while, in the second,
they can only tend to compromise the character of the scientific
body by whose advice they are conferred.        It is true that I would
not claim infallibility for the united judgement of any association, or
of any body of men, however eminent their scientific rank may be :
but it is the peculiar privilege of the great masters of Science, (and
more particularly so when acting or speaking as a body,) to be able
to anticipate, though not without the possibility of error, the de
cision of Posterity, and thus to offer to the ardent cultivator of Sci
ence that highest reward of his labours, as an immediate and well
assured possession, which he might otherwise be allowed silently
and doubtingly to hope for, but never be permitted to see realized:
and though some powerful minds might be content to entrust the
complete developement of their fame to the fulness of time, and might
pursue their silent labours under the influence of no other motives
but such as are furnished by their love of truth, the gratification de
rived from the discovery of the beautiful relations of abstract science,
or from the contemplation of the agency of a Divine Mind in the har
monies and constitution of the physical world, yet it is our duty
and business to deal with men as we find them constituted, and to
stimulate their exertions by presenting to their view honourable     di
stinctions attainable by honourable means; to assure them that the
result of their labours will neither pass unnoticed nor unrewarded;
and that there exists a tribunal to which they may appeal, or before

able pride in maintaining the character of the Body whose Members
are to be constituted by their choice.
    In proceeding now, therefore, to call your attention, Gentlemen, to
the series of great men to whom those Medals have been awarded,
I  shall not presume to state in detail the specific grounds upon which
the decisions of your Council were founded, but confine myself to
little more than their enumeration in the order of time, feeling that it
would be unbecoming in me to attempt to assign them those stations
which they either have taken, or are destined hereafter to take, in
the temple of fame.
    The first name upon the list is that of DR. John DALTon, a venera
ble Philosopher, whose developement of the Atomic Theory and other
important labours and discoveries in physical science have, at the
 eleventh hour, (I blush to own that it was not earlier,) first abroad,
and secondly at home, secured him that public recognition of his sci
 entific rank to which he has long been entitled.             With him, Gen
tlemen, posterity may be said to have already commenced, and though
full of years and honour, I rejoice to hear that he still retains the
 same zeal and vigour in the pursuits of science which have carried
him forwards from his earliest youth in his career of discovery, in
 spite of all the discouragements of confined means and of the most
laborious and depressing employments.             It gives me great pleasure
to learn that His    Majesty   has  lately  expressed   his Royal approbation
 of his services to science    by the  grant  of a  pension,   if not commen
 surate with his services, at least as considerable as the severity of
 existing regulations will allow; though                 I
                                                     cannot refrain from ex
pressing on this occasion my regret at the very narrow limits within
 which the munificence of the King and the generosity of the Nation
 should be confined.
    The second Medal for the same year was awarded to MR. Ivory,
the first of our mathematicians who transplanted to this country the
profound analytical science which LaGrange, Laplace, LeGendre,
 Gauss and others upon the continent, had applied to the most im
portant and sublime physical inquiries.          The dignity of such inves
tigations has not suffered by the association of Mr. Ivory's name
with them, and the Transactions of the Royal Society present fre
quent and honourable records of his valuable labours.                  It    howis,

too speedily        terminate his valuable life; and the Council availed

that Medal which, from natural feelings of delicacy, they could not
have offered to their President.
  In the following year a similar tribute of gratitude and respect was
paid to DR. Wollaston, who had so long honoured the Royal Society
by his services and his scientific contributions, and who, towards
the close of his life, had augmented       means      usefulness by his its              of

      I now come to the consideration of the Medals upon the Founda
 tion of His present Majesty; and it is the King's pleasure that the
 President and Council of the Royal Society should be considered as
 his official advisers, in the award of an honour which emanates imme
 diately from himself.       His Majesty has also been graciously pleased
 to prescribe the general Rules and Principles which shall regulate
 their distribution hereafter.      The King has therefore commanded
 that they shall be adjudged annually, and that the award shall be
 announced on the day of the Anniversary Meeting of the Royal
 Society; that the Memoirs which shall be entitled to receive them,
 whether composed by Foreigners or by Englishmen, shall be com
 municated to the Royal Society; and that the general subject matter
 of such Memoirs shall be prescribed and announced by the Council
 at least three years preceding the day of their award: and also, that
 for the present and the two following years, the principle of their
 distribution shall be the same as that which has hitherto been adopted,
 with the additional condition, that the succession of branches of sci
 ence which shall be selected as entitled to these rewards, shall be the
 same as that which shall be hereafter followed when the cycle of
 their regular distribution begins.
     The selection of the subjects which should compose this cycle was
left to the Council of the Royal Society, who have made such a
choice as seemed to them best calculated to comprehend every de
partment of science and to prevent the jealousies which might arise
from the recurrence of similar subjects in immediate or too close
succession: the subjects themselves and their periodical order (de
termined by lot) are as follow :—
       . Astronomy.
       . Physiology, including the Natural History of Organized Beings.
       . Geology and Mineralogy.                                        -
     i
       . Physics.
       . Mathematics.
         Chemistry.
     In conformity with these Regulations, which form the existing
law for the distribution of the Royal Medals, they have been awarded
for the current year to PROFEssoR DE CANDoLLE, of Geneva, for his
numerous and valuable researches and investigations in Vegetable
Physiology, as detailed in his Work, entitled “Physiologie Végétale,”
published in the year 1832; and to SIR John FREDERICK WILLIAM
HERscHEL, for his Paper “On the Investigation of the Orbits of Re
volving Double Stars,” inserted in the Fifth Volume of the Memoirs
of the Royal Astronomical Society.

bilities of life.   Mr. Morgan was the nephew of the celebrated Dr.
 Price, whose memoirs he has written, and some of whose works he
 has edited; and he partook largely, at one period at least, of some
 of the political and financial opinions of that ardent character, par
 ticularly relating to the dangers of a national bankruptcy from the
 rapid increase of our National Debt.        He was appointed early in
life, chiefly by his uncle's influence and recommendation, to the situ
 ation of Actuary of the Equitable Assurance Company, which he
 continued to hold for nearly sixty years; and the unexampled wealth
and prosperity of that great establishment may be in a great degree
 attributed to the confidence inspired by the correct principles of cal
culation and of management which he introduced ; and though he
was exposed towards the close of life to many attacks and much
 opposition, in consequence of his too rigid adherence to a system
 which might be calculated to do injustice to some classes of insurers,
 yet no small indulgence is due even to the prejudices of a man who
 had done so much service to society, by establishing upon a firm
 basis the security of establishments which act as safeguards against
 the fluctuations and vicissitudes of life, and which thus encourage
 habits of providence and of foresight amongst the higher and middle
classes of the community.                      -
    MR. THoMAS ALLAN, an eminent citizen of Edinburgh, was the
author of a work on Mineralogical Nomenclature, and of several pa
 pers on geology and mineralogy in the Transactions of the Royal
 Society of Edinburgh, and elsewhere. He was greatly distinguished
for his accurate knowledge of mineral species and their varieties,
and of all the delicate and minute distinctions of external characters
by which they are separated from each other; and his collection of
 minerals has been justly celebrated for its great extent and perfect
arrangement.      In the year 1812 he joined Sir George Steuart Mac
kenzie in an Excursion to the Faroe Islands, where he greatly enriched
his collection, particularly in zeolites. This expedition was under
taken for the purpose of ascertaining whether, in a Trap Country,
where no traces of external volcanoes existed, anything similar to
the peculiar features of the rocks of Iceland was to be found; and
his Account of the Mineralogy of these Islands, in which his object
has been to describe, without relation to theory, whatever appeared
to him interesting in a geological point of view, was read before
the Royal Society of Edinburgh in the beginning of the following
year, and printed in the seventh volume of their Transactions.      He
adopted in early life the opinions of Dr. Hutton, though his papers
on some points in geology in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, and
in the environs of Nice, show him to have been an accurate and
an unprejudiced observer.        He was a person of active habits and
character, a liberal supporter of public charities and useful institu
tions, and an ardent and even enthusiastic friend of all the schemes
for the improvement and decoration of his own magnificent and pic
turesque metropolis.
    DR.WILLIAM BABINGton was a distinguished physician in the City
of London. He was formerly a lecturer on materia medica and on

chemistry at Guy's Hospital, and he was the author of a Systematic
Arrangement of Minerals, founded upon a joint consideration of their
chemical, physical and external characters; and also of other works,
of less importance, upon mineralogical arrangement. He was the
active and disinterested friend of science and of men of science, from
the time of Priestley to that of Sir Humphry Davy; and though the
absorbing duties of a laborious profession prevented his taking a
leading part in original inquiries, he was well acquainted with the
existing state of knowledge, particularly in geology, physiology and
chemistry.     He was one of the first founders of the Geological So
 ciety; and the earliest meetings of that distinguished body, which
has contributed so powerfully to the advancement of geological know
ledge, were held at his house. He was a person of great simplicity
 of manners, a warm and active friend, zealous in the promotion of
 objects of charity and usefulness, and in the practice of his profession
 singularly kind to the poor.
    The death of LoRD Dover in the course of this year excited an
 unusual degree of public sympathy and sorrow, from his youth and
 high birth, his domestic virtues, and perhaps also his domestic hap
 piness, his unsullied public character, his cultivated taste for the
 arts, and his liberal and enlightened patronage of artists, and most
 of all from the promise of the highest literary distinction afforded by
 his very interesting historical memoirs and other literary productions.
 Such qualities and attainments, whilst they give dignity to all who
 possess them, acquire a peculiar grace and lustre when found in
 those classes of society in which the possession of rank and wealth
 separate altogether the pursuit of knowledge and of fame from all
 taint of a suspected union with the desire of mere personal aggran
 dizement.
    THE REv. BEwick BRIDGE, Fellow of St. Peter's College, Cam
 bridge, obtained the highest mathematical honours in his own acade
 mical year. He was for many years Mathematical Professor in the East
 India College at Haileybury, and was the author of several elemen
 tary works on different parts of mathematics, which are remarkable
 for their judicious adaptation to the capacities of ordinary students,
 by the union of simplicity and fulness in the developement of first
 principles,—a species of merit which those only can duly estimate
 whose experience in education has shown it to be very rarely at
 tained.    Mr. Bridge was a person of great benevolence, who devoted
 his life and fortune to the promotion of objects of charity and pub
 lic utility, and whose purity     of

    CAPTAIN Lyon became first known             the public from his having
 accompanied the late Mr. Ritchie        inhis journey  into the interior          of
 Africa. His companion died         at Moorzouk, and after encountering
 the ordinary succession       sufferings and dangers which characterize
 the  melancholy   records of of

 of  his travels. He afterwards accompanied Captain Parry
                                                                           of in

two ships which composed that expedition.        After his return he was
chosen, from a knowledge of his enterprising and energetic charac
ter, to conduct a party of English miners to Zacatecas and Bolaños
in Mexico, and to undertake the management of the first of these
mining establishments: and though he continued there for a short
time only, being compelled by domestic circumstances to return to
England, his services were of such a kind as to produce the most
important results.     His Mexican adventures form a narrative full of
interesting, amusing and instructive details.        He was afterwards
chosen by the Brazilian Company to superintend the celebrated gold
mines at Gongo Soco, in the province of Minas Geraes, which under
his management became so productive, as fully to vindicate and re
deem the character of South American mining speculations.          Upon
quitting their service he engaged in mining adventures of his own;
and it was in returning to England, in consequence of an accidental
injury which he received in the course of his operations, that he
died at sea, in the thirty-seventh year of his age.
    MR. Joshua BRookEs was for more than forty years a distinguished
teacher of anatomy, and it is said that during the course of his life
he had superintended the anatomical education of more than seven
thousand pupils.     He had formed a Museum of human and com
parative anatomy, which was second only in extent and value to the
Hunterian Collection, and to which he gave the most ready and libe
ral access both to his pupils and to the public.   To the completion of
this museum, and to the instruction of his pupils, he devoted the
 whole of his time and of his income; and it was a melancholy cir
 cumstance that he should have been compelled towards the close of
his life, when his health, and with it his sources of income were de
 clining, from the pressure of pecuniary difficulties, to consent to the
 sale of his museum.      The dispersion of this collection was to him
 a source of the most poignant distress;       and the latter years of a
 long life which had been devoted with singular disinterestedness to
 the public service, were imbittered at once by the pressure of po
 verty and the despondency occasioned by the annihilation of those
 hopes of having raised a lasting monument to his fame, which had
 formed the great object of his ambition.
    LIEUTENANT-Colon EL JoHN BAILLIE went to India as a Cadet in
 1791, and from the commencement of his residence he devoted himself
 with great diligence to the study of the Oriental languages. Upon
 the establishment of the College of Fort William, in 1800, he was
 appointed Professor of the Arabic and Persian languages, and of the
 Muhammedan law, a situation which he continued to fill with great
 credit and distinction for several years.       He was the author of
 Tables elucidatory of a Course of Lectures on Arabic Grammar,
 of A Collection of the original Terts of the five most celebrated
  Grammars of the Arabic Language, and of A Translation from the
 Arabic of a Digest of the Muhammedan Law, of which one volume
 only out of four was published.    His Oriental studies appear to have
 terminated  upon  his appointment   as Resident at Luchow, where he
 continued for several  years.   He quitted  India in 1818, and in 1823

of propositions which have led to an immense extension of this the

from the most disinterested love of truth, was the first to welcome
 the appearance of these illustrious strangers upon his own territories,

 containing many valuable series of investigations, and very important
 discoveries. He first attacked the great problem of the determination
 of the orbits of comets by general methods, which display all the re
 sources of his analysis; though astronomers have not found it expe
 dient to make use of his methods in the actual calculation of their
 elements, which is the only proper test of their practical value, though
 it may not be decisive of their theoretical perfection. He was the
 author of the method of the least squares of the errors, for the pur
 pose of determining the most probable mean amongst the results of
 a great number of observations, of which such extensive use is now
 made in practical astronomy: a celebrated and most useful theorem
 in geodesy goes by his name; and there are few departments of ana
 lysis or of dynamics which have not been benefited by his labours.
     M. LeGendre was associated with Méchain and Cassini in the
 operations which were instituted in 1787, and finished in 1790, for
 the junction of the meridians of Paris and London.          He was one of
 the three Members of the Council nominated for the purpose of
 introducing the new metrical system into France in 1795, and he
 constructed the formulae employed for the calculation of the tables for
 the centesimal division of the quadrant.         He was nominated, both
 during the Imperial and subsequent Government, to various public
 employments, chiefly, however, of an honorary nature, requiring no
 great sacrifice of time or attention,-a fortunate circumstance, when
 it is considered to what important labours the leisure of his long life
 appears to have been devoted.
    The next name which I feel called upon to notice is that of FRAN
 cIsco DE Borj A GARGKo StockLER, BARON DA VILLA DA PRAIA, a
 Lieutenant-General in the Portuguese army, and formerly Secretary
 of the Academy of Sciences of Lisbon: he was the author of several
 Papers in the Transactions of the Lisbon Academy, chiefly on subjects
 connected with the developement of functions, and also of a volume
 of Poems. In 1795 he published his Methodo dos Limites, and in 1824
 his Methodo inverso dos Limites. In this latter work, written late in
life, he adopted the opinions of the well-known Hoene de Wronski,
which led to      its

    DR. JoHN FREDERICK MEcKEL, Professor          Anatomy      the Univerin
sity     Halle, was the third member
        of                                    family singularly illustrious

in  the annals     physiological and anatomical science. His grand
                  of
father,     the beginning
             at                the last century, was probably the great
                                  of
est anatomist     of    his age, and was the founder          of   that collection which

                                    Royal Society.                          14.5
has become, by the additions of his son and of his grandson, the
richest and the best arranged in Germany.     His father was likewise
an eminent anatomist, and greatly distinguished for his success in the
practice of physic and of surgery, and for his general attainments.
It was for the purpose of enriching the great collection which he in
herited, and of completing those departments of it in which it was
deficient, that young Meckel first directed his whole attention to
comparative anatomy; but the results of his labours were not con
fined to his museum : he published a German translation of the
Anatomie Comparée of Cuvier, which was enriched with many valu.
able notes.         This was followed by his Contributions to Comparative
Anatomy; by his System der vergleichenden Anatomie, which he
did not live to complete; his Tabula Anatomico-pathologica; his
Handbuch der pathologischen Anatomie ; his work On Human
Monsters, and several memoirs relating to this branch of medical
science, which display a remarkable union of laborious research
with the most profound and original views relating to the pheno
mena of animal life.  He devoted a great portion of his time to the
publication of the Archiv für Anatomie und Physiologie, one of the
most valuable and instructive periodical publications on medical
and physiological science which appeared in Germany.                One of his
last works, on the Lymphatic System, which is upon a magnificent
scale, was dedicated to the celebrated Sömmerring, upon the comple
tion of his fiftieth year from the period of his inauguration as Doctor
in Medicine, as a tribute of respect to one who had been his own
preceptor, the fellow-student of his father, the follower and pupil of
his grandfather, the intimate friend of his family for three genera
tions, and who was also one of the few of his living rivals in the
sciences which he cultivated.
    Meckel was only fifty years old at the time of his death : he united
in a very remarkable degree the power of correct and philosophical
generalization with the most profound and accurate knowledge of
 anatomical details; and though he may have left in his own country
 some who may equal or even surpass him in particular departments
 of human and comparative anatomy or physiology, there is no one
 of his countrymen,          if,
                            perhaps, Tiedemann        beexcepted, who can     be
 considered      having
                   as     made such    important    additions     toour general
 views in those sciences.

   M. Desfontaines was a person of mild and inoffensive manners,
and perfectly free from those feelings of jealousy which tend to pro
voke either opposition or controversy. For a considerable period be
fore his death he laboured under the affliction of total blindness,
  and was thus debarred from the continuation of those pursuits which
  had constituted at once the delight and the business of his life: and
 it was a fortunate circumstance that a visitation of Providence,
 which under ordinary circumstances would have produced a spirit
 of repining and discontent, was deprived of more than half                   bit           its

cordial congratulations upon his happy return, and to express our
hope that the sympathy and respect of his countrymen which he has
already experienced, and which, I trust, he will retain for the re

long sufferings which he has endured, and for the incomplete suc
cess of an enterprise presenting difficulties from the certain operation
of the laws of the physical world, which not merely baffle, but al
most annihilate, the powers of the bravest, the strongest, and the
most persevering of men.

      Dec. 4.—A letter from Hugh                E.    Strickland, Esq., addressed
 to George Bellas Greenough, Esq., was first read.                                         e

Mr. Strickland points out also, for the first time, a line of fault
ranging    from a little north of Bredon Hill in Gloucestershire,                                 to
Inkberrow, north of the road from Alcester to Worcester.                                   By this
fault the relative position of the red marl and the lias has been af.
fected, the former constituting a valley of elevation, bounded on each
side by the latter.         Mention is also made of bones and teeth of the
Hippopotamus and of a Deer having been found in the gravel near
Cropthorne, between Evesham and Pershore. Mr. Strickland like
wise alludes to the occurrence, on Shotover Hill near Oxford, of
fossils which he believes to belong to the fresh-water genus Palu
dina; but the specimens which he procured are imperfect casts.
These shells, he adds, were first discovered by the Rev. H. Jelly of
Bath, in a sand-pit on the brow of the hill, much higher than the
pit at which the Portland strata occur.
   A paper on the Strata of Quainton and Brill in Buckinghamshire,
by James Mitchell, LL.D., F.G.S., was then read.
   In this communication the author confines his observations almost
solely to an enumeration of the beds belonging to the Portland stone
presented at the two localities of Quainton and Brill.
   The principal quarries at the former place are composed of the
following strata:

Besides the fossils common to the Portland stone, the author pro
cured caudal vertebrae of a Plesiosaurus and a Crocodile.
   The strata at Brill are then enumerated in the following order:
                                                                                         Feet.

   The base of the Brown Clee Hill                 stated       consist
                                                                     is        old red   to                   of

cornstone, the lower of which is about 12 feet thick. The strata are
said to dip regularly towards the centre of the hill at an angle of
about 7°.
   The coal-field is represented to have the form of the figure 8.
The strata are said to be about 150 feet thick, and to dip towards
a common centre at an angle of from 3 to 5 degrees. Three beds of
coal have been discovered, varying from 1 foot 7 inches to 2 feet
6 inches in thickness, but the coal is of inferior quality to that of
the Titterstone Clee Hill.
                                               -
   Three faults are described, and stated to range nearly parallel to
each other, and to traverse the coal measures in a north easterly di
rection. One of them, the author observes, is marked by a dyke of
basalt connected with an overlying mass of the same rock. It is 13
yards in horizontal thickness, and though the wall of the dyke is so
hard as to require to be blasted, yet the coal is not in the least
 charred.
    The overlying basalt is shown to form the two highest points of
 the hill, one of them being 1800 feet above the level of the sea,
 and the other 1600.

     MARYLEBONE LITERARY AND scIENTIFIC INSTITUTION.
   This Institution is rapidly advancing to a state of permanent
prosperity, and may confidently be expected to become one of the
most important and interesting establishments of the kind in the
metropolis. The Committee have taken spacious and commanding
premises, situate No. 17, Edwards-street,     Portman-square, where
the business of the Institution is now conducted. A lecture room is
to be built in the rear of the premises capable of containing at least
600 persons. Until then the handsome and spacious suite of rooms
on the first floor, which have been thrown into one for the purpose,
will be occupied for the delivery of lectures.
   The audiences are numerous and highly respectable, and the
lectures delivered during the last six months have been eminently
calculated to command them. Among those who have given in.
struction in different branches of science or literature at this Insti
tion are Dr. Lardner, Dr. Ritchie, Dr. Copland, Dr. Southwood
Smith, Sir A. Carlisle, Professor Burnett, Messrs. John Taylor,
T. Phillipps, Wallis, Brayley, Jun., and Hemming, the latter of
whom is President of the Institution.
   The Committee are now forming classes for the instruction of
members in chemistry, languages and music. The following list of
the officers of the Marylebone Literary and Scientific Institution
will sufficiently prove the estimation in which it is held, while it is a
guarantee for the continuance of  prosperity.       its

  without adverting to the possibility            of other volatile substances
 being hereafter discovered to have a similar effect on solution of
 silver, it is to be borne in mind that this reagent indicates the ex
 istence of prussic acid in some esculent substances where it had
 previously been found, as well as in some new ones. . Upon this
 branch of the subject medical jurists will probably think it right to
 collect information.
     The application of the solution of silver is simple. The suspected
 fluid is to be acidulated by the addition of acetic acid, but so as to
 redden litmus paper in only the slightest degree.              If excess of acid
 be already present, it is to be not quite neutralized by carbonate of
 soda. These precautions are adopted to retard the interference of
 ammonia or muriatic acid. Two or three drops, quite cold, are then
 put into a watch glass, and immediately covered by a plate of glass,
 whose under-surface, to the breadth of a pea, is moistened with so
 lution of nitrate of silver, formed by dissolving one grain lunar caustic
 in 100 grains distilled water: —

fresh-water    limestone in the coal-measures at Burdie House near
Edinburgh. The organic remains, and their high state of preserva
tion, will secure to the limestone of that locality a marked attention,
particularly if the tooth of a Saurian animal be included in these
relics. In announcing this discovery, my friend Mr. Conybeare
has stated, that “the limestone was shown to differ from the com
mon carboniferous limestone of marine origin, and to form a species
of deposit hitherto undescribed by geologists, being not of a ma
rine but of a fluviatile or lacustrine character.”
   Now, Sir, without wishing to detract in the slightest degree from
the merits of Dr. Hibbert's researches, I must state that the ex
istence of a thick band of lacustrine limestone fairly included be
tween seams of coal was pointed out by myself in March 1833, the
discovery having been made in the year 1831, and confirmed in
1832, during repeated investigations of the country round Shrews
bury. In my communication * I distinctly asserted that “this
limestone is similar in mineral aspect to the lacustrine limestone of
Central France, and contains minute shells, referrible to fresh-water
genera.” At the same time it was shown that the associated beds of
shale contained many of the published plants of the coal measures.
   This Salopian fresh-water limestone is by no means confined to
a single spot, but is found in many situations, distant from each
other, where coal is worked, as at Pontesbury, Uffington, Le Bot
wood, &c., and always in the same position, separating the upper
from the central seam of coal.                        -
   I certainly   attached some importance                  I
                                            to what conceived to be
a singular and an undescribed species of deposit; and I enlarged
      its
upon      importance

                       in

       Gentlemen,
INofthe application of geological science to the development
     the mineral resources which constitute so material a part
of the wealth of nations, no subject can possibly claim a higher
statistical importance than the investigation of the relations of
our principal coal districts, with a view to point out the lines
in which we may look with the greatest probability for the
future profitable extension of their workings, when the immense
and increasing demand for that mineral shall threaten to ex
haust our present supplies; a period which some apprehen
sive geologists have predicted to be within a few centuries.                   Al
though      I
           myself incline to be more sanguine, still every one
must allow the discussion to be one of the very first oeconomical
interest.        I
             have already in my former geological publications
often alluded to

useful, and may very probably tend       elicit fresh information
in the points where     will thus

    South of the Wharfe the main coal-seams again emerge,
 and continue exposed throughout the great field of SouthYork
shire and Derbyshire, as far as the banks of the Derwent; but
here they are again overlaid by the superincumbent strata, for
the red marl, sweeping round to the west in this direction,

   At  Colonel Mudge's station on Ingleborough, which is 197
feet east of the centre (axis) of the round tower erected on
the site of the beacon hut, the angle between the tower and
his signal on Whernside measures 87° 20'. The distance
from the station to Whernside being 22,435 feet, that between
the centre of the Tower and Whernside (our base line,) will
be 22,445 feet. The Tower, of which the base, resting on an
 elevated flagged terrace, is on a level with the ground at the
station, measures 22 feet 3 inches in height, and 57 feet in
 circumference.
    About a mile from Thornton church, on the road into
 Kingsdale, lies, at a short distance to the left, a steep rounded
knoll, called Hunt's Cross. On the fence wall which crosses
the crest of the hill, a pile of stones, presenting a triangular
front towards Ingleborough, was erected and whitewashed.
 At a station a few yards east of this signal the following
 oblique angles were obtained.—(N. B. Of the two objects sub
 tending the angle, the one to the left hand is first mentioned.)

south end of the base beyond what might be introduced by a
faulty measurement of the latter, or such an error as might
be committed in measuring 100 feet by a tape of a corrected
length. About two years ago the height of the church tower
was found by observations with a 4-inch theodolite to be
115.6 feet above the water under Thornton bridge. The
base line was 318 feet in length, and the vertical angles taken
at both ends of it gave the same height within one inch.
Supposing the stream, noted as extremely low, to have been
one foot below      level  itsNovember last, (or two feet below

   Since the possible errors, though     tending one way, do           all
not amount    more than two feet, we may certainly claim for

                consequence
                 in
of   this insect.    But this          second error; for from the de

is   infinitely more mischievous and terrible. The Professor
 says, that “it flies with                      and    extremely trouble    is
                                                              2

172        The Marquis Di Spineto on the Zimb of Bruce,
some both to man and beast.            It is especially quite intolerable
 to the   large  herds of cattle in the woods of Hungary, and
 even to the   shepherds     themselves.      Wherever it settles itself,
 it cannot be taken off again : it gluts itself with blood and
 makes bloody boils; the large ones are painful.”
      He considers it to be the same insect which is “very
 plentiful in the Levant, which makes a very painful bite, and
 when it multiplies uncommonly, can become a serious plague;
 for it not only torments men and cattle, but it also gnaws
 household furniture and clothes, and eats                sorts       provi
                                                                       all                of
  sions.”
     Hence,     he
                 says, “it has been conjectured that Arob signifies
 Karcherlake       or
                    Kilchenschabe,” which           fact the Blatta. But
                                                             in
 this is another error.      The similarity             of is
                                                 the devastations made
 by   the Karcherlake and the 2imb, even                        on
                                                       the supposition                              of
 their  being  equally   terrible and  extensive,                    no
                                                        more proves that
 these two insects are alike, than the fondness                  devouring          of
dead carcasses establishes the similarity between                 rat and            a              a
pig.     And    in
                 the   present   case,  another fact militates against
 the   position,  for,  however troublesome and mischievous the
Arob may be, and            whatever degree
                             to                              its

Ark    of    Noah was built,          is   probably the same                   as   "p:     ;      that

                               a   tree.
   This change has,         believe, never been before suggested,
                               I
but the change            of
                       letters             of
                                   the same organ       common                 is                   in

particular instance seems highly probable, and the correction
very admissible.      Admitting, then, that Gopher         identical                is
with Kopher,     still think        very questionable that Kopher
                   I                   it
                                       is
means pitch, and atzei Kopher, pitch trees, for the following
considerations.
   Though the word               very frequent use
                                 is    of              the Hebrew             in
Scriptures        in
               the sense             of
                                cover over, atone for, expiate, and
is the word constantly employed, particularly            the Penta                 in
teuch,      express that meaning, not one passage,
           to                                               believe,                    I
can   befound    which
                    in       has the former import.
                                 it                    The nearest
to
 it,  and the only one         can find having the like sense,
                                 I                                                                   is
Isaiah xxviii. 18. “Your covenant with death shall be disan
nulled:” and there we need not infer the meaning                can                         of

                of the Received Version of the Scriptures.                                                 179
celled by daubing with pitch, but that of covered from sight,
put away, not allowed to be enforced.
   The pitch obtained from wood could scarcely have been
known at that early age, in a country where, probably, as
now, whole pools of it existed, and it flowed spontaneously
from the earth, and when boats and ships (for which is     more                                    its
important use) could              be
                          very little known.
   Two other words are furnished         the language        by
                                                        express                               to
the various kinds    pitch   of
                           orbitumen then    employed, the more
general term hemer signifying, among other things, red earth,
        cement (from nor), chamar
                                                                              nº
soil, or                                  hamar,    redden), and
                                                              or                  to

The two latter words occur      Isaiah xxxiv. in   and sulphur                    9.,

               or       are clearly,   expressed,   severally as                                           in

                                            pitch, the dust into

during volcanic eruptions, and         found      abundance

will carry thee captive into captivity,” i.e. will surely carry
thee captive, and Tiby Tºy (we-oteka atah), “cover thee
with a covering,” i.e. surely, or completely, cover thee. And it
may be noticed, that a particular command thus to cover
the ark, seems to have been more needed than a command to
daub it with pitch, for navigation in early society is usually
performed in boats made of a single tree.         It is after some
progress in the art, that men begin to cover within and with
out with a covering of wood.

     have made the above observations, assenting to the opinion
to which many would object, that a reference to the existing
productions of the climate in which the ark was built, may not
be irrelevant to such an inquiry, and believing it can be satis
factorily shown from the Mosaic history of the Deluge, that,

 adhesion must therefore clog the energy of the impulse in a way
 nearly insensible to our ordinary modes of impression: yet
 cases are not awanting where such adhesion is abundantly
 sensible, and especially when a metal so soft as lead is one of
 those employed.         It is not difficult to perceive how the posi
 tion of the groove or separation of pieces (for we have seen
 that the effect is absolutely independent of the form of the
 groove, provided the contact of the bar and block for a certain
 space be avoided) is the most favourable                 producing the         for                               vi

                                        the effect was less favourable
than when the angle was more obtuse, and the contact might
seem          to      be
                greater. The truth, however, was, that                this                             in

the properties    of some metals at a definite higher temperature,
I heated    several bars, in a cast-iron vessel full of sand, along
with a thermometer, having a very long scale: this vessel was
placed in another containing oil, and when the temperature
had risen to 350°, the bars were placed upon cold lead. On
one occasion I employed copper, brass, iron and antimony;
on another iron, tin, platinum and bismuth.                I did not find,
however, that the additional temperature thus gained facili
tated my inquiries, and it was, in the first place attended with
considerable practical difficulties.      The experiments, however,
confirmed a fact which I had        previously   suspected, and which
forms an exception to what may be considered the general
law, namely, that the intensity of vibration is proportional to
the difference of temperature of the metals; I found that at
350° iron was far more sluggish in            vibrations than  its    212°.                at

    57. Hence it appears to be quite obvious, that as far as
conducting power is concerned, both bar and block should have
it in the highest possible degree.        It would be quite essential,
too, upon this explanation, that the cold metal should expand
more than the hot one, otherwise the loss of elevation by the
contraction of the warm metal will equal or exceed the van
tage-ground for the new vibration gained by the expansion of
the cold one. By both these criteria Mr. Faraday's theory
seems to be deficient:                 I
                                need only point out the position of
zinc, which, with greater expansibility than lead or tin, occupies
so high a place in the list of vibrators, and cannot be used as
the cold metal with any other except silver: according to the
theory, zinc ought to vibrate far better upon zinc than upon
lead or tin. ...Silver, again, vibrates upon cold iron, although
its  expansibility       is half greater. Such facts
                              a                               these seem        as

                             the phaenomena.
     59.
       I     shall first recapitulate the general laws           which we            at
   have arrived.    .

      1st, The vibrations never take place between substances                                          of
 the same nature. Art. 13.

 ducting powers            of
                     the metals for heat (or   electricity), the
 metal having the least conducting power being necessarily
 the coldest.  Art. 36.

 192      Prof. Forbes's Researches on the Vibrations which take place
     4th, The time of contact of two points of the metals must
  be longer than that of the intermediate portions.            Art. 37.
     5th, The impulse is received by a distinct and separate
  process at each contact of the bar with the block, and in no
  case is the metallic connexion of the bearing points in the
  bar, or those of the block, in any way essential.           Art. 38.
     6th, The intensity of the vibration is (under certain excep
 tions) proportional to the difference of temperature of the
  metals.    Art. 47.
     60. In order to satisfy these various conditions, we shall
 find that the range of hypotheses is not great. During my
 experiments         I
                    was for a long time attached to the idea of a
 thermo-electric action.        The hypotheses which I assumed to
 explain the steps of it I was forced successively to abandon,
 and the total want of connexion of the order of the metals as
 vibrators with their thermo-electric properties (and especially
 the absolute inertness of antimony and bismuth), convinced
 me, after a long series of experiments, undertaken with this
 view, that I was wrong.
     61. The strict and simple connexion with the conducting
 powers of the metals for heat and electricity afforded a firm
 basis for speculation, and                 I
                                   was soon forced to consider heat
 as the sole    agent in the  case,      idea      electricity being ne

 cessarily abandoned,         soon as     was established that thermo

                                                     it
 electricity had         no
                         share       the action. The general laws
                                          all
 above quoted seem            to             in
                                   resolvable into this, “That there

metals    fall;  it must           be

action alluded to, depends on the internal motions                heat                  of        it
self.     Itwere easy      frame

Consequently, two bodies equally heated and placed together,
manifest no sensible repulsion.           In such a case every portion
of heat is kept in equilibrium by the equal and opposite re

nished us with facts, which, though not completely established
as belonging to any peculiar class of phaenomena, and there
fore not generally admitted into systematic works, are not the
less worthy of notice. Those which bear most directly on
our present speculation were observed by M. Fresnel”; namely,
the repulsion of disks of mica, of which one was placed at the
extremity of a delicately suspended needle in vacuo, and when
the disks were in contact, heated by means of a ray of solar
light concentrated by a lens. M. Saigey+ has also described
a class of similar phaenomena observed by himself, with a con
siderable number of metals, which after rejecting the in
fluence of aerial currents, of electricity, magnetism, &c., he
ascribes to the repulsive action of radiant heat at sensible di
stances.   There are several other experiments on record which
seem to   require  a similar explanation, but I apprehend that
the  present  are the first to establish the existence of some
species of mechanical repulsion in the propagation of heat, a
principle which can hardly fail to be applicable to the expla
nation of many natural phaenomena.

XXXIV.       Reply to Mr. Earnshaw's Remarks on the “Principle
     of Least Pressure.” By the Rev. H. Moseley, B.A., Pro
    Jessor of Natural Philosophy in King's College, London.

         Gentlemen,
INfollowing
    submitting to the consideration of Mr. Earnshaw the
            answer to his remarks on my paper purporting
to contain the demonstration of a new statical principle, which
I have called that of least pressure;                     I
                                           beg to suggest to that
gentleman that the obscurity of which he complains is perhaps
in some respect attributable to the nature of the subject under
discussion.   The theory of statical resistances has always been
considered among the most difficult and complicated of those
subjects which         lie
                    within the range                  of
                                          exact science, yielding
itself most unwillingly and  ungraciously     the control    ana

lysis, and such,       in     its
                        nature,   cannot       as

C" those equal and opposite to the pressures mutually propa
gated in C.
  Now it is manifest that if the system C" be withdrawn, the
equilibrium will remain.   And yet the forces of the system
 C. mutually propagate no pressure; and are equivalent, se—
 verally, only to the pressures propagated to their points of ap
plication from the forces of the system A. It is therefore
possible, &c. &c.

    Were this not, as hold it to be, a demonstration that the
forces of the system C may, under any conceivable circum
 stances, sustain those of A, and yet mutually propagate no
pressures, yet I should decidedly object to Mr. Earnshaw's
position that any portion of a system of forces not parallel
must of necessity mutually propagate pressures.
    Suppose we apply to a solid body any number of equal
 and opposite forces; these may certainly have directions how
 ever oblique to one another, and yet not mutually propagate
pressures.      Or, to take a case bearing more immediately upon
 the  point  at issue, suppose that to the different points of ap
plication of the system A, we apply forces having for their
 resultant one of the forces C, and then to the same points
 forces having for their resultant another of the forces of the
 system C, and so on until we have thus obtained                 the forces             all
                  C.   Now, under these circumstances, the systems
of of

 reason for    fixing upon   these     the variables upon which those

 functions depend,         for assigning the variables

          Remarks on the                 “Principle of Least Pressure.”                               197
function or functions on the determination of which a ques
tion of physics may be made to depend.
   The resultant of the resistances must be equal and opposite
to the resultant of the other forces of the system.    Now sup
pose that, by the variation of these last forces, the position of
their resultant is altered, the position of the resultant of the
resistances will then be altered; but the position of this result
ant cannot be altered unless the resistances themselves be al
tered; the resistances, then, vary with any variation in their
position in respect to the resultant of the other forces of the
system: they are, therefore, functions of their positions in re
lation to that resultant.
    Or we may reason thus. We must admit the resistances
upon different points not symmetrically situated with respect
to the given forces to be different, otherwise the resultant of
those resistances would have a position determined by the
positions of the points, and independent                               of,
                                                        and therefore not
opposite       to,
                 the resultant                of
                                      the other forces      the system.        of
    Also, the resistances being different from one another, that
difference must arise from some cause.                Now the nature of
       resisting               being                       everywhere the

positions      ofthe points              of
                                  resistance.
    Taking, for instance, any one point             resistance;   of long                     as           as

remain the      same,  we cannot understand how the pressure upon
    should    vary;   but      we cause the coordinates
                                    if                            that point             of
to itvary, we can          as
                         little understand how the resistance should
 remain the same:              fact,in    cannot manifestly remain the
                                                   it
 same; for        if   were, the resultant                        of
                                                    the resistances would
 cease    tohave     its it
                       direction     opposite     that       to

    Thus, then, the resistance upon any point remains the same

     Mr. Earnshaw's next remark has reference                  the case of          to                     a
  mass supported upon three points, forming                 triangle, whose   a

 198                  Prof. Moseley’s Reply to Mr. Earnshaw's
 centre of gravity is in the vertical passing through the centre
of gravity of the mass. In this case the pressure will be
equally divided between the points; and this equal division
will continue whatever form we suppose the triangle to as
 sume, provided only the centre of gravity of the mass alter
 its position         continually
                         so    as      satisfy the condition that the
                                                         to

 of the triangle.    Hence,    therefore,         concluded,         ap
                                                                    it    is                        as  it
pears       me,
            to   rigidly  enough, that this equal division obtains
also     the limit when one point passes into the line joining
        in
the other two. Mr. Earnshaw thus argues                  opposition                  in                       to

ply nearest to the direction of PA.
   Now, as is shown in the note, there is a certain direction be
tween which and the normal at either point, if any force be
applied, the surfaces will supply a resistance opposite to that
force, but if the force be applied further from the normal
than this direction, then no resistance will be afforded by the
surfaces in an opposite direction.       The angle which this                                                              di

 from the tendency of the opposite semiarch to motion, and is
 just equal to that tendency. It is therefore equal to the least
jorce which would support that semiarch, and therefore to
the least force which would support the first-mentioned semi
arch; or it is a minimum subject to the conditions, and
therefore the pressure upon the abutment is also a minimum.
And the positions of the resultants of the pressures upon the
different points of the key and abutments, as well as the mag
nitudes of those resultants, are subject to this law”.
    Here, then, we have verified another application of the
principle of least pressure, and it is shown to constitute a
most important element in the true theory of the arch, deter

XXXVI.        Remarks on Mr. Christie's Bakerian Lecture, pub
    lished in the Philosophical Transactions for 1833, Part I.
    By the Rev. WILLIAM RITCHIE, LL.D., F.R.S., &c.
     Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy in the
    Royal Institution of Great Britain, and in the University of
    London.
                           To Sir David               Brewster.                    s
      Dear Sir,                                                                                  -
HAP   this lecture appeared as a simple communication by
  the author, I should have done nothing more than point
out the discrepancies between the results and those which I ob
tained about the same time for voltaic electricity.  But as my
communication is printed in the same volume of the Transac
tions as that which has been thus selected and rewarded for
its scientific excellence, and as both communications cannot
be true, I consider myself called upon either to acknowledge
the fallacy of the conclusions at which I arrived, or to point out
the errors into which the author of the Bakerian Lecture has
                I
fallen. As am still as much convinced of the truth of my
communication as when it was read before the Royal Society,
I  have only one course left to pursue, namely, to point out the
fallacy of the conclusions stated in the Bakerian Lecture,
which I shall do without the intention or the fear of giving
offence either to the author or to the Council of the Royal
Society. We are           all
                       engaged     the same disinterested warfare,
in  forcing reluctant Nature              to in
                                    confess the truth: we contend
for  Truth,  not for Victory.
I    shall feel obliged    you and the other Editors
                                to                        you will                     if

ing, viz. That the conducting power of wires of the same
metal varies as the squares of their diameters directly, and as
their lengths inversely.        “Or we may say, that the intensity
or conducting power varies as the mass or weight directly, and
the square of the length inversely.”             The law thus obtained
for magneto-electricity is exactly the same as that obtained by
 M. Becquerel for voltaic electricity.
      Ihave formerly shown that this law of M. Becquerel does
not   give even an approximation to the truth for voltaic elec
tricity”, and as                     all
                        are agreed about the identity          the electri                        of

 neto-electricity must          equally remote from the truth.

      Mathematical Tracts. By J. W. Lubbock, Esq., F.R.S.
This     volume, which forms an important addition to the libraries
     of the astronomer and the analyst, consists of three tracts, the
objects of which we proceed to state, seriatim.
1.         On the Theory    Moon, and on the Perturbations of the
                                   of the
                                 Planets.

     “The stability of a system of bodies in motion subject to the
law of mutual gravitation which obtains in nature, is a question,”
Mr. Lubbock observes, “ of great interest. It appears to me,” he
continues, “that it may be established through considerations dif.
ferent from those hitherto employed, namely, by observing that
the quantities which have been called c and g in the Lunar The
ory are rational, so that no imaginary angles or exponentials are in
troduced in the expressions for the coordinates of the body in
motion, which are thus functions of periodic quantities. In the
theory of the moon I apprehend this theorem is certainly indepen
dent of the direction of the moon's motion.”

     Inthe short Treatise upon the Attraction of Spheroids which con
stitutes the second part of this tract, the author has endeavoured to
treat that subject in as elementary a manner as possible. He has
made continual references      in it to the authors who have written upon
the  figure of the earth: it may serve therefore, in some measure, to
illustrate the first chapter in the fifth volume of the Mécanique Céleste.
He shows, in the Preface, that the first addition to the Newtonian
theory of the figure of the earth was made, not by Clairaut, as af
firmed by Laplace, but by our countryman Stirling, in his paper “Of
the Gravity of the Earth, and the Variation of Gravity on the Sur
face,” which was published in the Philosophical Transactions for
 1735, two years prior to the appearance, in the same collection, of
the memoir in which Clairaut proved the approximate expressions
which Stirling (as evinced in his paper) must already have been in
possession          of.

deviate from the course which had previously been always pursued
by mathematicians, and to employ equations in which the true lon
gitude is the independent variable. Instead, however, of integrating
the equations of motion by the method of indeterminate coefficients,
as the author had proposed, M. Poisson recommends the adoption of
the method of the variation of the elliptic constants.              In the present
paper, Mr. Lubbock states the reasons which have determined him
not to employ the latter method, founded chiefly on the advantages
of obtaining complete uniformity in the methods used in the theories
of the moon and of the planets, and also in that of a greater rapidity
of approximation by the improvements introduced in these methods.
     Laplace, in the Mécanique Céleste, alludes to an equation of long
period, of which the argument is twice the longitude of the moon's
node, plus the longitude of her perigee, minus three times the longi
 tude of the sun's perigee ; and M. Poisson has shown that the co
efficient of the corresponding argument in the development of the
disturbing function equals zero: but the author shows that the same
 result may be arrived at very simply, by means of the method of de
 veloping the variation of the disturbing function.

 of Bath.” By Charles G. B. Daubeny, M.D., F.R.S., Professor of

     The author, pursuant to an intention expressed in a former paper
 read to the Society, undertook a series of experiments, for the purpose
 of measuring the gas evolved from the thermal springs at Bath during
 a period of time sufficiently long to enable him to determine with
  tolerable precision            its

teen years of observations which have been discussed by Mr. Dessiou,
under the direction of Mr. Lubbock, and which include 13,073 ob
servations. His first object is to determine the manner in which the
time of high-water is affected by the following conditions, namely, the
right ascensions, declinations and parallaxes of the sun and moon ;
for which purpose he considers at some length, first, the establish
ment; secondly, the semimenstrual inequality; thirdly, the correc
tions for lunar parallax ; fourthly, the lunar declination; and lastly,
the solar parallax and declination.    He next discusses the empirical
laws of the height of high-water; which he observes will be affected
in the same manner as the periods of the tides, by a semimenstrual
inequality, by corrections for lunar parallax and declination, and by
a solar correction; and concludes by giving a formula for computa
tion which comprehends                           all
                                     these elements.        He then enters into                                                    a

   Jan. 16, 1834.—“On a new property of the Arcs of the Equi
lateral Hyperbola.”      By Henry Fox Talbot, Esq., M.P., F.R.S.
   By an analytical process, the author arrives at the following theorem,
namely, if three abscissae of an equilateral hyperbola are materially
dependent by reason of two assumed equations, which are symmetrical
with respect to these three abscissae, the sum of the arcs subtended
by them is equal to three quarters of the product of the same ab
scissie, or only differs therefrom by a constant quantity.      In order to
satisfy himself of the correctness of this theorem, the author calculated
various numerical examples, which entirely confirmed           This simple                     it.

is described as being discoloured to a distance of three miles by the
detritus carried down by the river, with regard to which it may be
stated that the base of the triangle of the delta is above 125
miles.
     After mentioning a range of hills called the Hala Mountains,
which extends in a northerly direction from the sea-shore west
 ward of the mouths of the Indus, and terminates to the N.W. of
 Cabool in the Hindoo Caucasus, and which consists, in part of com
 pact nummulitic limestone, the author proceeds to describe the
 principal geological features which he observed on the banks of this
 great river. The town of Hydrabad, he states, is built on a finely
 grained, shelly limestone. At Schwan in lat. 26°22' and at Curachee,
 are hot wells; and the island of Bukhur, in lat. 27°42', consists en
 tirely of flint. On the eastern bank of the river, opposite this island,
 is a precipice of flint, 40 feet high, on which the village of Roree
 is built. In lat. 28° 55 the rivers of the Punjab fall into the Indus.
 Still higher up, in lat. 33", at Kara Bagh, the river cuts through a
 range of hills, described by Mr. Elphinstone as the salt range. The
 salt is found in layers of about a foot in thickness, separated from
 each other by thin strata of clay. With the exception of this range
 of hills, which is estimated to be about 1800 feet above the level of
  the sea, the district of the Punjab is uniformly flat; but the hilly di
 strict is intersected by numerous defiles, presenting vertical strata,
  which terminate in peaked points. Between the river Sutlege and
 Lahore the country consists of indurated clay, sometimes gravelly.
     At Attoch, much higher up, the rocks by which the Indus is con
  fined consist of a dark coloured micaceous slate, which is said to
  extend to the southward until it meets the salt range above men
  tioned. Near this place gold is washed out of the sand of the river.
     At Lahore, in February 1832, the author experienced a very vio
  lent shock of an earthquake. Several valleys were choked up by
  the masses of rock thrown down from the overhanging precipices,
  and a great part of the population of Badakhshan was destroyed.
  In crossing the Punjab the author observed that several buildings
  of the Mogul Emperors were decaying from the foundations, and
  were encrusted with an efflorescence of nitre.        Proceeding to the
  westward from the Indus, he found bituminous coal at Cohat, and
  that the salt range above mentioned extended across the country
  into this district.    The river of Cabool flows through a very nar
  row defile, the rocks of which rise to a height of 2000 feet, and con
  sist of sandstone, quartz rock and mica schist, the strata of the
  latter being vertical.     Cabool is situated 6000 feet above the sea.
  The neighbouring hills are covered with rounded pebbles of      allsizes,
  sometimes loose,    at   others forminga    conglomerate.  A   beautiful
  white marble is     found near Cabool, and the rocks are occasionally
  covered with asbestus.
     From Cabool the author crossed the Hindoo Caucasus to Balkh
  and the plains of     Tartary. This range                   the prolon

peak in the range, the only part of which that is covered with per
petual snow is the Koh-i-Baba, between Cabool and Bameean, from
which latter place the waters flow northward into the Oxus. In
some of the defiles through which the author passed, the sides rose
to a height of 2000 or 3000 feet.       The loftiest peak which he ob
served between Cabool and Hajeeguk consisted of gneiss or granite,
sometimes deeply impregnated with iron.           These formations were
succeeded by blueslates and quartz rock, and precipices of micaceous
schist. From the summits of the precipices masses of green granite
and other rocks had been hurled into the valley below. Further
down is a calcareous conglomerate, succeeded by cliffs of reddish
and purple coloured clay, and by ridges of indurated clay mixed
with bands of a harder nature. In this ridge great idols are carved
and caves excavated, for it is easily worked.        The neighbourhood
of Bameean is described as     producing   gold,  lead,  copper, tin, anti
mony, sulphur and iron.
   The lower passes of Hindoo Koosh consist principally of a light
brown splintery limestone, of great hardness, and susceptible of a
high polish.    This formation is followed by sandstone rocks, in one
of which round flint stones are imbedded at regular intervals. The
real peak of Hindoo Koosh lies about a degree to the eastward of
this route, and the difficulty of crossing it is very great.
   From Khooloom, whence the author descended into the plains of
Toorkistan, the country slopes gradually towards the Caspian. It is
generally flat and is watered by the Oxus.
   The author then describes the course of the Oxus, from its source
in the high plain of Pameer until it is lost in the sea of Aral, after
passing through a low and swampy district.          He does not believe
that the Oxus ever terminated in the Caspian Sea, and concludes
that what are called the dry river beds between Astrabad and Khina
are the remains of ancient canals. The natives pretend that the
waters of the Aral pass by a subterranean communication into the
Caspian Sea, and that at a place called Kara-goombuz, between
the two seas, the water may be heard gushing beneath. It              how    is,

   Jan. 8, 1834.—A paper was read by Roderick Impey Murchison,
Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S.,  “On the Old Red Sandstone in the Counties of
Hereford, Brecknock and Caermarthen, with collateral Observations
on the Dislocations which affect the north-west margin of the South
Welsh Coal-basin.”
   This memoir is presented     as the first of a series of communica
tions resulting from researches made during the last summer.
   A short sketch is given of the structure of that portion of the car
boniferous limestone of the South Welsh coal-field, which, in Breck
mock and Caermarthenshires, is contiguous to those older formations,
which were the peculiar subject of the author's examination.
   After noticing some features which are common to the mountain
limestone in other districts, such as an oolitic structure, and the ex
istence of caverns and funnel-shaped cavities, attention is specially
called to a portion of the limestone near Gwinfe in Caermarthenshire,
the exterior of which exhibits a high polish.    As these polished beds
protrude from the edge of a turf bog, it is suggested that such effects
may have been produced by the long-continued action of a weak ve
getable acid issuing from the morass, and altering the surface of the
rock.
   I. Old Red Sandstone.—The old red sandstone is divided into
 three groups.
   a. “Conglomerate and sandstone.”         b. “Cornstones and marl.”
c.  “ Tile-stones.”
   a. The uppermost of these groups, occupying the loftiest summits
the country described, such as the Brecon and Caermarthen Fans, is
uniformly capped by a band of conglomerate, underlaid by a vast
thickness of sandstone. Neither calcareous beds nor organic remains
have been discovered in this group.
    b. The central group is spread in undulating masses over the
greater part of Herefordshire. The argillaceous red marls of which it
consists, contain many beds of concretionary limestone or cornstone,
with some strata of sandstone.
    Remains of Crustacea have been found in this group, together with
defences of fish, &c.
   c. The tile-stones are best exhibited in a remarkably rectilinear es
carpment, extending from the north-western extremity of the Mynidd
Eppint to near the mouth of the Towey, a distance of about thirty
five miles.
   These beds contain fossils in Caermarthenshire, and also in their
north-eastern prolongation into Shropshire: among them are Lingula,
Avicula, three or four species of univalves,asmall species of Orthocera

into the “Ludlow Rock,” or highest member of the grauwacke series.
   The limits of certain detached basins of the old red sandstone, par
tially described during the last session, and which are spread over the
area of the inferior grauwacke rocks, have this year been extended west
ward to the source of the Teme, and twenty-five miles to the north-west
of the ancient line of demarcation.                             The      absence       of    all   vegetable           re

collar, and a second screw acting horizontally, and at right angles
to the line of direction of the needle. By a little adjustment, the
two points on the needle are made to coincide in the field of view
of the telescope of the sextant; and the radius is then moved until
the meridian mark (at such a distance as to make the parallax of
the instrument inappreciable,) coincides with them. The degrees
read off give twice the horizontal divergence of the needle.   If an
east point can be easily procured, a means of correcting this result
will readily suggest itself. This mode may prove of great import
ance in experiments on diurnal variation, and as it requires but
trifling expense, the investigation is opened to many who were
deterred by the price of the apparatus ordinarily in use. With the
dipping needle the process is precisely similar, the axis being so
constructed that the points can be observed in conjunction, and a
horizontal mark at a distance previously obtained.

  The occurrence to which Mr. Henwood has alluded in your last
Number (p. 103.), namely, the formation of clouds on Paul Hill, while
the rest of the atmosphere was almost free from clouds, is easily ac
counted for, on the principle that vapour exists in the atmosphere
in a quantity proportional to              its

and has been examined since, principally by Braconnot and Berze
lius: the former obtained an acid from rice and beet-root, which he
supposed to be peculiar, and gave it the name of nanceic acid, which
has been since found to be identical with lactic acid.
    Bouillon-Lagrange and L. Gmelin having suggested that lactic
acid was merely impure acetic acid, it appeared probable to Berze
lius that it might be a compound acid, analogous to the sulphovinic:
he left the subject, however, in a state of uncertainty, admitting that
the lactates in a pure state are unknown.

                                        Pelouze exposed a considerable
 quantity of beet-root     juice to fermentation, in a stove the tempera
 ture of which was       constantly   between 77° and 81°Fahr. After
 some days had elapsed, the tumultuous motion, known by the name
 of the viscous fermentation, took place throughout the mass: hy
 drogen gas, mixed with carburetted hydrogen gas, was abundantly
 disengaged.     In about two months the fermentation ceases; the
 liquor becomes fluid again, and it is then to be evaporated to the
 consistence of a syrup.         Crystals of mannite are then diffused
 through the liquor, and these, when washed with cold water and
 pressed, are extremely pure: the mass contains, besides, a sugar
 which had        all

 into grape sugar and then into mannite; for when the fermentation
is  long continued, mannite only          obtained without grape sugar.

   From these analyses it appears that the two acids differ merely in
the fluid one containing two equivalents of water, while the crystals
are anhydrous.     Four analyses were performed, employing lactates
instead of the liquid and crystallized acid. They differed but slightly;

its   equivalent would          be      1021, and                   its   composition would be,

opium. It was boiled in water with magnesia: the precipitate, washed
and dried, was treated with boiling alcohol, which dissolved the morphia,
and 30 grains were obtained. M. Fontenelle remarks that if these ex
periments should be confirmed, it will prove the error of rejecting
poppy seeds when the capsules are employed for making decoctions.

ANALYSIS OF THE                BLUE ARSENIATE OF COPPER OF CORNWALL
   According to M.    Wachmeister, the powder of this mineral is of an

   The authors  observe, that the excrement of the dog contains much
azote, while the small quantity contained in that of the horse may be
attributed to an admixture of animal fluids, as the bile, mucus, &c.
   MM. Macaire and Marcet have arrived at the following as the
results of their experiments:
    1st, That the elementary chemical composition, and especially
with respect to the azote, is similar in the chyle of herbivorous
and carnivorous mammifera.                  -
   2nd, That arterial blood contains as much azote, but less carbon
than venous blood.
   3rd, That the elementary chemical composition of the blood of
graminivorous and carnivorous animals is identical, and the sub
stances which they contain have also the same composition.
   4th, That when equal weights of the two fluids have been per
fectly dried, the blood of a mammiferous animal, whatever may have
been the mode of its nourishment, contains more azote than its
chvle.
  #.     That the excrement of carnivorous animals contains more
                                                               -
azote than that of herbivorous animals.
   6th, That neither carnivorous nor herbivorous animals can exist
upon food entirely free from azote.
   7th, and lastly, That unless it be allowed that azote may be
formed by the process of vitality, it must be admitted that what the
chyle contains is supplied from the food, and that in the two classes
of mammifera examined, respiration supplies the complement of
that which is found in the blood.—Ann. de Chim., tom.           371.                              li.   p.

 XLI.     On the Influence of successive Impulses of Light upon
     the Retina.   By Sir DAVID BREwsTER, LL.D., F.R.S.,
     V.P.R.S. Ed.
      ROM       the remarkable experinent of Mrs. Griffiths, de
       scribed in a former Number”, it appears that the reti
 culated structure of the retina may be rendered visible by
 throwing light suddenly on the closed eye when in a state of
 repose, and especially in the morning, before the retina has
 been subjected to the action of any other light.
    In repeating this experiment,               I
                                             have found that a remark
 able structure may be exhibited at any time, and whether the
 eyes are open or shut, by subjecting the retina to the action
 of successive impulses of light.                 If,
                                               when                   we

with a nebulosity of yellow light, the accidental colour being
the invariable companion of the primitive one.

cidental colour succeed each other in the pattern, let us call

tensity, it follows that different parts of the retina have dif
ferent degrees of sensibility to light. The lines which form
the network are probably thicker than the interstices between
them, and consequently less susceptible to luminous impres
sions. In like manner the interstices nearest to the foramen
centrale are probably thinner than those more remote, and
hence it is easy to understand why they exhibit a greater sen
sibility and a more rapid change of colour.      these views are       If
correct, we not only obtain a general explanation of the phae
nomena which we have described, but of many others which
have hitherto perplexed the optical physiologist, and among
these we may enumerate the phaenomena of oblique vision,
and the superior distinctness of objects when they are seen                                        di
rectly along the axis of the eye.
   In a former paper I had occasion to mention a very re
markable fact, which I had long ago discovered, that the                                           in
tensity of a given light may be increased physiologically by
causing it to act upon the retina by successive impulses of a
given duration.    Those who may repeat the preceding ex
periments will obtain an ocular demonstration of the truth of
this new property of light.    The maximum physiological                                           in
tensity seems to take place when
                                                       T is nearly equal to D+                     d.

 half more.
      This difficulty may, perhaps,                 be   partly explained by refer
 ring to page 262 of your paper, where, alluding to a particular
 compound, you add in a note, “assuming the double atom of
 phosphoric acid             (#)       = 892-3.”         Now, I do not observe in
 the tables of Berzelius any mention                           of     a double     atom; and
 the atom is there represented, not by                     P=             892.3, as you state,
but by       P=      892-3.            Let, however, P in page 255 of your
 paper have the same meaning as in page 262, and then the
 salt will be neutral according to your notation, though not
 according to your statement.
    In concluding this part of the subject, permit me to express
 a wish that you would furnish me with a table of acids and salts
 similar to that in page 282; but instead of containing an ac
 count of the atoms of oxygen in the soda, water and acid,
I  wish for a simple statement of their composition, and the
atomic weight of each.       I would save you the trouble if it
 were in my power; but I really cannot accomplish it with any
degree of certainty or satisfaction, on account of the discre
pancies which I have pointed out, and some others which,
your paper contains.
    With respect to Mr. Prideaux’s “Remarks,” on my                                           “Ob
servations,” I shall now show that they are inaccurate both
with regard to the facts and fancies of symbolizing.      He says
“there is but one known combination of phosphorus with
five atoms of oxygen; in which many chemists (chiefly in this
country) apprehend the phosphorus to enter as a single atom,
whilst others regard it as double, from       requiring     atoms   its
of   alkali.”   This             is    an
                            admission that, according        most                   is to 2
foreign chemists, and Berzelius,                     be

single atom     of phosphorus with five atoms       oxygen; and             of
consequently, while Berzelius symbolizes phosphorus                                           by   P,
and two atoms               by   P,    he
                            adds five dots   the latter, denoting
                                                               to
its   conversion into            an   atom   of   phosphoric acid             P.

a system which     he formerly characterized as one “in which
we see the acid and alkali, and the elementary composition of
each : the bases expressed in their initial letters; and oxygen,
the great modifier of chemical properties;–the pivot, as it
were, round which chemical agency revolves,—is exhibited in
a manner equally characteristic, prominent and compact, by
dots, corresponding to the number of atoms placed over the
symbol.”    Surely any alteration effected in such a system
must be for the worse.
   Mr. Prideaux, alluding to another set of symbols which                                                         I
quoted in my observations, says, “Warrington's, as there
printed, appears to signify quadroxide of potassium, soda, and
24 water.”     By the words as there printed, in italics, Mr.
Prideaux intends, I presume, to insinuate that they are so
printed nowhere else.    Mr. Prideaux ought, however, to know
that the privilege of changing symbols is not confined to him
self and Berzelius.    Mr. Warrington   proposed a notation in
the Lond. and Edinb. Phil. Mag., vol.       Sept. 1832,    which        i.,                            in

 XLIV.           On the External Structure                     of   Imperfect      Plants.          By
                    the Rev. PATRIck KEITH, F.L.S.*
 IFminutely,
    a plant of the imperfect class is taken and inspected
             at any season, it will be found to be defective, or
  apparently defective in one or other of the more conspicuous
 parts or organs of vegetables in general, such as the root,
 stem, leaf, blossom, seed. Yet in the class of imperfect plants,
 as in that of the perfect plants already surveyed, the eye
 readily recognises traces of a similitude or dissimilitude of
 external habit and deportment characterizing the numerous
 individuals of which it consists, and suggesting the idea of
 distinct tribes or families. Upon this principle botanists have
 instituted different divisions, more or less extensive, according
 to their different views of the subject; and some of their late
 alterations we regard as improvements. The student who
 wishes to make himself acquainted with the divisions and sub
 divisions that have been recently introduced into the class
 Cryptogamia, will find a very good view of them in the first
 numbers of Burnett's Outlines of Botany; though we cannot
 agree with the learned professor in thinking that the study of
 the simplest structures is that which the tyro in botany ought
 to begin withi. This is the converting of a pleasing and
 agreeable study into a difficult and disagreeable task.           It is
the seizing of the bull by the horns at the first onset.           The
 study of the ascending scale is both delightful and instructive,

merely, and does not profess to enter into detail. On this
account we content ourselves with the old division by which
they are distributed into Filices, Musci, Hepaticae, Algae,
Fungi; or, in plain English, Ferns, Mosses, Liverworts, Flags,
Mushrooms, without entering into the detail of their several
subdivisions.
   The Filices, or Ferns.—Ferns are herbaceous, and for the
most part, stemless plants, dying down to the ground in the
winter, but furnished with a perennial root, from which there
annually issues a frond bearing the fructification.     The fa
vourite habitats of many of them are heaths and uncultiva
ted grounds, intermixed with furze and brambles.

tion.    Yet in Equisetum the trunk is a jointed and upright
 stem; in Pilularia it is jointed and trailing; in Lycopodium it
is lash-shaped and creeping.            Ferns strictly so called have no
branches; yet in the Lycopodiaceae and Equisetaceae branches
are to be found. In the latter they issue in whorls; in the
former they do not originate in any regular order.                   Among
ferns, leaves are not to be met with, at least as distinct and
separate organs, except in Lycopodiaceae and Marsiliaceae,
which tribes, together with the Equisetaceae, have so much that
is peculiar to themselves respectively, that botanists now ar
range them as distinct orders".                               -
    It was for a long time thought that ferns were destitute of
seeds and propagated nobody knows how; yet there is no
botanist of the present day who doubts the reality of fern
seed, or at the least of sporules from which new plants spring.
Some botanists have even fancied that they had detected the
parts of the antecedent flower +. But admitting that such de
tection is impracticable, the botanist can, at least, direct his
attention to the mode of fructification, and to the fruit or
sporule produced.          In ferns strictly so called the fructifica
tion is dorsal, that              is,
                             scattered       patches in   clusters—sori—   or

                     the frond.      These     patches   are generally ac
companied with           integument called the indusium, which

   As they affect the most barren soils, so they thrive best also
in the coldest and wettest seasons; so that even the chilling
blast of winter, that deprives other plants of their foliage and
threatens destruction to the race of vegetables, serves but to
refresh and to revive the family of the mosses.
   The root consists generally of a number of small and slen
der fibres, closely matted together, as in Tetraphis viridula;
smooth, as in most examples; or covered with a fine and vel
vety down, of a dark or rusty colour, as in Bryum ligulatum,
one of the most beautiful of all British mosses.     Some mosses
are altogether stemless, as in the case of Phascum muticum ;
but where a stem exists, it is generally like the root, weak and
slender, though sometimes stiff and shrubby, as in Hypnum
alopecurum.    The branches are in their structure similar to
that of the stem, and are distributed, in certain genera, ac
cording to some uniform and specific mode; in others, with
out any regular order.    The leaves of the mosses are exceed
ingly minute, but are, at the same time, exceedingly elegant.
The most frequent forms are the linear, the lanceolate, the
oval, the concave.    They are always, as I believe, sessile,
 though often decurrent, or sheathing, with the margin beauti
fully waved.    Some are entirely smooth, as in Hypnum splen
 dens; others are beautifully dotted, or reticulated, or streaked,
 as in Hypnum striatum. The Burbaumia aphylla of Schmidel
 was thought to be wholly leafless, till Dr. Brown at last de
tected its leaves                *.

Finally, Hedwig, born, as it was said, to abolish cryptogamy,
perceiving           disorder and obscurity in which everything
                      the
 lay relative to the fructification of the mosses, undertook the
 arduous but indispensable task of investigating everything
 ab initio, and ultimately arrived at the conclusion, that the
 mosses are universally furnished with everything necessary
 to the botanical notion of a flower, and that their flowers are
chiefly dioecious, partly monoecious, and partly hermaphro
                                                               -

   According to Hedwig, the barren flowers are the stars, disks,
or buds that terminate the branches and nestle in the bosom
of the leaves. In their exterior they consist of leaves or scales,
larger or more elegant than the other leaves of the plant, but
never terminating in hairs. These Hedwig regards as consti
tuting the calyx.       In the interior they consist of a number of
small   thread-shaped       and succulent substances, issuing from
 between the     leaves,   or occupying the centre. These he re
 gards as stamens, furnished with an anther that bursts open
when ripe and discharges a pollen".              The fertile flowers are
of a most      singularly    curious construction.        They consist of
an  urn-shaped     capsule    surmounted with a       calyptra    or veil, in
the form of an extinguisher, and invested, at the base, with a
membrane called a perichaetium or fence.              Some writers have
called the fence a     calyx,   and the veil a    corolla;     but we be
lieve there is no unanimity among botanists on this point.

   The Hepatica,              or   Liverworts.-The liverworts are                 a   tribe

of small and herbaceous plants resembling the mosses, but
chiefly constituting fronds, and producing their fruit in a cap
sule that splits into longitudinal valves.      Their name is de
rived from a Greek word, Tag, àrarog, signifying the liver;
because, perhaps, some of them were formerly employed as a
remedy in diseases of the liver, or exhibit a slight resem
blance to the lobes of that organ. Their favourite habits are
wet and shady spots by the sides of springs and ditches, and
their vegetation is always the most rapid in cold and damp
weather.
   Many of them have no root, or at least no conspicuous
root, as Jungermannia asplenioides; but where a root is present
it is fibrous. In the greater number of them the herbage is
frondose, though not upright as in the ferns, but creeping
along upon the surface of the soil, and striking root as it ex
tends.    It is rather lobed than leaf-like, with the lobes over
lapping, and exhibiting under the microscope a fine network
of vesicles frequently transparent.
   The fructification of the liverworts is analogous to that of the
mosses.     According to Hedwig, the barren flowers are either
small and globular protuberances issuing from the summit
of the plant, or small and minute granules imbedded in the
body of the frond, or in target-shaped substances elevated on
a conspicuous pedicle as in Marchantia.        The fertile flowers,
for the most part, but particularly in the genus Jungermannia,
are furnished with a double envelope; the outer correspond
ing in some degree to the calyx, and the inner, which imme
diately invests the ovary, to the corolla of perfect plants.           If
the flower is left to ripen, the envelopes will, in the process of
fructification, burst open at the top, and discover a small pro
truding globule, of a black or brownish colour, and of about
the size of a millet-seed, which is by and by disengaged from
the envelopes entirely, and elevated on a fine and thread
shaped pedicle from a line to an inch in length. This ele
vated globule is the ovary, which when ripe separates into
four longitudinal valves, from the extremities of which a num
ber of small spiral and elastic threads issue, to which the seeds
                                          -
or sporules are attached.
   The Algae, or Flags.-The term Algae, which is of Latin
origin, and which we translate Flags, seems, primarily, to have
denoted any sort of plant or herb growing in sea-water.

   Many of the Fungi are altogether destitute of root, or at
least of any conspicuous root, being attached to some appro
priate basis of support merely by means of a flattened and
adhesive surface.     If any of them exhibits a root, it is nothing
more than a few fibres. The frond is thin and flat, or glo
bular, or bell-shaped, as in Nidularia, adhering to a basis
without any pedicle. But in a variety of genera it is furnished
with a stipe, solid or hollow, cylindrical or compressed, from
the size of a crow-quill to an inch or more in diameter, and
from being almost sessile, to six or eight inches in height.
Of the stipitate Fungi many are surmounted with a sort of co
nical production denominated the pileus, or cap, as in Agaricus
campestris, the Common Mushroom.             Its upper surface is ge
nerally smooth, though sometimes wrinkled; generally of a
white or yellow colour, but often of a beautiful red, as in the
elegant example of Amanita muscaria, or Fly Fungus.              The
under surface is furnished for the most part with a number of
thin and flat substances, resembling in their form the gills of a
fish, and designated by the same name.            Some have the ad
ditional appendage of a veil or curtain, inclosing the gills, in
the early stage of their growth; and some have the appendage
of a wrapper, enveloping the whole of the frond.
   If  the inner surface of the curtain is carefully examined with
a good magnifier before the time of                      its
                                                 natural detachment

Hedwig regards          as
                        the stamens.          the gills are next ex

                                         as

of small and minute granules, whether seeds          gems, from     or

seeds, not excepting even the lowest          the scale       vegetable  in                       of

by  him, after Purkinje and Steinbuch,     which the experi      in

The results of my own procedure in repeating that experi
ment are too remarkable to be concealed, whether justice to
myself or to the cause of physiological science be considered;
and as Sir David Brewster announces an immediate commu
nication on the same subject, it appears to me that courtesy
to him requires me to offer mine through the same channel.
Besides, it is possible that our researches may have lain in
different directions; and even if they happen to have led to the
same termination, Sir David's prior claim will be established,
and yet the deductions of an independent, though less                                                              in
formed, inquirer may have their value.
    1. C. W., like his predecessor Purkinje, employed a flame,
held within two or three inches of the eye, and on one side of
it,   orbelow,     produce the spectrum. On trying this, and
                                to
assisting others           the same,      do
                                           presently occurred
                                 of to
                                                                     me     it                                to

 no  sooner made than,                         on

 spectrum were never                           so
                              dark and well-defined          when the                              as
 focal image was accurately formed.

      Another observation, which may prove essential to further
researches,     is this (4), that with sunlight admitted as above,
 although the peculiar structure of the spot in question is                                     al
 ways distinctly enough seen, yet it never appears so bright
 as when the light falls on the verge of the cornea, in the re
gion of the ciliar circle. On using a lens and candlelight, the
silky texture is scarcely perceived, unless when the focus falls
on the ciliar region of the eye. The shifting mass of light
which, at this time, appears on the spot, would seem to have
entered the crystalline lens laterally through the colourless
portions of the integuments, and to be thence transmitted by
 reflection*.
    The easiest way to obtain correct measures of the quantities
of motion, would doubtless be by using a sunbeam fixed by
a heliostat in a darkened room; but I have not the means at
hand.      It requires some practice to manage a lens, and the
operation is at best complicated.        Besides the apprenticeship
to the use of the lens, the method itself of observing, namely,
by indirect vision, is at first perplexing, and demands a con
stant effort to resist the habitual tendency of the eye to follow
the object, and by that means exaggerate           apparent motion.its

                         are
dium and smaller vessels.  And this supposition derives sup
port from the fact that the trunks of the upper and lower
branches, when narrowly observed, have a perceptibly greater
motion than the general system has (Art. 10.); the excess
being distinguished by an alternating movement, like that of
a pair of shears, gently pressed and released by turns;–the
 perspective reason of which effect is very obvious. The esti
mated magnitude of the medium vessels also requires correc
tion (Art. 11.). On comparing their shadows with a gradu
ated system of bars at 15 feet distance, 3 inch proves more
 correct than $ ; and this element introduced into the corrected
calculation gives gºt inch, or less, for the diameters of the
 larger vessels in fig. 2. Of these, and yet more delicate ves
 sels, it is almost needless to remark, that not a trace appears

        Gentlemen,                                      -

    In
     the first place, Mr. Moseley denies “that        the forces                     if                of
the system     are notC parallel, their actions must      necessity                        of
propagate pressures.”     Now, for the sake          avoiding the                of
complexity      reasoning
                      of       general terms,     in   suppose the              let   us

 balance the forces A; but those of the latter are solely em
 ployed in balancing each other; and with regard to this set
 I   have to      observe:-
                            -
       1st,     That they are propagated by the forces of the                                          system     C,
 since no horizontal force can be propagated by the system A.
    2ndly, That, though in equilibrium amongst themselves,
 they cannot be removed by the principle of the superposition of
 forces; for the forces C are oblique, and consequently pro
 duce these horizontal pressures of necessity: that      change                                  is,   no
                                                                                                                hori
                                      It of
 in      the magnitudes                  the forces             C   can ever remove                these
 zontal pressures.              not allowable is      remove them          toany                            in
 other   way   than       changingby   the  magnitudes           C;   and any           C,of
 other method would         change    the directions            which cannot     of
     admitted, because the directions are given. Wherefore
 is be                                                                                                               it
    impossible            to
                      remove them          all.             at
    As rest my objections
           I                          Mr. Moseley's theory principally

It   is this.     believe that only the directions, and not the forces
                   I
themselves (when there are more than three), are functions                                                                      of

out     of the  question       saying        by

                   I                                  comprehend what the         to
coordinates have                    to
                           do with the matter.
    With regard           the body supported

hypothesis         construction, has shown that the pressure
                      of                                                     one                                     on

    finite; and thence infers that when the triangle passes into
an is evanescent state, the pressure               that prop undergoes       on                                               InO

                                                       is                                                                 let it

I   have shown that the          pressure         one  prop       zero   on long                  is                so
 as  the  triangle   remains    finite,   and come          in<U+017F>er,       the na             to                 by
 tural reasoning before mentioned, that                 continues zero when        it

                       is

attention of botanists to this study; for in his writings are
to be found many observations on the distribution of plants
over the different regions of the world.
    But the principal authors who have, within these few years,
brought botanical geography again into notice, and have given
to the world a vast deal of scientific information, collected in
various parts of the globe, are Humboldt, Bonpland, De
Candolle, Ramond, De Buch, Schouw, Mirbel, Tenore, Robert
Brown, Winch, and Wahlenberg,                 Dr. Schouw published in
1822 a work in       Danish,    entitled                 “A
                                                 Prodromus of the Uni
versal Geography of Plants.”           It was translated into German,
and published at Berlin in 1823.
   How unfortunate it is that so much valuable learning on
this subject remains locked up in an “unknown tongue,” at
least with respect to most of the botanists of England                                            I
must therefore only hope that some German scholar will

    The great Linnaeus, in different passages of his celebrated
works, has not ceased from recommending botanists to keep
an account of their observations on the influence which the
difference of climates and seasons exercises upon the periods
of vegetation.     By adding, according to his custom, the ex
ample to the precept, in his Philosophia Botanica, under the
title of “The Calendar of Flora,” he has there given a series
of researches instituted by himself on the vegetation of the
vicinity of the city of Upsal, from whose celebrated University
he dictated the rules that are essential in paying due attention
                                           -

of these remarks, although given in  the second volume of my
Fitognosia”, may be able to throw some light on the subject
which has so engaged me, I thought it could be reinserted in
this place, and improved by dividing it into the five following
articles, which correspond with the different periods of vege
tation.
                        I. Germination.
  The variations to which Nature      has subjected the sprouting
of seeds   (germinatio)   are generally  known.    Thus, for ex
ample, Millet, Wheat, and the greater part of the seeds of the
Plantae Cereales germinate in two or three days; the Lettuce,
the Gourds, the Cress, in from five to seven days; the common
Bean, the French Bean, the Onion, in about twenty, the Par
sley in about forty days; the Columbine, the Almond, the
Chestnut, the Paeony, the Filbert, the Cornel Tree, in from six
to eight months; and finally, the Roses, after the first or se
cond year.
    In this article of botanical geography, we must not dis
course on similar natural distinctions, but on the alterations
alone which can be produced in the sprouting of seeds by the
application of the varying causes of vegetation.
    Among these, heat, being the more powerful, forces and
exerts, the greater and more direct influence upon germina
tion; it can consequently be established, that this appearance
of vegetation will be in constant relation to the different degrees
of the temperature of the soil which surrounds the seeds.
                                 I
    [But, in the first place, think it better to add here a few
general noticest on the climate of the capital and vicinity of
Naples.
    Being situated between the Apennines and the sea, and
therefore under the prevalence of the alternations of the south
and north winds, the city of Naples must necessarily be ex
posed to those very rapid meteorological changes that render
the weather extremely variable and unsettled.
    In the spring, in the autumn, and in the winter, these varia
tions are felt more sensibly; in so much so, that frequently
the thermometer during the same day falls from 10° or 12° of
 Reaumur (54° or 59° of Fahrenheit) to 4° or 5° Reaum. (41°
or 43°Fahr.), and vice versä; and the state of the heavens                         al
 ternates between calm, clouds, rain, hail and storm.
    In general the spring is very short, and is often confounded
 with the summer, in consequence of the high temperature
 which is wont to take place at the end of the winter. Indeed,
 in some months of that season, and especially in May, the

  changes of the atmosphere are so instantaneous that one may
  in the same day be overcome with heat, and so cold as to re
  quire a fire. The winter is mild and rather damp; but snow
  very rarely falls.        In Naples the thermometer in winter has

     The sea-breezes and the west winds make the great heats
 of the summer to be endured in the capital. Then most vio
 lent thunder storms are very frequent, being attracted by the
 lofty range of the Apennines, which occupy the larger por
 tion of the kingdom; for in that season the thermometer
 stands almost always between 20° and 22° Reaum. (77° and
 81% Fahr.), and for a few days it will even ascend to 23° and
 25° Reaum. (84° and 88° nearly Fahr.).

    * Compare this with the Journals kept by the Royal Society in London,
and published in the Philosophical Transactions for those years, and with
the Meteorological Tables given in the Annals of Philosophy of the same
years. Also with the tables of the weather kept near High Wycombe,
Bucks, at p. 351, vol. v. of Loudon’s Magazine of Natural History, wherein
the years 1823, 1824 and 1825 are stated.          I have not thought it neces

      of the Climate of Naples upon the Periods of Vegetation. 279
      those five years the maximum heat was found to reach
      In
30°. Reaum. (100° nearly Fahr.) on the 7th of August 1824,
and the minimum was —2°8 Reaum. (about 26° Fahr.) on
December 30th, 1822.]
    Now to prove the truth of the principle before stated with
regard to heat, it will be sufficient to observe that the seeds
of the plants of hot climates, introduced into temperate cli
mates, germinate very much later than they do in their native
countries; whilst the germination of the seeds of cold cli
mates is remarkably accelerated by their being transported
into temperate climates.        For the sake of an application to
this same principle, we are obliged in the stoves of our botanic
gardens to raise the heat to a very high point, in order to
make the seeds of the equinoctial countries sprout; and on
the contrary, for the growth of those of the northern climes,
we must select the colder and more shady situations.
     The different temperature which usually predominates in
the same seasons in different years likewise exercises         great
                                                                                              of its

                       on                    Mr. Carter's                   Paper on the Gopher-wood.
                                 By CHARLEs T. BEKE, Esq.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
         Gentlemen,
 I OBSERVE        that my paper on the Gopher-wood of Scrip
     ture, which appeared in the Number of your Magazine
 for August last, has given rise to the observations upon the
 same subject, made by Mr. Carter in your last Number.
    That gentleman justly states my argument to be, that the
 word      "El       (gópher)      the same as "EE (köpher);
                                         is probably
that kopher means pitch; and that consequently the wood in
                                                             -
question would appear to be that of a pitch tree.
   The first of these propositions Mr. Carter allows to be
“highly probable”; but at the same time that he admits
gopher to be identical with kopher, and thus agrees with me
in   all
      that really contended for,        thinks  very question               he
                                                                                           it it
              I
able that the latter word means     pitch,         rendered                           as           is                          in
the received English and                                  all
                               other authorized versions, for
the reason, principally, that the verb                                                nº           (kaphâr), from
which      nº
           (kopher)     plainly derived, is nowhere used                              is                                       in
Scripture       in    the sense              of      ‘to cover
                                      daub with pitch.”                     or
   But this reasoning must surely have been adopted too
hastily; for Mr. Carter can never intend          his meaning                         it   to      be
                                             secondary sense,

282                Mr.J.     Phillips on the Ancient and partly buried
 evidence which we possess upon the subject ought to lead
 us to a very different conclusion; and with respect to the
 former assumption, I will refer to the paper “ on the former
 extent of the Persian Gulf,” which appeared in your Number
 for last month (February), from which, if the facts adduced in
 it are correct, the inference would appear to be that the ark
 could not possibly have been built anywhere in the neigh
 bourhood alluded to by Mr. Carter.                                          -

No trace of the penetration of roots into the clay beneath was
remarked along several miles of cutting: the trees were mostly
in fragments, lying in confusion, and collected into a few
spots, while the branches and decayed leaves, &c., were more
generally spread. , Phosphate of iron was frequently seen,
but I obtained no bones.
   5. These appearances were observed at intervals along a
great length of the drain; and they show to a certainty that
the term ‘subterranean forest’ is wholly inapplicable to these
vegetable accumulations, if it be meant by this term to de
scribe forests submerged in the place of their growth. On the
contrary, the whole is clearly a water-drifted mass of frag
mented and uprooted trees, bushes, branches, fruits, land
shells, &c. It was interesting to observe that the quantity of
trees and peaty matter, where no evidence of river channels
could be seen, increased toward the gravelly hills; and            was  I
much impressed with the probability that the trees and bushes
had grown on these hills, and after falling by decay or violent
tempests, had found resting places in the neighbourhood, and
been gradually covered by sediment from the tide, then, per
haps, for the first time admitted. Only one layer of peat and
trees was anywhere seen, and this observation is general for
the low lands connected with the Humber.
    6. Between the villages of Swine and Waghen, or Wawn,
the drain crosses a remarkable flat morass, of about 100 acres
in extent, and circumscribed by gravel knolls, called Wawn
Turf Car. Toward the north-western margin of this morass
a great number of stumps of trees rise 1 or 2 feet above the
coarse grassy surface, and suggest to every beholder the no
tion of a humid forest, which had perished by violence of
wind rather than by decay or the hand of man. They are
nearly of equal and rather large size, stand in attitude of growth,
with expanded roots, at distances such as old and large trees
planted by Nature observe. As              far        we
                                               could find, every one

  magnitude, though several of the oaks and pines were long

in the Humber, where the rise of the tide may be taken at
24 feet.      How can we explain the growth of trees at the
level of half-tide 2 The notion appears to be general amongst
geologists that phaenomena of this kind require the admission
of local or general changes of level of the land and sea. That
such changes have often occurred is indisputable, and few
parts of the country have not experienced them.                   But in this
particular instance there seems no necessity for invoking any
such operation: what is known of the action of the sea on the
coast of Yorkshire and in the estuary of the Humber will give
us a more simple and more applicable theory.
     In order to see this, we have only to consider what would
be the effect upon the movement of the tide over the levels of
 Holderness if              its
                       rampart      banks was removed. Undoubtedly

                                        to                heights inversely to

  might exist and          drainedbe  though     their surface was below
  the present tide level. Now                 well known that the whole

 of   the mouth        the Humber has been greatly changed; large
                            of
  portions          of
                  land have been washed away both within and
  without the Spurn Point, and from the opposite coast                    Lin                       of
   colnshire about Grimsby; and the cliffs            Paghill are only the

288      On the Ancient and partly buried Forests of Holderness.
remains of a ridge of shelly gravel, which once extended
further to the south, and contracted the now broad estuary.
We may therefore easily admit that the aperture for the en
trance of the tide has been augmented. It is also certain that
before the embankments the interior basins were very much,
nay, a hundred times, larger than those which now receive the
Humber flood. There are, perhaps, 300 square miles of sur
face bordering the rivers which are below the level of the tide,
and therefore must at least in part have been flooded.                It
might then very easily happen that the land-locked basin of
Wawn might be imperfectly drained, wholly free from marine
irruptions, and capable of supporting a forest of pines upon
earlier accumulations of drifted timber.
    10. There is another consideration of some importance in
discussions concerning the ancient levels of marshy and peaty
countries.        The peat bed which occupied perhaps 3 or 6
feet in thickness while wet and spongy, will shrink to half or
one third the depth when drained; and if loaded with sediment,
as in the process of warping, will be compressed to a few
inches.       In some cases, therefore, the difference of levels as
now existing must be corrected by this rule to give the former
difference.
    In conclusion, it seems necessary to remark, that it is not
intended to convey the impression that this mode of explana
tion will apply to every case of ‘subterranean forests', nor that
it is actually applied by me to the whole area of the buried
forests of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.           I have here discussed
a particular case leading to some general reflections, but am

 the same position which they originally occupied.           When the
 eye looks lengthwise through a piece of doubly refracting
 spar thus prepared (and therefore very obliquely through the
 Canada balsam), only one image is seen. If two such instru
 ments are placed one before the other, and the observer looks
 through both, then, if they are in a similar situation, a printed
 book can be read through the combination with ease and di
 stinctness; but if one of them be turned round 90°, total dark
 ness is the consequence”.
     Now it will be observed, that the inventor attributed the
 fact of the instrument's producing only one image to a great
 “divergency” which it causes in the images, throwing one of
 them aside, out of the field of view.      The German writer fol
 lows the same idea, but adds, that in his opinion such diver
 gency is caused by the Canada balsam, whose index of refrac
 tion being 1:549, is intermediate between that of the ordinary
 ray 1-654, and that of the extraordinary ray 1483, which
 circumstance will (in his opinion) account for the rays being
 “thrown opposite ways”. He adds, that any one “who was
 not afraid of the trouble” might easily calculate the path of
 both rays; a remark which shows that his idea was, that they
 were both transmitted, and diverging from each other.              But
 I find that this great divergency does not in point of fact exist;
 for by inclining the instrument, a position may be found in
 which both the images are seen, and they are then very little
 separated, not more so than they were by the same piece of
 spar before        its
                   bisection and cementation. On gradually                                  al

    In the course of his     experimental       investigation       of a general and
important law of electro-chemical action, which required the accurate
measurement of the gases evolved during the decomposition of water
and other substances, the author was led to the detection of a curious
effect, which had never been previously noticed, and of which the
knowledge, had he before possessed                          it,
                                                     would have prevented many
of   the errors and inconsistencies        occurring           the conclusions

first deduced from his earlier experiments. The phaenomenon observed
was the gradual recombination                       of
                                                the elements which had been
previously separated from each other                     voltaic action. This hap

the mixed     gases  resulting   from such      decomposition        were left      con                        in

under these circumstances they gradually diminished                     volume, water     in

inquiring into the cause                 of

Thenard.         In discussing the theory of these remarkable effects, the
author advances some new views of the conditions of elasticity at the
exterior of a mass of gaseous matter confined by solid surfaces. The
elasticity of gases he considers as being dependent on the mutual ac
tion of the particles, especially of those which are contiguous to each
other; but this reciprocity of condition is wanting on the sides of the
exterior particles which are next to the solid substance. Then, rea
soning on the principle established by Dalton, that the particles of
different gases are indifferent to one another, so that those of one gas
may come within almost any distance of those of another gas, what
ever may be the respective degrees of tension in each gas among the
                                                                                   gas,

composable by the electric current are called electrolytes, and when
electro-chemically decomposed, they are said to be electrolyzed ; the
substances themselves, which are evolved in such cases, being called
zetodes, and the terms zeteisode and zeterode being applied, accordingly
as the substance passes in one direction or the other. The propriety
and the advantage of employing these new terms, the author observes,
can be properly appreciated only by an experience of their uses and
applications in the exposition of the theory of decomposition given
in the fifth series of these inquiries, and of that of definite electro
chemical action advanced and supported in the present paper.
    The first section of this paper is occupied with the consideration of
some general conditions of electro-chemical decomposition. It has
been remarked, that elements which are strongly opposed to each
other in their chemical affinities are those most readily separated by
the voltaic pile; and the discovery of the law of conduction, explained
in the fourth series *, has led to a great augmentation of the number
of instances which are in conformity with this general observation:
but it is here shown, that the proportion in which the elements of a
body combine has great influence on the electro-chemical character
of the resulting substance; and that numerous instances occur where,
although one particular compound of two substances is decomposable,
another is not. It appears, that whenever binary compounds of simple
bodies are thus related to one another, it is the proto-compounds, or
those containing single proportions, which are decomposable, and that
                                              -
the per-compounds are not so.
    The second section contains an account of a new instrument devised
by the author, for exactly measuring electric currents, and which he
terms the volta-electrometer.          The current to be measured is made
to pass through water acidulated by sulphuric acid, and the gases
evolved by         its
                     decomposition are collected and measured, thereby
giving   at  once        an
                        expression       the quantity
                                                   of       electricity which has
                                                                           of

    In the third section of the paper, the primary or secondary charac
ter of the bodies evolved at the electrodes is discussed.                  It is shown
that    they  are   secondary    in a far    greater    number of cases than has
usually been imagined; and that laws have been deduced with regard
to the ultimate places of substances, from the appearance of the se
condary products; so that certain conclusions, true in themselves,
have hitherto been obtained by erroneous reasoning, since the facts
which were supposed to support them have in truth, no direct relation
with those conclusions. The methods of distinguishing primary and
secondary results from each other are explained, and the importance
of this distinction towards the establishment of the law of definite
electro-chemical action is insisted upon by the author.
    The fourth section is entitled, “On the definite Nature and Extent
of Electro chemical Decomposition,” and is considered by the author
as by    far the most important            this  of indeed     or          of

a current of electricity capable of decomposing and transferring the
elements of 9 grains of water, being the full equivalent of that num

electric machine is pointed out in a general way, and the enormous
superiority as to quantity, in the former mode of action, is insisted

made in the third series of these researches”, in which he expresses                                                                   his

    “The cusps were generally sharp, but were twice sensibly blunted,
owing to irregularities in the lunar disc, independent of which their
varying in direction was easily observable. There was no scattered
light. The macula occulted was the only spot on the solar disc; and
it disappeared in the largest valley on the edge of the moon, near the
profile of a conical lunar mountain.”

  extract, containing an account of the Zoological Proceedings of the
  Mauritius Natural History Society, was read: an abstract of it is
  given in the ‘ Proceedings' of the Society.
     The Secretary called the attention of the Society to several ani
  mals which had recently been added to the Menagerie.           They  in
  cluded an ursine Opossum, Dasyurus ursinus, Geoff, an animal
  known to the colonists of Van Diemen's Land by the appellation of
  the Native Devil; a Secretary Vulture, Gypogeranus serpentarius, Ill.,
  presented to the Society by Lieutenant-General Sir Lowry Cole;
  and two crowned Cranes, presented by the same distinguished officer,
  on his return from the government of the Cape of Good Hope.
     Referring more particularly to the latter, he brought under the
  notice of the Meeting specimens from the Society's Museum of
  crowned Cranes from Northern and from Southern Africa, with the
  view of illustrating the characters which distinguish as species the
 birds from these several localities.      Their specific distinction, he
  stated, on the authority of Professor Lichtenstein, had been pointed
  out, nearly thirty years since, by the Professor's father, who gave
  to the Cape bird the name of Grus Regulorum ; this distinction
 has, however, not been generally known among ornithologists,           al
 though to those connected with the Society it has for some time
 been familiar, from observation both of numerous skins and of living
 individuals.     In the bird of North Africa, for which the specific
 name of      pavoninus   will be retained, the wattle is small, and there
 is much red    occupying    the lower two thirds of the naked cheeks: in
 that of South Africa the wattle is large, and the cheeks are white,
 except in a small space at their upper part ; the neck also is of a
 much paler slate colour than that of the North African species.
 He added that the latter characters had been observed to be per
 manent in an individual presented to the Society, in April 1829, from
 the collection of the late Marchioness of Londonderry, and which
 is still living at the Gardens: they exist also in both the individuals
 presented by Sir Lowry Cole.
     The two species may be distinguished as Anthropoides pavoninus
 and Anthrop. Regulorum.
     Mr. Gray took occasion to remark that the oval form of the
nostrils in the crowned Cranes, added to other distinguishing cha
racters which have frequently been pointed out, might be regarded
as indicating a generic difference between them and the Demoiselle
and Stanley Cranes, in which the nostrils have the lengthened form
usual in the genus Grus, a genus from which they scarcely differ
except in the comparative shortness of their bill. For the group
including the crowned Cranes the name of Balearica might, he
thought, be retained; and that of Anthropoides be appropriated to
the one comprehending Anth. Virgo, Vieill., and Anth paradisaeus,
Bechst.
    A collection of crania and skins of Mammalia from Nepal, pre
sented to the Society by B. H. Hodgson, Esq., Corr. Memb. Z. S.,
was exhibited.       It contained skulls of the Buansu, Canis primaevus,
Hodgs., remarkable for the absence of a second tubercular molar

  tooth in the lower jaw, as described in a communication by the
  donor read at the Meeting on September 24th, (see page 62); of
  the Thibetan Mastiff, and of the Pariah Dog: of the Indian Jackal
  and of the Indian For, both of which are regarded by Mr. Hodgson
 as belonging to species hitherto undescribed, the molar teeth of the
 latter having in their acute tubercles much of an insectivorous cha
 racter: and of the Felis Nepalensis, Vig. & Horsf.
    Among the skins were those of a Sciuropterus, F. Cuv., as large
 as Sci. nitidus, Ej, and apparently new to science: of a Sciurus,
 Linn., also apparently new ; and of a Herpestes, Ill., which Mr.
 Hodgson at present regards as a small variety of the common                 In
 dian Ichneumon, Herpestes griseus, Desm.
    At the request of the Chairman, Mr. Gould exhibited a specimen
 of a Toucan, hitherto undescribed, and which he had recently ac
 quired. It is nearly related to Pteroglossus Aracari, Ill., and to Pter.
 regalis, Licht. ; and Mr. Gould pointed out the characters which
 distinguish it from those and other species. He proposed for it the
 name of Pteroglossus castanotis.
    Mr. Gould also exhibited a Woodpecker, inhabiting the Hima
 layan mountains and also the lower regions of India, which he re
 garded as new to science. He described it as Picus flavinucha.
    Captain Belcher laid on the table several specimens of a Barnacle,
 the Pentalasmis striata, Leach, remarkable for the great length of
 their peduncles, which exceeded two feet.
    Notes by Mr. Martin of a dissection of a Puma, Felis concolor,
Linn., which recently died at the Society's Gardens, were read,
from which the following are extracts.
    “Among animals of the feline genus so few points of anatomical
difference are found to exist, that the notes of the dissection of one
species (allowance being made for relative magnitude,) are closely
applicable to that of almost any other.     We can therefore only ex
pect to trace out minor differences in structure; and these not
among organs essentially connected with the habits and general
characteristics of the genus, but with habits peculiar and specific.
Hence perhaps we find in this group the greatest difference to ob
tain in the organs of voice; a circumstance which might naturally be
expected, as some according modification must necessarily produce
the deep-toned roar of the Lion, the snarl of the Jaguar, and the
hissing cry of the Puma.
    “The distance between the base of the tongue and the larynx
in the Lion, has been brought more than once under the notice of
the Society”; in the Jaguar, this distance, comparatively speaking, is
nearly as great; but in the Puma, an animal equal, or nearly so, in size
to the Jaguar, the distance is reduced to an inconsiderable space,
1 inch or 14, according as the tongue is more or less protruded.      In
addition to this, it is worthy of observation, that the circumference
of the laryna in the Puma is also very inconsiderable: compare, for
                                            xi.

the mantle lobes take their origin: they may be regarded as the
branchial veins conveying the aerated blood to the two hearts,
which are situated exterior to the liver, and just within the origin
of the internal calcareous loop: they are accompanied in their course
by much smaller vessels, probably the branchial arteries. Such is
apparently the system of respiration in Terebratula.
    The viscera occupy a very small space near the hinge. The ali
mentary canal commences by a small puckered mouth, situated im
mediately behind the folded extremities of the arms. It passes back
wards, and expands into a membranous stomach, surrounded by the
liver, a bulky gland of a green colour and minute follicular tex
ture, which communicates with it by many orifices. The intestine
passes down to the hinge, and then turns to the right side and ter
minates between the two mantle-lobes. No trace of a salivary gland
was found.
    The generation of Terebratula is that of the ordinary Bivalves.
In two of the larger specimens the ova had insinuated themselves
between the layers of the mantle, and partly surrounded the
branchial vessels.     When so far advanced they obscure the organi
zation of the mantle which adapts it for respiration : this organi
zation is consequently most satisfactorily observed in very young      -
individuals.
    Mr. Owen describes in detail the muscles, the arms, and the pe
culiar internal testaceous apparatus or loop connected with the
hinge and supporting the arms. In the species which he examined,
with the exception of Ter. psiltacea, he finds that the loop possesses
 some elasticity, and when acted on by the muscles becomes in                          its

 mass, and   to which the mantle-lobes firmly adhere. Here the veins

  terior half of the shell.          The mouth is            seated between the base       of
   the arms. The        aesophagus passes obliquely throughthe tendinous
   wall of the viscera in a direction towards the upper valve: it be
   comes slightly dilated, and is then surrounded by the liver. The in
   testine is continued straight to the opposite end of the visceral ca
  vity, is there again contracted, makes a sudden bend upon itself,
  and returns to the middle of the right side of the visceral belt, which
  it perforates obliquely, and terminates between the lobes of the
  mantle a little below the bend of the arm. The liver is of a beau
  tiful green colour, and consists of a congeries of elongated fol
  licles, closely compacted together, which communicate by numer
  ous orifices with the stomach. As in Terebratula, there is no sali
 vary gland.
      In Lingula Audebardii, Brod., there is also no salivary gland; and
 Mr. Owen is therefore disposed to believe that the gland described
 as such in Ling, anatina by Cuvier, was only a portion of the liver,
 from which the colour had probably been removed by long macera
 tion in spirit.
     In the want of salivary glands the Brachiopoda would agree with
 the ordinary Bivalves. Destitute, like them, of any hard parts about
 the mouth for comminuting alimentary substances, glands for
 pouring in a fluid to blend with the food during that operation are

 not wanted.
     The nervous system in Terebratula was not detected by Mr.
 Owen. In              two small ganglia were found on the side of the
aesophagus next the perforated valve; from which two filaments, ac
companying the aesophagus through the membranous wall, imme
diately diverge and pass exterior to the anterior shell muscles, pro
ceeding with corresponding arteries to near the hearts, beyond which
he could not trace them. A single small ganglion is situated on the
opposite side of the aesophagus, but on a plane posterior to the pre

arising from disease, which is shown by the sudden termination
of the  costae and by the partial decay of the other segments. The
distinctions derived from the fructification, given in the English
Flora, are altogether fallacious, being dependent          on age. It is clear,
therefore, Mr. Don concludes, that the Aspidium dumetorum must
be erased from the list of species.
    Aspidium rigidum. This species has recently been introduced
into the British Flora on the authority of a plant gathered on Ingle
borough by the Rev. W. T. Bree, and by him communicated to Dr.
Hooker, by whom it has been published in the Supplement to En
glish Botany, and in the second edition of his British Flora. Mr.
Don has not seen an authentic sample of the English plant; but the
figure in the first of the works just named, which is unfortunately
taken from a cultivated plant, does not well accord with foreign
specimens of rigidum, and a sample in Mr. Forster's herbarium,
stated to have been taken from a plant received from Mr. Bree,
proves to be nothing but a dwarf state of Nephrodium Filir Mas.
    Asplenium Filia foemina. Of the two very marked varieties of this
plant, that which has the segments of the more delicate texture, and
the entire frond of a pale green, varies much in size according to soil
and situation: in damp shady places it becomes the filia foemina of
English Botany, and in more open exposed situations the irriguum,
but neither of these states, Mr. Don observes, is entitled to be re
garded as a distinct form.
    Cystea dentata. This plant appears to be peculiar to the Scottish
Alps, on which it was discovered by Dickson and the late Mr. Don;
for the author, after an attentive comparison of specimens from va
rious stations, both in the Smithian Herbarium and in that of Mr.
Forster, is satisfied that the Welsh plant is not in reality different
from fragilis, from which dentata was first distinguished by Dickson.
The Scottish plant is distinguished by                       its
                                                  broader, rounded pinnae,
with short, blunt teeth, rather crenate than serrated, with the costae
more conspicuous and flexuose. The angustata, Mr. Don fears,
must also   be  reckoned       variety

   Professor Airy gave an account of experiments on the polariza
of light by the sky. It appeared that the light was polarized in a
plane passing through the sun, and that the plane of polarization
was not reversed in approaching the sun as had been formerly sug
gested by M. Arago. Professor Airy found that he could ob
serve the polarization within nine degrees of the sun in a horizontal
direction; but that above and below the sun the traces disappeared
at a distance considerably greater. It was found in the course of
these experiments that very rough surfaces, as a stone wall, a gravel
walk, a carpet, produced some polarization by reflection; and that
the plane of polarization in                      all
                                  cases passed through the point                                                   of
reflection and the source from which the light came. This commu
nication gave rise          to
                      observations from other members.

   It will be observed that these results   agree with that obtained
from the ammoniacal compound.        M. Dumas remarks that there
are two circumstances which characterize the oils that are heavier

   M. Dumas remarks that indigotic acid is merely indigo highly
oxidized, containing 5 times more oxygen than blue indigo.                                           Car
bazotic acid is the substance formerly known by the name of Amer
de Welter. All animal matters treated with nitric acid may furnish
carbazotic acid: it resists the action of the most powerful acids and
forms detonating salts.
   It is readily formed by treating indigotic acid with concentrated
nitric acid : the carbazotic acid employed by M. Dumas was pre
pared from indigo, and was first converted into carbazotate of
potash, which was carefully purified, then decomposed, and the
acid repeatedly crystallized.        The mean results of several experi

   The conversion of   indigotic into carbazotic acid may be explained
by the abstraction of the elements of oxalic acid and ammonia from
the former, and the addition of nitric acid: this will give the exact
composition of carbazotic acid. When carbazotic acid is boiled with
a concentrated alkaline solution, much ammonia is evolved, and a
salt of an intense red colour is obtained, much resembling that pro
duced by the croconic acid of Gmelin.—Journal de Chimie Médicale,

                  Gases.    By THoMAs S. THoMson, Esq.”
THE  object of Mr. Graham's paper is to establish, with
  numerical exactness, the following law of the diffusion of
 gases: “The diffusion or spontaneous intermixture of two gases
 in contact, is effected by an interchange in position of indefi
 nitely minute volumes of the gases, which volumes are not ne
 cessarily of equal magnitude, being, in the case of each gas,                                in
 versely proportional to the square root of the density of that

322        Mr. T. S. Thomson's Observations on Mr. Graham's
in consequence of the great diffusive velocity of hydrogen, the
external level is maintained by fresh additions of water, so as
to avoid the mechanical agency of an increasing atmospheric
pressure. At the conclusion of the experiment, when the
hydrogen has entirely escaped, and the level become station
ary, the quantity of replacing atmospheric air is carefully
measured, and compared with the known volume of hydro
gen originally introduced into the instrument. The fraction
original vol. of hydrogen
                                  the diffusion volume
                                          =                  hydrogen                  of
   replacing vol. of air
referred to that of air as unity. The mean of five experiments
gave 3-848 as the diffusion volume of hydrogen, in accordance
with the law announced.         For the specific gravity of hydro
gen being 0-0694, the square root of which is 0.2635, we have
the proportion 0.2635: 1::1: 3-7947, the diffusion volume of
hydrogen, a number approaching very closely to that indi
cated by experiment.        Carbonic acid gas, chlorine, sulphu
rous acid gas, protoxide of nitrogen, and other gases, operated

upon in the same manner, present similar results,               tending
to show that their    respective   diffusion volumes are         the                                 in

law which he has discovered is not provided for or explained
by any of the existing theories of corpuscular philosophy.
   The object of the following remarks is to show that Mr.
Graham's facts, so far from being inconsistent with every pro
posed theory of the mechanical relations of mixed gases, af
ford an elegant and striking confirmation of the truth of Mr.

The most obvious and remarkable feature of Mr. Graham's
law      is,
         that the mutual diffusive velocities        gases are exactly          of
proportional         those which theory assigns for their relative
                          to                                                                    \

the experiment the same equality of moving force exists, and
that consequently the final volumes exchanged ought to be,

mentioned, of hydrogen escaping from the diffusion instru

                    Mr. Lubbock      on Cask-Gaging.           327
 subject in question. I shall limit myself, in the following brief
 remarks, to the gaging of casks lying, not entering upon the
 question of the gaging of ships, or stills, or any other irre
 gular figures, merely premising that this can only be done by
 quadratures, or, as it is termed in works on gaging, by the
 method of equidistant coordinates. A very material differ
 ence, however, exists between these problems and the one
 which I propose here to notice, and which consists in this
 circumstance, that in the one case extreme dispatch is a ne
 cessary requisite in the method employed; in the other, that
is to say, in ascertaining the tonnage of ships, or the content
 of any fixed reservoirs, such as distillers' vats, &c., time not is
 so great an object; so that the peculiar difficulty of cask
gaging arises from the necessity of combining accuracy with
 celerity in the operation.
    It has long been customary to divide casks into four varieties,
 which are thus defined:
    1. The middle frustum of a spheroid.
    2. The middle frustum of a parabolic spindle.
    3. The frustums of two equal parabolic conoids.
    4. The frustums of two equal cones.
                                  :

                                 2.
    I find these distinctions in a work, entitled “Cosmographia,”
 by Dr. John Newton, published in 1679, and they appear to
 have continued ever since.                          -  - -  -
    I place the origin of rectangular coordinates at the centre
                    I
 of the cask, and suppose the cask to be a figure of revolu
 tion about the horizontal axis Oa, as in the diagram annexed.
 According to the preceding definitions, in the first variety
 the arc ABC is considered to be a portion of an ellipse of

328                   Mr. Lubbock                on Cask-Gaging.
 which BO is the semiaxis minor, the axis    major coinciding in
 direction with Oa.                     -
    In the second variety the arc ABC is considered to be a
 portion of a parabola whose vertex is B, and whose axis co
 incides in direction with BO.
    In the third variety the arc BC is considered to be a                      por
tion of a parabola whose vertex is in the line Ow beyond D.
    In the fourth variety BC is a straight line.
    In works on gaging, the second and third varieties are sup
posed to be intermediate between the first and fourth, as in the
figure, which is copied from Symons's Practical Gager, p. 187;
but this is incorrect, for the second variety, as thus defined,
coincides very nearly with the first, and the third with the
fourth.
    Let BF (the internal bung diameter) be called b.
        CE (the internal head diameter) be called h.
        HD (the internal length) be called l.

   In the first variety the equation to the curves ABC, GFE,
in the plane wa, is

  In   the second variety the equation to the curve                     ABC   is
                                                 b—h

  In   the third variety the equation to the curves                     BC, FE,    is
                                      ,

  In the fourth variety the equation to the curve BC is
                                                         -

  In the first variety the content of the cask is easily found
by means of the triple integral <U+017F>/<U+017F>da, dy, dz taken between

   These are the rigorous expressions for the content of the

are given in Symons's Practical            p. 193.

       l

Imperial gallon contains 277.273 cubic inches of water at 62°;
and if we consider a gallon of any other fluid to have the
same volume at the same temperature, and not as a measure of
                                                                                 º
weight, when the dimensions of the cask, as is usual, are ex

vided by 277-273, in order to have the content in Imperial
gallons.
   The readiest mode of obtaining accurately the content of the
cask, considered either of the first or of the third variety, appears
to me to be by employing the Tables" given by Symons, p. 210
                                                                                        2

sidering the cask, with the same length, bung and head diame
ter, is thus in this instance 6:46 gallons, or about 5.5 per cent.
   The term ullage appears to be used indifferently to denote
either the liquor contained in a cask, or the vacuity above the
liquor.    It has been seen that accurate, that is to say, rigorous
and extremely simple expressions can be obtained for the en
tire content of a cask of either variety; but it seems to me                                                     im
possible to find expressions sufficiently simple to be used in
practice for the ullage of a cask lying upon         bulge, except                its                            in

     The rule which is given by Symons, p. 217, for finding the
 ullage of a cask lying, by the pen, is erroneous, and                               I   appre
 hend of no utility.
     In
      practice, the sliding-rule (or head-rod) is invariably used
in gaging casks, and the content of the cask, considered ge
nerally of the first variety, is sought by adding to the head
diameter a certain quantity, depending only on the difference
of the bung and head diameter, and considering the sum so
obtained as a mean diameter, and the content of the cask to be
the same as that of a cylinder of the same altitude or length,
with that quantity as the diameter of the base.

    This, however, is only to be considered as a rough approxi
mation, and the quantity q cannot be made strictly to depend
only upon b–h.               If
                         we take a cask of which the dimensions
are l = 46.9, b = 31-2, h = 26-1 (which are those of an
average brandy piece,) the content of which is accurately
 116:37 gallons, we find q = 3 (5-1) = 3-4, h--q = 29.5, and
the content is found by the approximate method above equal
to 115-61 gallons. It is obvious that the error will be nearly
constant for the same kind of cask, and hence either a correc
tion may be obtained experimentally or by calculation to be
added in all cases for each kind of cask, or this correction
may be included in that due to the variety. The direction
given by Symons             is,
                       “Look for the difference      the bung and         of

to ascertain: the line has most likely been laid down for a par
ticular value of h.
   The value of q, for the third variety, is found in the same
way to be approximately # (b-h), and the error of the con
tent would be = —     #<U+017F>º-hy.
  The sliding-rule or head-rod used in gaging affords the
means of multiplying the square of the mean diameter by
                                Trl
                         4   x 255-273               -
For gaging by the pen, it would be convenient to have a table
of the logarithms of the numbers in Mr. Symons's Table, en
titled “ Areas of the Head Diameters,” instead of the num
bers themselves. With these, and a table of the logarithms of
numbers from 1 to 1000, to four decimal places (both of which
might be contained on a single quarto page,) the content of
casks might probably be calculated as readily as by means of
the sliding-rule.     It must be recollected that the principle
upon which the line on the head-rod gives the quantity q to
be added to the head-diameter is only a rough approxima
tion, which may be out nearly half a gallon, and which stands
in need of a subsequent correction.
    The method of determining the ullage of a cask by the line
on the head-rod marked S Ly (Symons, p. 214,) is not strictly
accurate in principle; but how far the error which is so intro
duced is sensible in practice, depends upon how far it is de
sirable that the approximation should be carried, and how far
the principle itself is modified afterwards by any subsequent
correction. The ullage cannot be considered strictly as depend
ent on (or as a function of) the dry inches and the content of the
cask as it is by the nethod alluded to.
   In practice an error in determining the content of a cask
may arise either from the errors above noticed, which are in
troduced by calculating the content approximately by the
sliding-rule, having given the dimensions and the variety, or
from an error in ascertaining the dimensions, or from an er
roneous judgement in deciding upon the variety to which the
cask is to be referred.
   An error of a tenth of an inch in all the linear dimensions
of a cask will make a difference in a cask holding 116 gallons,
of about a gallon, which      is,perhaps, the maximum         of
                                                               this
error.  It   must be recollected also, that the instruments used
in  ascertaining the external dimensions are             of
                                                        nature

stand in   needof  occasional adjustment, and that the difficulty
of  ascertaining the internal dimensions       considerable, from

showing 6'46 gallons as the difference between the content
obtained, according to one or the other hypothesis.          This
error   may   be   greatly diminished by ascertaining  eaperimen
tally the correction required for any particular cask, when
one or the other hypothesis has been used, which proceeding
is facilitated by the circumstance that casks coming from the
same country generally maintain a separate and peculiar cha
racter, so that a particular correction might be easily de
duced for a sherry, butt, a port pipe, &c., without any re
ference to mathematical considerations. This would amount
to the same as to deduct a certain quantity from the length of
the cask, calculating the content as though it were accurately
 of the first variety.   So if the brandy piece be, in fact, of the
 variety which I call the fourth, namely, that of which the con
 tent is given by the expression

of June    ten or eleven Canada Geese were observed in the
River   Caldew,   near the village of Dalston, one of which was
procured, and is now in the collection of agentleman residing
within a short distance of the above-named village.
   211. Northern Diver (Colymbus glacialis).-A remarkably
fine old female Northern Diver was taken alive, by a boy, on
the sands near the village of Bowness. The intestines of this
bird were fully seventy-two inches in length, and the irides
were of a very fine crimson red.
   221. Common Skua (Cataractes vulgaris).-A fine old fe
male Skua Gull was brought to us alive on the 27th of April,
which had been captured on the preceding day, on the coast,
in the following very extraordinary manner. A fisherman, who
had been examining his nets on the above-mentioned day, ob
served, at some distance, two large birds struggling together,
and upon arriving at the scene of combat he found this bird
upon the point of killing a Herring Gull (Larus argentatus),
and so determined was the Skua to dispatch               prey, that the     its
fisherman secured       without the least
                          it                difficulty.   The stomach
was  quite  empty, and  the eggs     the ovary    in
                                                 were  still  very small.
We cannot find that      the Skua   has  been  captured         this vici         in
nity before.                                                                                   -
   231. The Lesser Brown-headed Gull (Larus capistratus).—
An immature female this rare Gull was accidentally procured
                                 of
near Sandsfield,         on
                       the 6th     June.     ofwas found associating

                                all
at, and fortunately killed.      From       inspection       anthis bird,         of
 we are satisfied that this species  may     very   easily   overlooked,

follow loud claps of thunder, and which happen, generally,
at the end of storms, the igneous matter being then expended.
Sometimes the particles of fire being combined with the air
only, it melts like nitre; and this it           doubtless, which pro

 Barbadoes at noon of this memorable day was involved in
midnight darkness, and the whole surface of the island was
covered with the dust or cinders: of this substance                  have a              I
specimen which fell upon the deck and sails of a vessel, 150
miles to windward of the volcano. In this case it is probable
 that a continued succession of ignited materials being pro
jected from the mountain and rarefying the air, an upward
 draught was established, which carried the volcanic dust into
 the higher regions of the atmosphere, whence it was wafted
by upper currents and fell over a vast space around. With
 these phaenomena history affords no parallel instance; al
 though it is mentioned by Pliny, that the explosions of AEtna
 had been heard, and               its

348      On the future Extension        of the English Coal-fields.
here thrown out, or whether we may expect to be able to
pursue it further westwards beneath this limestone *.
    I conceive it most probable that the Warwickshire coal
field is separated from that of Ashby Wolds on the north by
a prolongation of the same anticlinal undulation which throws
up the transition chain of Atherstone and Nuneaton already
mentioned, although this prolongation is concealed by over
lying horizontal strata of red marl.
    The Ashby coal-field, which skirts the Charnwood chain on
the north-west, appears to be subdivided into the two small
basins of Ashby Wolds and Cole Orton by an anticlinal
ranging in a direction parallel to that already assigned to the
 Charnwood anticlinal, viz. north-west and south-east, and
passing through the town of Ashby: altogether the substrata
of this whole district appear affected by so many undulations
as to afford scarcely any indications of the probable lines in
which we may look for their prolongations, beyond their
known boundaries, beneath the horizontal investiture of red
marl.
    Crossing the Trent to the north, and approaching towards
the great emergence of the subjacent carboniferous lime of
Derbyshire, we find two localities in which coal is worked to
the south and south-east of Ashborne, viz. Darley Moor, and
 Sprinxhall in Edlaston parish. Patches of carboniferous lime
stone emerge from the red marl in the vicinity of both these
pits; but we have as yet no information how far the circum
stances indicate any connexion of the coal-measures between
them, or with the nearest coal-field on the west, that of
 Cheadle, which must be within five miles of Darley Moor.
According to Farey, however, the undulation of the strata
constitutes the Cheadle field into a detached basin; but the
whole of this district requires reexamination.
    Of the central coal-fields, that of Dudley remains for ex
amination; but the probable extension of this being connected
with the western coal-fields of Shropshire, it will be more
properly considered in a future communication, which I hope
to prepare for the ensuing month.

   * I was originally inclined to believe, from the general dip of the War
wickshire coal-field to the west, and that of the south-eastern portion of the
Dudley coal-field to the east, that these two fields extended continuously be
neath the intervening red marl ; but Mr. Yates’s observations of the eastern
dip of the Annesley lias, and a westerly dip along the eastern extremity of
the Dudley field, where also, near Walsall, the transition lime emerges,
render it more probable that they are separated by an anticlinal line.

Functions of tubular and cellular Polypi, and of Ascidiae.” By Joseph
Jackson Lister, Esq., F.R.S.—was commenced.

concluded.
. . This paper contains the account of a great number of observations
made by the author during the last summer, while he was at the
southern coast of England, on several species of Sertulariae, Plumu
 lariae, Tubularia, Campanularia, Flustra, and other polypiferous zoo
phytes, and also on various Ascidia.            Each specimen was placed for
examination in a glass trough with parallel sides, before the large
achromatic microscope of the author, directed horizontally; and care
was taken to change the sea-water frequently, which was done by
means of two syphons, the one supplying fresh water, while the other
carried           off
               the old;     plan which succeeded

It appears from a passage which the author has quoted from Cavolini,
that he had noticed the circumstance of currents existing in the inte
rior of Sertulariae, but had not detected their continuation into the
stomachs of the expanded polypi. Similar phaenomena, which the au
thor describes in detail, were observed in several Campanulariae and
Plumulariae; and several particulars are noticed with regard to the
ovaries, and to the movements of the fluids contained in the ova of
these zoophytes, before their exclusion from the body of the parent.
In some cases, the young polype, after it has attained a certain
growth, but while still adhering to the parent, becomes decomposed,

observations on another star, of about the fifth magnitude, which has
nearly the same zenith distance towards the south that y Draconis
has towards the north, and which passes the meridian between 20

visions can be defined. In addition to this, the several formations
thin out so rapidly in their course to the south-west, that beyond
Llandeilo, the Ludlow and Wenlock formations appear in the same
escarpment, and in like manner on the left bank of the Towey, be
tween Llandeilo and Llangadock, it is difficult to separate the shelly
sandstones of the third formation from the black flags of Llandeilo,
with which they are associated; the great fossiliferous system which
in Shropshire, Hereford, Radnor, &c. is expanded over so wide an
area, being there compressed into a narrow zone between the old
red sandstone on the one side and the rocks of roofing-slate on the
other.

have been the scene of great dislocation, and it is shown, that
through such rents in the strata, the principal rivers escape from
the mountains of Wales into the lower counties of England, viz., the
Severn, the Onny, the Teme, the Lug, the Wye, &c.
   On the eastern side of the trough of old red sandstone of Here
fordshire, the mean direction of the strata, as determined by the
outline of the trap and sienitic ridges of Abberley and Malvern,
is from north to south. But there are many aberrations from
that direction, and innumerable local disturbances, curvatures and
faults. Thus, for example, the superior grauwacké formations strike
south-south-east from Knightwick bridge upon the Teme for a                                                        di
stance of six miles, until they are met by the sienitic ridge of the
Malvern running due north and south. The result of this contact
is, that the sedimentary deposits are cut out, deflected from their
course, and their direction accommodated             the western sides and  to
promontories          of
                    the intrusive rock.        the neighbourhood In   East                                    of

 affected both the transition rocks and the coal-measures.
     This part of the memoir was concluded by the notice of a very
 remarkable case of dislocation, amounting to an entire reversal of
 the two younger formations of the grauwacké series along a distance
 of several miles upon the flanks of the Abberley Hills. In this tract
 the Lower Ludlow overlies the Upper Ludlow rock, at angles
 varying from 70° to 45°; and the adjacent parallel ridge of the
 Wenlock limestone is conformably tilted over, giving the appear
 ance of the Ludlow rocks passing beneath the older formation. This
 phaenomenon      is supposed to have been brought about by the out
 burst of the   contiguous   trappean hills of Abberley and Woodbury,
 the  elevating forces   accompanying   which, it is conceived, have bent
 them back    upon   their axes, and produced  their present inverted po
 sition. This mode of explanation, it is stated, is rendered conclusive
 on tracing the same sedimentary groups to those points where, from
 their south-south-easterly direction they impinge upon the sienite
 of the Malvern chain, and where the same phaenomenon of reversal,
 on a small scale, is again apparent. Here the strata near the sienite
 are bent backwards; but those which are removed from it not having
 been disturbed in so great a degree, incline towards the west, the
 Wenlock and Dudley limestone dipping beneath the exterior and
 upper zone of Ludlow rocks.

    Feb. 5.—A paper was first read “On some of the Faults which
affect the Coal-field of Coalbrookdale,” by Joseph Prestwich, jun.,
Esq., F.G.S.
    In this communication the author confines his observations        al
most entirely to the direction of the principal faults, and to the
changes which they have produced in the relative position of the
beds of coal; and he refers to the memoirs of Mr. Murchison for an
account of the formations on which the coal-measures repose.
    The author concludes his memoir with some observations on the
fossils he procured principally from the ironstone of these coal
measures. Of 18 genera of shells which he enumerates, 12 are ma

rine. The lower layers of the ironstone nodules contain, in general,
the greatest number of shells, and the upper the greatest number of
plants; but the bed called the “Chance-penny ironstone,” the
highest wrought, contains the greatest abundance of a species of
Productus.      The most remarkable fossils obtained by the author,
are the remains of Trilobites hitherto undescribed.            He procured
them from a bed of ironstone in the centre of the coal-measures.
He notices also a Coleopterous insect, and another apparently be
longing to the genus Aranea, in the possession of Mr. Antice of
Madeley, and which were obtained from ironstone nodules.
     A paper was then read, entitled, “Notes on the Forest of Wyre
 Coal-field,” by the Rev. Thomas England, F.G.S.
     The district, described in this memoir, is bounded on the east by
the Severn, on the north by the coal-field of Coalbrookdale, on the
west by the Rea and the Hopton to their junction with the Teme,
and on the south by the latter river and the Abberley Hills.
     A paper was lastly read “On a Freshwater Formation contain
 ing Lignite in Cerdagne in the Pyrenees,” by Charles Lyell, Esq.,
 Foreign Sec. G.S.
     The upper part of the basin of the river Segre in Cerdagne pre
 sents an example, rare in the Pyrenees, of a great longitudinal valley
 running east and west, or nearly parallel to the axis of the chain.
 This basin is formed by a depression in the central region of granitic
  rocks, which, in the eastern division of the Pyrenees, is of consider
 able breadth.     The lacustrine strata occupy the lower parts of the
 depression, reposing horizontally on the granite, hornblende schist
  and argillaceous schist. The breadth of the freshwater formation
 is about five miles, and               its
                               elevation above the sea probably between
  three and four thousand feet. Its eastern limits are seen         the east              to

 it appears that the country        has undergone great geographical
 changes since this part of Cerdagne was a lake.
    The position of the tertiary basin of Cerdagne was illustrated by
 two transverse sections across the Pyrenees. The memoir concluded
 with some remarks on the signs of obliterated lakes which abound
 in the valleys of the Pyrenees at a great variety of levels.
    The first of the sections alluded to, extended from Pamiers south
of Toulouse through the highest part of the Pyrenees to Puycerda in
Spain. Beds of a conglomerate (a), are seen on the river Arriege near
Verhilles, inclined to the south; and next in a succession are limestone
strata much contorted, containing nummulites and other fossils (b);
then a formation of grit, sandstone and coal, (c). In passing from Ver
hilles to Foix, the groups b and c appear to be more than once re
peated in consequence of the derangement of the strata.        In the re
maining part of the section between Ussat and Puycerda, the rocks
consist chiefly of granitic and argillaceous schists, covered here and
there by limestone in which no fossils were observed.
   The second section extended from La Estéla in the low country of
Catalonia to Céret in France. Immediately north of La Estéla, which
stands upon horizontal tertiary strata, the geologist, on ascending the
Pyrenees, finds strata of conglomerate having a southerly dip and
probably identical with the group a of the first section. This conglo
merate resembles the pudding stone which caps the lofty hill of Mont
serrat in Catalonia. Next to this comes a nummulitic limestone (b),
which is seen at Tarrades, and is also inclined to the south ; then a
series of shales and sandstones (c); and next to this, proceeding to
wards the north, a formation of red sandstone and red marl (d). This
last is well exhibited in the valley of the river Muga not far from
San Lorenzo.       It recurs on the north of that valley with a southerly
dip, and rests on strata of mica schist and gneiss, which dip to the
north.    A little to the north of this point the secondary and primary
rocks come in contact with opposite dips; the Pyrenees here consist
of gneiss, mica schist and clay slate, which continue to near Céret,
where tertiary formations are seen at the base of the Pyrenees.
   The above section passes through Masanet, to which place Maclure
supposed that the volcanic rocks of the Olot district extended. The
author searched in vain for any of these modern igneous rocks near
that place, and convinced himself that the extent of the modern vol.
canic region of Catalonia has been greatly exaggerated, and that it
does not stretch in a direction from Olot towards Masanet much
farther than Castel Follit, or some point between the last-mentioned
town and Besalu.

of Dukhun, Canis Dukhunensis, Sykes, for the purpose of comparing
it with a skin of the wild Dog of Nepal, Canis primaevus, Hodgs.,
recently presented to the Society by B. H. Hodgson, Esq., Corr.
Memb.Z.S. (See p. 62.) He showed that the two Dogs are perfectly
similar in their general form, and in the form of the cranium; and that
in his specimen, equally with that of Mr. Hodgson, the hinder tuber
cular tooth of the lower jaw is wanting. The only differences re
markable between the two specimens are in the quality and colour
of the fur, that of the Dukhun Dog being paler and less dense than
that of the individual from Nepal.              These differences, depending
probably on climate and individual peculiarity, cannot be regarded
as sufficient to indicate a distinction between the two races.             Iden
tical as   they  are in form and       habits,  Col. Sykes   considers them as
belonging to one species. A short notice of the Dukhun Dog, com
municated by him to the Committee of Science and Correspondence,

   Captain Smee remarked that the existence in Guzerat of a mane
less  Lion had been known thirty years since by Colonel Sykes, and
that Olivier had seen at Bagdad a similar animal, which was under
stood to have been brought thither from Arabia; but that hitherto,
he believed, no skin of such a race had fallen under the observation
of naturalists in Europe. Besides the absence of the extensive mane,
it has to distinguish it from the ordinary Lion, a somewhat shorter
tail, furnished at             as
                        tip with   much larger brush.  a

from the examination of an individual which recently died at the

 Secretary by the Rev. R. T. Lowe, Corr. Memb. Z.S., and dated
Madeira, November 15, 1833. They related to a collection of
Fishes made in that island by the writer, and accompanied about
thirty species presented by him to the Society, in addition to those
formerly transmitted by him, and exhibited at the Meeting of the
Committee of Science and Correspondence on August 14, 1832.
Those now sent were severally exhibited. They include the follow

than these two he has no evidence; but if any exist, he hopes soon to
procure a sight of them. Neither has he ever seen any appearance
about the planet which gives ground for the least suspicion of a ring.
    II. Continuation of Researches into the Mass of Jupiter, by Ob
 servations of the Elongations of the Fourth Satellite.    By Professor -
Airy   #.
  #. results of this paper are founded on six sets  of measures, made
in the   same manner as the last, and with the same instrument, before
the opposition of Jupiter. The unfavourable state of the weather
after the opposition prevented any more being made. By observation
of 3 Ursa Minoris in different positions of the instrument, the errors
of the line of collimation, and the declination and polar axes, were
found to be very small, as was also the rate of the clock. In every
instance, twelve transits over three wires were obtained, both of the
planet and satellite.
   The mode of calculation in this paper differs from that in the pre
ceding, in a correction applied to the observed difference of right as
cension for refraction; in the addition of 05:0073 to the mean longi
tude of the satellite in finding the Jovicentric right ascension, for

the orbit of the fourth satellite, the difference will become more con
spicuous in observations when Jupiter is near the solstitial colure, and
the true mass of Jupiter will be greater than that obtained even by the
present determination. I believe, however, that the difference is due
entirely to the small errors which cannot be eliminated, even from
the mean of many observations.”

                         CHLOROCARBONIC ACID.
              DUMAS  finds that this acid is best formed in a diffused
       • rather than a vivid light: when mixed with anhydrous
 alcohol it yields an aether, in which an atom of chlorine is replaced
 by an atom of oxygen.
    The aether put in contact with ammonia, yields a compound which
 crystallizes very readily, and offers a case of isomerism with lactate
 of ammonia, and also presents the composition of ammonia com
 bined with sugar.
    Oxalic aether gave with ammonia a compound which may be re
 presented by alcohol and oxamide, and from which this last sub
 stance may be extracted.—Journal de Chimie Médicale, Feb. 1834.

during the decomposition of oxalic acid by M. Gay-Lussac.         M.
Pelouze states, that with proper precautions, and especially by keep

the law above stated will hold good.

              ON HYPERIODIC ACID AND HYPERIODATES.
   MM. Ammermüller and Magnus remark, that considering the
strong resemblance which exists between chlorine and iodine, it
appears singular that analogous compounds of these with oxygen
have not yet been discovered, especially as the affinity of iodine for
oxygen appears to be stronger than that of chlorine. The method
of Serullas for procuring hyperchloric acid does not succeed for
procuring hyperiodic acid, for on heating iodate of potash, hyper
iodate cannot be procured.           M. Liebig's method of procuring                                       io

It   was then dissolved, with heat,            dilute nitric acid, and then, by

orange colour were procured.
    By these processes these three different combinations of hyper

by heating in a glass retort to obtain the oxygen, and the silver
was obtained by solution in nitric acid, and precipitated by the
muriatic.

    This salt is therefore neutral and          anhydrous.   It is decomposed
 by water into a subsalt and hyperiodic acid: this occurs at com
 mon temperatures. The form of the crystals is destroyed, a straw
 coloured subsalt is deposited, and the liquor, separated by the filter,
 acts as an acid, and does not contain any silver, but merely hyper
 iodic acid dissolved in water. This is the best method of obtaining
 this acid in a pure state. When the orange salt is treated with
 hot water, the same effects are produced, except that the remaining
 subsalt is not the yellow, but the red one.
     Hyperiodic acid, thus obtained, maybe heated to ebullition without
 decomposition: by evaporation, crystals are obtained which do not
 deliquesce.    At a high temperature they lose part of their oxygen
 and are converted into iodic acid; at a still greater heat they are de
 composed into oxygen and iodine. Muriatic acid converts them into
  iodic acid, chlorine being evolved.

           ON KREOSOTE.                          BY M, REICHENBACH DE BLANSKO.
        M. Reichenbach of Blansko, to whose labours we  owe the disco
very of Paraffine, of Eupione”, and Picamore, has recently found in the
products of the destructive distillation of wood a new substance,
which he terms Kreosote, from the Greek words xpaz; flesh, genitive
by contraction xpedig, and adºw I save.
  This substance is highly interesting, not only on account of                                                               its   che
mical properties, but from                             its

and alkalies. Concentrated, it dissolves the deutoxide of copper, and
assumes a chocolate brown colour.           At a boiling heat it reduces the
deutoxide of mercury, and is then transformed into a resin, which has
no longer the properties of kreosote. Nitric acid acts on it strongly,
and acid vapours are disengaged.       It combines with chlorine, bromine,
iodine, phosphorus, and sulphur.          Potassium thrown into it disap
pears, gas is disengaged, and potash remains combined with thickened
kreosote. From this combination the kreosote separates by distilla
tion.    Concentrated sulphuric acid added in small quantities gives to

                         The late             Mr. T. Tredgold.                                  395
  An ordinary education at his native village, Brandon, near Dur
ham, and an apprenticeship of six years in that city, occupied his time
until his twentieth year. Subsequently he was employed five years
as a working carpenter in Scotland, and ten years in an architect's
office in London.  During both periods the regular hours of labour
or of business were sufficiently fatiguing ; and the leisure and pecu
niary means which they afforded him would appear very limited for
other studies than those which the nature of his employment did not
render imperative. Yet, under these disadvantages, he acquired an
extensive knowledge of Geometry, Chemistry, Geology, &c., and be
came a very excellent mathematician.            But his great merit is in the
skill with which he has     applied  his scientific attainments to the prac
tical advancement of his      profession,  for to him we are indebted for the
best Treatises upon Carpentry, and the Strength of Cast Iron ; the
extensive use of which latter material forms so decided a characteristic
of the safety and durability of our various structures. He also supplied
the article JoineRy for the Supplement to the Encyclopædia Britannica,
and several valuable contributions to the Philosophical Magazine and
 Thomson's Annals of Philosophy. During the five following years, while
he was practising as an engineer, he investigated and exemplified “the
Principles of Stone-Masonry;” “ of the Construction of Rail-Roads
and Steam-Carriages ;” “ of Warming and Ventilating Buildings;”
added Notes to the Hydraulic Tracts of Venturi, Smeaton, and Dr.
Young; and in 1827 completed the last of his works,—an “Essay
 on the Steam-Engine.”

 proofs of  his extraordinary   talents, and           of
                                                 the benefits      has conferred he

it is believed that the particulars of those investigations remain nearly
unknown, even to many of the cultivators of science who are most
given to such subjects in this country. The investigations themselves
are somewhat abstruse, and are unfortunately scattered through va

which divests the undulatory hypothesis of the only great and hitherto
insurmountable objection, viz.          deficiency           its

            Mr. Marshall      on the Meteorology   of Kendal.      399
months out      of the  12,) more rain was measured in each    of these
months at Birklands than at Kendal. In         comparing   the quantity
taken at each place, it appears that when large quantities of rain
fall, the difference is greater than when small ones are measured.
In several instances, especially when the quantity is small, E. W.
Wakefield takes more than I do in Kendal; but in comparing one
month after another, it appears that the daily quantity is less at
Birklands than at Kendal. The apparent discrepancy between the
two accounts which sometimes occurs in the daily quantity of rain
taken, under the same circumstances, arises, I am inclined to think,
from our measuring the quantity at different hours, probably when
heavy rain is falling, by which means, he may appear to take a
larger than I have done on any particular day, from including one
or even two hours more rain. In the six months in which the rain
taken at Birklands exceeds that at Kendal, the weather was less
windy; but I am not sure that this circumstance will satisfactorily
account for the increased quantity. In the wettest month, December,
the quantity measured at Birklands was 12:390 inches, or nearly
two inches less than at Kendal, and in November 6:308, or above
one inch less. These were by far the most windy and boisterous
months in the year, as the dreadful loss of shipping on our coasts
lamentably proves.
   As I am aware that considerable interest exists in different parts
of the kingdom among scientific men respecting the meteorology
of Kendal, I annex an account of the quantity of rain, which I have
                         —

I may   remark, that January was an unusually dry month, five days
of which only were wet ones. February was a very wet one. The
next three months were particularly dry, and the weather genial.
 The greater part of June was wet, but July, August, September,
and the early part of October, were dry, and we had no frost
from the 30th of March to the 9th of October.        The remaining part
of October,    and nearly  the whole of November and December, were
extremely wet. We have not had many appearances of the aurora

       Dear Sir,
I SHALL          endeavour to supply the information which you
    consider still required to render my paper on the phos
phates intelligible, in a brief summary of               its
                                                   principal theore
tical results.    For the evidence upon which the conclusions
rest,I  must refer entirely      the paper itself, which

fore the  public.
   Two phosphoric acids had been previously recognised, which
possess very different properties, judging from the characters
of the salts which they form with the same bases.         These two
acids were said       to be isomeric bodies,         be or   to
                                                           the same     of
composition and atomic weight, and were distinguished                             as
the phosphoric        common phosphoric acid, and the pyrophos
                     or
phoric acid. The observation was made                        by

a third  phosphoric     acid,  which  may     produced

defects unamended.     It is not worth while to alter the names
tillwe can construct them so as to indicate the constitution of
the salt in reference to water as well as to soda.     Now here
we find our present system of nomenclature at fault. Such
combinations as we have to name were never contemplated,
and are not provided for.         The function of water in the
constitution of the salts has been hitherto almost entirely
overlooked.                  I

 North Wales, those of Central England at Dudley, in the N.E.
of Warwickshire       and at Ashby, those on both sides of the
         Penine chain on the east in Derbyshire, Yorkshire, Dur
#. am, and   Northumberland, and on the west in Lancashire,
and again mantling round the Cumbrian group to White
haven, we shall find the subjacent old red sandstone and car
boniferous limestone, and all the coal-measures, more or less
elevated, generally very considerably so, and the stratification
of this whole series generally conformable; whereas the lower
strata of the new red sandstone and the intervening dolomitic
limestone will be found comparatively almost horizontal, and
little disturbed, and altogether unconformable to the carboni
ferous series; so that it should appear that the principal aera
in which the disturbing forces which have produced these
phaenomena acted, was at the very close of the carboniferous
period, and (anterior to that of the dolomitic formation, al
though it may, indeed, be said that this may with equal pro
priety be assigned as the concluding aera of a succession
of elevations acting with a general uniformity of direction
during the whole period of the deposition of the carboni
ferous rocks rather than one single violent elevation; and
certainly the phaenomena of the exact conformity of the whole
coal series has scarcely hitherto been so minutely examined
as to authorize our pronouncing very positively which of these
hypotheses seems best to explain them, although, from the
general conformity which      I have noticed,  I should certainly
incline to adopt that of a single period of elevation. The
continental coal-basins of the Meuse, and many of those of
Northern Germany, appear to have been elevated at exactly
the same period. The lines of these elevations are, however,
assuredly not parallel, for those in the south portion of our
island generally range east and west, and those in the north
range north and south, forming tangents to the curve which,
as   I have already noticed, expresses the general line of the
 elevation of our strata of whatever age. But to proceed regu
larly with the detail.
    The carboniferous limestone first shows itself on the southern
 coast along the skirts of Torbay, Devonshire: it is here greatly
 elevated and contorted, and we may refer to the intrusive
 masses of greenstone as the probable cause of the disturbance.
 The lowest beds of the Exeter conglomerate, usually classed
 with the new red sandstone, also partake in this disturbance,
 which might seem to refer it to a more recent period than
 that of which we are now treating; but yet it does not appear
 altogether improbable that these may be the very lowest de
 posits of this great series, and possess a comparative antiquity

greater than that of the Pontefract sandstone and dolomitic
limestone, which are usually undisturbed; a supposition which
would enable us to refer these disturbances to the aera we are
now considering. It seems probable, but by no means certain,
that the elevation of the transition chains in North Devon and
on the adjoining borders of Somerset, such as the Brendon
and Quantock Hills, may be of this aera. The carboniferous
limestone of Cannington park, on the north of the Quantocks,
appears to conform to the elevation of that chain, which may
                                                                             -

 Haven, still proceeding westwards. Between the haven and
the Irish Channel intrusive masses of trap rocks penetrate the

perhaps, be considered as indicating the probable volcanic
origin of these disturbances. The whole of these phaenomena

410 The Rev.            W. D.       Conybeare on   M.   de Beaumont's Theory
to the age of the rothe todte, and yet anterior to that of the
magnesian limestone; and still further,as we find the 90-fathom
dyke of Northumberland throwing down likewise the magne
sian limestone, we must here have recourse to a third period of
convulsion. The main direction of elevation, and that which, as
we have seen, must be referred to the aera    of which we are now
especially treating, ranges N. and S. Of the direction of the
second, we have no sufficient information: the great fault
exemplifying the third ranges east and west.       But before we
can fully pronounce as to the aeras of the several disturbances
of this great chain, this very interesting portion of our country
requires a much more minute investigation.        It may perhaps
not be altogether useless, at a meeting like the present, to
suggest some of the objects of inquiry: 1st, according to
Farey, the limestone district of Derbyshire forms a vast ele
vated tract, bounded on three sides, the north, west and south,
by a vast fault, which depresses the superincumbent shale of
the millstone grit formation into contact with the whole series
of the subjacent limestones successively, until at length along
the western border the lowest limestones abut against these
superior beds.    But the existence of this fault still requires
more accurate examination: we do not know how far the ge
neral inclination of the strata accords with this supposition.
 Should it be found, as is not improbable, to have been assumed
in order to explain the position of the masses of toadstone,
taking these for regular and conformable beds, will it not be
much more probable that these intrusive rocks are absolutely
unconformable to the disposition of the strata on the great
scale, and must, therefore, afford the most fallacious evidence
as to the general structure of the district?”
   The fault traversing the coal-measures N. and S., nearly in
the line of the basset edge of the magnesian limestone which
Mr. Farey describes as the great zigzag fault, also stands in
need of corroborative evidence.
   Yet is there nothing in the existence of these faults at                     all
incompatible with what we certainly know concerning other
portions      this central ridge; for proceeding into Yorkshire,
               of
we  certainly  find where the western escarpment            the car of
boniferous limestone reposes                 on

level. We may state generally, that this range of faults ex
tends almost 20 miles from Malhan Tarn to Kirby Lonsdale,
where the limestone skirting the Westmoreland slate moun
tains on the south appears connected with the subsided por
tion proceeding from Giggleswick Scar".
     North of this, on the borders of Cumberland, we find at the
foot of the western escarpment of the great calcareous chain
of Cross Fell, a protruding ridge of greenstone rocks at Duf
ton Pike, &c., attended by shattered portions of carboniferous
limestone and coal; and in the great calcareous chain itself
 we trace several faults, some very considerable, associated with
the presence of the great whin sill in Upper Teesdale; and a
little further north we have the great Burtreeford dyke (head
 of Weardale) ranging N. and S., and occasioning a subsidence
 of 80 fathoms to the west in the different members of the
 limestone series. At the head of Tynedale we have similar
 faults, apparently connected with the western prolongation of
 the great Northumberland             90-fathom dyke; but this, as we
 have    seen,  is certainly  posterior    to the age of the magnesian
 lime, and we are yet unable to pronounce how far many of
  those just noticed may not be equally recent, only that it cer
  tainly appears that the disturbances connected with the erup
  tion of the trap rocks at Dufton are to be referred to our pre
  sent aera, being posterior to the coal-measures, which are ele
  wated and shattered, and anterior to the new red, which re
  poses against these fractured masses horizontally.
      Our information is yet imperfect as to the termination of
  this great calcareous chain against the Cheviot group; still
  less are we acquainted with the structure and phaenomena of
  the great Scotch coal-field.
      IV. Elevations which appear to have affected the transition
   rocks anteriorly to the deposition of the carboniferous series.
      An attentive examination of the phaenomena of the great
   Scotch coal-field, and the relative position of the older rocks
   near their junction, would throw great light on this part of
   our inquiry. As to these points our present information is al
   together deficient; but the general line of elevation of the
   southern transition chain clearly ranges E.N.E. and W.S.W.
   In the Cumbrian Lake district, as the lines of direction of the
   included transition series of formations are entirely uncon
   formable to the position of the zone of carboniferous lime
   stone which ranges round them, reposing indifferently on the
   younger member of that series on the S.E. and against the
   oldest portions of the system on the N.W., we must at once

412     The Rev. W. D. Conybeare                   on   M.     de Beaumont's Theory
 refer the primary elevation of the transition rocks to a period
 antecedent to the formation of the carboniferous lime. The
 general direction of these transition lines of elevation is
 E.N.E. and W.S.W., and they appear to have been attended
 with great transverse fractures, which have often indicated
 the course of the actual valleys.
    In the Island of Anglesea the whole of the transition chains
 are highly inclined and much disturbed, while the old red sand
 stone, mountain lime and coal repose on their edges in nearly
 horizontal strata. The lines of direction are here N.E. and
 S.W.; this is also the general line of the transition chains of
 North Wales. To this direction it is evident that the line of
 the border of carboniferous limestone on the north, proceed
 ing from Ormes Head, is entirely unconformable. The same
 N.E. and S.W. direction seems to prevail also in the transi
 tion chains of South Wales, while the lines of elevation of the
incumbent coal-measures range E. and W.; and in the Vale
of Towy, while we find the transition rocks on the northern
bank nearly vertical, the carboniferous limestone chains on
the south do not deviate above 10° from being horizontal.
The general range of the transition chain occupying the pen
insula of Devon and Cornwall ranges also from N.E. to S.W.;
but here we have scarcely any opportunity of ascertaining
the relative position of those rocks as regards the carboni
ferous series, for the overlying mantle of new red sandstone
is the only rock we observe in contact with their exterior
border; unless, indeed, the limestone of Torbay, as Mr. De la
Beche has stated, be carboniferous. But this district appa
rently has been subject to local convulsion at a much later
period, from the intrusion of greenstone dykes, so as to afford
no precise indications as to the general structure.

      of the Parallelism of Contemporaneous Lines of Elevation. 413
     collect the scattered evidence we possess on the subject to
     which it refers, and to indicate the points in which that evi
    dence is defective, than the attempt to deduce certain con
     clusions from materials so avowedly imperfect; and I will
     therefore content myself at present with observing, that while
     the evidence of the parallelism of the principal transition
    chains appears undoubtedly favourable to M. de Beaumont's
    hypothesis, I am altogether unable to reconcile to that hy
    pothesis the facts I have stated, with regard to the anticlinal
    lines bounding the coal-fields of South Wales, the Forest of
    Dean, and Bristol, where we have seen the very same lines of
    elevation inflected from an E. and W. to a N. and S. bearing:
    and      I
            would further observe, that to me the subject appears
    to embrace a much wider field of consideration; we have not
    only to consider the results of the more violent paroxysmal
    convulsions which have affected the strata at different epochs,
    but the more general and gradual elevation which the phae
    nomena of the post-carboniferous rocks indicate to have pro
    ceeded very gently, and to have produced very little relative
    disturbance in the strata so elevated.
        Finally, when the theory of parallel chains with reference
    to the points of the compass is so extended as to embrace
    half the circumference of the globe, (as is done in the conclu
    sion of M. de Beaumont's memoir”,)                    I
                                                   would inquire, Do we
    not require a more exact definition of the sense in which the
    term parallel is here used? The parallels of latitude are,                                  in
    deed, strictly parallel lines; but the meridians are great cir
    cles passing through the centre of the planet, and no two of
    them can possibly be parallel to one another: thus, an east
    and west chain in central Africa and Iceland are parallel, in
    every acceptation of the word; but north and south chains in
    the old and new continents, the Ural mountains, for instance,
    and the Cordilleras of the Andes, are not parallel in the same
    sense; the two systems of lines in no manner bear the same
,   relations to the spheroidal form of the planet, the meridional
    system having constant reference to                        its
                                                      centre, which the
    parallels        of
                  latitude  always  neglect.          If,
                                                  therefore,  we are     re                to
    ceive the idea         parallel chains, not
                             of                        strictly parallel
                                                                as                              to
    each other, but        having always similar bearings with regard
                              as
    to  the  points        of
                         the compass, must we not further demand
    some   explanation    why north and south chains are thus deter
    mined       their elevation

       I would
             also observe, that I have never in my life seen an
anticlinal line of any extent which followed a direction mathe
matically straight. Those which have fallen under my own ob
servation, on the contrary, have been always more or less
sinuous, although having on the whole a prevailing tendency
in one direction for considerable distances; and when we
speak of the general bearing of such lines, we intend, as I con
ceive, to express only this general and average tendency, on
either side of which the partial flexures, however, often de
viate 20°, or more.
  LXVI.         On the alleged Greek Traditions of the Deluge.
                 By the Rev. John KENRick, M.A.”
IT     is a very generally received opinion that the same event,
    the destruction of the human race by a flood, which is re
corded with so much minuteness of detail in the Book of
 Genesis, has been preserved in more vague traditions among
 allthe principal nations                of
                                   the earth, and especially among
the Greeks.        Not        to
                            mention     crowd a    writers      of
                                                              whom                 by
this question has been treated             connexion with the evi
                                                   in
dences          of
               Revelation, the sanction given        the opinion    to                       by
 Cuvier       sufficient
                is             to
                             show that    belongs  it science    well   to              as
as      religion.
       to            Some           of
                                his readers may have thought his
arguments less conclusive upon this subject than upon those
which lay more immediately within his province, but the ma
jority      no
             doubt have considered his authority decisive.
 I    propose         arrange chronologically the testimonies
                         to                                                                  of
 Greek authors         tothe existence of such traditions of     De                 a
luge: without this we can arrive                        at    no
                                            certain conclusion.
The coincidences which we may find between Pagan fables
and the narratives            of
                       Scripture   the second in  third century          or
after the Christian aera, can never warrant our  inferring their
existence   thousand years before
                 a                         confine the inquiry
                                                        it.   I
to the Greeks, because the chronology          literature among    of
other ancient nations    very  uncertain,
                                   is     and modern accounts
of  the traditions          of
                      barbarous tribes come             generally        to   us
through channels not free from suspicion.      Cuvier has given
such     chronological view (Discours sur
            a                                      Révolutions       les                     du

complete, and the inference which                   he
                                       draws seems the opposite

416                 The Rev. John Kenrick on the alleged
from the absence of such allusions, that the story of Deuca
lion and his flood was unknown to Homer. He might have
introduced them without incongruity, for example, in the ac
count of Thessaly in the Catalogue; but there was no necessity
that he should do so. The silence of Hesiod is more im
portant.    In his Works and Days, the only one of the poems
ascribed to him of which the genuineness is unquestioned”,
he gives a history of the different races of mankind which
had preceded the race of iron, among whom it was his own
misfortune to live+.      In such a deduction it appears impossi
ble that he could have passed over such an event as the de
 struction of the human race by a flood, if it had been in his
 age an article of popular belief. The only thing which even
 appears like the destruction of a wicked generation is what is
 said, l. 136, of the silver age:

4.18                   The Rev. John Kenrick on the alleged
of the brazen age, which Jupiter determined to destroy.                                         Fic
tion preserves a certain consistency with itself, however it
may make free with the laws of nature; and we may safely
pronounce that the account in Apollodorus as it now stands
was put together from fables which had no original unity.
Leaving out the part relating to the flood, the parts which
precede and follow it correspond with what appears to have
been the primary purpose of the mythic history of Deucalion,
to assign the origin of the Hellenes.
   The few fragments of Greek poetry which have escaped the
ravages of time, between the age of Hesiod and the 5th cen
tury before Christ, appear to contain nothing relating to Deu
calion.   The first definite mention of the circumstances of the
flood is in a passage of Hellanicus,                        (if
                                              correctly quoted                                   by

 if Plato be not altogether feigning, he has at least referred to
 Solon what may have happened to himself, and that the al
 leged destruction of historical records was designed to prepare
 the way for the story of the Atlantians and their submerged
islands. There               is,

       Gentlemen,
      objections originally alleged by Mr.Earnshaw against
THE
  the principle of least pressure were three in number.
  The first had reference to a general principle on which the
demonstration of that principle was founded.
  The second referred, not to the demonstration of the prin
ciple, but to an assumption made in the application of                 that                      it,
the value        of

 422       Prof. Moseley in Answer to Mr. Earnshaw's Remarks
  circumstances, the systems of forces concerned will have be
  come precisely analogous to the systems A and C; but by the
 principle of the superposition of forces it is manifest that no
 pressures will be mutually propagated among the forces of C.
  This is one of those arguments which Mr. Earnshaw states to
 have had the effect of strengthening rather than of removing
 his previous objections to my theory.         Will he do me the
 favour to answer it 2 Here is a case of two systems of forces
 in equilibrium, A and C, of which the latter are oblique to
 one another, and yet mutually propagate no pressures. The
 pressures propagated from the different forces of A to each
 point of application of C are exactly sustained by the force
 applied to that point; and the case is precisely analogous to
 that in which the forces C are supplied by the resistances of
 as many fixed points.
     Now it might easily be shown that by varying the magni
 tudes and directions of the forces C these might each of them
 be made to satisfy the conditions supposed above, whatever
 were the forces A. The general case, therefore, that the
forces C may be so taken in magnitude and direction as,                                 al
though oblique to one another, yet mutually to propagate no
pressures, is proved. Now this general case is what Mr. Earn
shaw in his first paper particularly objected against, making at
the same time an exception in favour of the particular case of
parallel resistance; yet, strangely enough, he in his last paper
seems to yield the general proposition, and flies at the parti
cular case. Here, however, I am happy to meet him. He
supposes the system A to be supplied by gravity, and the
forces C to be resolved, each horizontally and vertically. The
horizontal parts of the forces C must, he says, mutually
destroy, since the forces A are vertical; and it is thus proved
that the forces C mutually propagate horizontal pressures.
True; but what hinders that the forces C should in this case be
taken vertically?     My argument is that they may be so taken
as mutually to propagate no pressures; and if taken vertically,
they will propagate none. I have
                                       of all
                                         along assumed that     the                in

My proposition       that the forces    may            be
                                                    taken   somag             in

nitude and direction as                  propagate no pressures,
and yet sustain the forces    A.     r.Earnshaw's case      parallel         of
forces does not       the least shake this
                         in                conclusion,        much       in   as
as   itturns entirely upon the hypothesis that the direction                             of
the forces     Care given, and are not parallel       those      to

system A ; an hypothesis never made by me.    He goes on to
state, that he considers me to have erred in my argument on
this point in two particulars.
     1. In assuming that each of the forces C can be divided”
(not resolved) into two parts, one of which is solely employed
in sustaining the pressures propagated by the system A, and
the other in sustaining the pressure mutually propagated by
the system C.
    2. In supposing that these latter forces can be removed by
the principle of the superposition of equilibrium.
    Mr. Earnshaw has not informed me wherein have erred                          I
in these particulars.
     His next objection is couched in the following terms:
“I    am unable to comprehend why we are to consider the
forces as functions of the coordinates of the points at which
they are applied.”        For his inability to perceive the ground
on which this assumption rests, he assigns no reason in his
first paper; but perhaps, feeling from my answer to that paper
(of which answer, however, he has taken only this notice,) that
some reason was necessary, he thus satisfactorily supplies                                          it.
“I    will now give my REASON for saying that, &c.                   this:            It  is
I  believe that  only  the directions,  and not the forces    themselves,
when there are more than three, are functions                the coordi      of
nates.” Now, let          try this general principle, his belief

has the sanction        Mr. Earnshaw's own authority. Let there
                        of
 be
 a      perfectly smooth surface,                on

placed supported upon any number                 points;of     table, for        a
instance,   on  four legs.
    Now according          Mr. Earnshaw's hypothesis,
                             to                                      alter           if    we

                                                       in   leaving    the
weight   of  the table the same,                  we

    The sum      ofthe vertical pressures must equal the weight                                     of
the table, and result, indeed, from it; but where                the hori            do

this, that each such point being supposed capable of resisting
in every possible direction, the circumstances under which one
 point resists do not differ from those under which another
resists otherwise than as it respects the positions of the points.
 Or thus: it being supposed that the resistances are functions
 of their points of application and their directions,—also their
directions being subject in each case to the condition of a mi
 nimum resistance,—-we may from these data obtain equations
 from which the resistances themselves will be eliminated and
 the directions obtained in terms of the coordinates: the                                             di
 rections being then functions of the coordinates, the resist
 ances are also functions of these.                      -                    -

 Now Mr. Earnshaw,                        by
                                 bringing, first, one         the two points  of

vation      ofthe limit towards which the ratio                the triangles,   of
and therefore         the forces”, continually approaches altogether
                           of

with the line AB.
    My only hypothesis has been that when the triangles pass
from this exceedingly small but finite state into the evane
scent state, and the forces, from the nearest possible approxi
mation         the line AB, actually into that line, these retain
              to
that   identity      their ratios which they have
                       of                                         that point    up    to
 *     The forces     G     and  C   are demonstratively proportional                to    the triangles

                  on the      Principle of Least Pressure.                       4.25
maintained. If as these triangles approach evanescence they
continually approximate to a certain ratio or continually re
tain the same ratio, and if this approximation or this per
manence continue, however near we bring them to a state of
evanescence, it is a legitimate conclusion, that in their actual
state of evanescence they attain the ratio to which they have
continually approximated, or retain that which, up to the
point of evanescence, they have uniformly preserved.
    Now the forces have the ratio of the triangles in their finite
state,   this is a matter of demonstration,-and they retain this
ratio however nearly they are brought to the line AB; when,
for instance, they are distant from that line by the smallest
conceivable quantity: it is therefore a legitimate conclusion
that, carrying on the approximation, their ultimate ratio is the
evanescent ratio of the triangles.
    My argument in respect to this matter of the three points
 of support stands thus:            I
                               have shown (and Mr. Earnshaw
will not  pretend   to dispute my demonstration of this fact) that
when the points G and C are made to approach within the
smallest conceivable distance of the positions which I have ulti
 mately assigned them in the line AB, the pressures upon A, B
 and C are each one third that upon C.
    If under these circumstances Mr. Earnshaw conceives that
 these points G and C do not approach near enough to their
 ultimate positions to be supposed to sustain pressures not very
different from those which they sustain when in those posi
tions, then let the smallest conceivable spaces of which I have
spoken be halved, and               let
                               the points take              up
                                                  their positions
in  the bisections   these spaces: the proposition will then
                         of                                                         be
true, and Mr. Earnshaw's objections will                    be
                                                 limited within
the remaining half        the smallest space conceivable, where
                               of
I   leave them.
 I    now come     Mr. Earnshaw's attack upon my application
                      to
 to his case    offormula derived from the principle
                     a                                      least           of
pressure, which formula, when thus applied, gives          result         a
identical with that just obtained    the method  by  evanescent   of
triangles, and thus furnishes    remarkable verification

of a certain point, about which the moments of the resistance
are shown by the principle of least pressure to be equal.
   Now, if the positions of the points of resistance be supposed
to vary so that 3a–b–c may continually diminish, it is evi
dent that to satisfy this equation the value of a must continu

Report on the Progress, Actual State, and Ulterior Prospects of Geo
  logical Science.  By the Rev. W. D. Conybeare, F.R.S., V.P.G.S.,
  Corr. Memb. Institute of France, &c. (Second Report of the
  British Association for the Advancement of Science, 1832, p.365
  —414.
H AVING        reason to believe that certain points discussed and elu
       cidated in this Report have neither acquired the publicity nor
received the attention which they merit, and also that the geological
section through Europe which accompanies it is not so widely known
as it deserves to be, we deem it proper, although the volume of
which it forms a valuable portion has now been for some months
before the public, to present our readers with a brief account of
Mr. Conybeare's labours in this highly important contribution to
the prosperity of the science of which he has so long been one of the
most eminent cultivators.
   Mr. Conybeare having years ago (in the first part of the “Out
lines of the Geology of England and Wales,” by himself and the
late Mr. William Phillips,) submitted to the public a concise state
ment of the notices of geological observation and geological theory
which are contained in the records of classical antiquity, and of the
anticipations of subsequent discoveries, which are to be found in the
works of numerous writers in Italy, after the revival of literature and
science; and the outline he then gave having been ably filled up by
subsequent writers, especially by Mr. Lyell, (in the first volume of his
‘Principles of Geology,’) he confines his remarks on early geology
to a notice of the claims of Leibnitz. “The universal Leibnitz,” he
observes, “honoured this branch of physical speculation by devo
ting to it a portion of his attention, and anticipated, with the pro
phetic sagacity of a powerful mind,                its
                                           future progress, and the very
methods    ofinvestigation which would most effectually contribute                    to
 itssuccessful development.”              In
                                   the fourth section               of
                                                           his Protogaea,

vesicular and cavernous structure assumed by masses during their
refrigeration from a state of fusion, must necessarily have occasioned
in the crust thus cooling down and consolidated.               He assigns the
weight of the materials, and the eruption of elastic vapours, as the
concurrent causes of these disruptions. He adds that these disrup
tions of the crust, must, from the disturbances communicated to the
incumbent waters, have been necessarily attended with diluvial ac
tion on the largest scale. When these waters had subsequently, in
the intervals of quiescence between these convulsions, deposited the
materials first acquired by their force of attrition, these sediments
formed, by their consolidation, various stony and earthy strata.
Thus, he observes, we may recognise a double origin of the rocky
masses, the one by refrigeration from igneous fusion, the other by
concretion from aqueous solution. “We have here distinctly stated,"
Mr. Conybeare remarks, “the great basis of every scientific classi
fication of rock formations.”        By the repetition of similar causes
frequent alternations of new strata were produced, until at length,
these causes having been reduced to a condition of quiescent equi
librium, a more permanent state of things emerged. In concluding
his sketch of this portion of the geological anticipations of Leibnitz,
Mr. Conybeare particularly invites to the following clause the at
tention of those writers of the present day, who appear to assume it
as an essential condition of their theories, that the same physical
causes can never, under any former circumstances, have acted with
more intense energy than they actually exert: “Donec quiescentibus
 causis, atque aequilibratis, consistentior emergeret rerum status.”
    The contributions to geology of Hooke, Lehman, Fuchsel, Saussure
 and Werner, are next briefly reviewed; the first general announce
 ment that the various species of organic remains grouped together in
the rock formations bear a constant relation to the age of those for
 mations, being shown to have been made by the illustrious professor
of Freiberg. The progress of geology, from the period at which it had
in his hands begun to assume the systematic character of a regularly
 digested science, may be considered, Mr. Conybeare remarks, as
 having presented three marked stages, distinguished by three succes
 sive schools. Each of these schools has selected for the more especial
 object of  its attention    single member        the three great geological

members of which alone the previous researches of Cuvier, &c., had
made us acquainted,—has within           the few last years received an ad
ditional development, no less important than that which, in an earlier
stage of geological progress, the secondary system of      - the Wernerians
received from the discoveries of Smith.”
    In order to confirm this general statement, Mr. Conybeare enters
more minutely into the detail of the recent progress of geological dis
covery, reviewing in succession the researches of Fitton and Martin,
of Murchison and Sedgwick, of Buckland and De la Beche, of Mr.
 Phillips of York, (now appointed, we are happy to see, Professor of
Geology in the King's College,) and of the various expositors of the
structure of the northern coal-fields in the Transactions of the New
castle Philosophical Society.
     Concluding here the subject of British geology, Mr. Conybeare
proceeds to give an outline of the rapid progress which the science
has recently made in developing the structure of foreign countries,
 adopting the following geographical order. He begins with the coun
 tries constituting or bordering the great European basin, which he
 takes in the following order: France, the Alps, Germany, the Baltic
 Coasts and Scandinavia, ending with Russia.           He next proceeds to
 the countries connected with the Mediterranean basin, the Spanish
 Peninsula, Italy, Turkey and the African coasts. The other quarters
 of the globe now follow, Asia as divided into the northern and cen
 tral provinces explored by the Russian Government; and those of
 India by our own nation. He concludes with North and South
 America; but reserving in                 all
                                                                                           a to

We are indeed unable to trace many of these formations, even through
our own island, without observing such considerable modifications in
their comparative types, in our northern and southern counties, as
may sufficiently remind us that we are to look only for such analogous
rather than identical results, as would naturally proceed from the con
temporaneous action of similar causes in distant localities; in each of
which many varying local circumstances must have affected those re
sults, for two conditions obviously enter into this problem :—first,
the contemporaneous prevalence and extent of similar geological
causes; and secondly, how far these causes, even where active, may have
been modified by varying local circumstances. Now, at present, our
materials for answering these questions accurately are confined to
Europe: of America indeed we have some information; and although
this may as yet be considered too vague to be fully satisfactory, yet
as far as it goes it is undoubtedly favourable to the presumption of
even a greater degree of geological uniformity than we should have
been justified in anticipating a priori.
   “Humboldt indeed has remarked, that while on entering a new he
misphere we change               all
                             other familiar and accustomed objects, while
in the plains around we survey entirely new forms                vegetable and          of
animal being, and         the heavens over our heads we gaze
                            in                                          new con              on

thus imbedded, differences to the full as marked as those which, in
the same continent, characterize formations of the most distant ages.
Now with regard to the secondary rocks of distant countries, our in
formation is as yet far too limited to enable us to return, to the above
questions, answers on which we can rely with any degree of confi
dence: but the evidence, as far as it goes, does undoubtedly again
seem to indicate a greater degree of resemblance than we could have
reasonably anticipated: this may particularly be instanced with re
gard to the older rocks containing organic remains, e.g. the transition
limestone. We are extensively acquainted with this rock in Russia, in
the islands of the Baltic, in Scandinavia, and in North America; and

    A series of experiments is described, showing that when a given
quantity of electricity is divided among any number of perfectly simi
lar conductors, the attractive force, as measured by the electrometer,
is inversely as the square of that number; and if different quantities
of electricity be communicated to the same conductor, their attractive
forces are directly as the squares of those quantities.
    The author observes that the electrical force exerted by one body
on another is always diminished by the vicinity of a neutral body;
an effect which is analogous to the operation of screens in diminish
ing the force of a revolving magnet on metallic disks, as noticed by
him in a former paper, published in the Philosophical Transactions *.

 same area;     nor does it make any difference if the plates be turned

     The author proceeds to investigate some laws relating to the action
 of electricity, when resulting from induction ; and particularly that
 of the relation between electrical attraction and distance; adducing
 experiments in confirmation of the former being in the inverse dupli
 cate ratio of the latter. The attraction actually exhibited between
 two equal spheres, he considers as composed-of a system of parallel
 forces, operating in right lines between the homologous points of the
 opposed hemisphere.          The author concludes by various observations
 on the transmission of electricity to bodies in vacuo, from which he

The three omphalo-mesenteric, or vitulline vessels, were traced, from
the umbilical cord into the abdomen, where they terminated in the
usual manner; namely, the veins in the vena portae, and the artery
in the aorta. Hence it was apparent that the membrane on which
they ramified, corresponded to the vascular layer of the germinal mem
brane, which, in oviparous animals, spreads over the yelk, or to the
umbilical vessel of the embryos of ordinary mammalia.       The ventri
cles of the heart were completely joined together, and bore the same
proportions to each other as in the adult; a perfection of structure
which is not observed in the embryos of ordinary mammalia at a cor
responding period of developement.    The lungs were equal in size to
the heart, and were of a spongy texture, and full of red blood; their
precocious developement, compared with that of the abdominal or di
gestive organs, being evidently a provision for their early or prema
ture exercise.
   From the close resemblance in the structures of the ovary and Fal
lopian tubes of the kangaroo with those of ordinary mammalia, and
from the circumstance of the young being nourished, after birth, by a
secretion from mammary glands, the author concludes that the ovu
lum in the former animal quits the ovisac in a condition correspond
ing to that in the latter class, and increases in a similar manner as it
descends to the uterus.      But as there is no formation of a placenta,
it remains to be determined how the aeration of the foetal blood is
effected: this, however, probably takes place through the chorion,
although this membrane is not vascular, to an extent sufficient for the
purposes of the vital functions of a foetus so imperfect, and whose
uterine existence is of such short duration, as they are in this animal.
Reasons are given, which render it probable that in the Marsupiata an
allantois and umbilical arteries are developed at a later period of
gestation, corresponding in this respect to the foetal condition of the
Batrachian reptiles, and corroborating the views entertained by the
author, that the former family are essentially ovo-viviparous.
   The author next proceeds to investigate the structure and condition
                                                                                               its its

     May 8.—A paper                   was read, entitled,              “On the Connexion be
tween Refracted and Diffracted                        Light.”        By Paul Cooper, Esq. Com
municated by J. G. Children, Esq., Sec. R.S.
    The purport of the present paper, as stated by the author, is to con
nect the phenomena of the dispersion of light arising from refraction,
with that consequent upon diffraction, by showing, 1st, “that white
refracted light is formed by the superposition of fringes of colours, or
rays of light uniformly refracted, which compensate each other in suc
cession; 2nd, that diffracted white light is formed by the superpo
sition of fringes which are not uniformly refracted, but which recede
from it so gradually, as not to prevent the same mutual compensation,
although it is distinguished by other appearances; and 3rd, that the
purity of the colour of the light, in both cases, depends upon       con                              its
tinuity, any interruption    which, although the different portions into
                                           of
which      may
          it         be
                   separated are white                          at
                                           the moment the division takes
place, produces colours                         its
                                 further progress, because each portion
                                           in
carries with     the difference
                    it             direction required for their develope

       GENTLEMEN,
You have learned from the Report of the Council that the Society
has considerably gained in number since the last Annual Meeting,
So large an accession of members shows the growing popularity of
our science, and is at once a gratifying reward of your past exertions
and a sure presage of your further success.
    You have also been informed that during the same period the
losses of the Society have been unusually numerous. Several of the
deceased, whose main objects in life, if not alien, were connected
but remotely with those of our institution, conferred upon         notwith                          it,

 the joint purpose        friendly intercourse and mutual instruction.

 From such small beginnings sprang the Geological Society; and
 among the names         those    of               by
                                    whose care and watchfulness           was                             it
supported during the early and most perilous crisis                  history,              of   its
that   ofDr. Babington must always stand conspicuous.
    But while Dr. Babington employed his leisure                the study                 in                  as
chemistry and mineralogy,                          he
                                     gradually rose into eminence                                             a of
physician, and      last became occupied with the care
                            at                                     numerous                of  a

sive medical practice.       During many years,           was disabled from     he

                               Geological Society.                                              445
pursuing     his favourite sciences with that unremitted attention
 which alone leads to original discovery; and accordingly our Trans
actions do not contain any communication from his pen: no man,
however, more steadily cheered us in our progress or more heartily
rejoiced in our success. In the year 1822, he was elected to the pre
sidency of this Society, an office which he accepted in deference to
the earnest wish of the Members, and held for two years at great
personal sacrifice.     His conduct in this chair afforded to us ample
opportunity of observing the native goodness and kindliness of his
heart, the urbanity of his manners, the evenness and cheerfulness of
his temper, and the aptitude with which he exercised every liberal
feeling.
    During the presidency of Dr. Babington, and at his suggestion,
was established the practice of submitting to immediate discussion
the papers read at the table of the Society.           Apprehensions were
entertained by some persons at that time, that the collision of argu
ment and the desire of personal distinction might interfere with
the love of science or break the bonds of social intercourse,         that we
i.
might learn to contend less for truth than for victory.           I appeal to
       Gentlemen, whether the brighter anticipations of Dr. Babington
   ave not been amply justified by experience; whether our discussions,
continued now during twelve years, have not been strongly charac
terized by a love of truth; whether the bonds of friendship have not
been more closely cemented by them. Our conversations have been
animated, but never intemperate; they have encouraged the timid,
assisted the investigator in discovering the object of his research, and
given additional value to every paper in our Transactions.
    Dr. Babington was a Vice-President during the years 1810, 1811,
 1812, 1813 and 1814, and a Trustee from 1811 to 1821. His dona
tions to our library and museum were extensive, and from subscrip
tions set on foot to promote the objects of the Society his name was
never withheld.

his memory kindle in      us a feeling not merely of gratitude but of
emulation!
    Dr. Berger, who died in the early part of last year, was a native
of Switzerland, and had been employed in geological study for
some years previous to 1813, when he sought in England an asylum
from the foreign oppression which in those days of revolution had
visited his country.    In 1816, at the request of some of his friends
in this Society, he agreed to devote himself for three years to geo
logical investigations in the British Islands; and an annual sum
was insured to him during that period by a subscription of some of
our members. The north-west coast of Ireland was suggested for his
first examination, and there, as might perhaps have been foreseen, the
movements of a foreigner, who spoke our language imperfectly,
and whose occupation must have appeared to the inhabitants myste
rious, if not dangerous, at first excited doubt and obstruction, which,
though not unamusing, were attended with some embarrassment, and
called for the interference of his friends.      He laboured with great
zeal and   assiduity, in that interesting  field of inquiry, till his health
unfortunately gave way. His papers and collections were therefore
incomplete ; and his attention appears to have been given perhaps
too much to the investigation of details not immediately connected
with the proper and immediate business of the geologist. His merit,
however, must be judged            not    of,
                                           reference      by

                                         at
were valuable.  “A Memoir the Dykes             on                   of

    Dr. Alexander Turnbull Christie imbibed in the class-room of
Professor Jameson a taste for geology, which he afterwards im
proved in India, as far as opportunity allowed, under many discoura
ging circumstances. On his return to Europe he applied himself
to the science with great earnestness; he studied the best works,
courted the society of their authors, familiarized himself with the
contents of collections, and practised in the open air the most ap
proved methods of investigation. He became the pupil of M. Brong
niart at Paris, and the companion of M. de Beaumont and M. von
Buch in the Alps. His studies were by no means confined to
geology; they embraced every department of natural history. The
climatological and geographical distribution of plants was a subject
to which he paid much attention.           Having provided at his own ex
pense the best instruments for the purpose, he returned to India
with the design of instituting there a continued series of barometric,
hygrometric, and other experiments, as well as of exploring the
physical structure of that vast region, and of determining the rela

upon examination proved to contain a great number of new and
rare substances of the highest mineralogical interest, cryolite, so
dalite, allanite, with mixed groups of striking variety and novelty;
and all in such abundance that most of the cabinets of England
(when collectors, if not more numerous, were at least more active
than I fear they are at present,) were supplied from this source.
Mr. Giesecké himself accidentally arrived at Leith in 1813, not long
after Mr. Allan had published an account of his purchases, and with
great generosity contributed to the improved catalogues and de
scriptions of specimens which subsequently appeared. He was soon
after appointed Professor of Mineralogy to the Royal Dublin So
ciety, and went to reside in Ireland, where he spent the remainder
of his life. About this period also he was honoured with an Order
of Knighthood by the King of Denmark; but having now passed his
fiftieth year, his health was broken, and much of the energy lost
which distinguished his early life. He lived to the age of 72, and
died at Dublin in March 1833. Sir Charles Giesecke meditated,
after his return from Greenland, an extensive work upon that coun
try; he published a brief account of it in Dr. Brewster's Encyclo
paedia, but the larger work was deferred till the voyages of Ross
and Parry had deprived the subject of the interest of novelty.
His meteorological observations appeared in the Edinburgh Philo
sophical Journal for 1818; and he gave to Mr. Scoresby, for his work
on the Greenland Coast, the use of his maps and other materials.
The Edinburgh Philosophical Journal for 1822, contains an ac
count of his discovery of the geological situation of Cryolite. His
only publications on the mineralogy of Ireland are, I believe, a brief
notice of the geological situation of Beryl in the county of Down",
and an account       of an excursion to the counties of Galway and
Mayof.
    Mr. Alexander Nimmo was a civil engineer of high reputation.
 He was born in Fifeshire in 1783, and at a very early age showed
a strong propensity to physical and mathematical inquiry. One of
his first public employments was a survey of some of the bogs in
Ireland, on which he delivered a report to the Commissioners in
1811, containing some general observations on the geological cha
racter of part of Roscommon, Kerry, Cork and Galway.             He was
afterwards engaged in various works of great importance, prin
cipally in Ireland.     He was the author of several articles in Brew
ster's Edinburgh Encyclopædia, on subjects connected with his pro
fession. One of his latest and most valuable literary productions,
on the publication of part of which he was engaged at the period of
his death in January 1832, was a Chart of the Irish Channel, with
sailing directions for the coast of Ireland, a performance probably

   Mr. David Scott was one of the numerous class of officers in the
service of the East India Company who have found means to com
bine with the most exemplary discharge of their official duties, a con
stant attention to the interests of literature and science. He was the
second son of Archibald Scott, Esq., of Montrose, and died prema
turely in India in 1831, at the age of 45, having passed through
many offices of high trust with distinguished credit, and holding at
the time of his death the situations of Civil Commissioner in Bung
poor and other districts, and agent to the Governor General in the
North-east of Bengal. His exertions and success in discharging his
official functions, and in promoting the welfare of the country in
which he was placed, by diffusing education, were highly appreciated,
and a monument has been erected to his memory by the Supreme
Government of India.        Mr. Scott possessed great knowledge in
several branches of science not immediately connected with this
institution, and lost no opportunity of attending to geological re
search. Our Transactions are indebted to him for the substance
of a valuable paper communicated by Mr. Colebrooke”, “On the
Geology of the North-eastern Border of Bengal,” in which is de
scribed a remarkable deposit on the left bank of the Burrampooter
river, containing an assemblage of fossils that bear an extraordinary
likeness to those of the London clay. “Among the remains of fishes,”
Mr. Colebrooke states, “bony palates and the fins of the Balistes are
common to the Indian clay and to that of Sheppey; and the shells
of Cooch-behar bear a strong generic, if not specific, resemblance
to the marine formations above the chalk in France and England.”
This communication contains also some valuable facts respecting
a succession of strata, like those of our coal-fields, in the Tista
and Subuk rivers; and in the same volume, is an extract from a
letter written by Mr. Scott, describing the situation of a limestone
and clay containing Nummulites at Robagiri, a village in the North
east of Bengal. Such resemblances, though they are far from esta
blishing the contemporaneous formation—much less the continuity
—of the groups in which they occur, are interesting, from the proof
they furnish, of the operation of similar causes in very distant parts
of the former surface of the globe.

   Wollaston MedAL.-The product of the Wollaston Fund du
ring the past year has been awarded to Mr. Agassiz of Neufchatel,
in promotion of his work on the “General History of Fossil Fishes."
   The first part of Mr. Agassiz's publication has but recently reached
England, and the Council have availed themselves of the earliest op
portunity of giving support to an undertaking of great geological im
portance.     The author's qualifications for this work were so highly
appreciated by the late Baron Cuvier, who had himself been engaged
in a similar project, that on seeing Mr. Agassiz's collection of draw
ings, and hearing a statement of his views, and the results at which
he had arrived, that profound naturalist at once transferred to Mr.
Agassiz the whole of his materials. The approval of Cuvier is
fully sanctioned by the portion of the work which is now before the
Society. In deciding on the present award, the Council have acted
strictly in compliance with the bequest of Dr. Wollaston.                    The
work of Mr. Agassiz is intimately connected with the objects of
this Society; it demands for              completion great labour and ex

   After careful examination of the Old red Sandstone, Mr. Murchi
son has proposed to divide it into three parts: the uppermost, cha
racterized by quartzose Conglomerate; the middle, by Cornstone;
the lowermost, by Flagstone. The cornstone and marlstone of the
middle group contain undescribed genera of crustacea; and in the
tilestone beneath are found some defences of fish, together with a
few remains of testacea.
     Mr. Murchison has employed three summers in examining                                 a range
of country situate between Shrewsbury and Caermarthen;            and the
geological positions as well as the mineral and zoological characters
of the several rocks which border England and Wales are now deter
mined with as much exactness as those of any portion of the secon
dary system. Taking the old red sandstone as a line of departure,
the rocks beneath are disposed in descending order as follows:
   1. The Ludlow series, divisible into three parts, the upper,
middle and lower. To the middle belong the well-known limestones
of Amestry and Sedgley: the upper and lower consist of sand, marl,
or flagstone, having some fossils peculiar to each, and others in
common. The thickness of the whole is estimated at 1000 feet.
   2. The Dudley or Wenlock series, consisting of limestone :                                        its
thickness may         be

When his observations are published, the Society will have type                            a

 by Mr. Murchison are, for the most part, exceedingly well charac

most part assignable, but the description of them has been reserved
for communications not yet before us.
    Professor Sedgwick has transmitted to us a notice on the granite
of Shap in Westmoreland. From recent excavations it appears that
veins of this granite penetrate the adjoining strata, from which he
infers that it is of posterior date.
   Mr. De la Beche, one of our Vice-Presidents, acting under the
direction of the Board of Ordnance, has produced a geological map
of the county of Devon, which, for extent and minuteness of informa
tion and beauty of execution, has a very high claim to regard. Let
us rejoice in the complete success which has attended this first at
tempt of that honourable Board to exalt the character of English
topography by rendering it at once more scientific and very much
more useful to the country at large.
   ORGANIC REMAINs.-Every succeeding year brings to light new
fossil animals which cannot be assigned to existing genera. Dr.
Riley, deeply skilled in physiology and comparative anatomy, has
given us an account of an animal so extraordinary, that naturalists
differ even respecting          its
                             class. After careful examination,       con                         he

   A memoir on the neighbourhood of Bonn was presented last.
year by Mr. Horner. After describing the characters of the grau
wacke, trachyte, basalt, brown coal, gravel and löss, the author
compares the age of these with that of analogous formations in
other parts of Europe, and of one another. The beds of grauwacke
as they contain Terebratulae and other shells he refers to the upper
part of that system; he considers the brown coal more recent than
the plastic clay, some of           its
                                 plants and shells having been identified
with specimens found           Aix

    In a late number of Jameson's Journal is part of a memoir on the
structure of the Valley of Ovelipore* by Mr. Hardie, one of our re
cently elected Fellows.
    This valley had previously been noticed by Captain Dangerfieldt;
but Mr. Hardie has been the first to describe a singular Indian for
mation which occurs there, called Kunkur. It is rarely, if ever, stra
tified; it forms a bed, seldom exceeding a few feet thick, which
mantles over the irregularities of the country.            It is sometimes im
perfectly oolitic; at others globular, botryoidal or nodular; in some
places a compact limestone; in others it resembles chalk : not un
frequently it contains round and angular fragments of rocks.                 No
animal or vegetable remains have been noticed in                   The author              it.
carefully distinguishes Kunkur from modern tufaceous deposits, but
assigns       to  similar origin.

   taste for scientific research which sprung up in the minds of these
   gallant men, spontaneously, as it were, and without the aid of regu
   lar systematic culture, has been to many of them a welcome relief

   afforded pleasurable occupation in the solitude of trackless deserts,

       This genus of marine Shells appears to be most nearly related to
    Pyramidella and Rissoa. A species which has been long known
   has had the appellation of Turbo politus among British Linnean
   writers; and a fossil species has been placed by Lamarck among
   the Bulini, under the specific name of Bul. terebellatus.           There
   are two distinctly marked divisions of the genus, which are cha
   racterized by the two species above mentioned; one has a solid
   columella, and the other is deeply umbilicated.      All the species are
   remarkable for a brilliant   polish externally, and the shells are fre
   quently slightly and somewhat irregularly twisted, apparently in
   consequence of the very obsolete varices following each other in an
   irregular line, principally on one side, from the aper toward the
   aperture, . Several recent species are British, and the fossil species
   are found in the calcaire grossier near Paris.

   this were in G. Humphrey's collection, marked “Spira lineata,
  Weymouth, M.P.”: these two last letters stand for Musaei Port
  landici.   I make no further remark, save that it appears to have
  been published by Da Costa under the name of Turbo glaber—

      February 11.-Extracts were read from a letter addressed to the
  Secretary by B. H. Hodgson, Esq., Corr. Memb. Z.S., and dated
  Nepal, July 13, 1833.     It conveyed the thanks of the writer for the
 present to him on the part of the Society of an illustrative series of
 skins of Birds; and, referring to the mortality among the living
 Birds and Quadrupeds forwarded by him for the Society's Mena
 gerie, it expressed a hope that a subsequent attempt would be more
 successful.
      Portions were exhibited of the viscera of a Capybara, Hydrochae
 rus Capybara, Erxl., taken from an individual which recently died
 in the Society's Menagerie.        They consisted of the stomach, the
 enormous calcum, and the fauces. In calling the attention of the
 Meeting to the latter parts, Mr. Owen availed himself of the oppor
 tunity to demonstrate the structure first observed in them by Mr.
 Morgan, by whom it has been described and figured in the lately
 published Part of the ‘Linnean Transactions'.         The constriction of
 the hinder part of the soft palate, which prevents any but minutely
divided substances from passing into the pharynx, and which was
first observed in the Capybara, is found in many other Rodents, but
does not obtain in the whole of the animals of that order.
     Various preparations were exhibited of the Rhea, Rhea Ameri
cana, Vieill, and of the Cassowary, Casuarius Emeu, Lath. They
were brought under the notice of the Society by Mr. Martin, who,
at the request of the Chairman, read his notes of the dissections of
these birds. They agreed generally with the descriptions published
                                                                           -

     Mr. Martin also exhibited a preparation of aneurism

                                           H. Lance, Esq. He stated
that this disease appeared to be rare among Quadrupeds, no previ
 ous instance of it having occurred to him among more than a hun
dred individuals of various orders which he had dissected within
the last few years.
    A preparation was exhibited of a young common Macaque Monkey,
Macacus cynomolgus, La Cép., which was born at the Gardens on
the morning of the 25th January, but was dead when first noticed by
the keeper. It is the first instance that has occurred in the Society's
Menagerie of the birth of any Monkey of the Old Continent.
    The reading was concluded of a Paper entitled “A few Remarks
tending to illustrate the Natural History of two Annulose Genera,
namely Urania of Fabricius and Mygale of Walckenäer: by W. S.
MacLeay, Esq.”
    Adverting in the first place to the doubts which prevail among
entomologists as to the true situation in nature of the genus Urania,
Mr. MacLeay proceeds to contribute towards the elucidation of the
problem, the history of one species which appears to him to be
possibly new. He characterizes it as
   URANIA FERNANDINE.             Ur. alis nigris, anticis utrinque lineis
      transversis auro-viridibus supra undecim, septimã bifidd, subtiis

      ratd et lineis octo brevibus lateralibus transversis auro-viridibus.
   Exp. alarum 4–4} unc.

   Mr. MacLeay describes in great detail the perfect insect, and
 points out, as far as printed descriptions and figures exhibit them,
(he having at present no access to cabinets,) the marks which di
 stinguish Ur. Sloanus, Godart, and Ur. Boisduvalii, Guér., from the
 Cuban species. He conceives, however, from the many variations
 that he discovers in   it,
                          that this insect may      merely

  Ur. Sloanus,      which species Ur. Boisduvalii may also possibly
