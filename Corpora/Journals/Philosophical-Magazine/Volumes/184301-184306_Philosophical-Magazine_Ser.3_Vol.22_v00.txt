I.    On the Efficacy of Steam as a means of producing Electricity,
     and on a curious Action of a Jet of Steam upon a Ball. By
     W. G.        ARMSTRoNg, Esq.”
THE   experiments which I have made on the electricity of
  steam, since the date of my last communication to the
Philosophical Magazinet, have completely confirmed the con
                           I
clusion which had then arrived at, that the excitation of elec
tricity takes place at the point where the steam is subjected to
friction; and by the improvements I have effected in the mode
                                               I
of discharging the steam, have so amazingly increased the
energy of the effects, that I question whether any electrical
machine has yet been constructed capable of producing as
much electricity as my electrical boiler.        At       events the           all
boiler has been proved        possess upwards
                                          to        seven times the       of

2                      Mr. Armstrong on              the Efficacy          of
    Number of discharges obtained per
      minute when it was applied to the Y-220
      insulated boiler ........................
    The discharges were                              rapid when the elec
                                            so exceedingly
trometer was connected with the              boiler,   that it was difficult
to count them with accuracy, but the number I have inserted
is assuredly not overstated.
   The boiler is a wrought-iron cylinder, with rounded ends,
and measures three feet six inches in length, and one foot six
inches in diameter.           It rests upon an iron frame, containing
the   fire,  and the whole apparatus is supported upon glass
legs to insulate          The application
                            it.                   the fire of   unfortunately  is

    It  ismuch more convenient and effectual                      collect elec   to
tricity from the boiler than from the steam-cloud, but                                               in

                I
plug, such as have described, are screwed into an iron vessel
communicating with the boiler, and in which the proper
quantity of moisture, to be carried out with the steam, is de
posited by condensation.       The steam is used at a pressure of
about 70 pounds on the square inch, and is discharged hori
zontally in diverging jets.      Each jet affords quite as much
electricity as a good electrical machine of ordinary dimensions;
and when it is considered that a boiler of evaporating power
equal to that of a locomotive engine would be adequate to
sustain hundreds of such jets, an idea may be formed of the

obtain by the agency of steam.
   Although it is perfectly clear that the electricity is excited
in the discharging passage where the steam is exposed to vio
lent friction, yet as the mode of ejection which I have de
scribed is neither characterized by peculiar violence of fric
tion, nor by great extent of rubbing surface acted upon by
the steam, I feel great difficulty in accounting for

6          Sir J. F. W. Herschel                 on the        Action of the Rays
light is so rapid that the state of the weather, as to gloom or
sunshine, is of little moment.     It is otherwise in the class of
photographic actions now to be considered, in which exposure
to the concentrated spectrum for many hours, to clear sun
shine for several days, or to dispersed light for whole months,
is requisite to bring on many of the effects described, and
those some of the most curious.      Moreover, in such experi
ments, when unduly prolonged by bad weather, the effects
due to the action of light become mixed and confounded with
those of spontaneous changes in the organic substances em
ployed, arising from the influence of air, and especially of
moisture, &c., and so give rise to contradictory conclusions,
or at     events preclude definite results, and obscure the per
        all
ception     characters which might serve
            of                                 guides        intri      as             in    an

a fiducial point or centre corresponding to the mean yellow
ray; and 4062 positively, from the same centre to the ter
minal violet, both as seen through a certain standard blue
glass, which lets both extremes pass freely and insulates the
mean yellow with considerable precision. The correction for
the sun's semidiameter has been applied in what follows to all
measures up to terminations of spectra, unless where the con
trary is expressed. Maxima and minima of action, and neu
tral points neither require nor admit this correction.

 paper, gives a nearly colourless ground. A slip of this paper
 exposed to the spectrum is speedily impressed with a fine blue

 described in Art. 92.               If

ground of the paper is turned to a pale brownish green, with

   152. A portion of the same paper was exposed, dry, to an
atmosphere of chlorine considerably diluted with common air,
which imparted to it a pale, dirty, greenish yellow hue. Being
thence transferred immediately to the spectrum, the result
was not a little remarkable.        The whole spectrum, the green
excepted, was impressed in faint tints nearly corresponding
to the natural ones. The red was evident—the yellow dilute
and nearly white—the blue a fine sky-blue, while beyond the
violet succeeded a train of somewhat greenish darkness. These
tints proved fugitive, and in twenty-four hours were nearly
obliterated.
    153. When paper fresh washed with tincture of guaiacum
and still wet is exposed to chlorine, it instantly acquires a fine
and full Prussian blue colour, which however passes speedily
to brown if the action be prolonged.          The colour is difficult

of very nearly the same intensity as on the face 4. Indeed, if
the picture be over-sunned the back will exhibit a perfect im

strange effect: exposed to the spectrum, the blue colour is
converted to a pale reddish yellow in the region of the less
refrangible rays, and simply whitened in the more refrangible
region.     The action, when prolonged till the light seems to
have no further influence, extends from — 12-4, corrected for
semidiameter, to +40, or thereabouts, where it dies away                                                         in

such circumstances it might be expected that the additional
heat thrown on the paper in the region of the thermic rays
would turn the scale in their favour at their points of greatest
intensity, and give ocular proof of their action by a decided
discharge of colour at those points.    But no such result was

so near as to produce a commencement of discoloration over
the whole of that region of the paper where they ought to
have shown themselves.

an unexpected influence, was exercised by the heat so thrown
on that part of the paper where the less refrangible rays
fell, and where the discoloration was in progress under their
agency. For it was observed that, under these circumstances,
the discoloration in question went on with much greater ra
pidity, so much so indeed, that the same amount of               which                 it,

to the region of it occupied by the luminous rays, as contra
distinguished both from the so-called chemical rays, beyond
the violet, which act with the chief energy on argentine com
pounds, but are here for the most part ineffective, on the one
hand, and on the other, from the thermic rays beyond the
red, which appear to be totally so. Indeed, I have hitherto

 goes on rapidly.      It does not even cease in the dark when once
 begun.      Hence it happens that photographic impressions
 taken on such paper, which when fresh are very sharp and
 beautiful, fade by keeping, visibly from day to day, however
 carefully preserved from light. Specimens of such photo

 cautiously applied, retards considerably, but does not ulti
 mately prevent, this spontaneous discharge.

 minutes the colour is totally destroyed and the paper whitened
 in the whole region of the green, blue and violet rays, to which
 therefore the most energetic action is confined, agreeably to
 the law of complementary tints (Art. 170.).                  the action of            If

          which  they were  completely  whitened,   and     traces                        all
of the pictures obliterated.    They were then exposed         free                             to
air, the one      the dark, the other

twenty-four hours, that in the dark not till after a lapse of two
 or three days.
     180. A slip of the stained paper was wetted with liquid sul
phurous acid and laid on blotting-paper similarly wetted.
 Being then crossed with a strip of black paper, it was laid be
tween glass plates and (evaporation of the acid being thus
prevented) was exposed to full sunshine. After some time the
 red colour (in spite of the presence of the acid) was consider
ably restored in the portion exposed, while the whole of the
portion covered by the black paper remained (of course) per
 fectly white.
     181. Slips of paper, stained as above, were placed under a
 receiver, beside a small capsule of liquid sulphurous acid.
 When completely discoloured they were subjected (on various
occasions, and after various lengthsofexposureto the acid fumes
from half an hour to many days) to the action of the spec
trum; and it was found, as indeed I had expected, that the
restoration of colour was operated by rays complementary to
those which destroy it in the natural state of the paper, the violet
rays being chiefly active, the blue almost equally so, the green
little, and the yellow, orange, and most refrangible red not at
all. In one experiment a pretty well-defined red solar image
was developed by the least refrangible red rays also, being
precisely those for which in the unprepared paper the disco
louring action is abruptly cut off. But this spot              never    I
 succeeded in    reproducing;  and it ought  also to be  mentioned,
 that, according to differences in the preparation not obvious,
the degree of sensibility, generally, of the bleached paper to
 the restorative action of light differed greatly; in some cases
 a perceptible reddening being produced in ten seconds, and a
 considerable streak in two minutes, while in others a very
long time was required to produce any effect.
     182. The dormancy of this colouring principle, under the
 influence of sulphurous acid, is well shown by dropping a
 little weak sulphuric acid on the paper bleached by that gas,
 which immediately restores the red colour in                   all
                                                             vigour.  its
In    like manner alkalies restore the colour,  converting       the    it   at
 same time into green.

20       Action of the Solar Spectrum on Vegetable Colours.
 speedily restored on the total evaporation of that ingredient.
 But one remarkable instance of absolute dormancy induced
 by that agent, has occurred to me in the case of the Papaver
 orientale, a flower of a vivid orange colour, bordering on
 scarlet, the colouring matter of which is not extractable other
 wise than by alcohol, and then only in a state so completely
 masked, as to impart no more than a faint yellowish or pinkish
 hue to paper, which it retains when thoroughly dry, and ap
 parently during any length of time without perceptible                                                      in
 crease of tint.      If at any time, however, a drop of weak acid
 be   applied   to paper   prepared with this tincture, a vivid scarlet

  the picture again faded, by very slow degrees, and on January
   2, 1842, was found quite obliterated.     Being then again sub
 jected to the acid vapour, the colour was reproduced.         How
  often this alternation  might  have    gone on   cannot   say, the           I
  specimen having been mislaid or destroyed.          But a portion
  of such paper photographically impressed with a stamped
  pattern, accompanies this communication for the satisfaction
  of any member who may wish to try the experiment. The
 extreme slowness of the action precludes any prismatic ana
  lysis of the process, and it cannot be too often repeated that
 the use of coloured glasses in such inquiries serves only to mis
 lead. Of dormant photographic impressions generally, whether
 slowly developing themselves by lapse of time, or at once re
 vivable by stimuli, as well as of the spontaneous fading and
 disappearance of such impressions, I shall have more to say
 hereafter, having encountered several very curious cases of
 the kind in studying the habitudes of gold, platina, &c.                                                  I
 would here only observe, that a consideration of many such
 phaenomena has led me to regard it as not impossible that the
 retina itself may be photographically impressible by strong
 lights, and that some at least of the phaenomena of visual spec

mental equations are essentially erroneous.    Mr. Earnshaw
and myself have fully confuted his strange attempt to set up
the plea of misprint and mistranscription.
   3rdly. Professor Kelland does not defend his equations in
page 159 of the Cambridge Transactions, vol.                                                  vi.
   4thly. Professor Kelland most unquestionably denies the ex

                  a                 the Edinburgh Transactions, in
vol. xiv. page 396; and neglects taking the normal vibrations
into account       that memoir, which plainly proves how little
                            in
he then understood       the question       of
                                          transversal and normal       of
vibrations.
I    now therefore am entitled confidently        assert the accu                    to
racy       of    all
              my assertions respecting Professor Kelland's                                                    in

V. On   the Foci and Directrices of the Line of the Second
  Order.   By T. S. DAVIES, F.R.S. Lond, and Ed., F.S.A.,
  &c., Royal Military Academy.
     N vol. viii. (pp. 317–21.) of Gergonne's Annales des Mathé
      matiques, M. Bret has proposed a method of discovering
the foci of a conic section, defined by the usual general equa
tion of the second degree between r and y. He adopts as his
definition of the focus, that of Euler: the focus is a point in
the plane of the curve, such that              distance from any point
                                                                     its

                                             the corresponding coordi
nates    ofthe curve. The investigation, however,              not carried                      is
beyond rectangular coordinates, and                  does not solve his         he
resulting equations except for two very simple cases.                Those
equations are certainly,            the eye, very simple; but

expect.      Moreover, the conclusion             draws from his equa   he
tion (that there are four         foci, two real and two imaginary)

 I    did     that lecture give Mr. Daniell

on this point, it is too frivolous.    New batteries, or new phi
losophical experiments of any sort may differ in every parti
cular from old ones and yet be valueless, while on the other
hand a very slight alteration may constitute an important dis
covery. Mr. Daniell's battery varied only in one element from
those previously known.
     Ihave already published my opinions on the principles of
the voltaic battery and need not repeat them, but as it is ne
cessary to be explicit, I will refer to one other point wherein                                            I
differed, and still differ, from Professor Daniell. In the above
mentioned lecture at the London Institution I drew a broad
line (not an imaginary line, but a broad line with chalk on
a black    board) between metallic solutions and highly oxy
genated acids, such as the nitric, chloric, &c.;             still hold to            I
this distinction. Now Professor       Daniell,   in his  long   paper re
cently published containing many experiments on my battery,
interspersed with simple equations, arrives in the last page at
the following conclusion:—“If chloride of platinum were not
too expensive to allow of                     its

ments in reducing the places of the stars, are extremely small,
the greatest, that between Dunnose and Burleigh Moor,
amounting only to 0"'65, while that between Dunnose and
Clifton amounts only to 0"-04.
   In the present volume the amplitudes of the several arcs
are first deduced from the observations of each star separately,
and the most probable mean found by assigning to each
partial result the weight due to the number of observations.
The final results are contained in the following table: and it
is only necessary to remark that the latitudes are obtained by
adding consecutively the amplitudes deduced from the sector
observations to the latitude of Greenwich (51°28'38"3) as
determined by the Astronomer Royal. The former results

40               Mr.  Redfield on the Rotary Action
    Mr. Allen says further, “The progress of the tornado was
nearly in a straight line, following the direction of the wind,
with a velocity of perhaps eight or ten miles per hour. Near as
I  was to the exterior edge of the circle of the tornado,    I felt
no    extraordinary gust  of  wind,  but noticed that the breeze
continued to blow uninterruptedly from the same quarter
from which it prevailed before the tornado occurred.        I also
particularly observed that there was no perceptible increase
of temperature of the air adjacent to the edge of the whirl
wind, which might have caused an ascending current by a
rarefaction of a portion of the atmosphere.”
    Soliciting a careful attention to the observations of Mr.
Allen, who is well known for his intelligence and his habits of
 correct observation, I proceed to give some account of my
 own examinations of the traces of this tornado.
    From a point on the rocky “ledge” north of the turnpike
road and nearly three miles westerly from Providence, to the
house of John Burr on the Cranston road, a distance of about
one and a quarter mile, I found the course of the tornado to
have been S. 86° E. by compass, over a plain country.         The
 magnetic variation being here about 8° westerly, makes the
 true course E. 3° N. From this point to Providence river, a
 distance of about two miles, the course was five degrees more
 northerly.
    I  agree with Dr. Hare that the general effects observed on
 this track were “quite similar” to those of the New Bruns
 wick tornado; and will give such of my sketches, formerly
 prepared, as will best illustrate this similarity and the general
 effects here mentioned.
    The following is a sketch of some of the effects on the farm
 of Mr. Burr: his house is about one mile and a half from the
 Providence bridge.
    The effects here exhibited appear to me to be due to a pro
 gressive whirlwind, revolving to the left; for we may notice,
 as in the New Brunswick tornado, a more onward direction
 in the trees prostrated on the right of the axis, d, m, n, o, &c.,
 than on the left side; while the outermost prostrations on the
 right, n, o, point still more nearly than the average on this
 side, to the course of the tornado: and on the left side of the
 track we have the tree k in a direction inclined several degrees
 backward from the course of the storm. The value of these
 indications of whirling action I have endeavoured to point out
 in my remarks on the New Brunswick case. [Silliman's
 Journal, vol. xli. p. 70–75.]
    At the front of the house a, however, were two slatted door
 yard fences, extending from the house to the road. The

in the contrary direction towards e : both directions being
transverse to the line of the axis, which passes between them.

ward course of the wind in the body of the tornado; or as
indicating two bodies of opposing wind meeting on a central

           near the

blowing against each other and by turning upward to escape,
thus having little effect at this point, within four feet of the
ground. I say nothing here of the possibility of any winds
blowing with violence in such central and opposing directions;
which I could never conceive: for the entire spaces between the
centripetal lines of arrows must be conceived as being filled by
the affluent winds, the lines only indicating their directions.

44.                                       Mr.     Redfield on the Rotary Action
   Explanations of Fig. 3.-The cases of prostration 4 to 14, were from
a line of small, locust-trees on the west border of an old apple orchard,
and are severally shifted a little out of line for the sake of a distinct exhi
bition of their directions.
    From thence to near Tifts' house at b, the ground is but slightly fore
shortened, and the relative positions of each tree, on the left of the centre,
are approximately shown.        The figure was drawn from my field notes on
account of the distinct phaenomena which were exhibited on this part of the
track, and which, in cases a, 14, 22, 21, 23, and 27, show conclusively the
first action of the whirl across the path of the aris, and sweeping towards
the northern border of the track. On the opposite or right side of the axis,
southward of 15, there were no trees exposed, and the effects of the tornado
were here visible only on the crops and fences. Therefore the cases shown
on the figures south of the axis, and also westward of 22 on the left side,
were brought in from the more western parts of the track between the
orchard and the river, and include          the prostrations from the latterall                                                                          to
Tifts' house; and their relative distances from the axis          centre     the                                            or                  of
track are but approximated.

     But on the arrival of the third quadrant, the prostrating
  power on the left side becomes more and more efficient by the
  ceasing of the backward and the accession of the progressive
  movement; and at or near the line offm, it again takes effect
  with rapid increase. The destructive force is also much aug
  mented here by the greater velocity in the heart of the whirl,
 near       axis, and the impetus must rapidly increase

   It will readily be seen that this eccentricity of the axis, on
the visible track, will be in proportion to the progressive velo
city of the tornado; other things being equal. Thus, if Mr.

50               Mr. Redfield     on the Rotary Action
siderations:—1. The ascertained existence of a stratum of un
usually cold air in the higher region of clouds, on some parti
cular days remarkable for the occurrence of numerous thunder
gusts and tornadoes".          2. The observed descent of a portion
of the clouds in front of the nucleus or body of a heavy squall
or tornado, which may sometimes be traced by the eye as low
as the existing limit of condensation will afford opportunity
for observation.       3. The fact noticed by Mr. Allen and others,
that adjacent “to the exterior edge of the circle of the tor
nado” or whirlwind, the previous breeze often continues “to
blow uninterruptedly from the same quarter” as beforet.
4. The last fact, when taken also in connexion with certain
peculiar and striking effects in the outward portions or edge
of the tornado, a knowledge of which I have gathered from
various sources.        5. The coldness of the air which has been
noticed at the edge of a whirlwind.           6. The instant penetration
of the lower end of the whirlwind into thick forests, and into
hollows and ravines, which has been frequently noticed.
7. The direct memorials of downward action in the outward
portions of the whirl which          I  have myself met with on the
tracks of different tornadoes.
     In most of the foregoing remarks it has been my design to
view the tornado as it moves onward, in full action.                   Of the
origin or incipient causes of the whirl, it is not necessary here
to inquire; although some clue to these is perhaps afforded us
in the considerations above noticed.
     Recurring once more to the track of the Providence tor
nado,    I have to state that eastward of Tifts' house the course
of the track soon became S. 65° E. magnetic, for more than
two miles. It then took the course of S. 75° E., and further
onward the tornado passed directly over the house of Solomon
Peck, about four miles from Providence. This house was
partly unroofed ; chimney thrown down; windows broken
inward, as in many other cases; and much other damage was
also done to Mr. Peck’s property.            In passing onward towards.
                                           I
    * This change of upper temperature think can be clearly made out on
the day of the New Brunswick tornado, which was but one of many torna
does and thunder gusts which appeared in this part of the United States on
the same day; and on the preceding day in Illinois and other - western
states.
    In the New Haven Gazette are accounts of five severe tornadoes which
occurred in the states of New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode
 Island, on the afternoon of August 15, 1787.    I can also refer to many more
recent cases of this kind.
    + The observation here quoted is one of many which show the error of
 the very hasty generalization which alleges a circuit or annulus of calm air
 to have been observed on all sides of tornadoes and hurricanes.

      On the track from the Lyon farm           Peck's house there              to
were   many   interesting  memorials which   might  confirm the de
ductions already made.        On some portions       the track, also,                 of

                     Perhydrosulphocyanic Acid.                        53
     Besides this neutral compound, this chemist has formed
 another, by precipitating a solution of the acid with basic ace
 tate of lead.    It is composed of 2 atoms of the neutral salt
 combined with 1 atom of oxide of lead.

 quantities of the perhydrosulphocyanic acid are formed, with
 hydrocyanic acid, formic acid, carbonic acid, sulphuret of
carbon and ammonia; but no sulphuretted hydrogen.                    Sul
phuret of carbon and carbonic acid sometimes are produced
in very small quantities, sometimes not at all.
    3 atoms of hydrosulphocyanic acid are decomposed by
hydrochloric acid into 2 atoms of perhydrosulphocyanic acid
and 1 atom of hydrocyanic acid.              The                     acid
 removes the water necessary        for the existence of the hydro
sulphocyanic acid. The formation of carbonic acid and the
sulphuret of carbon depends on another decomposition:                   1
atom of     hydrosulphocyanic       acid takes 2 atoms of        water,
and forms 1 atom carbonic acid, 1 atom sulphuret of carbon,
and 1 atom of ammonia.          If the solution of sulphocyanide of
potassium be not sufficiently cool nor saturated, this decompo
sition takes place.      The best proportions are 1 part of the
salt and 5 parts water.
    When heated to 150° perhydrosulphocyanic acid begins to
be decomposed, forming sulphuretted hydrogen and hydro
sulphocyanic acid.      When the temperature is raised to 200°,
sulphur, and sulphuret of carbon are given off; if still greater
heat is applied, ammonia is formed and mellon is left.

    The experiments of Parnell” and Bengiesser have been re
peated by Völckel.        When a stream of chlorine is passed
through a concentrated solution of sulphocyanide of potas
sium, the latter being kept cool, there are formed sulphuric
acid, hydrocyanic acid, or cyanogen, and a yellowish red body,
but no carbonic acid nor ammonia.
    This body is insoluble in water, alcohol, and aether. It is
dissolved with difficulty by diluted potash ley; when the mix
ture is heated the solution is easily effected, and is of a deep
red colour. From this solution acids reprecipitate it un
altered.    The analysis made by Völckel of this body agrees

cylindrical base in a socket of corresponding form, and can be
rotated in any given direction when the natural attachments are de
stroyed by decomposition; and he alludes to the skeleton exhibited
in London in 1805, in which the tusks were bent downwards.
    Having, by a series of comparisons of the teeth and bones, which
the author does not conceive it necessary to recount, arrived at the
conclusion that the Missourium is either a Tetracaulodon or [a] Ma
stodon, he next considers the relations in which these supposed di
 stinct genera stood to each other; premising that Mr. Koch's ske
 leton illustrates the osteology of the gigantic Mastodon far more
 completely than has been done by any other collection of North
 American fossils brought to Europe. The genus Tetracaulodon was
founded by Dr. Godman on the lower jaw of a young Proboscidean
 having two tusks projecting from the symphysial extremities.       Mr.
 W. Cooper of New York, however, suggested that the Tetracaulo
 don was nothing but the young of the gigantic Mastodon, and that
 the tusks were lost as the animal became adult.       This opinion has
been also advanced by others, but without being illustrated by any
 analogies; and it has been opposed by Dr. Isaac Hays, in an elabo
 rate memoir on additional specimens, which he states present all
 the proofs necessary for refuting the opinion that Dr. Godman had
 committed the error of describing as a new animal the young of a
 known species; and he observes with respect to Mr. Titian R.
 Peale's suggestion that the lower tusks might be only a sexual di
 stinction, “that it is impossible in the existing state of our know
 ledge, and with our present materials, to confirm or positively refute
 this suggestion.” The most recent opinion on the subject, Mr. Owen
 states, is contained in the last edition of the ‘Ossemens Fossiles,’ in
 which M. Laurillard, after alluding to the opinion that the lower jaws
 with tusks may be immature Mastodons, proceeds to say, “others
 have been led to believe that the lower jaws of every age which have
 tusks belong to a different species of large Mastodon : some charac
ters taken from the form of the jaw would seem to justify that opi
nion.”—Oss. Foss. 8vo. vol.       ii.373, 1836.

only  by immature animals.

  the socket more or less obliterated; and Mr. Owen says that the
  dimensions prove the close similarity in size and proportions between
  the lower jaws of Mastodons with and without the tusks; and
  further that no individuals of the same species could resemble each
  other more closely in the conformation of the molar teeth. In both,
  the inner boundaries of the molar series are parallel, and the inter
 space is of the same breadth: the general form of the ascending
 ramus and the symphysis, the place and size of the great foramina
 for the dental nerves and vessels, are alike. The only differences
 consist in the Tetracaulodon * having larger condyles, and the outer
 side of the horizontal ramus being less convex and prominent; the
 coronoid process also is higher; and the broad canal, which is im
 pressed upon the upper part of the symphysis, is nearly straight, not
 sloping down to the deflected part as in the Mastodon; but the
 breadth of the canal is the same in both, though the symphysial part
 of the jaw is larger and broader in the Tetracaulodon than Mastodon.
 These differences, Mr. Owen observes, may relate to the additional
 motions of the lower jaw, connected with the uses to which the                         in
 cisor may have been put.
     The incisor in full-grown Tetracaulodons or male Mastodons is a
  comparatively small, cylindrical and straight tusk, projecting forwards
  and a little downwards; its circumference is five inches; the length
  of the projecting part of the most entire of three specimens was five
 inches, but an unknown portion had been broken off; the socket was
  three inches in depth, uniformly one and a half inch in diameter,
 and slightly concave at its termination.
     With regard to these incisor teeth and the importance attached to
 them as a generic distinction, Prof. Owen says, it must be remem
 bered that in many species, both of Cetacea and Pachyderms, incisors
 as well as canines vary in relation to the age and sex of the same
 species of animal.     In the male Dugong the upper incisors are pro
 truded, scalpriform, and of unlimited growth, while in the female
 they are concealed, cuspidate, and solid to their base. In both sexes
the lower jaw is provided at          its
                                       deflected extremity with six incisors,
which disappear    in  mature animals, only one           two remnants being
                                                            or
occasionally discoverable        in the cancellous sockets.             many In          of

the molar teeth might impress the more cautious palaeontologist with
a strong suspicion of their generic identity; but the cranium of the
male Narwhal, with its unsymmetrical distortion, increased by an
enormous tusk, would, it can scarcely be doubted, be referred to a
genus of Cetaceans quite distinct from that which the edentulous
 and more symmetrical skull of the female would be considered to
 represent.        -
      In  determining    the real nature of differences in these extinct
 animal remains, Mr. Owen says it is necessary to inquire what other
 modifications are associated with those of the tusks;–are the more
 essential parts of the dental system, as the grinding teeth, alike or
 different in the jaws with tusks and without tusks          Do the jaws
 themselves and the other parts of the skeleton offer the modifications
 of form which usually attend distinction of species        Above all, are
 the same characters presumed to distinguish the genera, present in
 the young as in the adult skulls are there, for example, young
 Mastodons as well as young Tetracaulodons :
      The youngest of five full-grown Tetracaulodons or male Masto
  dons, examined by him, had two molars and half of a third deve
  loped in each ramus; the first or antepenultimate having three trans
  verse ridges, each divided into two tubercles; the second also three
  bicusped ridges; and the third two ridges extricated, and two others
  within the alveolar cavity. In the next jaw in the order of develop
  ment, the third ridge of the last molar was extricated; in the third
  specimen the antepenultimate grinder had been shed, and the last
  molar exhibited the same degree of development; in the fourth jaw
  the ultimate molar was fully extricated, exhibiting four bicuspidate
  ridges and a talon; and the fifth or oldest Tetracaulodon retained
   its penultimate but worn grinders, the two anterior ridges of the last
   molars being a little abraded, and the talon being developed into a
   pair of small tubercles.
       A series of jaws of female Mastodons (Mastodon proper of Dr.
   Godman and Dr. Hays) presented the same order of development.
       Having already shown that the molar teeth are identical in number
   and form in the Mastodon and Tetracaulodon, Mr. Owen proceeds to
   point out their correspondence in the mode and order of succession.
   The lower jaws of both present, moreover, those characters by which
   the Mastodon giganteum is distinguished from the genus Elephas,
   namely, by the higher coronoid, the less-rounded angle, the straight
   inferior margin, the parallel inner alveolar border, and the more pro
   duced symphysial extremity.        They present, besides, equally the
   minor characteristic of the sharp process on the inner side of the
   neck of the condyle, and the ridge continued from the outer side of
   the neck.      Both have an oblong depression on the outside of the
   coronoid    process, but varying in depth in different Tetracaulodons.
    In both the   posterior aperture of the dental canal commences in the
   same   place;   and the inner side of the angle of the jaw is concave,
   and bounded by an irregular margin, indicating the attachment of
    the fascia covering the internal pterygoid muscle, the irregularity
    being stronger in the lower jaws of older individuals.    The relative
    position of the principal anterior outlet of the dental canal is the

position to the teeth as these alter their position in age.
   When the striking modifications by which the lower jaw of the
Elephant differs from that of the Mastodon are considered, it cannot
be supposed, observes Mr. Owen, that no corresponding differences
should be present in the lower jaws of the Mastodon and of an
other genus of Proboscideans characterized by a difference in the
number of the teeth, and he says, he knows of no analogy in the
whole mammalian series that would justify such a belief. Tetra
caulodons are as numerous in Mr. Koch's collection as Mastodons,
yet there are not found in it two forms of humeri, ulnae, radii,
femora or tibiae, only the merest difference of variety being de
tectable;       whilst the femora of the Elephas primigenius associated
with them are at once recognizable by modifications which might
be expected to accompany true generic differences in the rest
of the organization. With the exception of a few bones of the
Elephas primigenius,                    all          proboscidian Pachy

other closely allied.  Thus the teeth which are shadowed forth in
the lower jaw of the Foetal Whale are fully developed in the Cachalot.
The upper rudimentary maxillary teeth which remain hidden in the
gum of the Sperm Whale are functionally developed in the Grampus;
and in like manner in the gigantic Dinotherium, discovered by Dr.
Kaup, is exhibited the full and functional development of the infe
rior rudimental tusks of the Mastodon.
   The molar teeth of the Mastodons offer, Mr. Owen says, a beauti
ful transitional modification connecting the lamellated structure of
the triturating molar with those having simply a transversely-ridged
grinding surface. The interval between the molar teeth of the
Elephant and those of the Tapir is too great to have allowed their
fundamental resemblance   to have been detected in the existing
creation; but a study of the extinct Pachyderms brings to light,
he says, a beautiful series of gradations leading through the ele
phantoid Mastodon of Ava and the gigantic Mastodon of the
Missouri to the Dinotherium, which it may be remembered was the
gigantic Tapir of Cuvier.    Moreover, he adds, the indication of the
singular armature of the lower jaw of the Dinothere might be most
closely discernible in that species of Mastodon which makes the
nearest approach to the Dinothere in the form of the grinding teeth.
   The report from which the above extracts have been taken had been
completed when Mr. Owen received a copy of the notice” of Dr. Hays's
description of Mr. Koch's collection.     After an attentive perusal of
this document, in which the generic distinctness of the Tetracaulo
don is maintained, Mr. Owen has been only more convinced of the
truth of his own theory; he, however, in justice to Dr. Hays, gives
the arguments of that esteemed naturalist.     Dr. Hays considers the
existence of a single tusk in the lower jaw to be only an accidental
occurrence, referring, as examples of two tusks, to the specimen
described by Dr. Godman, and to that belonging to the Museum of
the University of Virginia.    Respecting this statement, Mr. Owen
observes, that the jaw described by Dr. Godman is that of an im
mature individual, retaining on the left side the first small molar,
and therefore affords no proof of the persistence of the two in
ferior tusks in the adult animal, or evidence of the accidental na
ture of the absence of the left tusk in the mature jaw. With regard
to the specimen in the cabinet of the University of Virginia, he
says, that if this belong to a mature animal it would be an unique
specimen, and might be paralleled with cases on record of two
projecting tusks in the male Narwhal, and considered by all na
turalists to be accidental.   Mr. Owen further calls attention to the
figure of the specimen in pl. 27. fig. 2. of the Transactions of the
American Philosophical Society (vol. iv.), where only the right tusk
is represented, the left being merely indicated by a dark spot of cor
responding size, of the nature of which the text is silent.

tusk in the presumed male Mastodon's jaws of corresponding size,
and considered by Dr. Hays to constitute a distinct variety, if not a
new species of Tetracaulodon, Mr. Owen considers it to be the jaw of
a young female Mastodon in which the obliteration       -
                                                              of the tusks had
not been    completed.
    A lower jaw without tusks, considered by Dr. Hays to have been
a  young   Mastodon, but with “the chin slightly broken, so that it is
impossible to determine whether it had the foliated termination so
conspicuous in the adult;” Mr. Owen remarks, that notwithstanding
the prominent end of the symphysial part containing the chief por
tion of the tusk-socket is wanting, yet “two foramina are recognized
at the anterior part of the chin,” and these, he observes, must be
 either portions of the alveoli of the tusks, or the canals of the nerves
and vessels for the tusks in these alveoli.
    Thus, Mr. Owen says in conclusion,                                  all
                                                 the examples which seemed

    the lower jaw, and that the genus Tetracaulodon was characterized

shallow channels worn in the granite in the direction of the current
of water; and the author mentions in particular one, consisting of
forty basin-shaped cavities near the ruins of the pavilion of the sixty
columns at Annagundi (also lat. 15° 14', long. 76° 37'). Below the
anicut of Sanapore, near Bijanugger, where the river bursts through
a natural barrier of granite, the rocks both on the bed and at the
sides are honey-combed ; and still higher up the river, below the
anicut of Wullanapore (lat. 15° 6' N. long. 76° 22' E.), the gneiss
 forming the bed of the river is very greatly eroded, as well as the
 basalt of a dyke. The different effects of water on rocks dependent
on their relative position, the author says, is forcibly illustrated in
 this part of the river. Above the anicut the bed of the Toombud
 dra is slightly inclined, the stream flowing in one smooth and ma
jestic sheet nearly 800 yards in breadth over rocks, the surface of
 which is almost unimpaired, and a Hindu inscription, on which
 the waters have glided upwards of three centuries, retains                     cha                          its

 he admits their cooperation to a certain extent.          The manner in
 which he considers the basins are formed is as follows. The water
 having worn a hole, however small, in the rock, flows into it in a
 circling eddy, and thereby enlarges the sides and bottom in a greater
 ratio than the orifice.    This mode of operation, he says, may be
 demonstrated by throwing a fragment of cork into the current before
 it enters the cavity, and by then watching the gyrations of the cork
 till it escapes over the lip of the basin. During this experiment it
 will be seen, that the centre of the bottom is but little acted upon,
 and that the projections before noticed are consequently left. That
 these cones do not rise to the level of the orifice, Mr. Newbold says,
 is accounted for by the action of the water in the shallow cavities
 being more equally distributed over the whole superficies of the       in
 terior, and from the formation of the projections not commencing
 till the basins have been deepened.
     The cavities are mostly free from sediment, but some contain
 pebbles and sand disposed in a horizontal bed at the bottom, un
 disturbed by the rotatory motion of the water. In all cases in which
 Mr. Newbold noticed earthy matter carried into the basins by the
 current, the weightier pebbles sunk immediately, and either            re
 mained stationary or were but slightly moved ; and the heavier par
 ticles of sand also sunk after making one or two whirls round the
 interior of the basin, while the mud and other light materials passed
 with the upper current over the lip at the opposite side.
     During the dry seasons, when the contents of the basins are gra
 dually evaporated, the carbonic acid contained in the water, acts,
 Mr. Newbold says, upon the rock which frequently possesses a
 temperature of 120°, and softening the interior of the cavity, pre
 pares it for additional erosive effects by the river during the next
 monsoon.
     Besides the river-basins, the author alludes to similar but smaller
 cavities on the surface of rocks at considerable elevations above the
 drainage level of the country, and which result from the action of
 springs or rain-water overflowing from receptacles where it had
collected ; also to other hollows not referable to similar agency, on
the summits of table-lands and isolated mountain-peaks, where no
springs or collections of rain-water have been known to exist. Ca
vities of this description the author has observed on the summit of
limestone mountains in Greece, Sicily, the south of Spain, the op
posite coast of Barbary; on the table summit of the Gebel Ataka
range, on the west coast of the Red Sea, and in the granite rocks
of Mount Sinai; and he refers them to diluvial action.          Lastly, he
refers to a remarkable funnel-shaped cavity at        Malta,  described by
the Hon. Mr.     Frere”,  and ascribed by that author to a rush of water
pouring down the cavity, though there are now no signs whence
such a body of water was derivedf.

           Mr.  J.  Phillips's Three Notices from Mexico.            65
   Three Notices by Mr. J. Phillips, and communicated by J. Taylor,
Esq., Treas. G.S., were then read.
   1. The first of these communications gives an account of the Cave
of Cuernavaca or Cacaguamilpas, thirty-two leagues S.S.W. from
the city of Mexico, or sixteen from the town of Cuernavaca. It is
situated in a range of limestone hills, and is of vast extent.        A
descent of fifty feet conducts from the entrance to the floor of the
cavern, which for some distance is tolerably level, though covered
with the debris of the limestone to a considerable depth ; but the
progress of the visitor is afterwards greatly impeded by huge piles
of rocks apparently fallen from above.      Enormous and fantastic sta
lactites and stalagmites abound on every side. At a spot where the
cavern separates into two great branches, the height was estimated
by means of rockets to exceed 200 feet; and the depth of the left
branch is stated to be at least half a mile; but the right branch had
not been explored.
   With reference to the statement of a writer on Mexico ", that he
did not expect to see many caverns, if any, and that he had met
with very little limestone, Mr. Phillips observes, that besides the
great cavern of Cacaguamilpas, there are several in the district of
El Doctor; and that limestone abounds in various parts of Mexico,
occurring, besides the range of hills noticed above, at Atotomilco el
Grande, north of the city of Mexico; at La Calera, on the road to
Guanaxuato; also near Xeres in the state of Zacatioas, and at Bo
laños in the state of Xalisco.      Fossils are said by the author to be
very rare in Mexico, but he obtained a species of Astraea in the
limestone of El Doctor.
   2. The second notice was on the remains of elephants, and on an
ancient causeway near Mexico.           The waters of the lake having
permanently subsided to some distance from the Hacienda of Cha
pingo, the proprietor commenced a canal to restore the communi
cation.    Twelve feet below the surface an ancient causeway was
discovered, and two or three feet lower the fossil elephant; and other
similar remains are said to have been afterwards obtained.        Hum
boldt, in his ‘Essai Politique,' mentions the discovery of fossil bones
of elephants in cutting the great drainage canal of Mexico; the only
new fact therefore, the author states, which his communication con
tains, is the finding of the causeway,+an indication of difference of
level in former times.
   3. The third notice contained an account of six specimens of
pumice obtained in sinking a well near Perote in Mexico. The
road from Vera Cruz to the city of Mexico traverses an extensive
tract of table-land, 7700 feet above the level of the sea, along the
foot of the mountains which stretch out from the volcano of Orizaba
and the Coffre of Perote.       The water being exceedingly bad and
brackish, a well was sunk to obtain better, at a new inn between
Perote and Santa Gertrudes.        The depth of well was sixty varas,

system rests upon a great development of sandstones and limestones,
called by Prof. Rogers the Appalachian system, and divided by him
into the following nine formations:—
   1. Red and buff-coloured shales and argillaceous sandstones.
   2. Olivaceous shales.
   3. Fossiliferous sandstones.
   4. Argillaceous limestone.
   5. Variegated calcareous shales.
   6. White and yellowish fucoidal sandstones.
   7. Red argillaceous shales, with soft and hard sandstones.
   8. Blue, drab and yellow shales.
   9. Blue limestone.
The aggregate thickness of these deposits is stated to be upwards
of 20,000 feet, and the whole of the formations from the top of
the coal-measures downwards, to constitute one conformable series.
The bottom limestone (No. 9.) has a wide range, extending through
New York to the banks of the St. Lawrence, and it is believed,
on account       of    its   fossil contents,          to   belong    to   the lower Silurian
series.

side of the Alleghanies and eastward of the Susquehanna river pro
duce anthracite, and it was to them that Mr. Logan more particu
larly directed his attention. These detached fields consist of a num
ber of long, narrow, irregular troughs, separated by anticlinal axes
of the quartzose conglomerate or subjacent red shale, and they are
distinguished by the names of the southern, middle and northern
anthracitic coal regions.
    The southern region extends from Mauch Chunk on the Lehigh
river nearly to Petersburgh on the Susquehanna, a distance of 70
miles, but          its
                 greatest breadth does not exceed six.                traversed                 It   is
 by  five anticlinal axes parallel        one another and    to    that which                   to
bounds the trough, the steeper escarpment being              the north side;               on
and the    angle   increases with each successive     ridge,       that      the                 so             at
southern the strata have been elevated beyond the perpendicular
and turned over, exposing beds many thousand feet below the coal
measures.       Pottsville and Mount Carbon are mentioned                 points                           as
where these      phaenomena    are well exhibited.      On   inspecting      the
coal-seams        this neighbourhood, Mr. Logan observed, associated
                    in

70            Geological Society :            Mr. Murchison           on the
ton" to be ten, and the aggregate thickness to be sixty feet.                          The
only one at present worked contains twenty-four feet of clean coal,
and about two hundred and forty tons of fuel are raised daily. Pro
ceeding eastward the dip of the strata becomes more precipitous,
and at New Glasgow, a distance of two miles, is a thick, highly
inclined, very coarse quartzose conglomerate, considered by the
miners to be a dyke, but by Mr. Logan to be a portion of the coal
measures. On Frazer's Mountain, to the east of New Glasgow, are
two workable seams, measuring together about eight feet, and rest
ing, with the interposition of a stigmaria bed, on a deposit con
sisting of non-fossiliferous limestone and sandstone.    Judge Hali
burton has given a detailed section of upwards of 600 feet of the
strata at the Albion mines; and Mr. Logan, in an appendix, gives an
elaborate list of beds, commencing 238 feet below Judge Halibur
ton's section, and extending in a descending series through upwards
of 2500 feet. He is of opinion, that the whole series is susceptible
of being divided into the following groups:—
1. Red and drab-coloured sandstones alternating with
     red and gray shales; a few coal-seams occurring
     chiefly towards the bottom, associated with lime
     stone, and resting on a thick coarse conglomerate.
2. Soft dark-coloured shales, with a few beds of sandstone,
     and richly stored with workable seams of coal and
     ironstone . . . . . . . . . . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 5000 feet.
3. Marine limestone . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .           10 ...
4. Coal-measures, probably unproductive, consisting in
     the upper part of red sandstones and shales, and of
     carbonaceous shales resting on stigmaria fire-clays;
     and in the lower, of red and gray sandstones, with
     a few bands of shale             ......   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  1900 ...
5. Limestone . . . . . . . . . . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - . . . . . . . .      10 ...
     All   the above deposits contain carbonized vegetable remains, but
in the beds next to be noticed they are rare.
6. Soft variegated shales, alternating in the lower part
     with red shales     . . . . . . . . . . . - - - - - - - . . . . . . . . . .   650 feet.
7. Limestone . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    20 ...
  Under every bed of coal which he examined, amounting to more
than twelve, Mr. Logan detected the stigmaria fire-clay ; and he
was informed by Mr. Poole, the superintendent of the Albion mines,
that similar strata occupy the same position in the coal-field- of Cape
Breton Island.
   The limits of the Nova Scotia coal deposits have not been de
fined, and Mr. Logan states that considerable difficulties would
attend an attempt to trace them, in consequence of the overlying
gypsiferous strata.    He believes that the Pictou field extends west
ward across Colchester county to the north side of the Basin of
Mines, and that the seams which dip to the north at Kemptown
and Onslow may belong to          southern side;

 a parallel trough ranges to the southward, from Hawkesbury in
 Cape Breton Island to Windsor, on the south side of the Basin of
 Mines (lat. 44° 49', long. 64° 19 west); and three miles further
 south he also discovered coal-measures, rising with a northwardly
 dip of 45° from below the gypsiferous rocks, and resting on granite.
    Coal is likewise reported to occur at Beaver Lake, south-east of
 the Albion mines, and to be brought down the East River during
the spring floods, attached to floating ice. On the north side of
the valley of the Stewiack, south-west of the Albion mines, coal
 measures rest on a deep bed of limestone which dips to the south.
    The gypsiferous strata, and the associated shales, sandstones, and
fossiliferous limestones, Mr. Logan is of opinion, are not only newer
than the coal-measures, but overlie them unconformably, founding
                                                                                                                                 be its

with the upper diluvial mud of Belgium, France and Germany; not
having anything in common with the latter, and differing from the
loess by the absence of well-preserved freshwater and terrestrial
shells indicating fluviatile or lacustrine origin. The loess, moreover,
is never found on high plateaux; but Mr. Murchison does not dis
sent from the belief that the two deposits may have been produced
at nearly the same epoch. He is therefore induced to consider the
Tchornoi Zem as a submarine formation accumulated gently at the
bottom of a sea undisturbed by any violent current, and beyond the
range of those operations which spread out the northern drift. The
 absence of marine shells, he says, is only a negative objection, and
not to be opposed to the evidence afforded by the widely different
nature of the deposits at considerable levels, far above the drainage
of the country or the action of any body of water which could oc
 cupy the valleys. Lastly, he ascribes the black colour of the earth
 to the state of decomposition of the vegetable matter originally dif
fused through the mud which now forms the fertile Tchornoi Zem
 of Russia.

 WEzoologist,
           are happy in being enabled to state that the distinguished
                    Mr. E. Forbes, has been appointed Curator and Libra
 rian of the Geological Society of London;—Mr. Forbes's name having
 been selected by the Council from a list of nine candidates, several
 of whom preferred very strong scientific claims. The choice of the
 Council was confirmed by an unanimous vote of a Special Meeting of
 the Society, held on the morning of the 14th of December.
     We congratulate our geological friends on having secured the ser
 vices of a naturalist who is qualified by his talents and acquire

       GENTLEMEN,
     Your Number for last month contains a paper by Dr. Apjohn, as
 read at the Royal Irish Academy, “On the force of aqueous va
 pour within the range of atmospheric temperature;” and in Table
  1, which is for the correction of the mercurial column to 32° of
 Fahrenheit, I observe a wide difference in the result from what
  would have been the case from the method I have usually adopted,
  based upon the assertion of General Roy, for the expansion of mer
  cury.
     Perhaps Dr. Apjohn will have the kindness to explain, through
  your pages, his method of making the before-named calculations, and
  thereby confer a great obligation on,
                              Gentlemen, your obedient Servant,

      ACETATE            CONTAINING NINE ATOM'S OF WATER.
                       OF SODA
     M. Anthon obtained during the summer some acetate of soda in
fine acicular crystals, from a solution procured by the double decom
position of acetate of lead and sulphate of soda ; this solution was
rather dilute.    He found, on examining the proportion of water of
crystallization contained in this salt, that it amounted to 49-60 per
cent., and which is much larger than that usually found to exist in
it; the salt in question had been thoroughly dried by exposure to
the air. In converting this proportion of water into atoms, it will
appear that the following is the composition of this acetate:—
            1 atom of soda  . . . . . . . . . . . . 31-3 19:16
            1 atom of acetic acid........           51:0 31-24
            9 atoms of water                         ..........

                                          163-3     100'
There  consequently exists, according to this analysis, an acetate of
soda which contains one and a half time more water of crystalliza
tion than the common acetate, which contains 6 atoms, or 39 per
cent. of water.—Repert. für die Pharm., and Journal de Pharm.,                                                 No

   Many chemists have supposed that arsenious acid dissolves as
readily in dilute nitric acid as in hydrochloric acid, without being
converted into arsenic acid; M. H. Rose, however, states in his ‘Ana
lytic Chemistry,' that “nitric dissolves but a very minute quantity of
arsenious acid without converting                            it,
                                              even when heated, into arsenic
acid; this conversion         effected only

not perfect, neither was nitric oxide given out. The mixture was
afterwards heated           matrass; nitric oxide was then evolved, red
                             in   a
vapour formed, and the solution was readily and perfectly effected.
It must therefore       admitted that one part

ACTION OF SOLUTIONS OF CHLORIDES AND AIR                                          ON   MERCURY.
   We have given in previous Numbers the results of M. Mialhe's
experiments on the action of chlorides on some mercurial compounds,
and he states that he had nearly concluded his experiments when it
occurred to him to try whether mercury itself would not be acted
upon by this class of substances.
   Experiment, he states, confirmed his suspicions, for he found that
the solutions of the alkaline chlorides put into contact with mercury
and atmospheric air always produced bichloride of mercury, the
quantity of which was greater in proportion to the concentration of
the solution of the chloride, and the more perfect state of division of
the metal, but no effect is produced unless oxygen, that of the air
being sufficient, is present.
   1st Experiment.——Mercury treated with the solution of alkaline
chlorides (described in our last Number as the assay liquor), gave by
stove heat 0.4 part of sublimate.
   2nd Erperiment.—The above repeated with the mercury finely
divided by mucilage, yielded 0-7 part of sublimate.
   The researches already detailed sufficiently prove, in the opinion
of M. Mialhe, that the decomposing power of the alkaline chlorides
is great, but they do not teach us anything as to their relative energy.
The following experiments will supply this deficiency.
   Hydrochlorate of Ammonia.-One hundred and twenty parts of
hydrochlorate of ammonia and 30 parts of calomel were placed in an
open bottle containing 1000 parts of distilled water, the temperature
of which was gradually raised to 122°Fahr., and kept at this heat
for half an hour; the sublimate produced amounted to 0-9 of a part.
   The experiment repeated with the following salts gave the an
nexed quantities of sublimate:—-
                     Chloride of Sodium         0-4       part.        of
                                                     ... ...
                                                                        a
                                                                            ...
                                       of of
                     Chloride       Barium      0-4
                     Chloride      Potassium 0.3
It  results from these    experiments     that the hydrochlorate      ammonia           of
is the most    powerful          of
                              these four salts.
     Inconcluding his experiments, M. Mialhe remarks that the reac
tions which         has pointed out take place
                       he                               common temperatures,

produced       in short time, and some occur instantaneously, the greater
part requiring only          few hours' contact for action.

     “We   are therefore led to represent carbonic acid as being formed
of  a molecule of carbon weighing 6, and 2 molecules of oxygen
weighing 16, which constitute a molecule of carbonic acid weighing
22.
   “Carbonic acid then, like water, is represented by the most
simple numbers.
   “Composition of Ammonia.—Lastly, ammonia seems also formed,
in whole numbers, of 3 parts of hydrogen and 14 of azote, which
may be represented by 3 molecules of hydrogen weighing 3, and
 1 molecule of azote weighing 14.
    “Thus, as if better to exhibit her power, nature in organized
substances always acts upon a very small number of elements com
 bined in the most simple proportions.
    “The whole atomic system of the physiologist turns upon these
 four numbers, 1, 6, 7, 8.

                6 that of carbon;

                8 that of oxygen.
Let the chemist always attach these numbers to these names, and
there will no longer exist for him either hydrogen, carbon, azote, or
oxygen in the abstract. These are substances the reality of which
he has always seen; it is of their molecules that he always speaks,
and to him the word hydrogen means a molecule which weighs 1,
the word carbon a molecule which weighs 6, and the word oxygen
a molecule which weighs 8.”—Essai de Statique Chimique des Etres

                    ON SANGUINARINA.                 B.Y.   M. SCHIEL.
    According to M. Dana, sanguinarina is extracted from the root
 of the Sanguinaria Canadensis by treating it with anhydrous alcohol,
 adding water and ammonia to the solution, then washing the red
 precipitate formed with acid, and boiling it in water and animal
 charcoal.   After pouring off the water, the mixture of the base and
 charcoal is to be treated with alcohol, and the solution being evapo
 rated, the base remains in the state of a mass of a pearl-gray colour.
 M. Schiel prefers in preparing this substance the process adopted by
 Probst for that of chelºrythrina, procured from the Chelidonium majus,
 the appearance of which resembles that of the sanguinarina.
    The dried and powdered root is to be treated with aether; the solu
 tion is to be filtered and a current of hydrochloric acid gas is to be
 passed into          This acid occasions the precipitation
                    it.                                               impure of

hydrochlorate of sanguinarina of a magnificent scarlet colour is ob
tained.    This salt, when dissolved in water, yields, on the addition
of ammonia,    pure sanguinarina in white or slightly coloured flocks,
which become a yellow powder by washing and drying.
   Sanguinarina is insipid, occasions violent sneezing, and soon be
comes red in an atmosphere which contains even a small quantity of
acid vapours. It is insoluble in water, very soluble in alcohol and
aether; the alcoholic solution has a very bitter taste, and a mani
festly alkaline reaction.    When heated it fuses, and has the appear
ance of an oil, and when burnt it leaves no residue.                 It neutralizes
acids  perfectly  and forms red salts with          them,  which are very soluble
in water,  and   possess very  decided bitterness.            Chloride of platina
precipitates them of an orange-red colour, and infusion of galls of a
yellowish-red.     Concentrated nitric acid decomposes sanguinarina,

 bable greater accuracy of the whole numbers we may observe, that
 ifwe compare the results of the analysis of 100 parts with that of
 the composition of 100 parts calculated according to the different

82                  Mr. Mossotti           on the Constitution                  of the
of M. Bessel,     ten years and a quarter would scarcely be suffi
 cient for the light from one of the stars which we may suppose
 the nearest, viz. 61 Cygni, to reach us. And, if we consider
 the smallest stars visible to the naked eye as those which are
 placed at an intermediate distance between the nearest and
 the most remote or telescopic stars, we may presume with
 Sir J. Herschel, without fear of departing greatly from the
 truth, that the light from many of them takes some thou
sand years in reaching us; so that, to avail myself of the ex
 pressive style of that writer, when we observe those stars,
when we note their changes, we are reading and writing their
history of a thousand years ago. Yet distant as they may
 seem, these stars do not mark the limits of the universe; they
are only those that constitute our sidereal system.      There are
in the heavens groups of stars and divisible nebulae, which,
                          at all
according to         appearance, form separate sidereal systems.
The distances        which these systems are placed must be                                             as
much greater than those                  of
                               the common stars,      the distances              as
of  these are    greater  than the dimensions        our planetary              of
system. Following out the increasing progression               these                              of
intervals, our imagination fails, and       bewildered     the con
                                                                is                        in

             such            an

                                   to             my discourse.           of                            I
 do  not, however, intend       speak     the remotest sidereal sy

 stems, which are scarcely discoverable            the most powerful       by
telescopes; they are too distant, and         yet we know too littleas
of  them. My lecture will treat          the constitution of    the                            of       si

   It  was the celebrated astronomer Sir W. Herschel who,
 penetrating     with his powerful telescopes, analysed

 points, present the appearance                        of

 so that he was able                to
                           conclude that more than 50,000 stars
had passed over the field        his telescope   of    zone only two          in     a
degrees     breadth during the short space
               in                                  one hour.     Thus        of
was completely verified the conjecture, already put forth                                                       by
 Democritus, that that light was         the greatest part the effect

 one plane. The structure then of the Milky Way which we
 have been considering requires some modification.
   This modification is suggested by an observation of Sir                                                      J.
 Herschel, the son of the above-named, who, inheriting the ge
nius of his father and trained by an excellent scientificeducation,
is now one of the luminaries of British science. This astro
nomer, while residing at the Cape of Good Hope, wrote to
a distinguished Italian mathematician, Commendator Plana,
nearly in the following terms:–                             “A
                                          circumstance, with regard
to the structure of the   Milky   Way,    which forcibly strikes me
every time I observe the heavens during any of these serene
and clear nights, as frequent here in summer as they are in
your lovely Italy, is that the portion of this wonderful zone,
which lies between Sirius and Antares, is perfectly illuminated
by the stars, of which a multitude is visible to the naked eye.
If starting from the centre of this portion we follow            direc                            its
tion with the eye towards the north, the illumination gradually
diminishes until nothing remains but           weak hazy light with     a

Milky Way appears therefore nearer              our solar system than   to

    The third and last point relates to the difficulty which might
 arise from the consideration, that if the ring is of such enor
 mous dimensions, and if the portion of it opposite that in
 which we are placed is so very far from us as we must sup
 pose it to be, how does it happen that the light of that portion
 is not much less than that of the part nearest to us? To                                             ac
 count for this effect, let us suppose the point of the interior
 edge of the ring S, in which the solar system is placed, to be
 the common vertex of two opposite cones of small and equal
 vertical angles (fig. 2), each produced respectively to the outer
edge of the ring. The visual angles under which the two oppo
 site portions of the Milky Way intercepted by the two cones
 will be seen will be equal; that is to say, the two portions will
appear equal: but a much greater number of stars will con
tribute to the illumination of the furthest portion, inasmuch
as the section made by the cone is much greater at that                                               di
stance, whereas a smaller number of stars will contribute to
illuminate the nearest portion.       The greater quantity of stars
giving light will thus compensate to a certain extent for the
greater distance, and the brightness of the Milky Way can
not differ a great deal in                    its
                                 different parts.

   of their exact agreement with experiment in those phaeno
sity
mena which depend upon the change of the algebraic signs, or
upon the equality of intensity of the two kinds of light, or the
evanescence of one of them. In all cases of this nature which
have been examined, I believe the results have been found to be
most satisfactory.     The formula (A) is always positive while
the angle  of incidence changes from zero to 90°: (B) is negative
at first and afterwards positive; vanishing entirely, in exact
accordance with Brewster's law, at the intermediate stage of
i +    i= 90°. All this is shown by the Astronomer Royal in
the  Cambridge     Transactions, vol. iv., in a series of very      in
teresting experiments, to be in perfect agreement with nature.
In the extreme case of i = 90°, Professor Lloyd, in vol. xvii.
of the Irish Transactions, by a very simple and elegant ex
periment, has proved that both (A) and (B) are rigidly exact,
both as to their algebraic signs, and the relative magnitudes of
the vibrations which they represent. In the other extreme case
of i = 0°, I am not aware of any very satisfactory experiment
of a direct nature, not depending on photometry, having been
made. I beg therefore to propose one, which I believe is
perfectly new, and of such a nature as to be free from any ob
scurity or doubt as to the phaenomenon to be observed. It
will be remarked that when i is very nearly 90°, the formulae
(A) and (B) become

   Now these are exactly equal, but of opposite signs, indica
ting that both species of light are reflected with equal inten
sities; but while the phase of that portion whose vibrations
are perpendicular to the plane of reflection is unaffected, the
phase of that portion whose vibrations are in the plane of re
flexion is accelerated or retarded by half an undulation.
Consequently, if right-handed circularly polarized light be         in
cident nearly perpendicularly upon a plane surface of glass,
Fresnel's formulae lead us to expect that the reflected light
will be left-handed circularly polarized, and vice versé.       I

XV.      On the coloured Rings produced by Iodine on Silver,
         with Remarks on the History of Photography.
              By H. F. TALBot, Esq., F.R.S., &c.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magasine and Journal.
        GENTLEMEN,
    your Number for December 1842, you have inserted an in
INteresting account of some experiments by Dr. Waller on co
loured films:—in which account, however, I have noticed with
 some surprise what is there stated to be a new method of
 making coloured rings, like those generally known under the
 name of “Newton's coloured rings,” on many of the metals.
    “In order to procure these coloured rings,” says Dr.
 Waller, “we have but to place a piece of iodine on a well
polished surface of silver or copper, and in a short time we
find around the iodine a series of coloured zones of the various
tints of the spectrum.”        In the next page he adds, “the ac
tion of   light  on the different colours is very interesting; the
most correct way of studying this, is to protect one half of a
system of coloured rings by an opake screen, while the other
half is exposed for a short time to the influence of the solar
rays. The golden zone . . . . . . is converted into a beautiful
green,” &c. &c. &c.
    Now, since the History of Photography will probably be
written some day or other, it is desirable that the different
phaenomena discovered should be ascribed to their first obser
vers, with as much attention to accuracy as possible.
    As this is in most cases the only reward of scientific re
searches, justice requires that it should be scrupulously ad
hered    to, and    if       by
                        accident     mistake occurs
                                           a              ought        it    to   be
speedily rectified.
    Give me leave therefore         state that this method of form
                                       to
ing Newton's rings was first discovered and published              my       by
self; and that      I particularly called attention      the beautiful to
phaenomenon which occurred when the rings were formed                             on
silver, namely, that they were sensitive            light, and when
                                                              to

      Mr. Talbot        on Coloured Rings by Iodine on Silver.                          95
I was  in hopes it had become known to the scientific world;
but as that appears not to be the case, will you allow me to
occupy a page of your Journal with an extract or two from the
above-mentioned report contained in the Athenaeum?
   After alluding to M. Daguerre's process (then just divulged)
of exposing a silver plate to the vapour of iodine, by which it
becomes covered with a stratum of iodide of silver which is
sensitive to light, I stated to the Section that this fact had been
known to me for some time, and that it formed the basis of one
of the most curious of optical phaenomena, which, as it did not
appear to have been observed by M. Daguerre, I would de
scribe to the Meeting.          Place a small particle of iodine, the
size of a pin's head, on a plate of silver, or on a piece of silver
leaf spread on glass. Warm it very gently and you will
shortly see the particle become surrounded with a number of
coloured rings, whose tints resemble those of Newton's rings.
Now, if these coloured rings are brought into the light a most
singular phaenomenon takes place, for the rings prove to be
sensitive to the light, and their colours change, and after the
lapse of a short time their original appearance is quite gone,
and a new set of colours have arisen to occupy their places.
 These new colours are altogether unusual ones; they do not
 resemble anything in Newton's scale, but seem to conform to
 a system of their own.        For instance, the two first colours are,
 deep olive-green, and deep blue inclining to black, which is quite
 unlike the commencement of Newton's scale.               It will be un
 derstood that the outermost          ring  is here accounted the first,
 being due to the thinnest stratum of iodide of silver, furthest
 from the central particle.          The number of rings visible is
 sometimes considerable.          In the centre of all, the silver leaf
 becomes white and semitransparent like ivory.               This white
                                                                          ofits
  spot when heated turns yellow, again recovering              whiteness
  when cold; from which                inferred     consist to  iodide                   of
                                  it
                                  is
  silver in  aperfect state.     The coloured rings seem          consist      to
 of   iodide  ofsilver     various stages
                          in                           of
                                                development.
      They have further singular property, which
                   a                                             follows:
                                                                      is      as
 —It well known that gold leaf transparent, transmitting
        is                                        is

  possessing coloured transparency.           These rings       iodide    of
  silver however possess        it,
                                 being slightly transparent, and trans

  I      then related another experiment,             which in particle   a                  of
   iodine was caused       to
                            diffuse         its
                                         vapour   over   surface a   mer           of
   cury.     Inorder      this,
                         to       acopper-plate was spread over with

96            Mr. Talbot on                   the   History of Photography.
  nitrate of mercury, and then rubbed very bright, and placed in
  a closed box along with a small cup containing iodine.                The
 result was a formation of Newton's rings of the greatest splen
 dour and of a large size. But they did not appear to be in
                sensitive to light.
*::::::he next experiment related was as follows:—If a piece of
 silver leaf is exposed to the vapour of iodine, however uniform
 the tension of the vapour may be, yet it does not combine uni
 formly with the metal, but the combination commences at the
 edge of the leaf and spreads inwards, as is manifested by the
 formation of successive bands of colour parallel to the edge.
 Perhaps this is due to the powerful electrical effect which the
 sharp edges and points of bodies are known to possess, so that
 electricity may be either the cause, or the attending consequence
 of the combination of vapour with a metallic body.
     Again   :-if  a minute particle of iodine is laid on a steel
 plate, it liquefies, forming an iodide of iron, and a dew spreads
 around the central point.           Now, if this dew is examined in a
 good microscope,                its
                             globules are seen not               arranged  to    be
 casually, but         straight lines along the edges
                      in                                       the minute       of
 striae or  scratches which the microscope detects even                 po                     on
 lished surfaces.      This another     is proof how   vapour    attracted           is
 by   sharp edges, for the sides                     of
                                         those striae are such.
     The above extracts from the Athenaeum will think suffi                 I
 ciently show that        was acquainted with the effects
                           I                                         iodine           of

This reasoning, which may be readily extended to motion in
space of three dimensions, justifies the assumption in my last
communication, that V is a function of r when u da -- w d y
 + w dº is an exact differential which may be integrated from
any one point of the fluid to any other; and the conclusion
thence derived also holds good, viz. that in that case the
motion is rectilinear.
    The foregoing reasoning shows that the equations (9.) and
                                                 single variable r,
(10.) are satisfied when t is a function of a
such that r* = (a — a)* + (y                          –

recourse must be had to the        equation  of  continuity.     For

   Before quitting the subject                            I
                                   am desirous of adverting to
the demonstration I gave in the Philosophical Magazine for last
August (S. 3. vol. 21. p. 102.), which Mr. Stokes has objected
to because it takes no account of the curvature of the lines of
motion.    Notwithstanding this omission, the proof is perfectly
valid as far as it goes, and requires to make it complete only
the enunciation of the following principle, which I suppose
will be conceded, viz. that in fluid motion there is no general
relation between the curvature of a surface of displacement
 and the curvature of a line of motion.   This being admitted,

must be satisfied both when the curvature of the surface of
displacement     considered apart from the curvature
                           is                            the                                               of

            of                        considered apart from         is

   2. Does it follow from the arguments I have used that they
ought to be equal?
   3. Do I make an axis of coordinates to coincide with the
direction of transmission ?
     1.    I say it   not follow from any hypothesis that these
                         does
quantities should be equal; nor even that the equations should
assume the form assigned to them at p. 162, unless one of
the axes of coordinates be that of transmission.       This sup                          I
pose my opponents will admit, at least Mr. O'Brien himself
points out the fact, when he says (Phil. Mag. for June, 1842,
p. 485),       “I
             assert that the equations at the foot of p. 162 of the
Transactions of the Camb. Phil. Soc. are essentially erroneous;
they ought to have been in the form,” &c.       He explains him
self afterwards, (Phil.  Mag.   for November,     p. 345, P.S.) by
making me exclude the case (the only one I did not exclude)
in which an axis of coordinates coincides with the direction of
transmission.    Mr. O'Brien then admits (what is quite correct)
that even the form of the equations, to say nothing of the
equality of the quantities themselves, is not a necessary conse
quence of the hypothesis of molecular forces.       I may add that
the true form corresponding with the case supposed by Mr.
O'Brien, will be found in the Transactions of the Camb. Phil.
Soc. p. 331.   Any arguments, then, levelled at the Newtonian
Law   through  the supposed equality of these quantities, fall to
the ground.
   2. But does it follow from the arguments I have used that
they ought to be equal?                         If
                                 it does, no consequences will fol
low, except the obvious one, that I have committed an error
in one proposition.      But this clearly does not follow from my
arguments.     The   quantities are doubtless denoted by the same
letter n; and Cauchy designates them by the same letter s,
almost always. At p. 139 of the Evercices d’Analyse, we find

ness of my equations. Their very form is determined by the
fact that I do.  It has been shown above that they assume an
 essentially different form in the contrary case.
                           I
    At p. 161, say “...we might at once suppose the direction
 of transmission to be the axis of y, and put 8 y for 3 g ; this,
however,           I
               shall not do, as it does not appear necessary, and
it is convenient to retain the symbolp, on other accounts to be
noticed hereafter. The above remarks will be mainly useful
in pointing out to us what are the quantities to be rejected in
our equations of motion.”                               I
                                     refer to this when I say (p. 162)
“bearing in mind the remark above made with respect to p.”
Now       I
          am quite sensible this might have been better and
more    clearly   stated.    But the reason why         did not put the                 I
symbol y for p, or rather why I changed y into g, as I actually
did, was this: I wished to retain a symbol which might be
converted into                  ar,   pleasure; and my readers will

    P.S. Should any of my readers be desirous of seeing a
 proof of the inequality of the three expressions, elsewhere than
 in my own writings, they will find it at p. 301 of the Exercices
 d’Analyse of M. Cauchy. In a paper, part of which is already
 in the hands of the Editor, I have proved that my equations
  give rise, by the most simple process, to M. Cauchy's results.
  This is a sufficient guarantee for their correctness, and a strong
  illustration of the importance of the method which                  have                            I
  adopted.
      P.S. Jan. 4, 1843–The Philosophical Magazine for this
  month, with the united reply of Mr. Earnshaw and Mr.
  O'Brien, has just reached me. The object of the arguments
  in that paper is to show that what I termed a misprint or mis
  transcription, is in reality a mistake.        Now suppose I grant
  them this for the sake of     getting   along,  what do they gain by
 it? Do I thereby “confess that my fundamental equations
  are essentially erroneous” (O'Brien, p. 22)? No such thing.
I    confess no more than this—that there is an error in the
 equations, which error has never been propagated to other
 parts of my writings, and which has been corrected by myself
 in the Philosophical Magazine for May 1837.                   then these               If

trum, read      the French Academy, June 13, 1842, has come into my

hands.            M.
            Becquerel has also used the prism, and with excellent effect,

          of the Solar  Spectrum on the Daguerreotype             Plate.   121
in such inquiries, as a substitute for such analysis, in the pre
sent state of our knowledge of the absorptive powers of such
glasses, serves only to confuse and mislead.                In illustration of
 this proposition      I  need only refer to the statements of Pro
 fessor Moser" as to the action of the green and yellow rays on
 the iodide of silver, in his papers on the process of vision and on
 invisible light; statements which, embodying, at least in inten
 tion, the results of elaborate and no doubt most carefully con
 ducted experiments, are rendered perfectly unintelligible to
 one who has studied the subject with the aid of the prism,
 by his continual (and as it would almost appear systematic)
  substitution of the apparent (or absorptive) colours of glasses
  for the prismatic colours of rays, which he appears to assume
  that such glasses insulate in a state at least approaching to
  purity; an assumption unwarranted by the whole tenor of the
  phaenomena of absorption, and in the case of yellow glasses
  most particularly open to objection, as any one may readily
  satisfy himself by looking through such a glass at a prismatic
  spectrum, and by referring to Art. 103. of my paper “On the
  Chemical Action of the Rays of the Solar Spectrum,” &c.
   (Phil. Trans., 1840), and repeating the experiments there de
  scribed.
      2. Professor Draper's specimen consists of a Daguerreotype
  silver plate, about 3% inches by 3 inches, on which is exhibited
  the impress of the spectrum in the form of a streak 3-3 inches,
   or thereabouts in length, and 0.08 inch in breadth, the edges
   being perfectly rectilinear and sharply defined throughout the
   whole length until within about a third of an inch from either
   termination, where they curve into an elliptic form so as to
   terminate the impression with two very elongated semiellipses,
   which are also very faintly and feebly marked.               This, together
   with the very high proportion of 41 to 1 between the length
   and breadth of the photographic spectrum, sufficiently indi
   cates it to have been formed by a non-achromatic lens,                    in
   clining the surface of the plate forward so as to bring that
   part on which the more refrangible rays fall nearer the lens
   than that which receives the less, thus compensating the short
   ening of the focus for the former rays. And as such (though
   not stated in respect of this individual specimen) appears to
   have been Dr. Draper's usual practice; and as in another of
   his papers he formally recommends it as securing “the great
   advantage of elongating the total length of the spectrum, and
    though he seems to have read with rather cursory attention what had       al
    ready been published on this subject in England.—Note added during the

 therefore increasing the measures” (Phil. Mag., Dec. 1842,
 p. 456.), I cannot help observing, that not only is no real ad
 vantage gained by such elongation, but the very reverse. For,
 in a spectrum formed on a surface so inclined, each of the co
loured solar images, of whose succession it consists, is not only
defective in       individual definition everywhere but

   3. But to return to Dr. Draper's specimen.      The ground
on which it is  projected is dimmed  by the  vapours of mercury
settling on the parts where dispersed light has fallen, so as to
be rendered much less specular, not only than the unattacked
part of the silver surface, but also than the impression of the
spectrum itself, which for the most part yields a much more

 Draper supposes, has been protected from the action of di

  curve, fig. 2, is fully in unison with what I have described
  and figured respecting the action of the spectrum on iodu
  retted papers (Phil. Trans. 1842, Article 214–216). And if

XX.       On the Sustaining Voltaic Battery, in reference to some
     Observations of Professor Daniell in the April Number of
     the Philosophical Magazine, 1842.   By F. W. DE Moley Ns,
     Esq., late M.P. for Kerry, M.A., F.G.S., &c."
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magasine and Journal.
        GENTLEMEN,
DOthemefollowing
         the favour to insert in your forthcoming Number
                 observations on a paragraph in the letter
of Professor Daniell, published in the Philosophical Magazine
for April 1842. Absence from this country prevented my ad
 verting to it before.
     After setting forth the difference between the principles of
 the constant battery and M. Becquerel's voltaic combination,
 Mr. Daniell proceeds:–“But, of course, the principles of the
construction are independent of form and materials, and are
capable of application to flat, square and equal surfaces of the
two metals as well as to concentric arrangements. They admit
also of the employment of different metals and of different
electrolytes. They are not changed by placing the zinc on the
outside instead of the inside of the copper, nor even by altering
the name of the constant battery to that of the sustaining bat
tery.” Now, as the designation “Sustaining” was given by me
to my battery, upon         introductionits   1836, and distinguishes
                                                                in
    fully             the term “Constant” does Prof. Daniell's;
               it as
it          much                 as
and       asmight                 be
                        inferred from the above extract that the
principles             of
                the two batteries are not only identical, but that
the “Sustaining             mere modification
                                 ”    is a           the “Constant,”          of
I  feel myself called upon         protest      the strongest manner
                                               to                   in
against the correctness         such          of
                                        conclusion.       a
     It   incorrect, because, assuming Prof. Daniell
          is                                                      have                          to
truly stated his own principles, there            not one principle  is                                    in
my combination similar           his, and this difference
                                              to             principle                    in
is  supported               by
                  the very wide difference        construction.    few   in                         A
sentences will show the distinction.

 *    The publication             of
                         this letter                is   urged upon      us   by   the author   as   an   act

                         it                          in   us to refuse.
   W. De Moleyns alleges that we “have published papers containing in
jurious remarks and insinuations,” and that “it becomes point      justice            a         of
to  afford him     opportunity

which would be drawn were he to remain silent”. Ed.                      –

mity    of the two       metals, as well as      of the preservation of the
same proximity during action, and which cannot be made
by any straining, to involve the principle of central forces
as explained by Prof. Daniell +.
   2ndly. My battery is not founded upon the principle of
equal action being produced from a minute as from a large
surface of the active metal, so long as the inactive metal re
mains unchanged i, but upon the contrary principle of pre
senting an active surface, at least one-fourth of the inactive, less
than that being found to diminish the action.
    3rdly. I do not advocate the use of acidulated solutions, or
of amalgamation of the active metal; on the contrary, I sup
port the principle of obviating local action, and of preventing
injurious combinations, by employment of a solution of chlor
hydrate of ammonia (par earcellence) in contact with the ac
tive metal.
    4thly. I do not assert one of my principles to be that of
“perfectly preventing the mixture of the liquids on the opposite
sides of the diaphragm employed f ; ” on the contrary, I en
courage mixture to a certain extent, for it unquestionably
promotes electrolysis.
    5thly. I did not adopt a diaphragm “in order to prevent a
deposition of active metal on the conducting surface           inas        5,”
much      as
           I  used not one fluid, but two,                 to
                                                  which latter case
that principle does not apply. One               of
                                            my reasons for using                   a
diaphragm was          prevent the too intimate mixture
                         to                                      the         of
fluids  employed.

                 THE1. Postscript to a paper “On the Action of the Rays
of the Solar Spectrum on Vegetable Colours.”     By Sir John Frede
rick William Herschel, Bart., F.R.S., &c.
   An account is here given of some additional facts illustrative of
the singular properties of iron as a photographic ingredient, and also
of some highly interesting photographic processes dependent on
those properties, which the favourable weather of the summer has
enabled him to discover.    The author also describes a better method
of fixing the picture, in the process which          he has denominated the
Chrysotype, than that which he had specified in the latter part of
his paper.     In this new method the hydriodate is substituted for the
hydrobromate of potass; and the author finds it perfectly effectual;
pictures fixed by it not having suffered in the smallest degree, either
from long exposure to sunshine or from keeping.
   He next considers the class of processes in which cyanogen, in                                                            its
combinations with iron, performs            leading part, and    a      which the                           in
resulting pictures are blue; processes which                  designates       the           he                         by
generic term Cyanotype.         Their varieties appear              innumerable,              to       be
but one      particularly noticed, namely, that
                is                                         simply passing over          of

common yellow ferrocyanate             potass.    As soon  of       the liquid                     as                        is

     A letter was also read from Sir John F. W. Herschel on the sub
ject of Photography, addressed to S. Hunter Christie, Esq., Sec. R.S.
     November 24.—The following papers were read, viz.       –
     1. “On certain improvements    on Photographic Processes described
 in a former communication.”       By Sir John Frederick William Her
 schel, Bart, K.H., F.R.S., &c., in a letter to Samuel Hunter Christie,
 Esq., Sec. R.S. Communicated by Mr. Christie.
     The present memoir, which is a sequel to the last by the same
 author, is accompanied by a series of photographic impressions illus
 trative of the chrysotype, cyanotype, and other processes formerly
 described by him.        Some improvements which he has introduced
 into these processes are given, together with a few remarks on some
 other points treated of in the former paper, in relation to the influ
 ence of thermic rays as distinct from calorific rays; the former being
 rays, which in the spectrum accompany the red and orange rays,
 which are also copiously emitted by heated bodies short of redness,
 and which are distinguished from those of light by being invisible.
 The author thinks they may be regarded as bearing the same rela
 tion to the calorific spectrum which the photographic rays do to the
 luminous one, and would propose to designate them by the term
 parathermic rays.       He conceives that these may be the rays which
 arc active in producing those singular molecular affections determi
 ning the precipitation of vapours in the experiments of Messrs.
 Draper, Moser, and Hunt, and which will probably lead to import
 ant discoveries as to the intimate nature of those forces, resident on
 the surfaces of bodies, to which M. Dutrochet has given the name
  of epipolic forces.
     2. “Boring Register, Bow Island, South Pacific.”          By Captain
  Edward    Belcher,   R.N., communicated    by  Captain  Beaufort,  R.N.,
 F.R.S.
     The results of   the boring operations carried on in this island are
  here given, as well as the register of the daily proceedings, under the
  particular superintendence of Mr. Thomas Pass, acting master of
  II.M.S. Sulphur. The depth reached was 45 fect, when the auger
  broke, and no further progress could be made.
     November 30.—Anniversary Meeting.—The President addressed
  the meeting as follows:–
        GENT LEMEN,
  I Must commence my address to you by the expression of my re
  gret that my absence from England at this period of the last year
  prevented my being then able to meet you at your Anniversary.
  The gratitude which it has behoved me to intimate to my Council
  on former occasions for their assistance in the discharge of my pre
  sidential duties, it is more than ever necessary for me now to feel, as
  it was that assistance that rendered my absence no real     - detriment
  to the Society.
     During that absence, an event took place to which I am bound to
  refer-I allude to the visit to this city of the sovereign of another
  country at the time of the auspicious baptism of His Royal High
  ness the Prince of Wales.       His Prussian Majesty was pleased to

                               Royal Society.                          137
join our Society.       At this I heartily rejoice, as I believe it to be a
 happy omen for mankind when those who are placed in exalted
 situations show their sympathy with scientific pursuits.         I congra
 tulate the Prussian nation, that her sovereign has taken so early an
 opportunity of countenancing science, and of declaring his opinion
 that the natural philosopher is a friend to good government, to
 order, and to civilization.                          -
      The pleasure experienced by you on this occasion was enhanced
 by the presence within these walls of Baron Humboldt, who ac
 companied his Majesty. It is very seldom that we can expect to
  see among us any of our Foreign Associates. It was therefore doubly
  gratifying to receive, together with his sovereign, the distinguished
  philosopher who had travelled over so large a portion of the globe
  in the pursuit of every branch of knowledge.
      Since I last addressed you, two years ago, a great degree of suc
  cess has attended the expedition of Captain Ross to the Antarctic
  Region.     I congratulate you, Gentlemen, on the results already de
  rived from an expedition which originated in a joint application to
  Government from your Council and the British Association.            I re
 joice that a British officer has had the honour, not only of making
  most important scientific researches, but also of approaching much
  nearer to the Southern Pole than any one had done before him, and
  of discovering a new Iceland and a new Hecla, more gigantic than
  the arctic volcano.
      With respect to the magnetic observatories,      I have the gratifica
  tion of informing you that they are to be continued for three more
  years, in hopes of making the information to be obtained from them
  more extensive and more accurate.          The consent to this continu
  ance was granted by Sir Robert Peel: a continuance of the scien
  tific measure of one minister by the statesman who had superseded
   and succeeded him. This is a gratifying circumstance, as proving
   that, as we hope and believe that British patriotism belongs to all
   parties, so the love of science also belongs to all, or rather that in
   scientific pursuits there is no party feeling and no party jealousy.
    I must add, that on the present occasion, the application of the
   Council of the Royal Society was seconded by M. Brunow, the am
   bassador of the Emperor of Russia; thus showing that nations are
   ready to testify that any great acquisition of physical knowledge is
   a common object to the whole human race.
       The hopes that the Expedition to the Niger might be productive
   of important additions to our stores of science, as well as great re
   sults to the highest interests of humanity, have been unhappily in a
   great measure disappointed.        At the same time the hopes of the
   scientific naturalist have not been entirely vain, for I am informed
    by Mr. Gray that many new species of birds and other animals have
    been brought to England from Fernando Po and the mouth of the
    Niger.
       Your Council, Gentlemen, have taken into their consideration the
    great importance    that microscopical researches have always pos
    sessed, and the   still greater influence upon science that they are

 138                                          Royal Society.
now beginning to exercise, in the hands of Mr. Owen and others,
as well as the extraordinary perfection to which the instrument itself
is now brought. They have come to the conclusion that it is highly
expedient that we should ourselves possess the means of repeating
and verifying the experiments brought before our notice, as well as
instituting new branches of inquiry. We have therefore thought it
expedient, by summoning competition to our aid, to endeavour to
obtain one of the best microscopes that can be constructed. Indeed
we feel sure, that, independently of the liberal price that we have
offered, there is no optician who would not feel highly gratified on
seeing within these walls an instrument constructed by him.
   The room, Gentlemen, in which we are met, has had some changes
made in the pictures which adorn       walls.               its
                                                  consequence      these        In                        of

                         that most intricate part       the human organiza      of

    SIR CHARLEs BELL, K.H., F.R.S.                and E., &c., the youngest
                                                                    L.
son  of  the Rev. W. Bell,                   of
                                   the episcopal church        Scotland, was              of

                              Royal Society.                      139
born at Edinburgh in the year 1778. While a mere youth, he was
instructed in the elements of anatomical science by his brother Mr.
John Bell (himself a distinguished surgeon and anatomist), and at
a very early period he published the first part of “Plates of Dissec
tions; " a work alike remarkable for the fidelity of the anatomical
details, and the spirited style of the illustrations from the pencil of
the author.
   In 1799, Mr. Charles Bell was admitted a member of the Royal
College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and soon afterwards was ap
pointed one of the surgeons of the Royal Infirmary in that city,
where he acquired a high reputation as a skilful and dexterous
operator.
   In 1806, he removed to London; and by his own unaided exer
tions, established himself as a lecturer on Anatomy and Surgery.
He was subsequently associated with Mr. Wilson in the celebrated.
anatomical school of Great Windmill Street, and speedily became
one of the most popular and effective lecturers in the surgical
schools of London ; although at that period, Cline, Cooper, Aber
methy, and other eminent men, were in the zenith of their fame as
professional teachers.
   He was elected Surgeon to the Middlesex Hospital in 1812.
   A few years afterwards he was appointed Professor of Anatomy
and Surgery to the Royal College of Surgeons of London, in which
capacity he delivered a series of lectures, which excited in an extra
ordinary degree the interest and attention of the profession, the
theatre of the College being crowded to the conclusion of the course.
   Immediately after the battle of Waterloo, Mr. Charles Bell, with
that humanity and zeal for the pursuit of professional knowledge
which marked his character, proceeded to Brussels, and tendered
his assistance to the wounded soldiers in the hospitals of that city;
and after his arrival he was incessantly engaged for three successive
days and nights in the operations and dressings of upwards of 300
Cases.
  In 1826,   Mr. Charles Bell was admitted a Fellow of the Royal
Society.
  On the institution of the London University College, in 1828, Mr.
Charles Bell was chosen Principal of the Medical School; and he
delivered the opening lecture in that department of the College, and
also a course of lectures on Physiology.
   On the accession of William IV. to the throne, Mr. Charles
Bell, together with a limited number of other men of distinguished
scientific attainments, received the honour of knighthood.
    A “Treatise on Animal Mechanics," composed by Sir Charles
Bell for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, being
the substance of some of the lectures which he had delivered before
the College of Surgeons, contained so powerful and lucid an expo
sition of the proofs of creative design, as exemplified in the struc
ture of the human frame, that our late President, Mr. Davies Gilbert,
was led to select the author as one of the Bridgewater Essayists. “An
Essay on the Hand,      its mechanism and      its
                                                 vital endowments    as

140                                   Royal Society.
evincing   design,” is the title of the admirable volume which Sir
Charles  Bell, in accordance with the provisions of the appointment,
contributed to those celebrated essays.
   Sir Charles Bell, in conjunction with Lord Chancellor Brougham,
also published “Illustrations of Dr. Paley's Evidences of Natural
Theology.”
   In 1836,   he accepted the             Chair of Surgery in the University                   of
Edinburgh, to which             he was invited by the unsolicited                     and   unani
mous vote of the patrons of that institution; and he left London to
place himself at the head of the profession in his native city.                  In
this new sphere of usefulness he continued to pursue with undimi
 nished ardour the cultivation of surgery and physiology until his
 death, which took place on the 29th of April, 1842, at Hallow Park,
 in Worcestershire.
- With this brief sketch of the professional career of Sir Charles
 Bell, I proceed to notice those original and important investigations
into the nature and functions of the nervous system, upon which
his high reputation as a physiologist is based, which entitle him to
be ranked among the most distinguished Fellows of this Society, and
 for which he was deservedly awarded the first Royal Medal we had
 to bestow.
    The earliest contribution of Sir Charles Bell to our Transactions
was in 1821, “On the Nerves, giving an account of some experi
 ments on their structure and functions, which lead to a new ar
 rangement of the system.” This was followed by other essays on
the same subject, which were severally published in the Philoso
phical Transactions for 1822, 1823, 1826, 1829, 1832, 1834, 1835,
 and 1840.
    In the last communication, entitled “On the Nervous System,”
the author gives a condensed view of his investigations and disco
veries, the result of more than thirty years of indefatigable labour
and research.
    As long since as 1806, in the first edition of his beautiful work
“On the Anatomy of Expression in Painting,” we perceive the
germ of those original views of the nervous system, which it was
the labour of his life to elucidate and establish.          “If,” he observes,
“we had but a       perfect    knowledge   of the functions of the nerves,
                   all
                                                                           I of
they would on         occasions inform          us   of
                                                  the cause        those actions
which now appear           to    inexplicable.”
                                us   so             And here       may observe,
that the   drawings    which illustrate this work are         the first style
                                                                    in                          of

   In  1811,  in  asmall work entitled “An Idea                 of

Bell, F.R.S.E,"       distinctly enunciates those original opinions, which,
                      he
modified and extended            by
                                subsequent investigations and discoveries,
have led     to those  enlarged    and philosophical views            the pheno
                                                                             of
mena    of the nervous system, which have             largely contributed
                                                          so                                    to
the advancement        ofphysiological science.
   In  short, whatever we may owe           the genius and labours
                                              to                             other         of

                             Royal Society.                              141
men in this field of research, the discovery of the grand fundamental
principle upon which a correct knowledge of the functions of the
nervous system depends, is unquestionably due to Sir Charles Bell.
He was the first to ascertain, not by accident, but by careful and
laborious dissections and experiments, and by a cautious induction
from the phenomena which his talents and unwearying industry              en
abled him to develope, that “the nerves which we trace in the body
are not single nerves possessing different powers, but are bundles
of different nerves whose filaments are enclosed in one common
sheath, but which are as distinct in function as they are in origin;
that they depend for their specific attributes on the nervous masses
to which they are severally attached; that the spinal nerves arising
 from the lateral and anterior columns of the medulla spinalis convey
 the power of motion, while the nerves arising from the posterior
 strands communicate the faculty of sensation to the several parts of
 the body to which they are distributed.”         The nerves which arise
from the middle and upper columns of the spinal marrow, Sir
 Charles conceived to be designed for the act of respiration; and
 these he termed the “system of respiratory nerves.”
    Having thus established the principle by anatomy and experi
ment, that the nerves possess distinct functions in correspondence
with their origin from different parts of the brain and spinal mar
row, Sir Charles Bell followed up his inquiries by collecting such
pathological facts as served to illustrate and confirm the opinions
he had advanced; and our Transactions are enriched by numerous
memoirs relating to this most important subject. His essays on the
nerves of the face in health and disease are of the deepest interest,
and their practical value cannot be too highly estimated. In fact,
the great advancement which has been made of late years in our
knowledge of the nature and treatment of the diseases of the nervous
system, is mainly attributable to the labours and discoveries of Sir
Charles Bell*.

     In private life this eminent man was distinguished by the suavity
and simplicity     of his manners, by his elegant tastes, and domestic
virtues *.
    Mr. JAMEs Ivory was the son of Mr. James Ivory, watchmaker
 in Dundee, and was born in that town in the year 1765. He re
 ceived his elementary education at the public schools of Dundee,
 and in the year 1779, was sent to the University of St. Andrews,
 where, in the period of four years, he went through a course of
 Languages, Science and Philosophy, entitling him to the Degree of
 Master of Arts, which was afterwards conferred on him. While at
 this University he was distinguished for his attainments in Mathe
 matics, to the study of which branch of science he had, even at this
 early period of his life, particularly applied himself, under the able
 instruction of the Rev. John West, at that time assistant to the Pro
 fessor in the University.         It reflects equal credit upon the pupil
 and the instructor, that for this gentleman Mr. Ivory ever after en
 tertained the highest regard.
    Being intended for the Church of Scotland, he now commenced
 his studies in theology, and in the prosecution of them remained
 two years at St. Andrews, after the completion of his course of Phi
 losophy.     He then removed to the University of Edinburgh; and it
 is not a little remarkable that he should have done so with Leslie,
 who had been his fellow-student at St. Andrews.               At Edinburgh, he
 received his third year's theological instruction, necessary, by the
 regulations of the Scottish church, to qualify him for admission as
 a clergyman. His studies in divinity were not, however, prosecuted
 farther; for immediately on leaving the University of Edinburgh,
 he was, in 1786, appointed assistant-teacher in an academy then
 instituted in his native town of Dundee, for the purpose of instruc
 tion in mathematics and natural philosophy.              Having remained in
 this situation three    years,  he entered   upon   a  totally  different career,
 becoming a partner in, and the manager of a Flax-spinning Com
 pany, which had        its
                          mills    Douglastown

The solution of the more difficult case had been reduced                     form                                to  a

nearly equivalent to this by Laplace, but his process was trouble
some; that by Mr. Ivory is remarkably simple and elegant.                                                Al
though this transformation constitutes the most valuable part of the
paper, it would be wrong to omit to state that the developments
which it contains, on the investigation of the attraction in the
simpler case, are highly ingenious, and exhibit a perfect command
of analysis.
   The second subject is the criticism upon the method used by La
place in the third book of the ‘Mécanique Céleste,' for the compu
tation of the attraction of spheroids of any form differing little from
spheres, and the substitution of a method purely analytical for some
of Laplace's operations which are founded on a geometrical consi
deration.    The papers which contain Mr. Ivory's remarks on these
subjects are two papers and an appendix in the volume for 1812,
and one in that for 1822. The remarks on Laplace's theory ad
verted to two points. One of these was the faultiness of his reason
ing as relates to the evanescence of the attraction of the particles
included between the spheroidal and a spherical surface when the
attracted particle was brought very near to the surface.         The other
was a limitation of the generality of Laplace's assumption for the
form of the function expressing the distance between the sphere and
the spheroid, to a rational function of the coordinates of each point.
With regard to the first of these subjects, it seems impossible to deny
that Laplace had, in the greater part of his investigation, left the
interpretation of his suppositions in some obscurity; and Mr. Ivory
has, with remarkable acuteness and analytical skill, exposed the de
fects of Laplace's investigation on his interpretation of the suppo
sitions.    Yet we must observe that the limitation expressed by La
place (“supposons de plus que la sphère touche le sphéroide, &c.")
appears to be entirely overlooked by Mr. Ivory, and that this limi
tation, when       effects are fairly examined, completely removes the
                    its
                                                                                                          by

 not explicitly rational, admits                    of

 no ordinary share of profound mathematical knowledge, and no
 common degree of industry and sagacity in the application of it."
     The investigations to which we have just alluded are those upon
 which Mr. Ivory's European reputation as a consummate mathema
 tician was principally founded; and deservedly so. It is no small
 praise, even at the present time, to assert of any mathematician, that
 he thoroughly understands the remarkable investigations of Laplace
 applying to the attractions of spheroids; and it would be still greater
 to assert that he is able to substitute a new, clear, and elegant pro
 cess, in place of one portion which seems doubtful and indirect.              But
 at the time when these papers were written (1808 and 1811) the
 merit was vastly greater than it would be now.                Very few English
 mathematicians could then read with ease an investigation written
 in the notation of the differential calculus; scarcely any could un
 derstand a process of partial differentials; and probably not another
 person in the kingdom besides Mr. Ivory had read that part of the
 Mécanique Céleste. In acknowledging that Mr. Ivory most justly
 earned the reputation which he acquired (and our remarks above,
 detracting from the necessity of his criticism, do not in the least
 detract from    its   singular skill and command                       of
                                                               mathematics), we

time offer great facilities for mathematical treatment. The whole

from his mother, who was the daughter of Viscount Mayo. He
died at Kew on the 10th of January of the present year, having
nearly completed his 81st year.               His name appears among the
original members of the Linnean Society, and for nearly fifty years
he was one of its Vice-Presidents.             He became a Fellow of the
Royal Society in 1791, and consequently had belonged to it for
more than half a century.          He was an eminent botanist, and formed
a very extensive herbarium, and was at               times anxious    all  give in                 to

thence he received orders to return home with his own despatches,
and was received most cordially in England.       His travels were now
published, and met a most hearty welcome.       They were immediately
 translated into the French and German languages, the best proof of
their merit and importance being appreciated in other countries be
sides his own.     He was warmly welcomed by the Royal Asiatic
 Society; and the French and English Geographical Societies be
 stowed on him their respective medals.
    He enriched the national collection of the British Museum by
 presenting it with a collection of oriental coins.
    After staying a year and a half in Europe, he returned to the East,
and on his second arrival in India, he was sent on a mission to
Hydrabad, which was entirely successful." The next, and unfortu
 nately the last public duty in which he was employed was in a
mission to Cabul, where those political events occurred which oc
casioned his falling a victim in his country's service at the early
 age of 36.
    Such is a brief statement of the very active life of a man endowed
by nature with an extraordinary variety of powers. Personally
active and enterprising, he united to the qualities of the accom
plished soldier and statesman those of the philologist and philoso
pher.    What might we not have hoped from such a man, if Provi
dence had seen right to prolong his days'
    Sir Alexander was of a lively and playful disposition, and most
amiable in private life.    He was one of the best of sons and kindest
 of brothers.
    GEORGE FitzcLARENCE, EARL of MUNSTER, was born January
29, 1794.     He entered the army at an early age, and served in the
Peninsular war. He afterwards went to India, where he assiduously
and successfully studied the Sanscrit, Arabic, and Persian languages.
In 1818 he was entrusted with despatches announcing the conclusion
of the Mahratta war; he seized the opportunity of acquiring and
imparting additional knowledge, and travelled home by an overland
 route, publishing an account of his journey.       He was created Earl
of Munster soon after the accession of his late Majesty, William the
 Fourth.
    Shortly after his return from India, he was elected a Vice-Presi
 dent of the Asiatic Society, and by his personal exertions procured
 much valuable information on oriental geography and statistics, and
 on the natural productions of India.     He subsequently took a very
 active part in promoting the Oriental Translation Fund, and also the
 Society for the publication of Oriental Texts, and the Association
 formed for the purpose of increasing our knowledge of the countries
 south of Egypt.     For the last fourteen years, he devoted great la
bour to the collection of materials for the compilation of a military
history, and history of the civilization of the Mahommedan nations.
 Of this elaborate and important work, which was nearly completed,
a long and interesting account is given in the Asiatic Journal.      It
is to be hoped that the friends of Lord Munster will not allow these
labours to have been performed in vain.

   It is needless for me to add what a severe loss his lordship's death
must be to those who are interested in oriental pursuits, and indeed
to his country itself, when we reflect on the large empire held by
 England in the eastern regions of the globe.                           -
   Lord Munster married Miss Wyndham in 1819, and has left a
family to lament his death.         He was elected President of the Asiatic
 Society only a short time before his decease.
   John YELLoLY, M.D., was born in 1773, at Alnwick in Nor
thumberland, and received his early education at a school in that
town.    He chose medicine as his profession; and at the age of 20,
went to Edinburgh, and after going through the usual course of
study in      its
                University, graduated there          1796. Four years after

In this paper he gives an account of the structure and chemical com
position of 330 calculi, which had either been purposely divided or
accidentally broken in their extraction.          The results are arranged in
tables, exhibiting, in the order of their superposition from the centre,
the consecutive deposits of which each calculus is composed. It ap
pears from these tables, that not less than two-thirds of                 urinary                        all

their passage through a double-refracting crystal; and thus that the
forms of the rings, or isochromatic curves, which had previously been
deduced only by approximate methods, may be determined generally.
   The next paper of Professor MacCullagh is that “On the Double
Refraction of Quartz”;" a subject which had engaged the attention,
successively, of Biot, Fresnel, and Airy. The first of these writers
had determined experimentally the laws of rotatory polarization,
which take place when a ray is transmitted along the axis of rock
crystal; and the second had shown that these laws were explained
by the interference of two circularly polarized rays, which are trans
mitted along the awis with different velocities.  The next step in this
curious subject was made by Mr. Airy, who examined the peculiar
phenomena of refraction by quartz in other directions, and showed
that they were accounted for by the supposition of two elliptically
polarized rays, the ratio of the axes of these elliptical vibrations va
rying with the inclination of the rays to the axis of the crystal.
Lastly, Professor MacCullagh has shown that both the circular po
larization of the rays in the axis, and the elliptical polarization of the

dia were apparently unconnected with those which govern the pro
pagation of light in the same medium.   It remained to connect these
laws as parts of one and the same system, and to trace the hypothe
tical principles upon which each theory was based, up to some higher
mechanical principle.      This crowning point of the theory has been
attained by Professor MacCullagh *.        Employing the general pro
cesses of analytical mechanics, as laid down by Lagranget, and                                                           li
miting the general theorems solely by the conditions that the density
of the aether is constant, and that the vibrations are transversal, he
has succeeded in deducing, as parts of one and the same general
theory, not only the laws of propagation in the same medium, pre
viously discovered by Fresnel, but also the laws of reflexion which
take place at the bounding surface of any two media, already disco
vered by himself and M. Newmann.          The same theory has likewise
led to the demonstration of those   physical principles, which had been
assumed in the former     paper.  It has shown that the vis viva is ne
cessarily preserved, in the passage of light from one medium into
another; that the resultants of the vibrations are the same in the two
media ; and finally, that the vibrations themselves are parallel to the
plane of polarization.
   This seems to be the most advanced point to which the physical
theory of light, in              its
                       present form,   capable    being pushed and

leviation of agony, and the prolongation of human life. Gentlemen of
your own valuable profession have given their testimony to the import
ance of your discoveries, and the Council feels pleasure in rewarding

mencing January 1831, is 29-564 inches.        With the exception of
yesterday, the lowest height of the barometer during the time which
has elapsed since I commenced keeping a register, was 28:04 inches:
it occurred at 6 P.M. on the 13th of November 1840.
   The weather in the early part of yesterday, and till evening, was
similar to what it had been for several days previously; a little snow,
hail and rain falling at intervals. The wind was rather south of
west, but not strong, till about 7 P.M., when it began to blow
strongly, and during the night and till daybreak this morning was
very boisterous; it then began to abate, and by 9 A.M. was not un
usually strong.
   The temperature here yesterday ranged from 35° to 36°; today
it has ranged from 34° to 30°: at half-past 10 on the night of the
12th instant it was 27°, and the height of the barometer at that
time was 28:70 inches. Today the height of the barometer has
been at 8 A.M. 28'58 inches; at half-past 12 P.M. 28'54 inches, and
at half-past 10 at night 28'57 inches; the weather similar to that of
the several previous days.

XXIII.      On the rapid DetithonisingPower of certain Gases and
    Vapours, and on an instantaneous means of producing Spec
    tral appearances. By John W. DRAPER, M.D., Professor of
    Chemistry in the University of New York”.
     some time after I was acquainted with the phaenomena
FOR
  mentioned in the last paper communicated in this Journal,f
and there referred to radiation, I was led to attribute them to
a peculiar property which certain gases and vapours possess,
of which I propose now to give a detailed description.
    This property is a power of effecting a very rapid detitho
nization of surfaces that have been powerfully tithonized.
    It affords the means of instantly procuring spectral appear
ances of external forms.
    Referring now, in the first place, to the analogies of caloric: a
body which has been warmed cools down to a temperature that
is in equilibrium with that of objects around in several different
ways, by radiation, by currents in the air, and often by direct
conduction, each of these tending to produce the same result.
    A sensitive surface, which has been disturbed by exposure
to the daylight or lamplight, has the quality of restoring itself
      its
        primitive condition when kept                      Daguerre
                                                                          .

                                           of
perimenters have likewise proved that         takes place with some

162                         Prof. Draper on the Detithonizing

powerfully indeed does this cause operate, that, as have said,                                I

     Inseveral successive trials I found that the magnitude of
this spectre  diminished as the time of exposure to the vapour
had been prolonged.
   Next, I repeated the same trial, using the plate and lens
as just described; but immersing the plate in the vapour of
bromine instead of that of iodine,—a still more remarkable
image emerged on mercurializing. This image, like the former,
was circular and black, but all round it for a certain space
there was an annulus of narrow dimensions of pure unmer
curialized silver, the deep black of which contrasted strikingly
with the blue black of the spectre, and         outer circumference       its
was marked                by
                     faint whitening

that now chlorine, diluted with atmospheric air, was used;
the spectre again came out, and did not differ            any obser                            in
vable manner from that      produced       iodine.                by
     In   fourth trial the vapour
          a                             nitrous acid was usedof                                              as

                     this case the edges     the spectre commonly      of
had   a gradually  shading   outline, and  only     one instance did               in
I find that sharpness                       of
                              termination exhibited        the other                           in
Cases.
     We therefore perceive that iodine, bromine, chlorine, and
nitrous        acid can detithonize      surface    which light has
                                                            a                      on

                    To R. Taylor, Esq.
      MY   DEAR         SIR,
   T was with    no small degree of interest that I perused the
     other day Mr. Grove's communication [Phil. Mag. S. 3.
vol. xxi. p. 417], containing a description both of a gaseous
voltaic battery, and of some experiments made with that ar
rangement.      The results obtained by that distinguished phi
losopher are, indeed, such as will certainly draw upon them
the attention of         all
                      scientific men who occupy themselves with
                                                                                                    lº

concerning     asimilar subject, and ascertained        series    facts a               of
which,   inmy opinion, are closely connected with Professor
 Grove’s beautiful experiments,       and     good deal      scientific         of

combined with chemically pure water, and the circuit thus
formed completed by platinum, produces a current which
passes from the solution to the water, though no trace of free
oxygen should happen to be contained in either fluid.               By
letting pass either the latter gas or atmospheric air into the
solution of hydrogen, I could not sensibly increase the cur
rent produced by the arrangement, from which negative                          re
      I
sult thought           I
                      was entitled to draw the conclusion, that the
current   being   generated   under those circumstances cannot be
due to the combination of free hydrogen with isolated oxygen;
an inference which may also be drawn from Mr. Grove's                          ar
rangement itself, for the oxygen being contained in one tube
cannot be supposed to combine with the hydrogen inclosed
in another tube.
    An aqueous solution of oxygen being voltaically associated
with pure water is not capable of exciting a sensible current
if the circuit happens to be completed by means of platinum,
a fact from which it seems likewise to follow that in Grove's
novel pile oxygen does not immediately contribute to the pro
duction of its current.
    But if the current of that arrangement be, nevertheless,
augmented by having the alternate glass-tubes filled with
oxygen, I am inclined to ascribe that effect to the depo
larizing action exerted by oxygen upon the negative platinum
electrodes which are inserted in the tubes containing that
gaseous body.         From obvious reasons that action must be
greatly facilitated and accelerated by the well-known power
of platinum to favour the chemical union of hydrogen with
oxygen.
    It    is,
           however, very likely that        the oxygen tubes, besides
                                              in
the depolarizing action, there             some other electromotive

              investigation, which appeared in the Philosophical Magazine
              for August 1838, is adapted to the case of the parabola; and
              the mode of extending it to the other cases is pointed out.
              In the following investigation, the equation of the conic sec
              tion in general is used, and the property is demonstrated on
              elementary principles alone.

 posed to the spectrum, slowly receives a deposit of Prussian
 blue over the region of the blue, violet, and “lavender” rays:

 streak within the blue, just where the violet itself is most                                                in

 lated with sulphuric acid, the first portion only of the spectral
 impression (from + 13.3 to + 20-0) is blue, the whole of the
 remainder (extending to + 51) snuff brown.                 The dose of
 acid being increased, the exposure prolonged, and the liquid
 plentifully supplied, a green thermic impression is produced
 by the less refrangible rays, in which the spots a, 3, y are very
 distinct, and               lie

proved by the photographic impressions described in Arts.
204 and 209, where no iron is added beyond what exists in the
ferrocyanic salts, themselves.       Nevertheless the following ex
periments abundantly prove that in several of the changes
above described, the immediate action of the solar rays is not
exerted on these salts, but on the iron contained in the ferru
ginous solution added to them, which it deoxidizes or other
wise alters, thereby presenting it to the ferrocyanic salts in
such a form as to precipitate the acids in combination with

176       Sir   J.   F. W. Herschel on the Action of the Rays
solution (in the shade) a most intense blue spectrum is de
veloped over the whole of the more refrangible region, in the
interior of which the blue colour appears to have been, as it were,
eaten away, leaving a white oval, as in the specimen annexed;
precisely the same phaenomenon, in short, as would have been
produced under the spectrum had the two liquids acted in
conjunction.    And this white portion comports itself under
the influence of water or air, just as it would have done had
it been produced under such joint action; i. e. it gradually
turns blue till it is no longer distinguishable from the rest of
the spectrum.       It is also blued by ammonia, just as the posi
tive   paper   of Art. 210, after bleaching, would be, &c. In
short, it is evident that we have succeeded in separating the
final action described in that article into two distinct steps or
stages, the photographic influence being confined to the first,
and the ferrosesquicyanate acting as a mere precipitant on the
nascent compounds resulting from that influence.
    212. In order to ascertain whether any portion of the iron
in the double ammoniacal salt employed had really undergone
deoxidation, and become reduced to the state of protoxide as
supposed, I had recourse to a solution of gold, exactly neu
tralized by carbonate of soda. The proto-salts of iron, as is
well known to chemists, precipitate gold in the metallic state.
The effect proved exceedingly striking, issuing in a process

certain that what little action of the kind exists is due to the
effect of casual dispersed light incident in the preparation of
the paper.     I have before me a specimen of paper so treated,
in which the effect of thirty seconds exposure to sunshine was
quite invisible at first, and which is now of so intense a purple
as may well be called black, while the unsunned portion has
acquired comparatively but a very slight brown.      And (which
is not a little remarkable, and indicates that in the time of
exposure mentioned the marimum of effect was attained) other
portions of the same paper exposed in graduated progression
 for longer times, viz. 1", 2", and 3", are not in the least per
 ceptible degree darker than the portion on which the light
had acted during thirty seconds only.
    214. The very remarkable phaenomenon, described in Art.
208. of a second darkening, different in character and colour,
coming on after the bleaching effect of solar light has been
fully completed, is not without a parallel among the argentine
compounds.            I
                refer to the action of the hydriodic saltson argen
tine papers completely blackened by exposure to sunshine, an
action imperfectly described in § 5. of my former paper (Art.94
et seq.), and signalized as to one of        most striking peculia

   the paper dried the action seemed to be suspended. It be
  came therefore necessary to renew the hydriodic wash, and
  thereby to increase the actual quantity of that salt present on
  the paper. Both actions grew more intense, but the bleaching
  effect most so. A per<U+017F>ect semicircle and long cometic train, c,
  d, fig. 12, No. 1, (Plate II.), was produced, within which space
  the blackness of the paper was totally destroyed, and replaced
  by white or rather very pale yellow.           The hydriodic washes
  being again and again renewed, the darkness at first pro
  duced in the lower part of the spectrum began to give way,
  and was slowly replaced by a very feeble bleaching, which at
  length extended very far indeed below the extreme red rays,
  and upwards to join the semicircle C fig. 12, No. 2, which
  had by this time assumed an outline perfectly sharp and well

and consequently the experiment agrees exceedingly well with
the theory.
    Kakodylic acid forms large, glassy, perfectly transparent
crystals, which are oblique quadrilateral prisms with oblique
angled unequal terminal faces; they belong to the trimetric
system.      The substance is not altered by exposure to dry air,
but is decomposed by moisture.          It is less soluble in absolute
alcohol than in water, but not at          soluble          all
                                                        aether. Among          in
all  the  kakodyle   compounds         the  only  one which does not

not destroyed.             If,      on

 form organic substances, these properties are completely lost.
 Copper, mercury, lead and barium do not lose their poisonous
qualities, whatever the soluble compound may                  which they            be     in

like many inorganic sulphurets, into free sulphur and proto
sulphuret of kakodyle, which is driven off. This compound is
easily soluble in alcohol and aether, but perfectly insoluble in
water; concentrated nitric acid oxidizes it with great violence;
fuming acid even causes combustion and explosion. It may be
reduced with the same ease with which it is formed. Mercury
effects it in the cold; the products are sulphuret of mercury
and protosulphuret of kakodyle.       The products of this action
will of course be different at different temperatures, for I have
already shown that the protosulphuret is decomposed at a
temperature of 200° C.

     It worthy

   The criteria just exhibited, being very easily applied, will

      New Criteria for the Imaginary Roots of Equations.         187
of the equation, by the method of Budan,        leaves only one   in
terval in doubt: the labour of       examining this interval is thus
spared.
   The criteria exhibited above are only two of a group of
n—1 criteria, arising from applying the second of those two
to the several limiting equations derived from the primitive
equation.     By applying the formula [1..] to these derived
equations, we shall merely obtain a repetition of the same        in
equality: for, as may be easily shown from the nature of dif
ferentiation, if a, b, c be the first three coefficients, either in
the primitive or in any derived equation, m being the degree
of that equation, the ratio
                              7m a c
                            (m=1).5°
will be constant.      But if the formula [2.] be applied to the
successive derived    equations,  we shall be led to the following
distinct conditions; where, for uniformity, Al is put for A,
and Ao for    N:
                        2n Ao A2 S (n-1) A1*
                 3 (n-1) Al As-2 (n–2) A.”
                 4 (n–2) A3 A4 S 3 (n-3) Asº
                 5  (n-3)  As As S. 4 (n–4).A.”
        n (n-<U+017F>n-2) Anºs An S (n-1) (n-[n—1]) A*-
or                   2n  An—a  A, S (n-1) A*–1.
   And if either of these conditions have place, we may infer
the existence of imaginary roots in the proposed equation.
Hence    if we call  any term in an equation, which lies between
two terms with like signs, the middle term, we have the fol
lowing general principle, viz.                 -
   If the product of the first and third of the three terms, mul
tiplied by the exponent of the first and by n minus the expo
ment of the third, be greater than the square of the middle
term multiplied by the exponent of that term and by n minus
the same exponent, the equation must have imaginary roots.
The well-known principle of De Gua is obviously included
in this rule.
   Each one of the series of inequalities given above involves
three of the given coefficients; and, as in the cases at first
considered, if either of these sets of three be preserved, it mat
ters not how the remaining coefficients be altered: it follows
therefore that the preceding conditions are perfectly inde

pendent, so that equations may be framed that shall satisfy
them all.
   We cannot infer therefore that there are always as many
pairs of imaginary roots as there are conditions fulfilled,                                                al
though it is probable that there does exist a connexion be
tween the number              of conditions and the number of imaginary
pairs.       But this is a matter that requires further investigation.

          of the most abundant and important minerals is fel
ONE   spar, which constitutes the principal constituent in gra
nite and gneiss, and together with hornblende forms the rocks
so prevalent in this part of Scotland,     mean greenstone and        I
basalt.    Felspar is a double salt, being composed of 3 atoms
of tersilicate of alumina and 1 atom of tersilicate of potash.
Sometimes the potash is replaced by soda. The mineral in
that case is distinguished by the name of albite, and differs in
the shape of          its
                   crystals; three    the minerals which    of

the lustre is vitreous and the texture imperfectly foliated: its
hardness is only 3.75, which is a good deal less than that of
felspar.   Its specific gravity is 2.568.

With carbonate of soda it melts into a green coloured bead,
and on adding nitre the colour becomes red; with borax it
fuses into a colourless bead.

  The silica is much greater than in felspar, and the alumina
much less, while the proportion of potash is nearly the same
If we  were to consider the lime and magnesia and the oxides
of iron and manganese as accidental bodies united to silica in
the same ratio as the alumina and the potash, the constitution
of the mineral might be represented by 4 (Al Sº) + 3                                           (KS).
If the lime and magnesia be essential constituents, the formula

  Its constitution may be represented by the formula
          14 (MgS) + 3 (#f + + Al) Sº + 11 Aq.
   Asbestus contains more silica and a good deal of lime, which
is wanting in baltimorite: asbestus, in fact, is merely a variety
of pyroxene.
   7. For the next mineral, which from its constitution       call       I
subsesquisulphate of alumina, I am also indebted to Mr. Alger.
The locality is South Peru.
   It is a soft, opake mineral, composed of silky fibres adhering
to each other. The colour is white, but there is a reddish
yellow tint which partially pervades the specimens, owing                    ob
viously to a little foreign matter with which they are stained.
The taste is acid and sweet, like that of alum. The specific
gravity is 1:584. It is soluble in water. The constituents are

    The sulphate of soda exists in a greater proportion than
sulphate of potash or of ammonia does in our alum.          It is
                                                                             re

curious that in South America soda almost universally
  laces the potash which occurs in other parts of the world.
          of saltpetre, so abundant in India and even in Europe,
we have nitrate of soda in Peru, and instead of potash alum,
we find in Buenos Ayres and other districts of South America,
soda alum deposited in amygdaloidal cavities in a kind of shale.
    8. Messrs. Alger and Jackson gave the name of Acadio
lite to a variety of chabasite which they found in Nova Scotia,
and specimens of which Mr. Alger was kind enough to send
to me. The colour of the mineral is yellow, and it has the
crystalline shape and the characters of chabasite so completely,
that it would be considered as a mere variety of that mineral
were it not that the constituents do not quite agree. The spe
cific gravity of acadiolite is 20202, and             its

  The proportion of alumina in chabasite is greater than in
acadiolite.            If
              this difference be constant acadiolite must be
considered as a new species.    Its constitution, and that of
chabasite, may be represented by the formulas—
                Acadiolite . . . 2 (Al Sº) + Cal Sº + 6 Aq.
                Chabasite . . . 3 (Al Sº) + Cal Sº + 6 Aq.

194          Prof. Kelland on Mr. Earnshaw's Reply to the
it to a new analysis.    The result was so different from Mr.
Keating's, that it became evident that the position which I had
assigned it was a wrong one, and that in reality it was a qua
druple salt consisting of silica united to the four bases, lime,
alumina, iron, and magnesia.
   The colour of Jeffersonite is dark olive green, passing into
brown.    It is foliated, and according to Keating, may be
cleaved in various directions. The specimen in my possession
is an imperfect four-sided prism; but the faces are not smooth
enough to admit of measurement.
   The lustre is resinous and almost semimetallic; the streak
is gray, and the powder light green. It is rather harder than
fluorspar, though softer than apatite. The specific gravity is
3:51. Before the blowpipe it fuses readily into a dark co
loured globule:               its

fluence me in bringing it forward.” It is quite true I had
 other motives, motives of delicacy. I did not wish to make a
conclusion so evidently at variance with the premises stand
forth prominently in a friendly controversy.               In the first
 sketch of my paper it bore a more conspicuous place than I
afterwards permitted it to do.          Mr. Earnshaw remarks that
it stands in his Memoir as a       purely  casual observation. I am
glad to learn he intends it as no more, and an incorrect one
of course. It appeared to me to be the summing up of the
argument which I was replying to ; for this is the way in which
it is introduced; “and consequently whether the particles are
arranged in cubical forms, or in any other manner, there will
always exist a direction of instability.” (Art.                   am                    5).     If  I           to
understand that Mr. Earnshaw withdraws this, then have                                                          I

any manner whatever, no force is put in play on the one which
is not moved. But Mr. Earnshaw refers to Art. 4 for proof.

    But that am justified in my misconception (in supposing
that Mr. Earnshaw's Memoir has reference to equilibrium),
 will, I hope, be admitted by any one who reads the hypothe
 sis on which it is based.               “It

 sists of detached   particles; each of which is in a position of
 equilibrium, and when slightly disturbed is capable of vibrating
 in any direction.” Further, a point of neutral attraction and
 a position of equilibrium are used as synonymous, Arts. 3, 4,
 6, 11, &c. And moreover, if equilibrium is a failing case in
 his objection (Art. 15), that “the equilibrium can only be
                                I
 stable in one plane,” am at a loss to know what the objection
 itself amounts to.
     2. I turn now to the second portion of Mr. Earnshaw's Re
 ply (p. 438). It is quite unconnected with the former. Rela
 tive to the first four paragraphs, I beg to direct attention to
 the previous objection of my opponent and to my Reply. The
  objection is this (Phil. Mag. for July, 1842, p. 47): the

                                         in                replied       I                by
 stating that this expression       medium “must contain

                                                  of
 Oct. 1842,      p.
                264.)    Mr. Earnshaw's argument assumes that
it  does not.   Now       the Reply before me,
                               in                       attempted it   is                 to

       Defence      of the      Newtonian Law                   of Molecular Action. I 97
Clearly therefore the form of the function in this case, and
where there are no particles of matter, is different, and Mr.
Earnshaw withdraws his objection that they must be the
same. I have only to add in answer to the suggestion, “Perhaps
the Professor will point out what step of my investigation im
plies the existence of the absent particles:” none whatever.
The symbol X may take in everything. And this puts the
matter in the most simple light as regards Mr. Earnshaw's
inference.    If X in a medium is discontinuous, and in vacuo
continuous, then have we the clearest reason why the expres
sion does depend on h in the one, and does not in the other.
The next paragraph has reference to another subject, nume
rical verification. Of course no one considers an error of cal
culation as strengthening a theory.     And have already ex                   I
plained why the processes employed do so (p. 267).
   3. The paragraph at the foot of p. 440, is a reiteration of
Mr. Earnshaw's assertion that he has proved u = 0 or n = 0,
&c.    As this is of very great importance, the consequences
being broadly hinted at by Mr. Earnshaw, I deem it requisite
to state that       I

 the two remaining objections to Newton's law of molecular
 action.
    4. Mr. Earnshaw explains his equations which he asserts
 I  have misunderstood.                   “I
                                 fear it will give to my letter an
 air of great sameness if I again accuse the Professor of misun
 derstanding what he attempts to criticise.” The equations in
 their first form (Phil. Mag. for May, p. 373) are the same as
 Cauchy's well-known ones.        But the coefficients, it appears,
 are  very  different.  M.  Cauchy’s   depend on the direction of
 transmission, Mr. Earnshaw's do not. This was the ground
of my objection to the latter. Let us see the reply.           ask                    “I
 how does the Professor know that these coefficients are not
equal?” “Does it depend upon the direction of transmis
sion? This question and a similar one for each of the other
coefficients M. Cauchy has not answered, but have answered                I
it for myself in the negative, on experimental grounds.”
    It is quite true that Cauchy does not (in the Memoir al
luded to) answer the question, for a most obvious reason.
 He could never have conceived it to admit of doubt. What
is the problem they are solving 2 It is this: To find the vi.
brations which are capable of being transmitted, when the posi
tion of the plane of the wave is given.    Had it turned out that
the coefficients are independent of the position of the plane
of the wave, one of two consequences must have followed;
either,    1, that any vibrations whatever may be transmitted
along a given direction or with a given wave; or 2, that only
certain vibrations can be transmitted, whatever be the plane
of the wave; both of which are contrary to experiment. I
say then that Cauchy could not conceive it possible that his
coefficients should be independent of the plane of the wave.
But I add, that although he did not give their values, he left
only one step to be supplied for their determination. The co
efficients D, E, and F, are expressed at p. 38(equations 70), viz.
         D = 2 R b c k”, E = 2 R a c /*, F = 2 R a b /*,

periment?” I believe very few persons will be found to join
in this opinion. M. Cauchy's name, in the first place, is a
sufficient guarantee for the accuracy of results which he has
repeatedly obtained at different remote intervals. But, in the
next place, the same problem has been solved, in different
forms, by Mr. Airy (Tracts, Art. 110), by M. Naumann, by
myself, by Mr. Green (Trans. Camb. Phil. Soc., 129), and
lastly by Mr. O'Brien (Phil. Mag., March 1842, p. 216),                                                        all

                To R. Phillips, Esq., F.R.S.
       DEAR PHILLIPs, .
            you may think the following experiments worth
PERHAP:
  notice; their value consists in their power to give a very
precise and decided idea to the mind respecting certain princi
ples of inductive electrical action, which find are by many ac    I
cepted with a degree of doubt or obscurity that takes away
much of their importance: they are the expression and proof of
certain parts of my view of induction*. Let A in the diagram
represent an insulated pewter ice
pail ten and a half inches high
and seven inches diameter, con
nected by a wire with a delicate
gold-leaf electrometer E, and let
C be a round brass ball insulated
by a dry thread of white silk, three
or four feet in length, so as to re
move the influence of the hand
holding it from the ice-pail below.
Let A be perfectly discharged,
then       let
             C       be
                 charged                at   a    di
stance
         by  amachine       Leyden or
jar, and introduced into                      as

be  taken away,      will collapse
                          E
perfectly, the apparatus being                     in
good order.      As     enters the

 the oxides” are by themselves, and at common temperatures,
non-conductors of voltaic electricity, and therefore refuse to
yield up their elements. But if on the principles of the theory
we argue that the heat evolved on the combination of one equi
valent with another is a measure of the intensity of the electric
current passing between them at the time, we shall have the
means of eliminating the electromotive force employed other
wise than in separating the elements of the oxides.
      I
      suppose that there are three forces in operation, of which
two are against, and one is for, a current engaged in electro
lyzing the solution of the sulphate of a metallic oxide. The
first two are the affinity of the elements of the oxide, and that
of the oxide for sulphuric acid; and the third, which is in a
contrary direction to the two others and generally less than
either, is the affinity of water for sulphuric acid.   We elimi
nate the two latter forces as follows:—
    1st. For £inc.—I find that 41 grs., or an equivalent of oxide
of zinc, evolves 2°-82 when dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid.
This, which is the quantity of heat due to the intensity of cur
rent resulting from the difference of the affinities of sulphuric
acid for the oxides of zinc and hydrogen, leaves, when sub
tracted from 13°83, 11°01, the corrected theoretical result,
which           I
          have given in the 4th column of the table.
    2nd. For Iron.—The black oxide is dissolved with such dif
ficulty by dilute sulphuric acid that the heat thereby evolved
cannot be accurately measured.        However, the dissolution of
the hydrate is easily effected, the quantity of heat generated
thereby being, per equivalent, 2°74.         But we probably                 ar
rive nearer the truth by subtracting from the heat evolved by
the dissolution of iron in dilute sulphuric acid, that portion
which is due to the oxidation of the iron. In this way       have       I
5°2–0°-9–4°3, the quantity due to the solution of protoxide
of iron in dilute sulphuric acid. This, when subtracted from
12°36, leaves 8°06, the corrected result of theory.
   3rd. For Copper.—The protoxide of copper does not dissolve
readily in dilute sulphuric acid. Nevertheless by keeping the
temperature of the surrounding atmosphere equal to that of
the liquid, I obtained, per equivalent of oxide, 4°0, a result
which may, I think, be relied on.          Subtracting this from
9°97, we obtain 5°-97.
   4th. For Hydrogen, little correction is needed+.       The                li
quid used in the experiments made to ascertain the resistance
to electrolysis of water was mixed with a small quantity only

  shown that the heat arises from resistance to the conduction
  of electricity between the atoms of combustibles and oxygen
  at the moment of their union.         Of the nature of this resist
  ance we are still   ignorant.
     Some time ago I commenced an investigation on the heat
  arising from the union of sulphuric acid with potash, soda,
  and ammonia. This inquiry is more difficult than I expected,
  and my experiments are not yet sufficiently complete to lay
  before the British Association.        In a future paper I hope to
  extend   my  inquiry,  and also to show the relation of latent heat
  to electrical intensity.

 AS interesting
         every phaenomenon connected with electricity must
                      to the scientific world, whether it brings
                                                                    be
                                                                    to
 light a new principle or merely confirms one that has been
 already established, I have thought that the following experi
 ments might prove acceptable to your readers.
    If a needle of any of the malleable metals, or of other sub
 stances, such as wood, ivory, quill and straw, or even of glass
 or sealing-wax, be placed in a galvanometer of the simplest
form, and one end of the wire be fixed in metallic contact to
the hook of the prime conductor of an electrifying machine,
less than a quarter of a revolution of the handle will, if the
machine be in good working order, cause the needle to stand
at an angle of 90°.       If the proper needle of the galvanometer
be   employed    instead of one of the foregoing, it will place itself
at an angle of from 75° to 80°, and will preserve that position
as long as the machine is kept in operation.            The needles
with which these      experiments   were tried varied in length from
three inches to five-eighths of an inch.          The galvanometer
stood at first   simply  on a  mahogany   table, but the results were
not certain with every kind of needle, owing apparently to
their faulty construction; when, however, it was placed on a
good insulator the experiments never failed.          It is worthy of
remark, that whenever the state of the atmosphere was unfa
vourable to the working of the machine, which has been uni
formly the case during the present month, in consequence of

          Mr. Warington      on the Biniodide of Mercury.     209
the dampness of the weather, a singular difference occurred
between two needles, one of which was of brass and the other
magnetic, and both of them five-eighths of an inch in length.
 The brass one invariably placed itself at right angles, while
the magnet remained uninfluenced, though it was the more
delicate of the two, as it had an agate socket. This fact, as
well as what I have just stated of the other magnetic needle,
showed that there was a struggle between the polarity of the
needle and the influence     of the electric current.  It was ob
served that whenever there was a powerful stream of electri
city employed, it was seen to escape in a beautiful pencil of
light from the point of the other end of the wire which was kept
coiled up and unemployed.         The machine used in these ex
periments is of the plate construction and eighteen inches in
diameter, but is at present in very indifferent working order.
    M. Becquerel mentions in his History of Electricity that
he thought he had made needles of various substances move
in a galvanometer when under the influence of a voltaic cur
rent, but that he afterwards found that the slight movements
he had observed were owing to currents of air occasioned by
the heat evolved. The present experiments, however, are so
decisive and unequivocal that they cannot be attributed to
such a cause; still my own convictions are, that they are not
dependent upon magnetic influence.

    WARINGTon, Esq., Secretary to the Chemical Society. &c.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
     SHALL      feel obliged by  your inserting in an early Num
      ber of your Journal the following observations in reply
to a letter on this subject by Mr. Fox Talbot, which ap
peared in the Number of the Philosophical Magazine for
November 1842 (page 336); at the same time I cannot help
regretting that your pages should be occupied by a matter of
personal discussion; but as it would appear, from the contents
of the letter in question, that I had, either ignorantly or wil
fully, made use of the published observations of another, and
as Mr. Talbot pointedly “begs to draw my attention” to the
question of his priority to the “discovery of one of the most
curious phaenomena in optics,” it obliges me to adopt the
same public channel of reply for the purpose of clearing my

time   permitted    I should have       replied   to this charge    at an
earlier date, but professional engagements have rendered this
delay unavoidable.
   In the communication read before the Chemical Society
on February 1, 1842, and afterwards inserted in your Journal
of September of the same year, I do not lay any claim to the
discovery of many of the phaenomena therein detailed; nay
more, it is distinctly stated                       (p.
                                       193), “The resumption           the                                of

molecular arrangement.”
   A   comparison of the above extracts will doubtless entirely
 alter Mr. Talbot's opinion as to these points of his claims to
originality in regard to the observations of 1836.
   I  must now turn to the printed paper in the 9th vol. (S. 3.)
of the Philosophical Magazine, p. 2. Mr. Talbot there admits
“that chemical writers have observed” these “changes of co
lour,” quotes Dr. Inglis's authority for the retention of the yel
low tint for a considerable time, and states, that “wishing to
examine into the cause of these facts” he instituted certain ex
periments, which are then detailed; so, that independent of the
above paper in 1829, of M. A. Hayes, Mr.Talbot proves in this
very paper of 1836, that Nos. 1, 2, and 3 of the points claimed
in 1842 to have been “sufficiently established ” by him in
 1836 had been previously observed.      The next point has re
ference to the first  part  of the claim No. 6. In 1836 Mr.
Talbot states that “the change of colour is accompanied by
a visible internal motion in the crystal, like a sinking or giving
way of successive ranks of particles.”     Here is not a syllable
about laminae which he has now laid claim to, and which
term I consider implies a very different effect from either
“ranks of particles” or “rows of molecules:” it is used in
my paper to represent the plates of the crystal.        Again, as
to the commencement of the       change    of colour taking  place
“by the appearance of a red streak along one of           sides              its         or
edges,” and “the boundary         the red and yellow” being “a
                                         of

                          two sides              of
                                         the rhomboid,” and that
“its motion across the crystal from one these sides the
                is                                            of                   to

suspended in the mixed solutions, and therefore Mr. Talbot's
remarks, referring as they do to the sublimed crystals, cannot
in the slightest degree interfere with them. As to the quoted
expression, “the              #.
                         of view appears scattered with the most
brilliant assemblages   of (rubies, topazes, emeralds and other)
highly coloured gems,” &c., the names of which, inclosed in
the parenthesis, have, inadvertently I presume, been omitted
in the quotation, the only similar word that I can find which
occurs in my own description of these appearances is the word
‘gems,’ and if the use of that expression, applied as it is to
the precipitated biniodide of mercury, is to be considered as
implying a piracy on Mr. Talbot's application of it in viewing
the crystals of sulphate of copper by polarized light, I can
only plead the poverty of the English language, as I had never
seen Mr. Talbot's paper (Phil. Mag. vol. v. p. 324) until he
publicly drew my attention to                      it.
     Inthe concluding paragraph        Mr. Talbot's letter
                                                        of   first                              he
states that “the second part        my paper, however, contains
                                                   of
a fact both new and important,” and then immediately after
wards proves that        not new
                              it   isall, for that     at
                                                     described                he                            in

    Having removed this difficulty          submitted a variety of        I
agates to the microscope, and        found some which gave very  I

image, and in those cases I could distinctly see the edges of the
thin veins of which that part of the agate was composed, the
number of these veins in an inch corresponding with the                                                              di

 sand-covered rocks, intersected by deep ravines. The peculiarly ta
 bular features of Central and part of Upper Egypt are due to the ho
 rizontal stratification of the prevailing limestone, which supports the
 desert districts, and terminates near the banks of the Nile, from Esneh
to Cairo, in mural escarpments. Between Kossier and Ghennah the
 aspect is rendered more varied and irregular by pinnacles and dome
shaped masses of plutonic or hypogene rocks.               The deserts present
 a series of undulating plains sometimes studded with clusters of low
 hills, and are covered chiefly with unproductive saline, often calca
 reous and gypseous sand, marl, and gravel. The Oases of the deserts
 and the mountainous region, Mr. Newbold regards simply as valleys,
 supplied with moisture either by springs or by the drainage-water of
 the deserts, held up by the impervious clay constituting the subsoil.
 In a few cases the moisture, he thinks, may be due to percolation

increases the inclination diminishes, proving, Mr. Newbold states,
that the strata were elevated to their present position with no more
force than was necessary to produce the fissures or valleys; and he
adds, that in proportion as the horizontality is recovered, the fre
quency, depth, and extent of the fissures decrease.
    Some of the valleys, as that of Kossier, are considered to have
been widened by aqueous causes no longer in operation, and that
of the Nile by the still continued erosion of the river; while others,
as the Bahr-bila Maieh, or waterless river*, and that which separates
the petrified wood formation from the Red Mountain, to have been
formed entirely by them. The surface of these valleys is covered,
for the greater part, with the detritus of the neighbouring rocks and
 of distantly transported rolled pebbles, which often rest on ledges
 and hills much above the general drainage-level.           In the valley of
 Kossier, near the Red Sea, the gravel consists principally of pebbles
 of plutonic and hypogene rocks derived from the interior; but near
 the hills or to the westward of the parent rocks few of these pebbles
 are found, proving, the author says, the eastwardly direction of the
 transporting currents.
    The natural drainage of the country is remarkably simple. The
 greater portion of the small quantity of rain which falls in Central
 and Upper Egypt is absorbed by the deserts and collected in natural
 basins like the Oases; the remainder is partly carried off by the
 great evaporation, and partly conducted to the Red Sea by transverse
 cracks on the eastern side of the anticlinal axis, or to the valley of
 the Nile by similar cracks on the western flank of that axis. The
 drainage of the Libyan desert is also effected through the valley of
 the Nile. The amount of water which escapes by these means is
 however so small, that the Nile throughout the last 1350 miles, or
 about one-half of          its
                          course, does not receive what may        termed             be              a
 single tributary.

                   Lieut. Newbold on the Geology of Egypt.                                            219
the Red Sea to the Libyan desert, with the exception of the tracts
occupied by plutonic and hypogene rocks near Syene, and in the
centre of the Egyptian desert, constituting for the greater part the
basis of both deserts.       Mr. Newbold considers the limestone on the
eastern shore of the upper part of the Red Sea, extending to the
base of Sinai and far into the Arabian desert, to be also of the
same age.     The dip is considerable as well as variable in the vicinity
of the plutonic rocks; but there is scarcely any perceptible inclina
tion in the beds composing the banks of the Nile; the general bearing
of the dip        is,
                however, decidedly towards the north.
   The   upper  beds abound with Nummulites, and are generally hard
and    compact,   but sometimes singularly honey-combed, apparently
from the removal                  of
                           the organic bodies. They are often siliceous,
and   considered,  from  effervescing  slightly,    contain sometimes mag

are considered        to be the remains                  of   once    continuous strata.                   The
sandstone varies from a red, white or yellow compact rock to a
loose quartzoze grit, with a calcareous, felspathic or ferruginous
cement, and associated with it is a conglomerate composed of quartz,
chert and jasper, derived chiefly from the subjacent limestone; also
                                                                        and
beds of variously coloured marls containing gypsum and salt,
in which the matron beds of Egypt are situated.
   Casts of marine shells were noticed by Mr. Newbold in the vici
nity of Wadi Ansari, and trunks with smaller fragments of silicified
trees occur in many parts of the Egyptian and Libyan deserts, par
ticularly in the Suez desert, seven miles east by south from Cairo.
This district, called the “petrified forest,” is described in great de
tail. It consists of a sterile irregular plateau, which is considerably
above the level of the Nile, lying on the slope of the Mokattem range,
and it extends three and a half miles southwardly, and four miles east
wardly. Many of the trunks are scattered over the surface among
rolled and angular fragments of dark grit, and pebbles of jasper,
chert, quartz and sharp-edged fragments of silicified wood. The
largest trunks occur in the greatest abundance on or near dark
coloured knolls, particularly towards the south-east portion of the
area, where they           lie
                      like broken stems        fallen forest, crossing each

                    diameter.     Among the fractured trunks which lay
broken transversely         the sand-hills, Mr. Newbold noticed many
                                  on

silicified wood varies  character from

  The author then describes the structure        Gebel Ahmar, situated         of
 on the northern limit    the “FossilofForest,"  and      the intervening                 of
valley.   Gebel Ahmar          irregular  ridge,
                                          is     an  mile     length and            a               in

the general level              of   the desert, and             it   is   composed             of   conglomerate,
grit and sandstone, the prevailing colour      the strata being red             of
(Gebel Ahmar, Red Mountain).
   The stone has been     extensively quarried, and the mounds
                                          so                                                                            of

those causes, and not                      its
                              supposed volcanic origin. The sandstone
reposes,    elsewhere,
            as                       on a
                               the marine limestone, passing near the
line  ofjunction   into      ochreous,anreddish and yellow clay, which
contains veins     fibrousofgypsum,    selenite, salt, and,       said, ba                         it   is
rytes.
   Both the sandstone and limestone abound             caverns, “the resort     in
of the hyaenas that nightly prowl among the burial-grounds without
the walls       of
              Cairo. One         these dens, into which "Mr. Newbold
                                               of
descended, “contained the recent dung            the animal intermingled  of
with human and other bones.”
   The valley which intervenes between Gebel Ahmar and the “Fossil
Forest”     excavated
           is              the sandstone, the subjacent limestone being
                                     in
in some places exposed.
   The following inferences are drawn             Mr. Newbold from the    by
phaenomena presented                  by
                             the deposit     petrified trees:—   of

bably occur where they grew; but until the vertical stems are traced
down to roots fixed in a given stratum or at certain levels, marking,
as in the Portland “dirt-bed,” the ancient surface of dry land, Mr.
 Newbold hesitates to admit the hypothesis that the Cairo fossil de
posit is the site of a submerged forest.
    Reposing horizontally, and at the height of 300 feet, on the       in
clined limestone of the Gebel Ataka range which skirts the shore of
 the Red Sea below Suez, is a calcareous conglomerate, which Mr.
 Newbold thinks may represent the sandstone formation, as it rests
on the marine limestone, and contains similar pebbles; but it contains
 no silicified wood, nor any other fossils, except such as have been
derived from the subjacent limestone.
    6. Post-Pliocene Deposits.-Around the head of the Gulf of Suez,
as well as between the Red Sea and the cliffs which skirt its western
shore, is an interrupted fringe rising in some parts to a height of 60
 feet, with an extreme breadth of four or five miles, composed of cal
careous deposits containing the remains of testacea, radiaria and
corals, which now inhabit the Red Sea.         Kossier and several other
towns stand    upon this formation.   It is suspected by some observers,
on account of the obliteration or    shallowing   of anciently deep har
bours, that the process by which the fringe was raised above the
level of the sea is still in operation, and Mr. Newbold is of opinion
that the forces which effected the upheaval acted gently and gradually.
He objects, however, to the inference that the isthmus of Suez has
been recently raised, on account of the difference in the faunae of the
Mediterranean and the Red Sea.
   Among the post-pliocene formations, the author includes the ac
cumulations now forming around the Red Sea and in the Mediterra
nean on the shores of Sicily, Greece, Asia Minor, &c.        On the west
shores of the Red Sea he has noticed them five or six feet above
high-water mark, overlying a raised coral beach.        They sometimes
enclose bones of the camel ; and in the island of Rhodes Mr. New
bold observed in a similar formation fragments of ancient pottery.
    In the valley of the Nile, on the plain of Benihassan, myriads of
Nummulites, washed from the overhanging limestone, are partially
re-cemented by calcareous matter deposited from springs and form
layers which alternate horizontally with others composed of clay,
sand and gravel, the whole in some places attaining a thickness of
more than 30 feet.    In the valley of Kossier, beds of gravel and other
detritus are gradually becoming consolidated by a calcareous or fer
ruginous cement derived from percolating water; and in the cliffs
skirting the Mediterranean, between Alexandria and Aboukir, Mr.
Newbold observed a bed of bleached bones, derived from Roman and
Greek cemeteries, with an intermixture of more modern human re
mains, overlaid by a layer of occasionally agglutinated sand or gravel,
sometimes from three to four feet thick.
    7. Drift.-Under this head the author includes, 1st, the saline
sands and gravel of the deserts, derived in great part, he believes, from
the fossil-wood sandstone formation, but generally much influenced
in each portion of the deserts by the character of the rocks in the im

mediate vicinity; and 2ndly, the gravel beds which cover the raised
coral beach of Kossier and the limestone cliffs of the Red Sea near
the Jaffatine group, also the detritus resting on the elevated platform
of the Libyan desert near Dendera, the materials composing the
whole of which consist of far-transported plutonic and metamorphic
pebbles, intermingled with others derived from adjacent formations.
   8. Volcanic Rocks.-After alluding to the supposed volcanic
cones or extinct craters in the desert between Cairo and Suez, and
to others said to exist in the vicinity of Dakkeh, situated in the
Nubian desert 69 miles from Syene, Mr. Newbold proceeds to de
scribe the trap and porphyry dykes which in Upper Egypt penetrate
 all the rocks from the lower sandstone                the granite, and have been
                                                                      to

Nile and the Red Sea, forming the anticlinal axis (lat. about 26° N.);
and according         M. Trivin, still further north

bold   thinks,  may       that mentioned            Savary. Sir  by   Wilkinson has    G.

Tenaset; and the same author states that the extreme height attained
by  these rocks        in

   Respecting the relative period               their elevation, Mr. Newbold

                 PAPER was first read on the genus Tetracaulodon by
                 Mr. Koch, communicated by the President.
   Mr. Koch commences by stating, that a difference of opinion ha
ving existed in the scientific world respecting the genus Tetracaulo
don of Dr. Godman, and as only a few weeks previously, in a memoir
read before the Society, the Tetracaulodon was pronounced to be
simply the male of the Mastodon", he conceives it to be his duty to
make public the results of his researches, and which fully prove, in
his opinion, that the Tetracaulodon is a distinct genus, consisting of
several varieties.
   The author declares that he has examined with the greatest ac
curacy            all
             the inferior jaws     the Mastodon preserved
                                                    of             the collec                      in

         the United States, but has never seen any specimens with the
least traces        tusk; and
                          of a      adds, that Dr. Hays he      Philadelphia,               of
         careful inspection          least forty jaws, had arrived

same conclusion.      According, therefore,        the common laws          na to
ture,       highly improbable, observes the author, that the Mastodon

             infers that there are young Mastodons,            well     Tetra              as
caulodons.
   Mr. Koch then proceeds            draw attention     to “some important           to

ble for that animal, with his enormous upper tusks and short neck,
   have reached the ground with them; yet these small lower tusks,
he to
    states, show that they were much used            rooting and grubbing,      in

short upper tusks. To substantiate this inference              calls attention             he
to  three species      Tetracaulodon, the first discovered
                                 of                                  Dr. God                        by
man, the two others by himself.

and Mastodon.      He says that in his collection there is a fragment
of a lower jaw of this species with a tusk which shows very distinctly
the difference  of the lower tusks in the T. Godmanii from those of
the T. Kochii, the character consisting in the root of the tusk being
pointed; and he states that he has not been able to discover the
place occupied by the dental nerve.
   2. Tetracaulodon Kochii.-Of this “species” the author pos
sesses three lower jaws of adults, and one of an extremely young
animal; also two upper tusks belonging to two different individuals,
and two which belonged to one Tetracaulodon. Mr. Koch states
that he found the roof of a mouth of this species perfect, with                six                          on its
molar teeth and the tusks           their “maxillary bones" resting            the
lower jaw which retained            tusk         a in

of  iron  intersecting    the  deposit   prevented    him from extracting this
valuable    specimen    entire,  but that                          he
                                                 secured the upper tusks and
grinders, and the lower jaw with the tusk                     alveolus.       doesin   its                 It
not require      close examination, the author says,                perceive that                to
the animal          to a
                 which these remains belonged was neither male, fe
male, nor young Mastodon,                 Missourium, the whole inner and
                                                        or

and   rooting.    Hence the author infers that the Tetracaulodon lived
principally          on
                  roots, whereas the Mastodon,              says, consumed the         he
large upper herbage. The superior tusks                 this specimen measure    of

lived on the roots of water-plants, &c. They are covered with a
thick coat of enamel, and were concealed for one third of their
length in the sockets; they are also stated to be large in proportion
to the size of the skull; and the bulb is said to resemble that of the
foregoing variety.
   Mr. Koch then calls attention to some vertebrae in his collection
belonging to a gigantic animal, but to neither the Mastodon nor
the Elephant.    They consist, he says, of an extremely well-pre
served lumbar, and a second cervical vertebra.      The most striking
character of these bones is stated to be the great size of the foramen
in reference to the smallness of the body, the former being double
the dimensions of that of the Mastodon.      The author also says that
the cervical vertebra presents two peculiar “cavities, situated on
the right and left of the root of the toothlike process,” and which he
“considers to have been for the reception of two unusual muscles,
to enable the animal to perform a peculiar motion with the head."
As he found these vertebrae in the same deposit from which he ob
tained the skull and jaw, and as he conceives that the Tetracaulo
don must have possessed the power of moving head and neck in a
peculiar manner whilst grubbing for                       its
                                       food, Mr. Koch believes that
these vertebrae belonged              to
                            that animal.

   Nov. 14, 1842.—Dr. Sutherland read a paper “On the Origin
and Progression of Glaciers,” in which, after giving a general view
of their natural history, he proceeded to the examination in detail of
the new facts in regard to their structure and motion which have
recently been discovered by Professor Forbes and M. Agassiz. The
facts bearing most closely on the theories of progression were divided
as   follows:—
     A. Facts in regard to Structure.—1st. It                     has been         shown by
Agassiz that glacier ice is highly porous, and admits of the free
circulation of water through          its
                                   structure. 2nd. That the quantity
of  water    in
             the ice   greater
                       is      during  the day than during the night.
3rd. That the surface       of
                            the ice     constantly melting whenever
                                             is
the  atmospheric  temperature    above 32°Fahr., and that the quan
                                   is
tity  of water passing through the glacier     found    increase when
                                                       is                to
the atmospheric temperature rises and              to
                                             diminish when       sinks.                it
4th. That the temperature        of
                                the ice    the glacier
                                                  of         all ascer            at
tained depths 32°Fahr.,       least during the season
                              at                          progression,    of is
and that   varies very little
            it                   if        all
                                     from that temperature. 5th. That
                                      at
     *    The Proceedings for December 1842 will            be   given   in   our next.

we owe to Professor Forbes the description of a very beautiful struc
ture in glaciers to which he has applied the term Conoidal, one
aspect of which is the appearance of loops on the surface of the
glacier, the apices of which point downwards in the direction of the
glacier's motion, and which Professor Forbes states “give the idea
of fluid motion, freest in the middle, obstructed by friction toward
the sides and bottom.”
   B. Facts in regard to Motion.—1st. That glaciers do not pro
gress during winter. 2nd. That they progress during the warmer
months at observed rates of 200 feet and upwards a year, according
to circumstances of temperature, inclination of bed, &c. 3rd. That
glaciers progress more rapidly in the centre than at the edges, and
more rapidly at the lower than at the upper part of their bed. 4th.
That glaciers progress more rapidly during the day than during
the night, and that their motion is in proportion to the quantity of
water supplied to their porous and capillary structure by the melting
of their surface by atmospheric temperature and rains, so that their
motion increases or diminishes according as the rise or fall of the
atmospheric temperature increases or diminishes their supply of
water. 5th. That the surfaces of glaciers are removed by melting
and evaporation to the extent of several feet a year without any
alteration in their level. 6th. That the peculiar conoidal structure
already mentioned, as well as other facts observed by Professor
Forbes, appear to establish the opinion entertained by him, that gla
ciers progress after the manner of semifluids.
   The author next proceeded to consider the theories which have
been advanced to explain glacier-motion. These are two in number,-
the Dilatation Theory and the Gravitation Theory. The first of
these assumes that the water infiltrated into the glacier loses its
caloric of fluidity, and in freezing expands longitudinally so as to
force the glacier to advance, and vertically so as to maintain the
thickness of the ice. Many objections were urged against this theory,
two of the principal of which were the following:—1st. That the
temperature of the glacier had been proved by Agassiz to be 32°Fahr.
during    its
           period     advance, and that
                      of                    had never been proved
                                                        it
that water proceeding from melted ice would freeze when brought
in  contact with ice   at    32°Fahr.      And      had besides been proved
                                                       it
that the     freezing   point of   water falls below 32°Fahr. under di
minished atmospheric pressure, which we know                   exist  to the al at
            glacier regions. The occurrence            liquid water also
                                                            of                all     at
        in of
titude
depths         the glacier was shown           militate directly against the
                                                  to
theory. 2nd. That       in   order  to  account for the ice always retaining
its  level, although the surface         constantly removed
                                        is                                 by
                                                                    melting and
evaporation, the dilatation theory requires that all the water arising
from this melting    of berefrozen  in the substance       the glacier, whereas
                                                                 of
the greater part     it       escapes        by
                                            the crevices              to
                                                                the bed      the     of
glacier,  to   form the glacier torrent, and only small part enters the

substance       ofthe ice, and thus     inone essential particular the theory
is  wholly inapplicable.
    The gravitation theory         as promulgated            by
                                                          Saussure was shown

234                   Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
to be inapplicable, on account of               resting     important errors
                                                                     its                   on                                          in
matters       fact,
             of      and  wanting    other facts which had been ascertained
since Saussure's researches were published.
    The author next proceeded            explain the following theory, which
                                                        to
he                                                                all  yet known.
                                                                                                          in as
     thought capable          including
                                     of       the phaenomena
During winter glaciers repose                               on
                                          their inclined beds             condition                            a
of  perfect rest.     When warm weather arrives the atmospheric tem
perature rises above 32°Fahr. The joint action                 the air, rains and               of
the solar   rays,   melts the ice and snow           the surface       the glacier.

interesting to the readers of the Philosophical Magazine to state,that
in the autumn of the year 1839, whilst engaged in a mineralogical
 examination of a part of the country in the neighbourhood of Ken
 mare, County Kerry, I discovered a few specimens of this rare mi
neral in the carboniferous limestone of that district; and more re
cently, when surveying in the vicinity of Bristol, I have succeeded
in obtaining it in tolerable abundance from the same formation in
several localities.  It occurs either coating the faces of the minor
joints, or filling up small crannies at the points where several joints
intercept each other; in the latter situations the pieces sometimes
weigh nearly half an ounce, in others it appears merely as a fine
 film.
   This interesting mineral has been described  as occurring in small
masses  in the lavas of Madeira and other volcanic districts, and also
as existing under very dubious circumstances at Alston in Cumber
land, in minute globules in the interior of small lumps of slaggy ga
lena within reach of the surface.
   Inclosed you           will find specimens of the metal exactly in the state
it was found.

        ON THE COMPOSITION                     OF PARAFFIN.                B.Y.   M. LEWY.
   Paraffin has already been subjected to the researches of various
chemists; according to the analysis of M. Jules Gay-Lussac, its com
position is the same as that of olefiant gas; its chemical equivalent
has not hitherto been ascertained, because it does not form any com
pounds whatever.                         -
   M.  Lewy   states that his  experiments   were performed in the labo
ratory of M. Dumas, to whom he was indebted for the various speci
mens of paraffin employed in his analyses; some of them were pre
pared by M. Malaguti from the bituminous schistus of Autun, and
from various kinds of wax. Some specimens of rough paraffin were
purified by M. Lewy himself by repeated treatment with alcohol and
aether, then distilling the products and again crystallizing them in
aetherized alcohol.
   The paraffin thus obtained was perfectly white, and had the form
of pearly scales.            Its
                         density was 0.89,    fused    about 85%.” Fahr.;

          NEW      METHOD OF PRECIPITATING METALS IN THE STATE OF
                             SULPH URET. BY M. C. HIMLY.

drogen; whilst the sulphur, at the moment of its simultaneous separa
tion, acts the same part as the sulphur of the sulphuretted hydrogen;
it combines with the deoxidized radical to form a metallic sulphuret.
The author cites  some examples in support of his process: if to a
solution of a neutral arseniate one of hyposulphite of soda be added
in  excess, the mixture may be heated to ebullition without producing
 any sensible change ; but if hydrochloric acid be then added, the
 arsenic is immediately precipitated in the state of sulphuret.            The
 decomposition is more slow at common temperatures; but by ob
 serving certain rules and precautions it may be rendered perfect. By
 means of this reagent results are obtained in a few minutes which
 would have required at least a day with a current of sulphuretted
hydrogen.      The decomposition of the salts of antimony and copper
by hyposulphite of soda and hydrochloric acid, is neither less easy
 nor complete.
    The application of the hyposulphite of soda, potash or ammonia
 to the quantitative separation of metals appears to be subject to cer
tain principles, which may be thus stated: some metallic oxides dis
 solve readily on an alkaline hyposulphite, when a little excess of
 alkali has been added to it; other metallic oxides are insoluble in
 it; a great number of double salts are formed, which have not
 hitherto been examined.        It is thus, for example, that chloride of
platina and potassium dissolves very readily, when gently heated, in
 hyposulphite of soda; at a boiling heat there are produced much
sulphuret of platina and free sulphuric acid; if the hyposulphite of
 soda be in excess, and hydrochloric acid be added to              the platina                  it,
is  completely precipitated        heat.           by
      appears that the metals, which form soluble sulphur salts, are

XL.       On Apparatus for the circular Polarization of Light in
      Liquids. By the Rev. BADEN Powell, M.A., F.R.S., &c.,
      Savilian Professor of Geometry, Oxford *.
THE  subject of circular polarization developed in light in
  passing through certain substances, especially liquids, is
one which has at the present day attracted considerable atten
tion, not merely among those who study the properties of
light as such, but also among chemists, as supplying a test of the
existence of certain elements in the solutions which exhibit
it.    Ithas thus become          object     an

to the prussiated solution, by which it is hindered from spread
ing unmanageably within the pores of the paper, and the pre
cipitated Prussian blue allowed time to agglomerate and fix
itself on the fibres. By the use of this ingredient also, a much
thinner and more equable film may be spread over the                                              sur
face; and when perfectly dry, if not sufficiently developed, the
application may be repeated. By operating thus                 have          I                    oc
casionally (though rarely) succeeded in producing pictures of
great beauty and richness of effect, which they retain (if not
thrown into water) between the leaves of a portfolio, and have
even a certain degree of fixity—fading in a strong light and
recovering their tone in the dark. The manipulations of this
process are, however, delicate, and complete success is com
paratively rare.
    221. If sulphocyanate of potash be added to the ammonio
 citrate or ammonio-tartrate of iron, the peculiar red colour
which that test induces on persalts of the metal is not pro
duced, but appears at once on adding a drop or two of dilute
 sulphuric or nitric acid. This circumstance, joined to the
 perfect neutrality of these salts, and their power, in such
 neutral solution, of enduring, undecomposed, a boiling heat,
 contrary to the usual habitudes of the peroxide of iron *,
 together with their singular transformation by the action of
 light to proto-salts, in apparent opposition to a very strong
 affinity, has,     I
                   confess, inclined me to speculate on the possi
 bility of their ferruginous base existing in them, not in the                                    or

plausible notion of the chemical nature of that peculiar inter
mediate oxide to which the name of “Ferroso-ferric” has been
given by Berzelius.     If (to render my meaning more clear) we
for a moment consent to designate such an isomeric form of
iron by the name siderium, the oxide in question might be
regarded as a sideriate of iron. Both phosphorus and arsenic
(bodies remarkable for sesqui-combinations) admit isomeric
forms in their oxides and acids +. But to return from this
digression.

in the direct action of the light on the simply nitrated paper.
    228. But if the mercurial salt be subjected to the action
of light in contact with the ammonio-citrate, or tartrate, the
effect is far more powerful.        Considering, at present, only the
citric double-salt, a paper prepared by washing first with that
salt and then with the mercurial proto-nitrate (drying be
tween) is endowed with considerable sensibility, and darkness
to a very deep brown, nay to complete blackness, on a mo
derate exposure to good sun. Very sharp and intense photo
graphs of a negative character inay be thus taken. They are
 however difficult to fºr. The only method which I have found
 at     all succeed, has been
              to                                   by

252                Prof. Young's New Criteria for
pass any photographic production I have yet seen, and which
indeed it seems impossible to go beyond. Most unfortunately,
they cannot be preserved.            Every attempt to fix them has
resulted in the destruction of their beauty and force; and even
when kept from light, they fade with more or less rapidity, some
disappearing almost entirely in three or four days, while others
have resisted tolerably well for a fortnight, or even a month.
                    P.
It  is to an over-dose of tartaric acid that their more rapid
deterioration seems to be due, and of course it is important to
keep down the                    of this ingredient as low as possible.
But without it I have never succeeded in producing that pe
culiar velvety aspect on which the charm of these pictures
chiefly depends, nor anything like the same intensity of colour
without over-sunning.

witnessed in England,         I  have been conducted.       But in so

dot engraving of any degree of delicacy is imitated, line for
line, and dot for dot, in a manner which might deceive any but
a practised artist to the point of rendering him unable to de
clare that the photograph had not been struck off from the
original plate with common printing ink, by the ordinary pro

 XLII.       New Criteria for the Imaginary Roots of Equations.
    By   J.  R. YoUNG, Esq., Professor of Mathematics in Belfast
    College.

       is  easy to
                  by
                    see that the foregoing criteria furnish the rules
                       Newton, in the Universal Arithmetic, for
detecting imaginary roots in an equation. These rules have
not, I believe, as yet been demonstrated; although, on account
of their obvious utility and ready application, a rigorous proof
of their truth has frequently been sought. The earliest dis

  cussion of Newton's rules is that of Maclaurin, in the Philo
  sophical Transactions, vol. xxxvi. No. 408, who has entered
  into a very long and elaborate investigation of them, the re
  sults of which, however, only go the length of showing that
  “some imaginary roots exist in an equation,” whenever any
  of Newton's criteria have place; and do not embrace the more
  general affirmation of the rules, that there are as many pairs
  of such roots as there are distinct criteria fulfilled.
     It is no doubt from the misgiving and uncertainty always
  attendant upon an undemonstrated principle, however nu
 merous the individual instances in which it may have been
 safely trusted, that these rules of Newton have fallen into neg
 lect, in the analysis of equations. It is one object of the pre
 sent paper to revive and demonstrate them: another, and the
 more immediate one, is to prove the adequacy of the criteria
 already given to determine the true character of a pair of
 doubtful roots, as soon as by actual development we have
 reached the point where, if they are real, the separation of
 them must take place.
    It is desirable, when this stage of the approximation is                                ar
 rived at,             we          be     pronounce

 the nature       of
                 the roots under examination, from the conditions
necessarily impressed upon the transformed coefficients thus
 attained, without having      applyto additional tests, to     exe               or   to
cute    any  new transformations     by-operations, for this pur

be   effected from the following considerations.

254                  Prof. Young's New Criteria for
the stage thus reached, the character of the discrepancy ad
verted to will, of itself, decide the doubtful point; for the dis
agreement may consist either in the first expression giving a
greater figure than the second, or the second a greater figure
than the first: if the former happen, the roots sought will be
real; if the latter, they will be imaginary.   For it is plain that
in the  quadratic,    to which the   approximation   tends (Equa
tions, p.262), we shall have, for f(x), n = 2; for      (r), n = 3;   f
for f. (a), n =  4, and so  on;  so that the conditions previously
given supply, in these cases, the following criteria of the
character of the roots sought, that is the roots are real or not,

   Hence the condition holding for the three leading terms of
one cubic necessitates     holding for the three final terms
                                      its                                                               of

              that the concurrence implies but       single ima                   a
ginary pair. By examining our series          cubics, with these    of
principles before us, applying the test     each group      three  to                          of
terms      succession, we shall obviously

those conditions which are really distinct and independent,
from those that are not, and therefore         infer   many di          to             so
stinct imaginary pairs.
  If  the first set         of
                       three, that      the leading terms

of one imaginary pair;         the next set—the final terms
                                      if                                 the                      of

following set         of
                   three—the leading terms             the next cubic—  of
must furnish the same concurring condition, by the second
principle above; and         on,      so    arrivetill   we
                                                          set     three for

                                                                   a              to                   of
concurring conditions, and preparing the way for new and                                               in
dependent conditions. As soon            the criterion again holds, the
                                                     as
condition, being altogether independent                the former, must of
imply another and distinct imaginary pair; and                  on,     the            so         to
end of the series.

 note the number of imaginary roots, at least, which enter the

    The rule now established will be found a valuable adjunct
in the modern theory of numerical equations; more especially
in connexion with the researches of Fourier. We shall apply
it to an example taken from the Analyse des Equations of this

Hence the equation has four imaginary roots.

XLVII.           On the Immersion of a small Spherical Ball in a                                                   Jet
           of   high-pressure Steam.  By A CoRRESPONDENT.
INofa paper which appeared in the last (January) Number
      this Magazine, Mr. Armstrong makes us acquainted
with the curious circumstance, that when a small spherical
ball is hung by a thread in a jet of high-pressure steam a
sensible force is required to draw it out: I shall endeavour
shortly to account for this phaenomenon.
   The most obvious explanation which presents itself    that                                             is,
the lateral pressure                   of
                                the steam       greater nearer the side
                                                                 is                                                     of
the    jet  than        internally,
                        it   is       but      the pressure     as   the surface               at
        only       be
                  equal            atmospheric     pressure, this method                                                of
                                    to to
can                           the
explanation seems                           be
                                  attended with some difficulty; never
theless there can be little doubt                 the true one. it   is
      Suppose we have vertical tube inserted
                                       a                      the steam-boiler       in

                                                     it to
              allowed                   the                  the                                              it
move along the tube until                either remains         rest       retro          at             or
grades.
      Let   E   represent the pressure             the steam          the piston
                                                                     of                           on
 at    any instant,       the atmospheric pressure                state     rest;     in                  of
                                                                                           on a
                               e
 then      if we consider the pressure              the air          of
                                                                   the external

                of                              vary from the atmospheric

E     e.    It    perfectly clear that when the piston ceases

 forwards the force Ee must have changed                    sign,      the elastic  its             or
 force     of the steam                on
                                the surface        the piston must   of      then                             be
 less than the atmospheric pressure.                 The above proceeds on
  the supposition that the atmospheric pressure                     the external               on
  surface       the piston does not sensibly vary during the motion:

                                                       this would be, that the

antagonist forces must gradually become equal.
    The piston, however, would still for some time continue

write merely to say, that when it was sent to me as printed
in Silliman's Journal, I sent a brief letter back, declining to
enter into discussion, since I had nothing more to say than had
been said, and still thought that that was sufficient to enable my
own mind to rest in the view it had taken of static induction,
&c.    My reason for declining                           was no want                   of respect to Dr.
Hare, but a strong conviction that controversial reply and
rejoinder is but a vain occupation.          Professor Silliman wrote

        GENTLEMEN,
       HE communications          which    have appeared in your          Jour
        nal from Professor Draper of New York, I have studied
 with the greatest interest, seeing in him an able and industri
 ous inquirer in that path of science to which                  I have myself
 directed some attention.            In the pages of the Philosophical
 Magazines for November and December 1842 and March
 1843, are three papers by Dr. Draper, in which he seeks to
 explain many of the phaenomena with which the art of photo
 graphy has brought us acquainted, and those still more mys
 terious effects to which the labours of M. Moser” have called
 general attention.          With the first of these papers have at   I
 present little to do, having in my essay on Thermography,
 which you did me the honour to publish in your Magazine
 for December, acknowledged the priority of Dr. Draper's
 observations on Latent Light.                I would however notice, in
 reference to Sir John Herschel's valuable remarks on the
  Daguerreotype which accompanied that paper, which you
 printed in February, that your Magazine for April 1840 con
  tains a communication on “The Chemical Action of the
  Solar Spectrum,” accompanied by a drawing, from me, which
  will show that       I   have a prior and very distinct claim to the
  prismatic analysis of the Daguerreotype photograph, which
  Sir John Herschel has, with characteristic readiness, acknow
  ledged in a note with which he has honoured me, dated Fe
  bruary 17th, Professor Draper's paper “On a New Impon
  derable Substance, and on a Class of Chemical Rays analo
  gous to the Rays of Dark Heat,” and also that “On the
  rapid Detithonizing Power of certain Gases and Vapours,”
   &c., claim our especial attention. The object of these com
   munications is to prove that the property of effecting chemical
   change, which has been considered due to the rays of Light,
   ought to be attributed to a “new imponderable substance,”
- which Dr. Draper proposes to call TITHoN1c1ty.                     Although
   have   frequently     i.
   many of the very remarkable effects which
                              me to consider     seriously
                                                            I  have observed
                                                              the propriety of
   separating the rays by which they were produced from Light

rays, and still more strongly convinced by the recent re
searches of Sir John Herschel of the existence of solar rays
broadly distinguished from HEAT and LIGHT,      do not think                       I
we have as  yet a sufficient amount of experimental evidence
to warrant us in receiving that broad distinction as truth,

moon will darken several argentine preparations, but merely
to a disturbance of the equilibrium of the caloric latent in the
plates. It will be found by experiment that heat or cold ap
plied to one portion of a metal plate will render that part
more susceptible of condensing vapour than the other parts.
I                                                I
   must confess, however, that hold my judgement suspended;
for there are curious circumstances which I am endeavouring
to investigate, which appear to indicate the influence of an
agent with which we are unacquainted.            will now come to        I
the more   important  part  of the Professor's  communication,--
“Proof of the existence of DARK TITHON1c rays analogous to
the rays of DARK HEAT.”
   Dr. Draper and M. Moser do not appear to admit that the
film of ioduret of silver on the Daguerreotype plates is de
composed by solar agency; the former attributing the change
of colour to a disturbance produced by the absorption of the
“tithonic rays,” and the latter to a molecular change pro
duced by light “externally blackening the iodide or other
compound of silver.”
    My own impressions are certainly adverse to this.           for                          I
merly” expressed it as my opinion that the iodide was con
verted into an oxide of silver by the light. I now believe the
oxidation to be a secondary action, due to the influence of
the atmosphere.      A great number of carefully conducted
experiments have convinced me that the solar rays liberate
iodine, leaving the silver in a state of very fine division loosely
on the surface of the solid metal. Iodide of silver is insoluble
in nitric acid or ammonia, although I find the former has the
power of decomposing that salt by long-continued action;
but it will be found that the darkened portions of the solar
ized Daguerreotype plates are rapidly dissolved by diluted
nitric acid, and slowly by ammonia.                                If,

274        Mr. R. Hunt            on the Changes which Bodies
were active in producing the effects described by Dr. Draper,
Moser and myself. I however obtained the most decided
evidence that no effect was produced by an exposure of two
hours to the prismatic spectrum by the most refrangible rays;
but it frequently happened in these trials, that much mer
curial vapour was deposited about that part of the metal on
which the rays of least refrangibility fell. These experiments
were, however, by no means satisfactory; but I hope, with
the increase of light and the required instruments, to exa
mine the question minutely this summer.
   The coloured media used by me were, 1, red; 2, yellow;
3, green; 4, blue: these insulated respectively the following
rays:—
   1.   Red, orange, yellow, and some of the blue.
   2. Orange, yellow, green, with a faint trace of the blue,
and a small portion of the red.
   3. Orange, yellow, green, and blue.
   4. Green, blue, indigo, and violet.
   In addition to these fluids, water (5), and water blackened
with ink (6), were also used.
   A very highly polished plate of copper with the above
media in flint-glass flat bottles laid upon      was exposed     it,                      to
bright sunshine for one hour.        was then  placed
                                                  It      dark                in a
box, and subjected      the vapour
                             to         mercury.       of
                                                    The largest
                                                                                          by by

                                             to
the red fluid (1); the next          order was that influenced
                                           in
the blue (4), and then the others          follows: green (3), yel

low  (2), white  (5), and black (6). There was less mercury
deposited where the last four bottles                       of
                                               fluids had lain than
on  the uncovered portions         the plate.

arrangement       as
                  the above was     kept    the dark for five hours,

                                         when subjected

tacked   in    the same manner

                              mercury was deposited             the un
covered parts     of   it.
   Another copper plate was placed one-eighth                      inch     of   an
above the same bottles             of
                               fluids     the dark, and allowed
                                                  in                                      to
remain     that position for five hours.       On exposure           the             to
vapour    of in
            mercury,      was found that the only impressions
                             it
were made         on
                  those parts opposite the red fluid (1), the
blue (4), and the green (3), the largest deposits correspond
ing with the red fluid; but that portion opposed            the green   to
fluid (3) exhibiting  the slightest   possible  traces     action.     of
I    cannot explain any           of
                              the peculiarities which        have now
described; they belong             to
                                 class a           of

mysterious kind, and the elucidation will only             effected    be                 by

the most unwearying perseverance in experimental observa
tion, and by a mind capable of drawing the most logical de
ductions therefrom.              I
                       state them now as they have occurred,
for the purpose  of showing  how perfectly independent these
effects appear to be of the chemical rays of light.     may                              I
mention another very curious, result in connexion with the
above.      Two copper-plate engravings were placed upon
highly polished amalgamated plates of copper; one of them
was covered with common window-glass, and the other with
a deep red glass stained with the oxide of gold.               They were
exposed to daylight for four hours, during which there were
but faint gleams of sunshine.         On subjecting the plates to the
vapour of mercury, a very capital copy of the print was found
to have been made under the influence of the red glass, but
no trace of an impression under the other. It will be seen,
on referring to Dr. Draper's paper, that these results corre
spond mainly with some obtained by him; but they will not
admit of the explanation he has given of the radiation of
tithonicity, unless he can in the first place prove the constant
presence of the agent he has so named in                bodies.     allknow         I
he  attempts        do this, but      am by                    no
                                                    means satisfied that

    With the view         of
                         testing Dr. Draper's results,             carefully   I
iodized two silver plates and exposed them                  light.        to

were subjected to mercurial vapour.      On the iodized plate
the deposit of vapour was uniform, although slight; but on
the superposed plate of silver a strong and beautiful image of

neither of the two iodized  plates  had lost their sensitiveness

these singular     results were produced, I instituted a series of

mercury          the upper plate.       On exposing the mercurial

amalgamated plate had made decided visible impressiona                                               on

278         Mr. R. Hunt on the                Changes         of Bodies in Darkness.
    I  became desirous of ascertaining whether the mercurial
plates would produce any change upon the precipitated iodide
of silver. Ifind by many experiments, that if the iodide of silver
is pure, no more change is produced than is produced upon
it by diffused light; but if it is rendered sensitive by a trace
of the nitrate of silver, it *is then darkened as by solar                                                       in
fluence.

 a mercurial plate was fixed \th of an inch above                      three                it.       In

   The mean of these determinations gives 1044 for the atomic
 weight of pyrogallic acid, which corresponds pretty closely
with the calculated number 1061. It is evident also that these
analyses give C8 H 4 O 4 as the formula of pyrogallic acid;
and not Cº Ha O, that of Berzelius. The formula C, H, O,
is that found by the late R. C. Campbell, as stated in Liebig's
 Geiger; but I am not aware that the details of his analysis
have ever been published.
   When even a single drop of caustic ammonia is added to a
solution of pyrogallic acid, it becomes alkaline and assumes a
dark brown colour.      A great excess of ammonia was added
to a solution of pyrogallic   acid, which was then evaporated in
vacuo.    The acid   crystallized    in confused tufts of a dark
brown colour; when pounded, however,                       its

potash, or even a concentrated solution, if cold, has no appa
rent action on chloride of silver; and this, I presume, explains
how the reaction about to be described has not been noticed.
But a solution of potash, spec. grav. 1:25 to 1:30, with the
aid of heat, decomposes almost instantaneously the moist
chloride of silver, converting it into a heavy, fine jet-black
powder, which is pure oxide of silver.             This oxide dissolves
without the smallest residue, and without effervescence in
diluted nitric acid, and yields a colourless and pure nitrate.
The heat of the spirit-lamp reduces the oxide to a coherent
spongy mass of absolutely pure silver.
    The following method appears to me the most advantageous.
    The cupreous solution of silver is precipitated by common
salt, while hot, and the chloride of silver well washed by decan
tation with hot water.          It should also be broken down with
a  spatula   of  platinum    or a glass rod, during the washing, but

       The calculation from the formula C,                            H, N, O, gives only
     7°16 per cent.                                                                       -
        The     excess     of 4.8 per cent. here obtained,                      estimated      by
     weight, amounted to 0.024 gramme nitrogen, or in volume
     nearly 25 cubic centimetres; in the above experiments with
     sugar 0.015 gramme of nitrogen was, according to M. Reiset,
     condensed in the soda-lime, and therefore took a part in the
     formation of the ammonia.
       If  we consider that the decomposition of organic bodies of
     difficult combustion by the hydrates of the alkalies does not
     take place at a heat below redness, that further, the heating
     of the contents of the tube by the fire placed around it cannot
     be so sudden as to produce in an instant the temperature ne
     cessary for combustion, but that the heat, even when sudden,
     penetrates the mixture only by degrees, and that the greater
     portion of the inclosed or condensed air is driven out by                                 its
     own expansion, we can scarcely comprehend how M. Reiset
     could entertain the idea that the nitrogen condensed        the                      in
     mixture could take           a    part   in

                                      experiment apparently supporting

290                  Dr. H. Will              on    M.   Reiset's Remarks
  In both the following experiments, conducted exactly as an
ordinary combustion, I employed soda-lime ignited just be
fore its introduction into the tube.
    1.000 gramme stearic acid decomposed with soda-lime in a
tube 14 foot long and half an inch wide, left, after evaporation
to dryness with chloride of platinum and resolution in aether
 alcohol, novisible trace of ammonio-chloride of platinum.
   2,000 grammes pulverized metallic tin, after ignition with
soda-lime and treatment of the residue after the evaporation
of the hydrochloric acid with chloride of platinum, afforded
an extremely small quantity of yellow powder, which pos
sessed      all
              the properties                  of
                                    ammonio-chloride          platinum.          of
     Inthe   following   experiments,       stream eithera     atmospheric       of
air   or    of nitrogen   was   passed    through    the tube during the
successive oxidation               of
                              the substance,         means        byalkaline      of   an
hydrate.       Both the     atmospheric     air and the     nitrogen    were
dried      by means      sulphuric acid, which had been freed from
                             of
nitric oxide          by
                     treating with sulphate         iron.         of
    The volume          gas  of
                             passed   through   was about from three                                  to
four thousand cubic centimetres, and the combustion through
out the whole length                   of
                               the tube was         conducted, the expe

                                               to     that the conditions
necessary for the formation                         of
                                          ammonia were given           every                at

hydrogen proved, however, that the tin was oxidized                      the                     at

platinum was obtained.            The same experiment repeated with
tin, zinc, and pure metallic iron, always afforded ammonio
 chloride       of
                platinum, yet         slight trace that
                                               so            a   most cases       in

 cause, from the violent evolution                           of

experiment       whichin nitrogen  was used instead     atmospheric                      of
air,   similar result was obtained, namely 0.007 ammonio
        a
chloride     of
              platinum.
   These    experiments    prove that the nitrogen        the atmo                           of
sphere can        in       no
                     way form ammonia with hydrogen             nas                                   in

cent state.    The extremely small quantities obtained         most
cases must consequently have some other source, which                                                       it   is

hydrate of soda, and must be kept in a state of fusion with it
for many hours before the oxidation is complete.
    Reiset states that ammonia is disengaged by heating me
tallic iron and potash-ley to 292°Fahr., with access of air,
but not so in an atmosphere of nitrogen. This statement
rests on a very equivocal foundation.             Pure iron can be
heated for a long time in a boiling potash-ley without the dis
engagement of hydrogen; the oxidation takes place only on
the fusion of the alkaline hydrates.     If a quantity of potash-ley
 which has stood for a   long  time in a perfectly clean retort be
heated, there is always observed at the commencement a slight
 disengagement of ammonia, but this soon ceases altogether.
    The, by no means inconsiderable, quantities of ammonia
 obtained by Reiset, admit of no other explanation than that
 his mixture of soda and lime contained a nitrate, probably        ni
                                        y
 trate of potash, which, as Faraday states, easily evolves am
monia when the smallest trace          it is melted with zinc and
 an alkaline hydrate.    If Reiset had only, in a small degree,
 followed or observed the   extremely   cautious and circumspect
manner of proceeding of that celebrated English philosopher,
a manner which is with justice admired by him, he would not
have endeavoured to find sources of error in a method’ to
which, on this point at least, no very weighty objection can be
made.
    The nitrate of potash contained in the soda-lime used by
Reiset, was very probably owing to the circumstance that most
manufacturers add a little of it to the commercial hydrates of
soda and potash, for the purpose of improving their appear
ance.     In Reiset's experiment, where he obtained 4.8 per
                    .."
cent, too much nitrogen in chincovatina, his mixture must have
contained very             per cent. of nitrate of potash, when it
is considered that his tube contained from 50 to 60 grammes.
This also explains in a much simpler and easier manner the
formation of ammonia in an atmosphere of hydrogen, and also
the limited increase of ammonia from the increased quantities
of sugar employed. As the whole quantity of nitrate of potash
would be destroyed by from 1 to 14 gramme of sugar, the
quantity of ammonia could not increase. The nitrogen was
here certainly contained in such a condensed state, that a
stream of hydrogen gas passed over it during twelve hours
did not expel   it.

                     the second source         oferror objected,   by

    The experiments of Faraday show with the greatest accuracy
 that the ammonia was not only not formed, but that it either
existed already in the material employed, or received it from
 the air by exposure.           The quantities obtained were so ex
tremely small that he could not estimate them.
   In the foregoing experiments I have not only confirmed, but
at the same time demonstrated the correctness of Faraday's
statement, that the nitrogen of the atmosphere does not in any
way possess the property of forming ammonia with hydrogen at
the moment of                 its
                         separation from any combination.                this                      If

with the disengagment of hydrogen gas at the common
temperatures, which is by no means the case; it presupposes
further, that the hydrogen on being set free possesses a far
greater affinity for the nitrogen than for the oxygen of the at
mosphere, which completely contradicts ourgeneral experience.
At high temperatures, where water would be decomposed by
iron, ammonia is not formed. Kuhlman* obtained only hydro
gen and nitrogen, butno ammonia, by the passage of steam, and
nitrogen over pyrophorous iron heated to a strong red heat.

   There is no doubt from this that the ammonia observed in
the rust of iron was obtained from the atmosphere.
   Herman*, in an essay “On the decay of wood,” mentions an
experiment in which the nitrogen of theatmosphere wasdirectly
absorbed and partially converted into ammonia by the decay
of fresh wood. Herman found nearly one-third part of the
nitrogen, which according to his experiments existed as a con
stituent of the wood, in the products of              decay.   He con    its

cessive memoirs of an experimental philosopher must necessarily be
better adapted to the study of the proficient than to the instruction
of the beginner, and that long periods of time often elapse before
the facts which they contain would find their places in general sy

    To this we should be inclined to add, that the piece-meal mode
in which this is commonly effected generally produces a patch-work
of old and new matter, extremely unfavourable to the reception and
spread of new and important opinions.            Professor Daniell, however,

      The Earl of Macclesfield was one of the early members of this
  Society, and continued his connexion with us till the time of his
  death.     He was the great-grandson of the first Earl of Maccles
  field, who was President of the Royal Society in 1752; and who
  had established an astronomical observatory, fitted up with excel
  lent instruments, at Shirburn Castle, near Oxford, which Bradley
  frequently visited.    The observations made at Shirburn are now in
  the Savilian    Library  at Oxford; and Bradley acknowledged his
  obligations to them in enabling him to complete his researches on
 nutation and refraction.     The observatory does not now exist; but
 in the   library,  which is still in great preservation, and contains
 many valuable printed works, there is a large collection of original
 letters, from men of science, in the last century; amongst which
 the names of Oughtred, Flamsteed, the Gregorys, Barrow, Wallis,
 and Newton, frequently occcur.       The late Earl of Macclesfield,
 whose decease we are now recording, permitted the late Professor
 Rigaud to make a selection of such letters as he thought might be
 most interesting to the public, which have since been printed at the
 University press of Oxford, and at the expense of the delegates, in
 two volumes.       Amongst these documents is the first letter which
 Flamsteed wrote to the President of the Royal Society, on Nov.
 24, 1669, and which was not known to be still in existence prior
 to this discovery.     Only a portion of it was printed in the Philo
sophical Transactions; and in the present publication there are
yet certain portions omitted, which are not now considered to be
interesting.
    Mr. Smeaton was a civil engineer, and was descended from a
 brother of his celebrated namesake: he had been but a short time
a fellow of the Society when he was removed by death.
   Mr. Thomas Tulley was the second son of Charles Tulley, the
 optician, in whose workshop he was brought up, and to whose
business he succeeded, first in partnership with an elder brother,
 and afterwards alone, on the death of the latter.
   Rear-admiral d'Urban has been dead some years, but the Coun
cil did not receive any news   of his decease till very recently.
   The Rev. Michael Ward had been         afellow   of   the Society for  a
long period.     He was fond    of astronomy, and possessed      a    small
observatory.
   Major-General Shrapnell was well known         to military men    as the
inventor of the destructive shell which bears his name. He was for
many years   a fellow   ofthe Society, though his period   of  active exer
tion was almost passed before the Society was established.
   Mr. James Moore French, chronometer-maker,              at   the Royal
Exchange, was     a   zealous and successful    artist,    and  on  several
occasions gained the prize given     to the best   of   the chronometers
which were tried   at  Greenwich.

   Captain William Tucker, R.N. was introduced to the Society by
his uncle, the late Mr. Frend, of whom an account appears in the
last annual Report. He perished in November last, in the 48th year
of his age, on the wreck of the unfortunate East Indiaman Reliance,
which was lost off Boulogne.          The circumstances of his death and
the devotion of his last moments, as narrated by survivors, to the
performance of an act of humanity, created the strongest public
sympathy.       He had been almost          his life      all
                                                         active service, and

been remarkably successful; and                               he
                                             gained his commander's com

   While on this subject, it may further be stated that the 13th
volume of the Memoirs, referred to in the last annual report as
about to be presented to the Society by Mr. Baily, and containing
the catalogues of Ptolemy, Ulugh Beigh, Tycho Brahé, Halley,
and Hevelius, is now nearly completed, and nothing but the atten
tion requisite for the Cavendish experiment has prevented it from
being actually ready.       Thus the Society receives, in the course of

now happy to state have been completed.      The first is an extension
of the catalogue of this Society, published in the second volume of
its Memoirs, with certain additional columns that will render it of
greater value to the practical astronomer.  The British Association
have granted the funds requisite for the publication of this work,
which will soon be sent to the press.   The next two catalogues con
tain the reduction of the stars observed by Lacaille at the Cape of
Good Hope, and of those observed by Lalande at the Ecole Militaire
at Paris. These catalogues are finished, and the British Association
propose to apply to government for a grant of the requisite funds
for printing them.
   The Council, while reviewing  the subjects connected with astro
nomy which have been brought before the Society since the last
anniversary meeting, beg particularly to call the attention of the
meeting to the labours of Professor Henderson and of M. Hansen.
It will be remembered that in the President's address, on delivering
the Gold Medal to M. Bessel for his researches on the parallax of
the double star 61 Cygni, honourable mention was made of the
labours of Professor Henderson in a similar inquiry with respect to
a Centauri, founded on the reduction of his own observations made
with the mural circle at the Cape of Good Hope. This indefatigable
astronomer has within the present year presented us with the result
of a series of observations made at his request by Mr. Maclear
expressly for the purpose ; and which, extending as they do con
siderably beyond a year, or the time during which the parallax goes
through         all   its
                     changes, and averaging from eight                 ten observa

   Gentlemen,--I have now the gratifying duty of stating to this
meeting the grounds on which the Council have thought it right to
award a Gold Medal to Mr. Francis Baily for his experiments to
determine the mean density of the earth, in repetition of what is
generally termed the Cavendish Experiment”.         In the performance
of this duty, I am  necessarily  required  to offer a few remarks on
the nature and utility of the end sought, on the previous attempts
which had been made to gain         and      the manner          it,

the other numerators are in their proper proportion to that one.
Hence the mass of the earth, for instance, may be called unity, and
the results of observation may be made to give the relative masses
of other bodies.
  What, then, is the mechanical signification of this numerator 2
The answer to this question belongs to the physical astronomer,
properly so called.
   Our first idea of mass is derived from bodies at the surface of
the earth; under the same bulk some are lighter, others heavier.
Two explanations present themselves: either the heavier body is
composed of matter of the same kind as the lighter, but in a state
of  greater density, or more closely packed; or else the heavier
body is composed of particles intrinsically heavier, that        more                                          is,
powerfully acted                on   by
                        the earth than those     the lighter.   Which               of
of  these two explanations            received  is the true one, more
                                                        to   be                          as
concerns the chemist than the astronomer, but the language         the                                             of
former explanation       always used is    our science.       we have  in                                 If
reason      know that water compressed into one-twentieth

such knowledge as he had of the composition of the mountain, gave
the mean density of the earth nine-fifths of that of the mountain, or
from four to five times that of water; Hutton's subsequent and
laborious investigation made four and a half for the ratio; but
Playfair's examination    of the strata of the mountain led to the
inference that the result of the experiment could only be considered
as placing the same ratio between four and six-tenths and four and
nine-tenths.   It is worth noting that Newton (Principia, book iii.
prop. 10) had ventured a conjecture, which, as happens so frequently
with him, turns out to be true. He thinks that the mean density

gold medal          Mr.

    And first, with regard               the responsibility which was imposed.

It    ought       to    be
                        most    distinctly     understood, that the functions                                   of
the Committee appointed                          by

superintendence was accepted.            Not one direction was given, not
one   single  condition was      imposed,   not one syllable was put upon
record   by   which  failure,   had it  occurred,   could have been thrown
from the shoulders of one upon those of several.             The suggestions
which Mr. Baily acknowledges himself to have received from men
of science, whether in or out of the Society, were submitted solely
to his judgement, as much as if the experiment had been his own
private undertaking.        Consequently, it is just that it should be
most explicitly acknowledged that            the merit             all
                                                           success lies where        of
 allthe blame              of
                    failure would have fallen.        But, while      say this,                       I
                  the same time observe that the disposition
                        to at

advice, and      try advice, which has characterized Mr. Baily's pro
gress throughout, has been                                      no

always take in an extension of our science, whether of principle, of
process, or of fact; from what country or quarter soever it may
come. We always acknowledge an addition to astronomy as a claim
upon our gratitude : how particularly then is it incumbent upon us
in the present instance, when the character of the Society depended
upon the fulfilment of the pledges under which the means of making
the experiment were obtained.      Had that experiment failed, had it

obtaining the earth's mean density by his now established mode,

   Mr. Baily,–I present you with this medal in the name of the
Society for which you have done so much, as the highest testimony
which they have power to bear to the splendid service which you have
rendered to the science of Astronomy.     I thank you in their name
for the care which   you  have taken of the honour of the Society,
and for the augmentation   which it has received from your labours.
And to our sincere congratulations upon the providential escape
which you experienced, during the prosecution of your inquiry,
from a sudden and violent death, I add the expression of our
earnest hope that you may long be spared to continue your services
in the advancement of knowledge, and to enjoy that well-earned
fame which will wait upon your life and your memory.

   November 1, 1842.-Mr. Warington presented part of a cast-iron
grating which had been subjected to the occasional action of slightly
acid liquids for several years, and which exhibited the partial removal
of the metal, while the residual graphite retained the original form.

                                        attack lately made    M. Reiset   by
on of   the new method      determining the nitrogen

into practice with great apparent success by MM. Will and Var
rentrapp of Giessen.
   After drawing a favourable contrast between the new method
and those previously in use when the proportion of nitrogen to be
determined is small, the author proceeds to inquire into the validity
of the objections before alluded to. It is stated by M. Reiset that
when sugar is burned with the usual mixture of hydrate of soda and
lime in fine powder, and the gases evolved conducted into hydro
chloric acid, an addition of pure chloride of platinum and evapora
tion to dryness gives rise to a quantity of the double chloride of
platinum and ammonium, indicating in some experiments 1 to 1-5
per cent. of nitrogen in the body analysed; and as this was considered
too great to be attributed to accidental impurity, it was ascribed to
the absorption of the nitrogen of the air contained in the tube by
the mixture of carbonaceous matter and alkali, and the subsequent
conversion of the cyanide so formed into ammonia; and this idea
was strengthened by repeating the experiment with the tube filled
with hydrogen instead of air, when the production of ammonia was
found to be lessened.     It became important to know how this very
serious objection could be disposed of.
   On repeating the experiment, it was found that when the finest
white sugar-candy was thus burned, a certain quantity of the yellow
platinum salt always remained upon the filter after washing with the
mixture of alcohol and aether, but this quantity, instead of indicating
 1 per cent. or more of nitrogen in the sugar, gave in three expe
riments only '06 per cent., a quantity attributable to impurity.
   Tartaric acid and charcoal made from white sugar gave similar
results, the ammonia amounting to a mere trace, doubtless due to
foreign admixture.
   It is difficult from such experiments to avoid drawing the con
clusion that the appearance of the nitrogen is in        such cases due         all
to  accidental impurity      the body burned, and not
                                in                         any direct               to                  or
indirect formation        of
                        ammonia from the   nitrogen    the air.                of
   To those practising the new method under discussion the fol
lowing observation may          useful:—in mixing the organic matter
                                     be

gen. The sugar, to ensure purity, had been crystallized twice out
of an aqueous solution, again dissolved and thrown down by alcohol,
collected and recrystallized out of water.     A small quantity of it
heated with some of the alkaline mixture in a test-tube, afforded
vapours which did not affect the red colour of litmus paper.       Fre.
quently in analyses by this method, especially when the organic
substance is very rich in carbon, fluid carburetted hydrogens distil
over, which remain behind on evaporation, forming a black residue.
This is not wholly dissolved on edulcorating with aether and alcohol,
and goes to increase the weight of platinum salt, if there be any. The
residue remaining on the filter after edulcoration with alcohol and
aether in the second experiment, did not exhibit under the microscope
the least trace of the yellow crystalline salt, but was of a blackish
brown amorphous appearance.       It appears, therefore, that the sub
stance calculated above as ammonio-chloride of platinum was most
probably platinum which had been reduced by these carburetted
hydrogens during evaporation.
   An analysis of oxamide by the new process gave an excellent
result, the per-centage of nitrogen falling just below the theoretical
quantity.

   62. “On the probable existence of Nitrogen combined with Sili
con in Soils and other Substances,” by W. H. Balmain, Esq.
   The stability of the compounds of boron and silicon with nitrogen,
and the facility with which such compounds are produced when or
ganic matter is strongly heated with a borate or silicate, seemed to
render it probable that such bodies might occasionally exist in un
expected circumstances, as in soils or minerals for example, and ex
periments were made with a view of directly ascertaining whether
this was the case.
   Samples of several varieties of soil were boiled for some time with
a mixture of dilute sulphuric and nitric acids, then washed and dried
and subjected to the action of hydrate of potash at a high tempera
ture; ammonia was in all cases abundantly disengaged, even after
the purified soil had been heated to redness.     In one instance the
sample of soil was boiled with strong nitric acid as long as nitrous
acid vapours were generated, then submitted to the action of di
lute sulphuric acid, washed again, boiled with strong solution
of caustic potash, washed, and then agitated with chlorine gas;
yet on being heated with hydrate of potash it gave off ammonia
abundantly.
   It was inferred by the author, that the nitrogen ultimately found
was in combination with silicon, and in that condition had resisted
the action of the various agents employed for        its
                                                    removal.

sian Blue upon the surface of Gravel, through the medium of Ferro
cyanide of Calcium.”   By Robert Warington.
   In a communication formerly made to the Society by Mr. Porrett
on the above subject", that gentleman considered the production
of prussian blue to have arisen from some of the gas-lime employed
to destroy the worms, &c., and placed under the fresh gravel, having
been accidentally dropped on the surface, and that the peroxide
of iron contained in the gravel had been deoxidized by some of the
sulphur compounds of the gas-lime, giving rise to the formation of
a combination of iron with cyanogen and calcium, and that this
compound had been decomposed by the action of the carbonic acid
of the atmosphere, or by the siliceous matter of the stone, thus
causing the formation of prussian blue.       An artificial ferrocyanide
of calcium was formed by mixing hydrate of lime and prussian blue
to the consistence of a cream; and this was placed in an open part
of a garden, and numerous white-coated siliceous pebbles, selected
from the red gravel of the neighbourhood of London, then partly
immersed in the mixture, so that the upper surfaces might be ex
posed to the action of the atmosphere and moisture; in a few days
the sides of the pebbles assumed the blue colour, which gradually
spread itself to the summits, having the same bright tint as the
pebbles presented to the Society by Mr. Porrett, proving therefore
that the ferrocyanide had been drawn to the surface, either by that
curious species of crystalline growth, if the expression may be
allowed, which is exhibited by so many saline combinations during
their crystallization, or by capillary attraction united with evapora
tion from the exposed parts of the pebbles, thus rendering it evident
that the ferrocyanide might reach the summit of the gravel from
below.
   Other substances were then submitted to the same action, to de
cide the question as to the siliceous matter of the stones being in
any way instrumental in the production of colour. White limestone
pebbles, from the south coast of Devon, and baked pipe-clay, un
derwent the same changes, with the exception that the blue tint
was not so bright and clear as was the case on the siliceous surface;
but this is considered attributable more to the perfect whiteness of the
siliceous coating, and the decidedly superficial film of prussian blue
which was produced on       it.Independent     this, the effect can only
                                                     of
be   attributable  to
                    the action     of
                                   the carbonic acid gas present     the         in
atmosphere slowly decomposing the ferrocyanide                        of
                                                            calcium and
generating the blue stain.

   70. Extract from a letter from Professor Henry Croft, “On the
Manufacture of Sugar from the Zea Mays.”
   Experiments have been made in the State of Indiana which seem
fully to prove that the stalks of the maize may be employed advan
tageously for the manufacture of sugar.    It is well known that the
sugar-cane, as grown in Louisiana, does not produce above one-third
as much saccharine matter as when raised in Cuba and other tropical
situations.   In Louisiana one acre yields from 900 to 1000 lbs. of
sugar, and it appears that 1000 lbs. may be obtained from the stalks
of the maize.   The juice of the latter contains more than three
times as much sugar as the juice of the beet-root, and five times that
of the maple. By plucking off the ears of the maize as they begin
to form, the saccharine matter of the stalk is greatly increased.
The maize-stalks require less pressure, and the whole of the stalk can
be used, afterwards affording a good fodder for cattle. The plant
can be raised with the greatest ease in from seventy to ninety days,
whereas the sugar-cane requires much care and attention,                           and does
not arrive at maturity in less than eighteen months.

         the following particulars :
    A large Comet has become visible in the evening, soon after sun
set.    It appears to have been first seen in this country on Thursday
the 16th inst. by Mr. Shorts of Christchurch, Hants.         But it had
been observed on board the Tay, West Indian Mail Steamer, on her
homeward voyage, as early as the 6th, and at Nice by Mr. Cooper,
on the 12th. On the 14th Mr. C. detected the nucleus, which he
found to be stellar, and equal to a star of the sixth magnitude; but
its  situation could not       correctly ascertained.

 CARGOES IN DIFFERENT LATITU DES.                                                         BY A CORRESPONDENT.
   Many useful and interesting articles on the mercantile law of
shipping not long since appeared in the Law Magazine, No. 32,
p. 367; in one of them, the writer, speaking of the master's duties
with regard to the ship's cargo, says, “The goods are to be delivered
according to the number, weight, or measure indicated in the bill of
lading.    In ascertaining the number no difficulty can exist; in other
cases the goods are weighed at the king's beam, or public scale, or
are measured by official meters, where such an establishment exists.
Not unfrequently serious discrepancies are found to exist between
the results so obtained and the quantities specified in the bill cf
lading ; and it is not always easy to determine whether a deficiency
is attributable to natural and intrinsic causes, such as evaporation,
leakage, shaking, compression, or the like, or to causes for which
the owner should be responsible.      It is evident however that con
siderable latitude of allowance should be made, as well on account
of variation in the weights and measures of different parts, as of the
changes both in bulk and gravity to which in the course of a long
voyage many commodities are necessarily subject.”
   The latter part of this quotation suggested the formation of the
inclosed tables". It is well known that             bodies are affected                       all                                          by

weight may be found at any other place by multiplying W by the
decimal multiplier corresponding to the nearest degree in the table.
   Ex, 1.—If a ship's cargo be 1000 tons at London, what will it
weigh at Moscow, lat. 55° 45'
   The multiplier corresponding to 56° is 1.000321, which being
multiplied by 1000, gives 1000-321 tons, or 1000 tons 6 cwt. 1 qr.
19 lbs., so that the gain or difference in weight is 6 cwt. 1 qr. 19 lbs.,
which the table indicates.
   Ex. 2.-A ship's cargo weighs 500 tons at London, what will be
its weight at Madras, lat. 13° 4'?
                                                           -
   The decimal multiplier in a line with 13° is '997561 12, which
being multiplied by 500, gives 498: 78056 tons, so that the cargo is
1 ton 4 cwt. 1 qr. 15; lbs. less at Madras than at London.
   The table exhibits the gain or loss in weight of           ships from                                                all

LVII.           Experiments on the Heat disengaged in Combinations,
                 By THoMAs GRAHAM, Esq., F.R.S., &c.”
THEtheobservations, of which an account shall be given in
        present paper, are exclusively confined to the heat
disengaged in combinations formed in the humid way. The
heat disengaged in such combinations is in general easily col
lected and measured, as it is immediately communicated to a
mass of fluid, of which the temperature may be observed with
accuracy.     The elevation of temperature in an experiment
may often, however, be greatly affected by incidental circum
stances; such as the liquefaction of the product of the com
bination, arising from         solution its   the water,   in   other men           or
struum   employed;         the  hydration
                                   or            the  compound  of  formed,
which           so
            generally   occurs with         salt formeda         uniting             by            an
acid and base; and can rarely, therefore,                taken       the ex   be          as
pression         of
             the heat   disengaged     from the combination without
considerable correction.
   Thus        few preliminary experiments
                in   a                                 ascertain whether, to
as  has been     anticipated,    different bases          the same class      of
evolve equal quantities           heat       of            on
                                             combining with the same
acid,    was found that equivalents
           it                                    oxides         of

zinc, and the equivalent          magnesiaof        dissolving       on
                                                                      highly                  in
diluted  sulphuric   acid,  evolved    respectively    4°-20,   5°18,    and
                                                                     to all
11°70. But the sulphates formed are                  hydrated salts, and
a large portion           of
                      the heat was found                 due      the com     be         to

atom of water to the sulphate of water.       It is scarcely one
third of 1°47, the quantity evolved by the first atom.
   4. H O, SO3 + 3 H 3. With 47-55 grains, or one equi
valent of this hydrate, the rise by dilution was in three expe
riments 1°31, 19.31 and 19:27, of which the mean is 1°30.
The difference between the heat evolved by this and the pre
ceding hydrate is 0°:56, which is therefore the heat evolved by
the addition of the third atom of water to the sulphate of water.
 Now the second atom evolved 0°53, so that the second and
the third atoms of water appear to evolve sensibly the same
..".      of heat. This curious result favours the conclusion,
that the second and third atoms of water go together; or
that the hydration of the sulphate of water here advances by
two atoms at a time, and that no intermediate hydrate exists,
in a state of solution at least, between H O, SO3 + H O
and HO, SO3 + 3 H. O. The last may be represented as
HO, SO, HO           + 2 H O.
   5. HO, SO3 + 4 HO. With 53.18 grains, or one equi
valent of this hydrate, the rise of temperature on dilution was
1°05, 1°-07 and 1°-05; mean 18-06. The difference between
this and the preceding hydrate, namely 0°:24, is therefore the
heat evolved by the combination of the fourth atom of water
with sulphate of water.
   6. HO, SO3 + 5 H O. With 58.8 grains, or one equi
valent of this hydrate, the rise of temperature on dilution was
O°88, 0°88 and 0°-85; mean 0°.87. The heat from the com
bination of the fifth atom of water is 0.19. It is not impos
sible that the heat evolved from the fifth is the same in quan
tity as that evolved from the fourth atom of water, and that
these two atoms go together like the second and third. The
present hydrate of sulphate of water corresponds with crystal
lized sulphate of copper.
    7. HO, SO3 +7 HO. With 70.05 grains, or one equiva
lent, the rise was 0°-68, 0°-71 and 0°-65; mean 0°-68. The
difference between the effect of this and the preceding hydrate
is 0°19, which is therefore the heat evolved by the combina
tion of the last two atoms of water, namely the sixth and
seventh atoms. This hydrate of sulphate of water corre
sponds with crystallized sulphate of magnesia.
   By the continued hydration of the sulphate of water, the
quantities of heat evolved are therefore as follows:–

It will be observed that the heat evolved by the first atom is
sensibly the same as that evolved by the four following atoms,
the quantities being 1°47 and 19.52; the difference between
these numbers being within the limits of errors of observation.
The same conclusion is drawn from his experiments on the
hydration of              oil
                      vitriol   ofProfessor Hess.  by  Supposing the

and   4      by
            the remaining excess.
   Although the experiments detailed above agree with those
of M. Hess       bringing out one curious result, they yet differ
from them            toin

   The salt was made certainly anhydrous by exposure to
an incipient red heat for a considerable time, and the equiva
lent quantity, 37.98 grains, in the state of a fine powder, was
thrown into 1000 grains of water. It did not cake, and was dis
solved completely by stirring in about one minute and a half.
The rise of temperature in two experiments was 4°30 and 4°-36,
of which the mean is 4°33. To this must be added the heat
lost by the liquefaction and solution of the hydrate formed.

at 400° to 100 sulphate of magnesia only 14:14 water, instead
of 14.81, the single equivalent. The hydrate was therefore
 #4 HO.      The heat evolved by the solution of 43.35 grains,
an equivalent quantity of this hydrate in two experiments, was
3°06 and 3°9, of which 3°.08 may be taken as the mean.
   Another portion of the same sulphate less strongly dried, re
tained to 100 sulphate of magnesia 15-75 water, which is
11ºr H. O.     The results from the solution of 43.93 grains, the
equivalent of this hydrate, were 8° 03, 2°-98 and 2°-98, of
which the mean is 2°'98.      The mean of the two sets of expe
riments, or 3°03, probably does not differ far from the truth.

The anhydrous salt disengaged 5°25, while the protohydrate
disengages 3°-95; the difference, or 1°30, is therefore the heat
disengaged by the combination of the first atom of water with
sulphate of magnesia. It thus appears that of the whole heat
evolved in the complete hydration of sulphate of magnesia, as
nearly as possible one-fourth is due to the combination of the
first atom of water, one-fourth of 5°.25 being 1°31.
   2. Sulphate of 2inc.—The equivalent quantity of the cry
stallized salt, 89'59 grains, contains 39:38, water, and was
therefore dissolved in 960-6 water. The fall of temperature
in two experiments was 1°-01 and 0°-98, of which the mean
is 1°00. This sensibly exceeds the cold produced by the solu
tion of crystallized sulphate of magnesia, which is 0°-92. The
difference has a real foundation, and is not the consequence
of errors in experiment; for in two other sets of observations
on the same salts made in glass, and which may be compared
with each other, although not with the preceding experiments,

the results were for sulphate of magnesia 0°85, 0°-80 and
o°-83, of which the mean is 0°-83; for sulphate of zinc 0°-97,
0°-91, 0°-92, of which the mean is 0°93: greater cold occa
sioned by the solution of sulphate of zinc than of sulphate of
magnesia, by the first experiments 0°08, by the last experi
ments 0°-10.
   Of sulphate of zinc, carefully dried and made perfectly                                           an
hydrous, the equivalent quantity, 50.22 grains, was dissolved
in 1000 grains of water, with the exception of a mere trace of
flaky matter. The rise in one experiment was 4°-20; in
another 4°15; mean 4°17.        The results then are,

There is the same difficulty in obtaining the protohydrate of
sulphate of zinc exactly definite, as the corresponding hydrate
of sulphate of magnesia. The hydrate operated upon con
tained to 100           of zinc 11-99 water, instead of 11-207,
which is a single equivalent.    The equivalent quantity, 56-21
grains, was dissolved in 1000 grains of water, and occasioned
a rise of temperature in two experiments of 2°34 and 2°-33.
As the rise for the anhydrous salt was 4°:17, the deficiency
from the hydrate, 417                      –
                            2:34 = 1°83, is due to the quantity
of water  already combined in the salt of the experiment. But
this deficiency cannot be entirely ascribed to a single atom of
water, as the combined water exceeded that proportion as
 11.99 to 11:21. It is difficult to find proper elements for the
necessary correction, but we may probably reduce the amount
of deficient heat to 1*71, that          11-99              is,
                                                   11:21, without as              to

11.83 water, instead of 11:29 water, the single equivalent. The
equivalent quantity, 55.72 grains, was dissolved in 1000 grains
of water, with a rise in two experiments of 2° 15 and 2°13.
The result is 3.73          –
                       2:14 = 1°59 for the combined water.
This hydrate  contained 12%, H O.
  After being dried still further on an oil-bath at 370°, it
consisted of 100 sulphate of copper and 11:44 water, or was
1;   H O; the salt was now almost white, the green tint being
barely perceptible.   The equivalent quantity of the last salt,
55-54 grains, was dissolved in 1000 grains of water, but some
what more slowly and with greater difficulty than the prece
ding salt. The heat evolved in two experiments was 2°09 and
2°07, which instead of exceeding falls short of the preceding
results. The deficiency of heat in the last experiments is re
markable, and is in some measure, but         believe not fully,I
accounted for by the slowness of the solution.     Giving a pre
ference to the first results, and deducting #nd part for the
excess of water above one atom already combined with the
salt, there remains 1°47 for the heat due to the combination of
the first atom of water. The result for the protohydrate                               is,

markable, and distinguishes this salt from the other magnesian
sulphates. This salt alone of the class forms a thick solution,
when highly concentrated, and crystallizes with difficulty. It
was also observed that the protohydrate of sulphate of man
ganese does not dissolve easily in cold water; the quantity of
the protohydrate employed in the experiments narrated above
requiring to be agitated with the water for two and a half
minutes, before the liquid ceased to be turbid and the salt
was entirely dissolved. The anhydrous sulphate of manga
nese was dissolved quickly and with ease.
       III.  Sulphates and Chromates    of the Potash family.
   1. Sulphate of Potash.-Good crystals of this salt were re
duced to powder and sifted. The solution of the equivalent
quantity, 54.55 grains, in 1000 grains of water, which took
place in thirty seconds, was attended by a fall of temperature
in two experiments of 1°50 and 1°52, of which the mean        -
                                                                  is
1°-51.
          Fall  on solution  of KO, SOs . . . 19.51.
   The same quantity of sulphate of potash was dissolved in
a mixture of 300 water-grain measures of dilute sulphuric
acid of density 1-1 mixed with 700 grains of water. The
dry acid in the mixture amounted to 36 grains; a single
equivalent is represented by 25 grains.          The solution was
quite as rapid, or more so, than in pure water; the fall of
temperature 2°04; the difference of 0°53 is probably con
nected with the formation of bisulphate of potash.
   2. Chromate of Potash.—The solution of the equivalent
quantity, 62.09 grains, of this salt in 1000 grains of water, was
attended with a fall of 1°-18 in water.
          Fall on solution of KO, Cr O. . . . 19.18
<U+017F>º
When dissolved in an equal quantity of the same dilute sul
          acid as was used with sulphate of potash, the solution
  ecame red from the formation of bichromate, and only a very
slight change of temperature occurred, namely a fall of 0°.08.
    3. Bichromate of Potash.-The fused salt was used, as it is
easily reduced to a fine powder, and half the equivalent quan
tity used, as the whole equivalent is not dissolved by 1000
grains of water at 57°Fahr., the temperature of the experiments.
The solution of 47.34 grains, half the equivalent quantity, was
attended with the same fall of 1°-98 in two experiments.         No
sensible change of temperature occurred on diluting this so
lution.     In the dilute sulphuric acid used with the two      pre
ceding salts, the fall on the solution of half an equivalent of
bichromate of potash was 2°00, or sensibly the same as in

   340   Mr.   Graham on the Heat disengaged in Combinations.
   pure water. The fall of temperature for a whole equivalent
   of bichromate of potash will therefore be 3°-96.
            Fall on solution of KO, 2 CrO, . . 8°-96
      The heat of liquefaction of bichromate of potash is there
   fore very considerable. It appears to be the same in quantity
   as that of nitrate of potash. The equivalent quantity of the
   latter salt, 63.25 grains, was dissolved in 1000 grains of water,
   with a fall of 3°86. The temperature of this solution was
   further reduced 0°-10, by dilution with another 1000 grains
   of water; so that by the solution of an equivalent quantity of
   this salt in the same proportion of water as was employed for
   the solution of an equivalent of bichromate of potash, a fall
   of temperature of 3°-96 is produced. In a second experiment
   the whole fall of temperature on the solution of an equiva
  lent of nitrate of potash was 3°-95.
         Fall  on solution of K.O., NO. .     .   .  .  .   .3°.96
      It is possible that this coincidence is not accidental, but
  depends on a thermal equivalency of NO, and Cra Oas the
  acids united with potash in these two salts.          If  the single
  equivalent of nitrogen in nitric acid be divided by three, or
  considered three atoms instead of one, as has been inferred on
  other grounds, then the acid constituents of both salts will
  contain the same number of atoms, namely eight; and the
  bichromate of potash, which has hitherto appeared so anoma
  lous among salts, be assimilated to the nitrate of potash.
      4. Terchromate of Potash.-Of this salt 63-63 grains, or
  one-half of the equivalent quantity, were dissolved easily and
  entirely by 1000 grains of water, with a fall of 1°-63.          But
  the terchromate of potash changes colour when thrown into
  water from decomposition, being resolved in a great measure
  into bichromate of potash and chromic acid, both of which
  are soon dissolved, the last more rapidly than the first.

  A corresponding proportion of the crystallized binarseniate
of potash, or 56.38 grains, were dissolved by 1000 grains of
water, with a fall in one experiment of 1° 13, and in another
of 1° 18. In a third experiment the solution of a whole equi
valent of this salt, or 112-75 grains, was attended by a fall of
temperature of 2° 15. A greater discrepancy is observable in
the results obtained from this than from most other salts,
which appeared to arise from the full depression of tempera
ture not occurring at the moment of solution, but a small
portion of it being produced in a gradual manner for three or
four minutes after the solution. The mean of the three ob
servations gives 2°26 for the equivalent quantity of the salt.

   The thermal properties of these two salts are interesting in
relation to the terchromate of potash. The latter salt contains
14 atoms, which is also the number of atoms in both biphos
phate and binarseniate of potash, if the equivalents of phos
phorus and arsenic be supposed, like that of nitrogen, to re
present three atoms.
    Potash being common to the terchromate and biphosphate
of potash, there remain, on subtracting that constituent from
both salts, three equivalents of chromic acid equivalent in
some sense to one equivalent of phosphoric acid together
with two equivalents of water. This statement respecting
phosphoric acid, recalls the view which has lately been pro
posed by M. Wurtz of the constitution of the hypophosphites,

dissolved by 1000 grains of water with a rise of 0°51.               se                                     A

therefore very different from those of sulphuric acid.

     The fall of temperature observed on dissolving bisulphate
of potash in water approaches that observed on dissolving the
neutral sulphate of potash in dilute sulphuric acid, the first
being 1°-95 and the second 2°·04. But it is doubtful if the
fall in the second case can be ascribed simply to the imme
diate formation and solution of bisulphate of potash, when the
sulphate of potash and dilute sulphuric acid are mixed and
dissolved together.  In the formation of bisulphate of potash
we have both the substitution of sulphate of potash for the
second atom of water of the sulphate of water, and the throw
ing off of           all

means convinced that      Napier    had seen    Torporley's  work:

means a common word among mathematicians; it was a tech
nical term of judicial astrology, and would probably be avoided
by the geometer: Torporley was an astrologer, as appears
from the opening of his work. Trias and ternio would sug
gest themselves first (trinitas being excluded for an obvious
reason).   On this word probably the question will turn: if it
should be found that no mathematicians of the period use the
word triplicitas except Torporley and Napier, it will be diffi
cult to avoid presuming that the latter must have seen the
work of the former.

    Solar Spectrum analogous to the Fired Lines of Fraunhofer. 361
    through the prism is converged to a focal image on a white
    screen by the action of an achromatic lens, the spectrum which
    results is given in great purity, and Fraunhofer's lines are
    quite apparent. The larger ones are seen by the most casual
    Inspection.
        2. A tithonographic surface, after being placed in this
    spectrum, exhibits impressions of an analogous character,
    being covered with the representations of multitudes of inac
    tive lines varying greatly in dimensions.
        3. After several attempts last summer                    I
                                                       succeeded in dis
    covering these lines, and have obtained impressions of them
    sufficiently perfect.
        4. Before proceeding to the description of the mode which
    is to be followed, and of the characters of the lines themselves,
    I  cannot avoiding calling attention to the remarkable circum
    stance which has frequently presented itself to me of a great
    change in the relative visibility of Fraunhofer's lines, when
    seen at different periods.      There are times at which the strong
    lines seen in a red ray are so feeble that the eye can barely catch
    them, and then again they come out as dark as though marked
    in India ink on the paper. During these changes the other
    lines may or may not undergo corresponding variations.
    The same observation equally applies to the blue and yellow
    rays.     It has seemed to me that the lines in the red are more
    visible as the sun approaches the horizon, and those at the
    more refrangible end of the spectrum are obvious in the mid
    dle of the day.
        5. A beam of the sun, passing horizontally from a heliostat
    mirror into a dark room, was received on a screen with a slit
    in   itscentre, the slit being formed          pair     by

                                   in

    give     an
              aperture Jainch wide, and the light passing through fell

 beautifully seen by employing a common double convex if the
  screen be inclined forward in the way described in this Journal
  for December 1842. Either way answers very well.
     6. In order to identify these lines                                I
                                                     have made use of the
  map of the spectrum published by Prof. Powell in the Report
  of the British Association for 1839. With the instrumental
  arrangement described they are exceedingly distinct, and no
  difficulty arises in the identification of the more prominent
  ones. The spectrum, with which I have worked, occupies upon
  the screen a space of nearly four inches and a quarter in length
  from the red to the violet, or, more correctly speaking, from
  the ray marked in that map A to the one marked k. In
  stating, however, that no difficulty arises in identifying these
  lines, I ought to add that I am referring to that particular
  map. In the figure annexed to Sir                                J.
                                                    Herschel's treatise on
  Light, in the Encyclopedia Metropolitana, the ray marked G
  seems to differ from that of the Report.              But Prof. Powell's
  map being drawn from his personal observations, and with
  reference to these very difficulties, as it coincides with my own
  observations and measures,                         I
                                          have employed it and therefore
  take the letters he gives.
     7. It will be understood that the whole spectrum and                                                 all   its
 lines cannot        be obtained         one impression.

 which
          is
          in     the way        effecting this rests

 this Journal for the month of February 1843, which has just
reached me, Sir John Herschel points out that a connexion
may be traced between the phaenomena of coloration im
 pressed by the spectrum, and those of Newton's rings. With
striking ingenuity he shows how a succession of positive and
negative pictures may arise by prolonged solar action, and
those shades of colour which the iodide of silver exhibits, un
 der variable exposure to light, originate.
  - 2. This hypothesis, however, as that able philosopher pro
ceeds to state, is not unattended with difficulties, and after
pointing out what those difficulties are, he shows how neverthe
less it can account for an extensive group of facts.              regret                                I
 that these difficulties are in the way, and that there are also
other facts which appear to exclude the theory of thin plates
 from these phaenomena.

remarkable power of certain electro-negative gasesin operating

published results of a similar kind. The true explanation of

cular orders of refrangibility or colour, rests on a very feeble
analogy, and strikes me as entirely without support.

obtained—the large cells in the ovum.           From these the cor
puscles of the blood seem to have descended; and they un
dergo changes essentially the same.
   1. The mammiferous blood-corpuscle, like one of the cells
of the ovum, is at first a disc, or what is now called a “cyto
blast,” i.e. a cell-germ.    It is not a flattened vesicle or cell.
Like other discs or   cytoblasts,  however, it may and does be
come a  cell; but then it is no   longer    flat. In the blood-disc
you see a central, colourless, concave portion, around which
lies the red colouring matter.
   2. As usually met with, the blood-disc is round, with the
exception of two or three instances in which, from the obser
vations of MANDL in France and Gulliver in this country,
it has been discovered to be elliptical. I have since found
that even in Mammals where the blood-disc is usually met
with round,       original form
                      its           elliptical.    have seen this

 globular. They also very much increase             size.                in

blood-discs, there takes place another change. Instead                                                  of   a
mere concavity, there        now seen colourless, pellucid, semi
                                       is               a
fluid substance; which,          the corpuscle becomes orange
                                              as

become      cell.

itself new matter, becomes disc; and each disc, undergoing

consumed. Thus,         the red pass into the colourless corpus

       From $4 it will be seen that the disc, or so-called                                 “cy
toblast,” is originally a pellucid globule; which globule there
fore is the true cell-germ.
    7. Sometimes the quantity of the pellucid substance in the
blood-cell is very much increased. This takes place at the
expense of the red colouring matter which surrounds              The                 it.

    The result of the analysis shows that the quantity of oxygen
in the silicic acid is twice as great as that contained in the
bases, from which the formula                 R, S, results, which perfectly
agrees with the composition of augite hitherto examined. The
proportion of the bases is however different from any former
analysis.
    In  most of the augites from volcanic districts the quantity
of alumina amounts to about 6 per cent, and with it is pre
sent a considerable quantity of magnesia, while the protoxide
of iron amounts at most to 12 per cent. In these crystals of
augite the protoxide of iron and the lime are present in nearly
equal atoms, the magnesia and alumina only in small quanti
ties, so that these belong to the class of lime-iron augites”.

   The analytical result shows that, on account of the insuffi
cient quantity of carbonic acid, the alumina and the oxide of
iron must act the parts of an acid and be considered as form
ing an aluminate with part of the magnesia. This is the view
taken of it by Professor G. Rose, who gives the mineral the
formula (3 Mg, C) + (2 Mg, Al) + 24 H. As this mineral
is different in composition from any other, it has been named

LXV.    On the Appearances and Relative Positions of the

IT    is frequently  asserted as a fact not admitting of dispute,
    that when one vein traverses another, the severing is newer
than the severed vein; and, consequently, that the portions
of the latter lying on opposite sides of the former were once
united : but, if this be true, it necessarily follows that a per
fect and exact coincidence will be found between the dimen
sions and configuration of these parts; and also that the
portions of different veins divided by the same cross-vein will
be found to preserve, on both sides of            the same relative     it,                                 di

374,               Mr. Henwood         on the Rocks and Weins
we assume that a motion has taken place to such an extent
and in such direction as may be requisite, we may solve, at
least within certain moderate limits, the problem of any single
heave.    The difficulty, however, lies in the mutual connexion
of several heaves, for the motion which will reduce one series
of displacements to a tolerable continuity may be found to                  in
crease our difficulties respecting other heaves by the same
cross-vein.    It is therefore only by a comparison of several
intersections by the same cross-vein, at the same and at dif
ferent levels, that we can hope to arrive at truth or certainty.
In making this comparison I shall confine myself to examples
in which the identity of the veins is beyond dispute; and                       I
now proceed to the details which I think will supply ample
materials for the confirmation or rejection of this theory.
   (a.) At Wheal Bolton the middle lode dips towards the
south, and the south lode towards the north, yet the cross
course heaves both towards the right-hand,-the former 18
feet, and the latter 12 feet: and beside being so heaved, both
of them accompany the cross-course for several fathoms.
   (b.) At Stray Park the north lode dips towards the south,
and the south lode towards the north, yet at certain levels both
are heaved towards the right-hand by the Boundary cross
course, and also towards the left-hand by the Machine cross
course; at other levels, however, these lodes are simply                    in
tersected by the cross-courses.
   At 146 fathoms deep the south lode is 2 feet wide on the
western side of the Boundary cross-course, but on        eastern     its
side the lode       feet
                    is  6  breadth: thus whilst the south wall
                                 in
to of
   the lode seems merely intersected, the north one appears
        be heaved   4    feet.
   (c.) At Cook's-kitchen     Dunkin's lode dips        the south,
                                                            to
and the Middle Engine lode towards the north, but both are
heaved      the right-hand
            to                        by
                               the Little cross-course, which also
intersects one elvan-course on the north, and another on the
south      of
          the lodes, but heaves neither          of
                                             them.
   (d.) At North Roskear the Caunter lode dips southward,
and both the Engine and south lodes towards the north, but
the cross-course simply intersects the two last, whilst     heaves   it
the first    feet towards the left-hand.
   (e.)
            At 8
             Cardrew Downs the south lode dips          the north,
                                                                to
and the north lode towards the south, and between them                     is   an
elvan-course dipping south-west, from which several veins
strike off into the adjacent slate.   The lodes, the elvan-course,
and the veins        of
                  elvan are   traversed    all        by
                                            the Little flucan                   ;
but whilst the elvans are simply intersected, both lodes are
heaved towards the right-hand,-the former                  24
                                                 feet, and the

                 which form the opposite Walls                     of Cross-veins.                375
latter 15 feet.     In the same mine the Great flucan simply                                      in
tersects the same elvan-course and its off-shoots, whilst it
heaves the south lode 100 feet towards the right-hand.
     (f) At Wheal Unity Wood the flucan simply intersects
the elvan-course, whilst it heaves Pits-anvollar lode 21 feet,
Trefusis lode 12 feet, and the Little ore lode from 30 to 36
feet, all towards the left-hand.    The elvan and all three lodes
dip northwards.
   (g.) At Wheal Prudence the elvan-course and the north
lode dip to the north, and the south lode towards the south.
The cross-course heaves                     all   of
                                   them towards the right-hand,
the elvan 30 feet, the north lode         feet, and the south lode
                                                        9                                          a
distance   varying   from          feet18   to    30
                                             different levels.at
   (h.) At Polberrow the eastern cross-course heaves the Pye
and North Seal Hole lodes each          feet, and the South House
and Great Gossan lodes each                            12 9
                                         feet: the first two dip to
wards the    north,   and the two last towards the south, and all
of them      different angles, nevertheless they are
             at                                                heaved                all
towards the right-hand.

in  opposite directions; whilst Stevens's flucan,                    different     at
levels, heaves them           different distances, but always towards
                                  to

lode is heaved, respectively, 24 and 27 feet by the eastern
cross-course, which, at 140 fathoms deep, divides into two
veins. The heaves have been already particularized.  Those
by the western vein, both at 150 and 170 fathoms deep, are
30 feet; and of the heaves by the eastern, the distance is 9 feet
at 150 fathoms deep, 5 feet at 170 fathoms, and 7 feet at 180
fathoms. All the heaves, whether by the whole cross-course,
or by     its separate veins, are towards the left-hand.      By
Woolf’s cross-course, however, the same lode         heaved to               is

the flucan heaves them        towards the right-hand; but the
                                      all
distances are not generally alike for different lodes,       even                     or
for the same lode at different levels.
   (p.) At        18
                fathoms deep,       Duffield, the eastern cross
                                                 in
course simply intersects the south lode, whilst      heaves the              it
Little north lode feet towards the left-hand; between these
                       9
lodes, however, Holman's lode intersects the cross-course,
and heaves       feet towards the left-hand. All the lodes have
                it 3
a northerly inclination.
   (q.) At Fowey Consols, the cross-course simply intersects
Bone's and Jeffery’s lodes;     next heaves Crosspark lode to
                                            it
wards the   right-hand,   but different distances       different                at

                   which form the opposite Walls                                of Cross-veins.                     377
 depths: Williams's lode heaves the cross-course 4 feet to
 wards the left-hand; the cross-course then intersects Trathan's
 lode, and at some levels heaves it towards the right-hand; and
 lastly, it heaves the Black lode 11 feet towards the left-hand.
    (r.) At Tincroft the Old lode dips northward, and simply
 intersects the eastern                    cross-course.                        The       same cross-course
 then heaves Highburrow lode, which dips south, 1 foot to
 wards the right-hand; it next intersects a mass of granite,
and also an elvan-course which dips northward, but heaves
neither of them. It then crosses two granite veins, one dip
ping north and the other south, and afterwards Martin's lode,
                                                            at all
which dips north, heaving       three towards the right-hand.
On meeting Dunkin's lode,            fathoms deep, the cross          26
course      heaved
               is    feet towards the right-hand; whilst
                                   4                                                                                  at
84 fathoms the same cross-course heaves the same lode
4  feet also towards the right-hand; and lastly, the cross
course heaves the south lode, which dips northward  feet,                                                  2          in
the same direction.

position below the great masses of fossiliferous Caradoc
sandstones, and (evidently assimilating them in his mind to
the black schists of South Wales,              position appeared
nearly similar) sought earnestly for traces of fossils which
might justify the collocation of these Malvern shales with the
flaggy series of Llandeilo.
    In diligent and repeated examinations for the same object,
I  have been able to add many facts regarding the history of
these shales, their place in the Palaeozoic series, and their re
lation to the trappean masses; but it is only within this month
           I
that succeeded in extracting a single trace of fossil organi
zation from their innumerable laminae.       Perhaps but for the
accident of a bright sunshine falling on a long crumbling
 bank of the shales,                     I
                          might not have resumed what seemed a
 hopeless search. However, my good fortune prevailed, and
I   had the pleasure to collect in little weathered bits of the
 shale abundance of Agnosti and parts of minute Trilobites.                                  I
 must reserve till a period of more leisure the description of
 these treasures, only remarking that they offer no very obvious
 analogy with the Llandeilo fossils. The Trilobites are not the
 Asaphi or Trinuclei of Llandeilo; perhaps the Agnosti are
 equally peculiar. No Orbiculae, no Graptolites, no Euomphali
 (seldom wholly absent from the schists of Caermarthenshire)
 have been yet found here. Neither does there appear any
 marked analogy between the fossils of the Malvern shales and
 those well known in the Caradoc strata incumbent.            Upon
 the   whole,   believe itImay  be recommended to those who are
  reasoning on the classification of the most ancient fossiliferous
  strata of Wales, to reserve their final judgement till the Ord

    III. “Some Remarks on the Total Eclipse of the Sun on July 8th,
 1842.” By Francis Baily, Esq., Vice-President of the Society.
   It is well known to many members of this Society that I pro
posed to proceed to the Continent, during the last summer, for the
express purpose of observing the total eclipse of the sun which was
to take place on the morning of July the 8th, civil reckoning. This
object has been accomplished; and I flatter myself that an account
of that rare phaenomenon,     by an eye-witness, may be acceptable to
this meeting. A statement of the principal observations that I
made was communicated by me to one of the Vice-Presidents of
this Society, in a letter written at Milan within 48 hours after the
eclipse, whilst the circumstances were still fresh in my memory;
and they do not differ from those that I am now about to relate
more in detail, and which I am desirous here to place on record.
   A total eclipse of the sun, in any particular portion of the globe,
is an event of very rare occurrence, since only four or five of these
remarkable phaenomena are recorded as having been seen in Europe
during the last century; to which we may add another that was
fortunately seen at sea, by Don Ulloa.      But the accounts of these
several eclipses are by no means satisfactory, since they are dis
cordant in many particulars; which probably has arisen not only
from the sudden and unexpected appearances that occurred, but also
from the loose description that has been given of them, either by the
observers themselves or by those who drew up the accounts, and
perhaps did not fully comprehend the intention and meaning of the
authors.    The difficulty also is very much increased from the want
of   drawings  to represent the exact appearances seen, which are
always more readily understood by this method than by any verbal
description.
   During the present century another eclipse of this kind has taken
place in the United States of America, which was observed by Mr.
Ferrer; and a minute account of the same, together with a drawing
of its appearance, has been published in the sixth volume of the
Transactions of the American Philosophical Society.     These are the
only cases of interest that are on record since the invention of the
telescope, within which period we must necessarily limit our at
tempt to acquire any useful information relative to this remarkable
phaenomenon.      But I must proceed with my narrative.
   My original intention was to have taken up my station, for ob
serving the eclipse, at Digne, in the south of France; and I had pro
ceeded on my way thither till I arrived near Lyons, when I found
that I had a few days to spare; and as I had proposed to visit
Venice before my return home, I altered my route and resolved to
proceed in an easterly direction, along the line of the moon's sha
dow, till the day before the eclipse, when I proposed to halt at the
most convenient place that might offer. I therefore turned off
towards Chambery, and crossing the Alps at Mount Cenis, passed

      Mr. Baily   on the Total Solar Eclipse of July 8, 1842.        887
 through   Turin, Asti, and Alessandria, and arrived at Pavia about
 noon on  July  7th.
    As this place was directly on the central line of the moon's sha
 dow, I resolved at once to make it my head-quarters. I had intended
 to apply to the director of the university there, for the use of a con
 venient place where I might observe the eclipse; but I was agreeably
 anticipated in this respect by a visit from one of the Professors,
 who having heard of my arrival and my object, immediately and
 obligingly came to offer me the use of any one of the apartments in
 the university that might be considered most adapted for my pur
 pose. On accompanying him to the university with this object, I
 selected one of the upper rooms of the building, which was admirably
 adapted for making the observations that I had in view.        He then
very kindly expressed his readiness to furnish me with any instru
 ments at the university that I might require for my use. But I had
 taken with me from London the same 3%-feet telescope by Dollond
that I had formerly used in the annular eclipse of May 15, 1836, as
 already described in the tenth volume of the Memoirs of this Society;
and I therefore informed him that all I wanted was to be left alone du
ring the whole time of the eclipse, being fully persuaded that nothing
is so injurious to the making of accurate observations as the intru
sion of unnecessary company.        Acting upon this hint, he imme
diately took the key from the outside of the door and placed it in
the inside, and told me that I might lock myself in : but there was
no occasion for this precaution, for although I heard numerous foot
steps pass the door, in their way to an adjoining apartment, which
was also used as an observatory on this occasion, no one attempted
to enter the room in which I was located.
    At four o'clock in the morning of the eventful day I went to the
university, in order to prepare for the observation; and at that
early hour I found many of the students and official persons walking
about.    At sunrise a thin stratum of clouds was seen in the east
near the horizon, but the sun soon got above this obstruction, and
the remainder of the day was beautifully clear and serene; not a
cloud was to be seen in any part of the heavens, visible from my
window, during the whole time of the eclipse. It was as fine a day
as that which I had fortunately witnessed in Scotland, at the annular
eclipse of 1836.
    I had a very good observation of the commencement and the end
of the eclipse; but I did not pay any great attention to these se
condary objects, and as my chronometer was not adjusted to correct
mean time, these observations can be of no use, except as indicating
the duration of the eclipse, which, according to my reckoning, was
1h 56m 395.6 mean time.
    As the moon advanced towards her central conjunction with the
sun, I watched very carefully and with much anxiety the approach
of the border of the moon towards the still illuminated portion of
the sun, which was now rapidly assuming a fine crescent shape, the
precursor of total obscuration.    I used a red coloured glass, in order
to observe the phaenomenon, notwithstanding the remarks and ad

388                             Royal Astronomical Society.
vice to the contrary by an American observer; and the power of the
eye-glass was about 40.        When the total obscuration took place,
the coloured glass was removed.
   I at first looked out very narrowly for the black lines which were
seen in the annular eclipse of 1836, as they would probably precede
the string of beads. These lines however did not make their ap
pearance, or at least they were not seen by me.               But the beads
were distinctly visible; and on their first appearance            had noted                   I
down on paper the time of my chronometer, and was in the act of
counting the seconds in order to ascertain the time of their duration,
when I was astounded by a tremendous burst of applause from the
streets below, and at the same moment was electrified at the sight of
one of the most brilliant and splendid phaenomena that can well be
imagined; for at that instant the dark body of the moon was sud
denly surrounded with a corona, or kind of bright glory, similar in
shape and relative magnitude to that which painters draw round the
heads of saints, and which by the French is designated an auréole.
   Pavia contains many thousand inhabitants, the major part of whom
were at this early hour walking about the streets and squares, or
looking out of windows, in order to witness this long-talked-of phae
nomenon; and when the total obscuration took place, which was
instantaneous, there was an universal shout from every observer, which
“made the welkin ring,” and, for the moment, withdrew my atten
tion from the object with which I was immediately occupied.              I had
indeed anticipated the appearance of a luminous circle round the
moon during the time of total obscurity; but did not expect, from          I
any of the accounts of preceding eclipses that I had read, to witness
so magnificent an exhibition as that which took place.            I had ima
gined (erroneously as it seems) that the corona, as to            brilliant                   its            or
luminous appearance, would not              greater than that faint crepus

     The next day was spent                       in   the examination                   of
                                                                          the instruments and
localities          of   the Observatory                    Turin, under the auspices
                                                        of of                              M.                             of
Plana, and            in   the inspection                 the hill and church     the Superga.         of

 392               Royal Astronomical Society.
 M. Plana was extremely anxious that we should         observe the eclipse
 at the Observatory, where    every   facility depending on an ample
 supply of instruments, and  an accurate determination of time, could
be afforded us. I had, however, long before fixed on the Superga
 as a station from which I should desire to see, if possible, the grand
 phaenomena of a total eclipse as exhibited on a large tract of country.
 It may be proper here to mention that the Superga is the highest
point of an insulated cluster of hills, perhaps 800 feet above the Po,
and five miles from Turin.    It is completely surrounded by the plain
 of Piedmont, and commands a most remarkable view: on the east
 over the plain of Lombardy; on the north-east, of Monte Rosa and
the neighbouring high Alps; on the north, of the mountains of the
Val d'Aosta (Mont Blanc itself is hidden by them); on the west, of
 Monte Viso and the Dauphiny Alps; and on the south and south
 east, of the Maritime Alps and the Apennines; with the plain ex
tending from the foot of the hill to the bases of these mountains in
every direction.    As the eclipse was to be total for the Superga
itself and for the western and southern mountains, and partial for the
northern mountains, I had thought it possible that I might see in
great perfection the different phaenomena in the different parts of
the view. The sequel will show that in this respect I was disap
pointed, but that (by chance) a most important advantage was ob
tained by my adherence to this plan.       Finally, it was arranged that
Professor Forbes should make his observations at the Observatory,
and that I should go to the Superga.
    On the 7th, the observations to be made were fully discussed,
and the series of observations intrusted to each person were drawn
out in the form of written instructions.      The observations bearing
upon physical optics were principally consigned to Professor Forbes,
those of astronomical character to myself.         The unfortunate cir
cumstances of weather, however, rendered the former impossible,
and in some degree abridged the latter.
   The morning of the 8th, at one or two o'clock (civil reckoning),
was very dark and lowering : scarcely a star was visible.           I pro
ceeded, however, with a companion to the Superga, and reached it
at a short time before five o'clock.    Every facility for viewing the
eclipse from any part of the church or convent of the Superga that
I might select was offered me by the fathers of that establishment;
and, had my object been simply to view the country during the
eclipse, I should undoubtedly have stationed myself in the upper
gallery of the dome of the Superga.         But the platform in front of
the portico offered far greater facilities for the placing of my
telescope, and more of general convenience; and, by moving a few
steps, I could at any time command the whole plain.            I therefore
adopted the platform as my station.      I think it due to the courtesy
of the Italians to remark, that though many persons were present, I
did not receive the smallest interruption of any kind from any one.
The sun was clear, and I saw the beginning of the eclipse very well.
   The power which I used throughout the eclipse was about 27 (as
I have since found by the well-known method of comparing a distant

    Mr. Airy     on the Total Solar Eclipse                      of July 8, 1842.                         393
object   seen   in the       telescope       with    a near one seen                      without it).
This power was found very convenient.                       I had intended                occasionally
to use a higher power, but was prevented from doing so by the fol
lowing circumstance.    The dark glasses adapted to the higher
powers were made a little darker than was necessary at Greenwich;
not, however, so dark as to prevent the most delicate observation.
But, in consequence of the cloudiness of the day of the eclipse, the
sun was, for the most part, so faint, that he could scarcely be seen
when these higher powers, with their corresponding dark glasses,
were employed; and as the glass for the lowest power was necessa
rily still darker, it was useless to attempt to combine the eye-pieces
for the higher powers with the dark glass for the lowest power.
was therefore compelled to lay aside the higher powers.                   It is cer
tain, however, that the power which I used was sufficient for the
nicest observations which the state of the air permitted, as it showed
very well the atmospheric undulations on the limbs of the sun and
moon; and nothing smaller, of course, could be seen with certainty.
   The dark glass which was used on the power actually employed
was a combination of a purple and a green glass.                  It gave to the
sun's disc a faint yellow greenish tinge.
   As the eclipse advanced (the sun continuing unclouded),                       ob                   I
served a circumstance which I have remarked in every solar eclipse
that I have seen. It             is,
                               that the limb                of
                                                      the moon          very much     is
more   sharply   defined than the limb                  of
                                                   the sun. This            clearly            is
owing    to the difference      intensity
                                   of          lightof           of on

sun's disc, the intensity near the centre                the disc being much
greater than that near the limb, and the degradation very near the
limb, though rapid, being gradual.           speak

hue which I have remarked in other eclipses of nine or ten digits:
 I know not whether this was due to the cloudiness of the day, or
to the continued correction of my eye by reference to the light of
the candle.
    I saw no spots whatever on the sun's disc.
    About six minutes before the totality I specially recorded the re
mark that there was a slight undulation on the limbs, but that the
 cusps were perfectly sharp.     I cite this particular observation, be
 cause I find it noticed in pencil at the time; but I am quite certain
that the cusps were seen perfectly sharp at every other time. The
 general aspect of objects was now very gloomy.
    As the totality approached, the gloom increased very rapidly.
 About two minutes (or perhaps more) before the totality, my com
 panion exclaimed that it was darker towards the Val d'Aosta.            I
 immediately looked in that direction, and am satisfied that it was
 not darker there. The country, however, looked blacker on that
 side, partly, I think, because it is more encumbered with wood,
 and partly (perhaps) because the mountains are nearer than on the
 south side, and therefore have less of the whitish atmospheric tinge.
    At this time, and to the totality, the appearances were very
 awful.    The gloom increased every moment; the candle seemed to
blaze with unnatural brilliancy; a large cloud over our heads, whose
 appearance I had not particularly remarked, but which, I think, was
 of cumulo-stratus character, became converted into a black nimbus,
blacker, if possible, than pitch, and seemed to be descending ra
pidly;      its
             aspect became horribly menacing, and            could almost    I
imagine that      appeared animated.

imagination than the sight       that terrible cloud. The sun was very
                                        of
little clouded; his narrow crescent form could be seen with the
naked eye when the eyelids were partially closed; there was, how
 ever,  a dark cloud immediately above him, and fainter clouds about
him.     Immediately   before applying my eye       the telescope  toview                to

 their form was nearly that of saw-teeth in the position proper for a
 circular saw turned round in the same direction in which the hands
 of a watch turn : their height was certainly not greater than one
 fourth of the breadth of the ring, or probably a minute: the distance
 between the first and third was perhaps forty degrees or more on
 the moon's limb; their colour was a full lake-red, and their bril
liancy greater than that of any other part of the ring. On my call
ing attention to these, my companion saw them with the naked eye.
It will be remarked that the part of the limb in which the red flames
appeared was immediately in contact with the dark cloud of which
I  have spoken; and we attributed them to some irregularity in the
density of the cloud's edge.
    While engaged in watching the reappearance of the sun, I lost
the opportunity of observing how the ring and the flames disap
peared. Every luminous appearance, however, and every trace of
the remainder of the moon's limb, vanished as soon as the smallest
portion of the sun was uncovered.       No beads or irregularity of any
kind could be observed. The general illumination of the earth and
sky was restored with very great rapidity.     The clouds soon began
to cover the sun, and in a short time it was invisible.     In less than
half an  hour, a few drops of rain fell.
   My companion, who had better opportunities than l had of ob
serving the formation of the ring, &c., has given me the following
account :—
    “A   bright line seemed to form round the right side of the moon
before the  disappearance,    but not quite round, so that the ring was
not  complete:   but,  at the moment of the total disappearance, the
ends seemed    suddenly   to join and form the complete ring, brightest
on the left side,  and as if beams of light came out.       It continued
brightest below, and at one time disappeared on the upper side, but
a heavy black cloud was touching it there. Shortly before the re
appearance, the brightness increased on the upper side; and imme
diately before the reappearance there were little beams of flame
colour starting out. There was no defined edge to the ring: it
changed sensibly, being brightest first on the left side where the
sun had gone         in,
                    then below, and then    on the right side; the light
coming out      ateach place successively like little beams from the
moon's edge. There was no remarkable change          inthe colour     the    of
light till the little flame-coloured beams shot out for few seconds
before the reappearance. The general appearance           of a
                                                           the country
during the totality was very frightful; but every object,       the di all
stant hills, &c. &c., were distinctly visible; was like looking
                                               it                  ob        at

   The numerous persons who watched the eclipse from the Superga
appeared   to  notice with great interest the progress    of     its
                                                             phases               to
the  totality;  and when the sun was       actually hidden there burst
forth from them, first     low murmur and then loud sounds

plause.   Immediately after the restoration of the sun, the whole
crowd dispersed, and nobody seemed to regard with the smallest
interest the phases of decrease of the eclipse.
   The meteorological circumstances of the atmosphere were evi
dently much affected by the concealment of the sun. The air after
the totality appeared transparent (as it usually does when the
ground is cold); and there rested upon or near to the flanks of the
 mountains a series of stratified or cumulo-stratified cloud, at an ele
 vation of less than 2000 feet; with a lower surface very sharply
 defined and (as far as I could judge) most truly horizontal through
 the whole extent to which I could see them; and with a less regular
 upper surface: the depth of these clouds could not be more than
200 or 300 feet. They had not the smallest resemblance to the                                                ill
defined fog-clouds which hang about the mountains at all elevations
in rainy weather; nor to any other clouds that I have seen during
the day in these countries: I think that I have seen clouds in the
evening which resembled them more nearly than any others.
   After the termination of the eclipse the day became very hot,
and the aspect of the country became very similar to that which it
usually presents at this season of the year.
   It was not till some hours after my return to Turin that I found
that  MM. Plana and Forbes had not seen the moon at                     during                all
the totality.    The region     which the sun and moon ought

    Professor MacCullagh read the following note on some points in
 the Theory of Light.
I.—On        a Mechanical Theory which has been proposed                for the Erplana
      tion of the Phaenomena                 of Circular Polarization in Liquids, and of
      Circular and Elliptic Polarization in Quartz or Rock-crystal; with
      Remarks on the corresponding Theory of Rectilinear Polarization.
      The theory of elliptic polarization, which                 called upon  I feel myself
 to notice, was first stated by M. Cauchy, and has been made the sub
ject of elaborate investigation by other writers. That celebrated
analyst, conceiving (though without sufficient reason, as will pre
 sently appear) that he had fully explained the known laws of the pro
pagation of rectilinear vibrations by the hypothesis that the luminife
rous aether, in media transmitting such vibrations, consists of separate
molecules symmetrically arranged with respect to each of three rect
angular planes, and acting on each other by forces which are some
function of the distance, was led very naturally to imagine that he
would find the laws of circular and elliptic vibrations, in other media,
to be included in the more general hypothesis of an unsymmetrical ar
rangement.     Accordingly, in a letter read to the French Academy
on the 22nd of February, 1836, a letter to which he attached so much
importance that he desired it might not only be published in the Pro
ceedings, but also “deposited in the Archives” of that body (see the
Comptes rendus des Séances de l'Académie des Sciences, tom.            182),                             ii.   p.

    Thus, to say nothing for the present of the questions of disper
sion and absorption, it appears that M. Cauchy conceived he had
completely accounted for the facts of circular and elliptic polariza
tion, and that he had deduced the formulas “which serve to deter
mine the conditions and laws of these phaenomena.”                     But neither
in this letter, nor in any subsequent version* of his theory, has he
given the formulas themselves.             Nor has he told us the nature of
the calculations by which he was enabled to correct the received
opinion, and to prove that the vibrations in a ray transmitted along
the axis of quartz, or through oil of turpentine, are not rigorously
circular as Fresnel and others have supposed, but slightly elliptical.
Now—to take the case of quartz—if we consider that the vibrations
of a ray passing along the axis are in a plane perpendicular to                 and                        it,
if  we admit,        M. Cauchy always does

come    tothe conclusion that the vibrations           such ray are performed

 402            Royal Irish Academy: Prof. MacCullagh on a
 Physical Section of the British Association in Bristol (seeTransactions
 of the Sections, p. 18), that a mechanical account of the phaenomena
 still remained a desideratum which no attempts of mine had been
 able to supply.   I am not sure that on the first occasion I stated
 the precise nature of these attempts, though I incline to think                                                            I
 did; but I have a distinct recollection of having done so on the
 second occasion, in reply to questions that were asked me by some
 members of the Association*. Now, my first attempt to explain
 those equations, which was made almost as soon as I discovered them,
 actually turned upon the very idea which about the same time found
entrance into the mind of M. Cauchy—I mean the idea of an unsym
metrical arrangement of the aether. For as it was generally believed,
at that period, that the hypothesis of aethereal molecules symmetri
cally distributed had led, in the hands of M. Cauchy, to a complete
theory of rectilinear polarization in crystals (see his Erercices de
Mathématiques, Cinquième Année, Paris, 1830, and the Mémoires de
l’Institut, tom. x. p. 293), the notion of endeavouring to account for
the phaenomena of elliptic polarization, by freeing the hypothesis from
any restriction as to the distribution of the aether, would naturally
occur to any one who was thinking on the subject, no less than to
M. Cauchy himself. And though, for my own part, I never was
satisfied with that theory, which seemed to me to possess no other
merit than that of following out in detail the extremely curious, but
(as I thought) very imperfect, analogy which had been perceived to
exist between the vibrations of the luminiferous medium and those
of a common elastict solid (for it is usual to regard such a solid as a
rigid system of attracting or repelling molecules, and M. Cauchy has
really done nothing more than transfer to the luminiferous aether
both the constitution of the solid and differential formulas of its                                                   vi
bration), still I should have been glad, in the absence of anything
   * At the period of this meeting, M. Cauchy's letter on Elliptic Polariza
tion had been published for some months; but I was not then aware of its
existence.             Indeed   the letter appears not to have attracted                                any general
notice: for the theory which it contains was afterwards advanced in En
gland as a new one, and M. Cauchy has been lately obliged to assert prior                                      his

claim    it, through the medium    Prof. Powell.—See notes, pp. 400,405.

better, to find my equations supported by a similar theory, and their

Refraction, had indicated a “helicoidal arrangement,” or something
of that sort, as a probable cause of circular polarization (Mémoires
de l’Institut, tom. vii. p. 73); and as this was an hypothesis of
the same kind as the other, only not so general, I was prepared to
find that the supposition of an arbitrary arrangement, whatever
might be thought of its physical reality, would lead to equations of
the same form as those which I had assumed.             Upon trial, however,
 the very contrary proved to be the case, for though it was possible
 to obtain additional terms, containing differential coefficients of the
 third order, multiplied by the same constant C, yet this constant
 always came out with the same sign in both equations, whereas a
 difference of sign was essential for the expression of the phaenomena.
I   had no sooner arrived at this result, than I perceived it to be fatal
to the theory of M. Cauchy, and to afford a demonstration of its
insufficiency, not only in the particular application which I had made
 of   it,
        but       in        all
                    its applications.     For the hypothesis which         used                         I

 Mechanical Theory of Circular and Elliptic Polarization. 407
   The foregoing investigation does not differ materially from that
which I had recourse to in the beginning of the year 1836. To
render the proof more easily intelligible, and to get rid of M. Cauchy's
“third ray,” which has no existence in the nature of things, I have
suppressed the normal vibrations; a procedure which is not, in ge
neral, allowable on the principles of M. Cauchy.               It will readily
appear, however, that this simplification still leaves the demonstra
tion perfectly rigorous in the case of circular vibrations, and does
not affect             its
                 force when the vibrations are elliptical.        For      the                                   in

but by the scientific world generally, to have already afforded the
only satisfactory explanation of the laws of double refraction in the
common and well-known case where the vibrations are rectilinear.
This supposed explanation was obtained, as has been said, by re
stricting the application of M. Cauchy's principles to the hypothesis
of a vibrating medium arranged symmetrically, in which case it was
shown that the vibrations were necessarily rectilinear; and of course
the removal of this restriction was the only way in which it was
possible, on those principles, to account for the existence of circular
and elliptical vibrations.    Accordingly, when M. Cauchy perceived
that, on the hypothesis of unsymmetrical arrangement, the existence
of rectilinear vibrations became impossible, and that of elliptic vibra
tions, generally speaking, possible, he found it very easy to persuade
himself that he had obtained a new proof of the correctness of his
views, and a new and most important application of the fundamental
 equations by which his general principles were analytically expressed.
To have supposed otherwise would have been to admit that his ge
 neral principles were false.    If the elliptical or quasi-circular vibra
 tions which he was now contemplating were not capable of being
 identified with those which had been recognized in the phaenomena
 presented by quartz and the rotatory fluids—if their laws were es
 sentially or very considerably different—his theory would be incon
 sistent with a wide range of well-known facts, and, notwithstanding
 its so-called explanations     other laws, should

[of molecules] so essentially different from each other” as the
aethereal fluid and an elastic solid*. (See Annales de Chimie,
tom. xliv. p. 432.) The remark, however, did not meet with much
attention from mathematicians, who were, perhaps, not disposed to
scrutinize too closely any hypothesis which gave transversal vi
brations as a result.     Besides, the hypothesis appeared to go much
further, as it offered primá facie explanations of a great variety of
phaenomena; it was one to which calculation could be readily ap
plied, and therefore it naturally found favour with the calculator;
and as to M. Poisson's objection, it was easily removed by a change
of terms, for when the elastic solid was called an “elastic system,”
there was no longer anything startling in the announcement that
the motions of the aether are those of such a system. The hypo
thesis was therefore embraced by a great number of writers in every
part of Europe, who reproduced, each in his own way, the results
of M. Cauchy, though sometimes with considerable modifications.
Every day saw some new investigation purely analytical—some
new mathematical research uncontrolled by a single physical concep.
tion—put forward as a “mechanical theory” of double refraction,
of circular polarization, of dispersion, of absorption; until at length
the Journals of Science and Transactions of Societies were filled with
a great mass of unmeaning formulas. This state of things was partly
occasioned by the great number of “disposable” constants entering
into the differential equations of M. Cauchy and their integrals; for
it was easy to introduce, among the constants, such relations as
would lead to any desired conclusion; and this method was fre
quently adopted by M. Cauchy himself.             Thus, in his theory of
double (or rather triple) refraction, given in the works already cited
(p. 402), he supposes three out of his nine constants to vanish, and
assumes, among the other six, three very strange and improbable
relations, by means of which each of the principal sections of his
wave-surface (considering only two out of              three sheets)    re     its                                is

recognizes a closer connexion between nervous energy and the elec
trical power of certain fishes. This theory is strongly confirmed by
the abundant supply of nerves furnished to the electric organ,—by
the necessity of integrity in the nerve for producing the electric
effect, by the nervous exhaustion consequent on exercising the
power,     by cessation of the animal functions during extraordinary

    Feb. 21.-Mr. Pollock communicated a series of experiments on
 electric phosphorescence, which led him to infer that this phaenome
 non is due to induction, that it is the return of the induced particles
 to their normal condition, and that conduction, chemical change and
 colour operate against      production.its

lution of this oxide in an alkali deposits, on evaporation, crystals of
metallic tin; according to others it yields anhydrous crystals of
protoxide of tin. M. Fremy found that when protoxide of tin is dis
 solved in a small proportion of alkali, and the liquor is concentrated
 under the receiver of the air-pump, the alkali at a certain period
 seizes the water of the hydrate of the protoxide, which then becomes
 insoluble in the alkali, and is precipitated in the anhydrous state.
 When, on the contrary, the hydrate of protoxide of tin is dissolved
 in an excess of alkali, and the solution is rapidly evaporated, the
 protoxide is converted into stannic acid, which remains combined with
 the alkali and tin which is precipitated. It is therefore evident that
 it is the alkali in excess which causes the variation in the decompo
 sition.   The foregoing observations show that potash in solution
 may act upon the water of hydration of an oxide, and render it anhy
 drous; this experiment induced M. Fremy to examine the influence
 of other bodies in solution on the hydrate of protoxide of tin, and
 this examination led to the discovery of the different isomeric states
 of this protoxide. When hydrated protoxide of tin is boiled with
 a quantity of potash insufficient to dissolve                  period arrives  it,

fact that I had observed, and shown to Professor Owen and others,
spermatozoa within the mammiferous ovum. The ova were those
of the rabbit, taken twenty-four hours post coitum from the Fallopian
tube *.
      I
      have this day confirmed the observation; several ova from the
Fallopian tube of another of these animals, in a somewhat earlier
stage, having presented spermatozoa in their interior: i.e. (as in the
first observation) within the thick transparent membrane (“zona pel
lucida”) brought with the ovum from the ovary.

CHEMISTs
  which occur so abundantly in the vegetable                                          kingdom,
into two kinds; those which give black and those which
give green precipitates with salts of iron. The propriety of
this distinction has of late been called in question by Ber
zelius, who seems to think that the tannic acid in       plants                   all
essentially the same; and that the green and gray colours                                      of is
the precipitates with salts              of
                                iron are owing       the presence           to
of free acid.   Professor  Liebig  appears  also    hold similar        to            a
opinion.    Berzelius states      116th      his Rapport Annuel

 blue, and acids gray or green. A few experiments which                                             I
  have made have, however, given somewhat different results
  from those of Cavallius.
     A solution of the tannin of catechu was prepared by mace
  rating a large quantity of catechu in a very little cold water;
  it was therefore quite free from catechin. A portion of this
  solution was allowed to remain for some days in contact with
  a quantity of iron chips; it assumed a dirty, grayish black                               co
  lour, which, however, did not at all resemble the blue-black
  colour which nut-galls, oak, bark, &c. exhibit when similarly
 treated. The precipitate did not become green when a little
 acetic acid was added to                it,
                                       but       dissolved

kino, larch, birch and alder barks, &c., are wholly unfit for
this purpose. Indeed the only salt of iron which gives pretty
nearly the same coloured precipitates with either species of
tannin is the acetate, but even these, though at first bluish
black in the case of the green tannins, become in a day or two
grayish black, and their reactions with the sulphate, chloride
and nitrate of iron have no resemblance whatever to those of
the black tannins. The old distinction, therefore, which di
vides the astringents into those which give black, and into
those which give green precipitates with the inorganic salts of
iron, appears, so far as it goes, to be perfectly just, as these
precipitates are not convertible into each other, as affirmed by
M. Cavallius. There                     is,
                                  however, good reason for believing

                              repeated digestions with animal char
coal and successive       crystallizations.    The crystals were then
perfectly colourless and possessed the silky lustre                  gallic                    of
acid, with which acid their reactions with salts                 iron and                of

lead. It precipitated as a yellow, slightly crystalline powder,
and was also dried at 212°F.

     0-803 salt gave 0.456 oxide and 0.142 metallic lead =
75-84 per cent. oxide of lead.

   Now the bibasic gallate of lead       C7H O” + 2 PbO contains
76-69 per cent. oxide of lead; therefore there can be no doubt
that it was the salt analysed, and that gallic acid, therefore,
occurs to a considerable extent ready formed in sumach.
     I next proceeded to examine the tannin. In order to ob
tain the tannin of sumach free from gallic acid,             macerated a     I
very considerable quantity of sumach in a very little cold
water, filtered the liquid, and threw down the tannin it con

422                                Dr. Stenhouse             on some
    These results again agree with the numbers                                   of      hydrated
gallic acid.
    The bibasic gallate of lead      was also formed with another
portion of the acid in the way already described.
   I. O.690 salt gave 0.153 oxide and 0.3448 lead = 76.18
per cent. oxide.
    II.O-7415 salt gave 0-1745 oxide and 0.3635 lead = 76.34
per cent. oxide.
   There can be no doubt, therefore, that the acid produced
by the action of sulphuric acid on the tannin of sumach is the
gallic acid, precisely as is the case with the tannin of galls.
Another portion of the tannin of sumach precipitated also by
sulphuric acid, and which had been freed as much as possible,
by being washed and compressed, from any adhering acid,
was kept well moistened in an open vessel for more than five
weeks at a temperature of about 70°F. . It readily yielded
crystals of gallic acid when treated with alcohol and aether in
the way already described. Sumach, therefore, appears to ap
proach the nature of nut-galls more closely than any of the
other astringent substances.        This fact is well known to Tur

however, it reddens it strongly.       It consists of at least two
substances, one of which only is soluble in hot alcohol, so that
they may be easily separated by this means. They both
dissolve very readily in alkalies, and decompose the carbonates
when assisted by heat. When saturated with ammonia and
rendered neutral by digestion, they give dark brown precipi
tates with salts of silver, copper, iron, lead, barytes and lime.
Their alkaline solutions are dark brown, and they are com
pletely precipitated by acids. These humus-like substances
are produced by the action of the acids on the tannin only,
for on boiling gallic acid with concentrated muriatic acid for
                     I

them. I am at present engaged in their further investigation.
  Valonia.-The next # the astringent matters examined
was valonia. It is the acorn of the Quercus AFgilops, and is
imported in considerable quantities from the Levant for the
use of the tanners. The dried extract of valonia prepared
like that of sumach, when destructively distilled, gave no indi
cation of pyrogallic acid.          Valonia was next examined for
gallic acid. A strong solution of it was precipitated by glue,
and the clear liquid evaporated to an extract and heated with
spirits of wine. The spirits of wine were distilled off, and the
residue treated with aether exactly as sumach had been. A very
small quantity of crystals was obtained.          They exhibited the
reactions of gallic acid on salts of iron and other reagents,
and when distilled yielded crystals of pyrogallic acid... I have
every reason to believe that these crystals were gallic acid,
though from the smallness of their quantity                     I
                                                          was unable to
subject them to analysis. Valonia, therefore, may be regarded
 as containing a little gallic acid, but

 liquid which passed into the receiver was nearly colourless,
 and did not give the least indication          pyrogallic acid. The

 tannin of   valonia appears, therefore, essentially different from
 that of  nut-galls.
     Oak Bark.-The extract of oak bark when dried and                                 di

considerable       quantities, such as six and eight pounds,                 did                 I
not succeed in the course of several trials in                obtaining      any
crystals of gallic acid.           I apprehend, therefore, that if oak
bark contains any gallic acid at all, it must exist in very mi
nute quantity. The tannin of oak bark when precipitated by
sulphuric acid had a reddish brown colour. When subjected
to distillation it gave no indication of pyrogallic acid.                   The
tannin was also boiled with dilute              sulphuric  acid. It became
darker coloured and nearly insoluble either in hot or cold
water.    ... Itwas     little more soluble, though very slightly so,

   In order to determine the atomic weight         -  of the acid, I
formed the bibasic gallate of lead.
   I. O-706 of this salt gave 0.3325 lead, and 0.1802 oxide =
76°25 per cent. oxide of lead.
   II.  0.887 salt gave 0.315 lead and 0.340 oxide of lead =
76.58 per cent oxide.
   Now the bibasic gallate of lead C7 HO94-2 Pbo contains
76-69 per cent oxide of lead; there can, therefore, be no doubt
that it was the salt analysed, and that gallic acid occurs to a
considerable extent ready formed in divi-divi.
   Sulphuric acid throws down a very scanty dark brown pre
cipitate, even in highly concentrated solutions of divi-divi.
When dried and distilled, it did not yield any trace of pyro
gallic acid, and left a very bulky charcoal.           The tannin of
divi-divi  appears,  therefore,   essentially different from that of
nut-galls.
      r. Harvey informs me that a few years ago some calico
printers endeavoured to employ divi-divi as a substitute for
galls, but the large quantity of mucilage it contained rendered
it unfit for this purpose.
   It is at present pretty extensively employed in the tanning
of leather, as the quantity of tannin it contains is considerable,
and the presence of mucilage is not injurious to that process.
   Gum Kino.—The species of kino which I examined was the
               sº.
African variety. I was unable to detect in it any trace of
gallic acid.                acid threw down the tannin of kino as
a  bulky  dark red  precipitate.    When distilled, it gave scarcely
any volatile products, and no trace of pyrogallic acid. When
digested with nitric acid, gum kino was wholly converted into
oxalic acid.
    Catechu.--It was the light-coloured cubical variety of ca
techu that I employed.        It does not contain any gallic acid,
but catechin and a     variety  of tannin which gives olive green
precipitates with salts of iron.      Sulphuric acid throws down
the tannin of a brownish yellow colour.          When boiled with
dilute  sulphuric  acid, it becomes dark brown. Like the tannin
of oak bark, it is insoluble either in cold or boiling water.
When boiled in strong alkaline solutions, it only dissolves to
a very small extent. It is also insoluble in alcohol and aether.

When distilled, the tannin gave no indication either of pyro
gallic acid or of
  Catechin, which is the part of catechu insoluble in cold
water, when distilled, yielded the pyrocatechin of Zwenger in
considerable quantity. So far as I examined
appeared
mist.

through them, when they are made               touch each other with
out  being   removed from the      liquid.
   This effect has generally been ascribed                 power sup       to   a
posed      to   be
                 acquired               by

simply completing the circuit, and has been called “polariza
tion of the electrodes.”
   Becquerel was the first who advanced the opinion, that the
effect was due        the alteration produced
                      to                             the liquid       in
                                                                      the                       by
current causing decomposition.          He supposed that the current
was consequence

produced        the positive and negative surfaces; but

 found that the most powerful acids and alkalies are incapable
 of producing         current, unless they readily undergo some
                      a
 other  change     than that which takes place when            acid and               an
alkali combine            as
                        such.       has often been shown, that sul

 428                  Mr. Arrott on   some new
incapable   of producing this effect; iodic, chloric, chromic, or,
 as in the beautiful arrangement of Becquerel, nitric acid, with
 an alkali, produce a powerful current, but in these cases the
action is very different from that which takes place in simple
neutralization of an acid by an alkali.
    I have observed, that a current is produced in many cases
where, from the nature of the liquids, no current can be sup
posed to arise either from the union of an acid and an alkali,
or from the action of the liquids on the metals employed.
        I
 Thus found, that solutions of a per- and protosalt of iron,
produced a current when they were allowed to touch each
other, and also made to communicate by means of platina;
the persalt becoming deoxidized and the protosalt oxidated.
    It seemed that in this case the current was due to the       oxi
dation and deoxidation of the liquids, by means of the ele
ments of water which was decomposed, and it appeared            pro
bable that, if substances were used capable of exerting a
greater attraction for the oxygen and hydrogen, a propor
tionally greater effect would be obtained. With this view,
I  tried solution of chlorine, and found that the effect was very
much increased.      I next tried iodine in solution in water, and
also in iodide of potassium:   the effect was very feeble; and this
is exactly what we ought to expect, for iodine has nearly an
equal tendency to unite with oxygen and hydrogen, as appears
from the mode in which it decomposes water.               I was not
aware at the time of making these experiments, that Schoen
bein had obtained the current from chlorine.
    We have an extremely simple and beautiful illustration of
these actions in the case of salts of iron.       If two tubes be
stopped at one end with plaster of Paris, and filled one with
per- and the other with protosulphate of iron, and both im
mersed in a vessel containing dilute sulphuric acid, on adding
red prussiate of potash to the persalt, and sulphocyanide of
potassium to the other, no change takes place; but if we con
nect the two solutions by means of a slip of platina foil, we
have instantly indications of the oxidation of the one, and de
oxidation of the other.     I have also constructed an apparatus
in the form of a  battery,  which, while it serves to illustrate the
action in question, may, I think, prove both convenient and
economical as an instrument of research in ordinary galvanic
experiments.     It consists of six small circular jars, within
which are fixed tubes of baked clay, or porous earthenware.
Small cylinders of platina foil, 0.6th inch diameter, and 1.5
inch long, were placed in the porous tubes, and outside these
larger cylinders of 1-8th inch diameter, and 15th inch long.
The whole was then formed into a series, by connecting the

                                 Cases      of Voltaic Action.                               429
outer    cylinder of the first jar with the inner one of the second,
and        on; the porous tube was then filled with strong nitric
          so
acid, and the jar with solution of sulphuret of potassium.
The arrangement is exactly similar to Daniell's constant bat
tery, except that the metallic surfaces are entirely of platina.
     With an instrument of the above dimensions,               have ob     I
tained by means of a voltameter, 0:5th cubic inch of the mixed
gases in a minute, and that action continues for some hours,
with very little diminution.
      Ifind that the substances capable of producing a current
 in similar circumstances, are very numerous; for example, per
 and protosalts of iron, tin, and manganese, an alkaline sul
 phuret hyposulphite, hypophosphite or a hydracid on the one
  side, and chlorine or chromic or nitric acid on the other.
     The intensity of the effect                        is,
                                           however, very various                              in
  these different combinations; thus, with salts          iron      very
                                                                     of            it   is
  feeble; while with chlorine                       or
                                         nitric acid and an alkaline
  sulphuret, the intensity        such, that the induction

     The mode          which the experiments were performed was

                                            baked clay was cemented
  inside   awine glass; the respective liquids were then poured
  into this vessel and into the glass, till they stood         the same    at
  level;      this way they were
               in                      free liquid contact, while their
                                                   in
  actual mixture proceeded with extreme slowness; metallic
  plates, which were              in

  into the  solutions;   the   plates had been carefully cleaned with
  nitric acid, then with potash, and washed with water.

430                 Mr. Arrott   on some new
     In order to prove this, and also to show that the effect is
 not  dependent   on any particular state of the metals, a porous
  vessel was filled with a mirture of strong solutions of proto
 and per-sulphates of iron; this vessel was then placed in
 another filled with the same mixture, a platina plate was
 plunged into each vessel, and the circuit completed by a deli
 cate galvanometer; not the slightest effect was produced; the
 plates were then put in communication with the poles of a
 common battery, and the amount of current which passed
 measured by means of a voltameter. No gas was evolved in
 the solutions, nor was any iron reduced, but the persulphate
 increased in quantity at one side, and the protosulphate at
 the other. When 80 measures of gas were collected, the bat
 tery was removed, and the plates being connected by the gal:
 vanometer as at the beginning of the experiment, a powerful
 current was produced in a direction the reverse of that of the
 battery; the effect was the same whether the same or fresh
 plates were used, and if they were simply washed with water,
they might be moved from one vessel to the other, without
producing the slightest effect on the current, provided their
 connexion with the galvanometer was also changed.             The
 arrangement was again connected with the battery, in such a
 manner that the current should move in the solutions in the
 opposite direction to the former battery current, 80 measures
 of gas were again collected, and the battery being removed,
not the slightest current was observed on connecting the
plates with the galvanometer, but every thing was in the same
state as at the commencement of the experiment. The power
of the solution to produce the current gradually dimi
nishes, but is not entirely destroyed until the second or return
current becomes equal in amount to the first. The quantity
of the return current cannot be measured correctly, without
using the battery to enable it to pass quickly; because, from
the extreme slowness of the action towards the end of the
experiment, the solutions unavoidably mix, and thus cause
great error in the amount. A similar experiment was tried
with nitric acid, containing a large quantity of the lower oxides
of nitrogen with precisely similar results.
    Where the circuit is entirely metallic, but not homoge
neous, we have also a return current; for the heat produced
in a thermoelectric arrangement causes a current the reverse
of that which produces  it;   but we cannot    inthis case deter
mine the amount, from the impossibility   of   retaining the heat
produced, and  of   preventingit   from extending    tothose parts
which   oughtto   remain  cold;  the same  may      be
                                                     the case also

in ordinary chemical action; but here the result is modified

when Cl is added to KO, no oxygen is evolved; but this dis

produce a new arrangement of the molecules of the substance
with which it is in contact, as in the case of platina with oxy

intensity of the attraction of    atoms, and this arrangement

they stood at an angle of 90°, and even to give a smart, stinging
shock, it was obvious that the insulation of the galvanometer
had prevented the escape of the electricity, and though it was
passing off at the other end of the wire that remained coiled
up, yet still so considerable an accumulation had taken place,
that every part of the galvanometer, including the needle, was
highly charged; and that consequently by the law of similar
states the needle placed itself at right angles to the frame of
the galvanometer, being equally repelled by both                  ends, and                   its

1.       IN
          several communications presented to the Royal So
        ciety, and printed in the Philosophical Transactions, it
has been my endeavour to show that the remarkable process
effecting the division and subdivision of what is usually termed
the “yelk” in the mammiferous ovum, is to be recognised in
other cells; and nowhere more distinctly than in certain states
of the corpuscles of the blood. In proof of this, I gave the de
lineations, figs. 1 to 5, along with many others. Figs. 1, 2, 3
                          represent blood-corpuscles (cells) of
                          the Sparrow. 1. The nucleus single :

  2. Such having been my views, it was very satisfactory to
meet with the following confirmation of them. In a lecture
                             delivered a few weeks since at the College
                             of Surgeons, Professor Owen exhibited
                             the sketches 6 to 10, in a thesis by Dr.
                   9         Bagget, representing successive stages in

    3. Professor Rudolph Wagner observed that the size of the
blood-corpuscles in the naked Amphibia is “so much the
larger, the longer the gills continue in the larval state.” Thus
the blood-corpuscles are larger in the Newt than in the Frog.
He hence conjectured that the Proteus and Siren, because
they permanently have both gills and lungs, being there
fore permanently larvae,         would be found to have the largest
blood-corpuscles.        In the Proteus he had the opportunity of
seeing the idea realizedf.—This connexion between the size
of the blood-corpuscles and a larval condition of the animal,
I  believe has not been explained.
    4. On first seeing the large cells in the mammiferous ovumf,
I  was struck with the resemblance they bore to the corpus
cles or cells of the blood in, for instance, the Batrachia; which
was also remarked by Dr. Roget on seeing my delineations of
the former: and              I
                         have since (§ 1, 2) shown them to be per
petuated by the same means. Finding also in the blood of the
 mammiferous embryo corpuscles or cells (figs. 4, 5) like the
ordinary blood-corpuscles or cells of the adult Batrachia, &c.,
I  conceived that the difference between the condition of the
 blood-corpuscles in the embryo and in the adult of the same
 animal, was referable to a difference in the degree of their
development as cellsš.
    5. Now there are facts,                  I
                                     think, which leave little doubt
that the blood-corpuscles—not            only in the embryo, but at
 all  periods      of
                   life—are descended from the two cells consti
 tuting the foundation                 of
                                 the new being         the ovum; cells
                                                                 in
 arising out       previously existing cells,

    6.  When tracing the early stages                   in
                                                 the formation      the     of
 embryo,    I  showed that,             as
                                   the cells thus increase      number,in
they diminish          their size. Have we any proof that this

LXXVI.               On   a   double Rainbow.       By HENRY BowMAN, Esq.
  To       the   Editors      of   the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.

   But the most remarkable phaenomenon attending this storm
was    double rainbow, which appeared during and after
        a                                                                                                     a
smart thunder-shower about        o'clock.   The primary bow,

vivid, but the latter soon vied with     until the two appeared       it,
with  nearly equal  brillancy.

                      seemed                   both extremities,                 at
and     occupy perhaps 120°
           to                     circle.   Within the primary
                                                      of   a
bow, counted two

                      three reflexions     supplementary   bows,            or
consisting chiefly                of
                    red and green rays. The bows were seen
against   dense mass
                a       cloud,       fine neutral tint, and what
                                        of                 of    a

       Mr. Henwood         on the opposite Walls       of Cross-veins.         443
strongly attracted my attention was, that the intermediate
space between the two bows was of a different shade, being
more the colour of Indian ink than neutral tint, and was con
siderably deeper in tone than the portion of cloud either
within the primary or without the secondary bow. The whole
together had the effect of a broad circular riband, bordered
 on each side with the prismatic colours.      The alteration in
 the tint of the cloud was so perfectly coincident with both the
 bows, as to leave no doubt of the necessary connexion be
 tween the two phaenomena.
   I  cannot suppose it to have been an accidental accumula
 tion of cloud in that particular region, but imagine it to have
 some connexion with the phaenomena of light and reflexion
 or refraction. This singular effect continued nearly as long
 as the rainbows were visible, viz. about 4 or 5 minutes.
    The masses of cloud seemed to accumulate towards the
 centre of the circle, and also at some distance on the outside
 of the secondary bow, though this probably was only an acci
 dental coincidence, but in effect it was as though the clouds
had been partially withdrawn from both sides of the double
band, and collected in the space between the two bows.

       LET  us now apply to the intersections of two or more
         lodes, or other veins, by the same cross-vein, the same
laws which have been assumed to prevail when there is but a
single intersection.
    (1.) In the event of a horizontal movement, any number
of veins contained in the mass of rock displaced, should be
always heaved to the same distance in every instance, and
for the same extent at all levels: but this result never occurs
 (a, d, e,f, g, h, i, m, &c.).
    But, although a horizontal motion will not accurately apply,
as     itsresults will not agree with the order observed,     will,       it
nevertheless, produce effects bearing         nearer resemblance

 heaved to the opposite side. On the other hand, of the cross
 veins which traverse two or three lodes each, 8.8 per cent.
 simply intersect one of the lodes, and heave the rest. And in
 almost innumerable instances, as at Dolcoath, Cook’s kitchen,

course, which dips N.E. 50°, and also Glover's lode, which
dips S. 50°–80°; whilst it heaves Paul's lode, which dips
N.W. 50°–70°, from 15 to 18 feet at different levels, and
Michell's lode, which dips S. 80°, 3 feet, and both of them
towards the right-hand (i
    We have here two veins, the elvan and Glover's lode, dip
ping in opposite directions, and both simply intersected; and
two others which have also opposite inclinations, and are, never
theless, heaved in the same direction, but to unequal distances.
    Now a horizontal motion (1.) would have heaved them all
the same distance, and in the same direction; and a vertical
 movement (2.) would have heaved Glover's and Michell's lodes
 in one direction, and the elvan-course and Paul's lode in the
 opposite: whilst a motion on the line of inclination of Glover's
 lode would have occasioned a heave of the elvan-course, as
 .
 well as of Paul's and Michell's lodes; on the other hand, if
 the line of elevation or subsidence had coincided with the dip
 of the elvan-course, it must inevitably have heaved Glover's
 lode (which has an opposite dip to the elvan), together with
  Michell's and Paul's lodes.
   We     have thus, within a very few fathoms, two sets of facts
           contradictory to each other, and to         the directions  all
 of  motion we have yet assumed: nor does any circumstance
indicate that any other motion could                     be
                                             substituted with greater
probability        overcoming the difficulty.
                  of
    (B.) At Cardrew Downs, two elvan-courses dip W. 50°–
 60°: both        of
                  them are intersected, both                      by
                                                   the Little and the
 Great flucans, but they are not heaved          either.      by
                                                           The south
 lode dips    N.  60°–80°, and the north lode dips          68°–82°.          S.
 The Little flucan heaves the former 24 feet          50, and 60 fa    at
                             80 30
 thoms deep, and           feet    100 fathoms; and the latter
                                         at                                                 15
 feet at 50, 70, and       fathoms deep, and      feet            12
                                                              fathoms.       at   60
 All the heaves are towards the right-hand.
    Now    if  the heaves had been consequences             horizontal       of
motion (1.), not only would                       all   of
                                            them have been           the               of
 same extent, but the elvan-courses would have been heaved                                  as
 well as  the lodes.    the motion had been
                            If                  vertical one (2.), the

 lodes would have been heaved          opposite directions, and both
                                               in
 the elvans would have been heaved also. As, however, the
 elvans are not heaved, any motion must have been parallel
 to  their inclination        Pl. IV. fig. 11). Now,
                             (s

discrepancy between the computed and observed results is
surely inconsistent with accidental fluctuation (e).
   (C.) At Wheal Unity Wood the Great elvan-course dips
N. 40°–50°: Trefusis                      id:
                             also dips N. 66°–82°; the Little
Ore lode likewise dips N. 52°–60°; and Pits-an-vollar lode
inclines in the same direction 60°–70°.      The flucan simply
intersects the elvan-course; whilst it heaves Trefusis lode 36
feet at 26 fathoms deep, and 30 feet at 36 fathoms; the
Little Ore lode 12 feet at 60 fathoms deep, and Pits-an-vollar
lode 21 feet at the same level. In all these cases the heaves
are toward the left-hand.
   The elevatory action, if any, must of course have been
parallel to the dip of the simply-intersected vein, the elvan.
Now in order that a motion in this direction should produce
a heave of 36 feet in Trefusis lode at 26 fathoms deep, the
extent of the movement must be from 85 to 90 feet; whilst to
i.
produce a heave of 30 feet, in the same lode, at 36 fathoms,
a motion of only about 55 in the same direction would be                                            re
            But an elevation of 90 feet, in a direction parallel to
the underlie of the elvan, would produce a heave of 21 feet
in the Little Ore lode at 60 fathoms deep, and one of 55 feet
would occasion a heave of 12 feet; whereas the same quantities
of motion, acting in the like direction on Pits-an-vollar lode at
60 fathoms, would respectively cause heaves of 45 and 27 feet.
   Thus, in order to the production of the observed phaeno
mena, we have at Trefusis lode these scarcely compatible con
ditions:—either the direction of the motion was the same at
both, and        its
                extent different,    the extent     or
                                                   motion was the       of
same      both, and its direction different.

  In     the foregoing examples the elvan-courses are the simply
intersected veins: it may now be desirable to examine a few
in which the unheaved veins are lodes.
     (D.) At Fowey Consols, at 90 fathoms deep, the cross
course simply intersects Bone's and Jeffery's lodes; but at
 95 fathoms, where Crosspark lode is in two veins, it heaves
one of them 9, and the other 15 feet towards the right-hand,
and at 200 fathoms, where there is only one lode, it is heaved
 2 feet in the same direction (q).
     The vein of Crosspark lode, which in dip most closely ap
proximates to the unheaved lodes (Bone's and Jeffery’s), is
heaved further, whilst the other vein, which differs most from
them in inclination, is heaved the smaller distance; and yet
the difference in the inclinations of these veins is only about
 three degrees.      Now, taking their mean dip and the direction
 of the movement to be parallel to Bone's and Jeffery’s lodes,
 the extent of motion requisite to produce a heave of 9 feet
 would be about 26 fathoms; but, to obtain a heave of 15 feet,
 an elevation of nearly 39 fathoms in the same direction would
 be requisite. Applying these directions and extents of move
 ment to the lode at 200 fathoms deep, where it has a flatter
 inclination, a motion of 26 fathoms would cause a heave of
 30 feet, and one of 39 fathoms a heave of 39 feet: the actual
 heave, however, is only 2 feet.
     Here, then, we have, in one case, that lode heaved furthest
 which, according to the theory, ought to have been heaved
 the least; and in the other a heave of only 2 feet, whereas
 the hypothetical motion demands one of 30 or 39 feet.
     For the present I pass the consideration of the heave of this
 same cross-course by Williams's lode, as it will be again ne
  cessary to advert to it (V.—3).
      (E.) At Stray Park the two lodes have opposite dips, and
 both are intersected by the same cross-courses.         Now a hori
 zontal motion (1.) would have caused similar heaves in both
               be all
 lodes at       levels.     vertical motion (2.) would have caused
                                    A
  them   to     heaved                     all
                                levels, and everywhere
                                    at                       opposite        in
  directions.     Any movement parallel      the dip     oneto  them    of        of
   (3.), would, for the most part, have simply intersected,                            or   at
  any rate but slightly heaved it”; whilst       effects         its
                                                            the other        on
  lode would have been much greater.         Lastly, rotatory mo        a
  tion (4.) would have produced results constantly increasing
in    magnitude       the spot was more remote from the neutral
                             as
  point  or  centre           of
                        motion.

450               Mr. Henwood       on the Rocks and Weins
  Let us compare these demands of theory with the facts ob
served:—At
108 fms. deep, both lodes are simply intersected by one cross-course.
162    ...     both lodes are heaved to the left-hand by one cross-course,
                   and to the right by the other.
}.                both lodes are simply intersected by both cross-courses.
198    ...        both lodes are simply intersected by one cross-course.
   Similar results, at the same levels in both lodes, whether
intersected by one or both of the cross-courses, appear in
every instance; except at 146 fathoms deep, and there one
lode is simply intersected, whilst the other is heaved towards
the left-hand.
    These facts seem utterly irreconcilable with the result of mo
tion in any one single direction that can possibly be assumed.
    But we have not always simple intersections to indicate the
directions in which any elevatory forces must have acted. In
the absence of the guidance such examples afford, it will be
 requisite to ascertain whether the observed conditions may or
 may not be fulfilled by motions which are neither horizontal,
vertical, nor yet coincident with the dips of any of the veins,
 but oblique to them all.
    Very little consideration will convince us that heaves in the
 same direction, but of very different distances, may in this
 manner be effected by motion of the same extent and direc
tion; as it will act on the lodes according to the coincidence
 or obliquity between their dips and the direction of the move
 ment.    Such a state of things, arbitrarily selected in order to
 suit the circumstances, may often be applied to the heaves of
 two lodes by the same cross-vein, when in the same direction,
 but of unequal distances. . But the sufficiency or insufficiency
 of this hypothesis is tested by        by
                                       affording,    not, or   third,

the effect of such a motion, it is necessary to have particulars
at different distances, on both sides of the presumed centre.
These details may be either the directions and distances of
heaves of different lodes at the same level, or of the same lode
at several levels.
   Ithas been already seen (4.) that a curvilinear motion will
only apply to heaves which progressively increase in magni
tude, or to those which are in opposite directions in the same
vein at different depths, or at the same levels, if the veins be
different.
  No example of a progressive increase in the extent of a
heave has been recorded.
  At the United Mines (m), Skues's flucan heaves 7 lodes,
which occur in regular sequence towards the right-hand;
and 7 others, which also follow each other in succession,
towards the left-hand.     Of the first seven, 2 dip towards the
north, 1 is perpendicular, and 4 dip south; of the second seven,
1 dips north and 6 dip south.
   As        all
           the lodes                     on
                          one direction from     given point are                  a
heaved towards the right-hand, and               those on the other        all
towards the   left,    this had been occasioned
                                 if                           rotatory                 by  a
motion, the lodes furthest from the neutral point, axis,                                                    or
centre     motion, would have suffered
             of                                 movement progress      a
ively increasing        extent:   consequently    the magnitude                                             of
the heaves   ought     increase  to in

     one cross-vein and    heave    the other.a
      Of     55
           lodes, each traversed     two cross-veins, producing
 110 intersections, there are    heaves.               90
                                           Now this hypothesis
 would   require  that every lode should     heaved     opposite            be              in
 directions           by
                 the two cross-veins intersecting it; but this                                              is

454.           Mr. Henwood      on the Rocks and Weins
the case with only 42 of them; and the remaining 48 are
heaved in similar directions.     Thus 46.6 per cent. counte
nance the supposed law, and 53.4 per cent. contradict it; and
consequently the evidence against it preponderates.
    Suppose, then, a series of heaves of the same lode, in the
same direction, by different cross-veins: these must therefore
be occasioned by successive steps; or the masses of rock
which contain it must be supposed to have suffered a series
of elevations each greater than the preceding; the first step
being next to the unmoved rock. Thus, at Polladras Downs
 (o), a series of elevations, successively increasing as we go
westward, will afford that superficial explanation which we
have already seen (G.) is contradicted by a more minute              in
vestigation. A similar succession of movements will also apply
to the Old lode at Poldory (United Mines) (i m), and a like
explanation will apply to Wheal Falmouth.
   At Cook's-kitchen (c), a system of elevations augmenting
as they are followed eastward will produce the same apparent
coincidences; and similar ones are also found in Wheal Jewel,
Wheal Friendship, and in the heaves of the south lode at
Cardrew Downs (e, B).
   But when the heaves by successive cross-veins are in op
posite directions, certain masses of rock must be heaved, and
others, interposed amongst them, remain in their original
positions;     as,
                for example,     Herland (n), where this assump
                                at
tion requires that the portion contained between the Half
penny flucan and Chambers's western flucan shall not have
been moved; whilst,       atevery cross-vein west      the former,
                                                      of
there shall have been, successively,        an
                                            elevation more consi
derable  as  we go westward, and       at every cross-vein east      of
the latter,a  similar one, still increasing      magnitude,
                                                 in             as
                                                                 we
 go eastward.
   At Wheal Vor (l), we may imagine the heaves             by
                                                            the two
portions  of the eastern cross-course    tohave been attended        by
 depressions westward; but then we must require that the part
between Woolf’s and Carleen cross-courses shall have re
 mained stationary, whilst the part west         of
                                                the latter has also
 subsided.   But     must still be remembered that these move
                     it
 ments will produce only       an
                                apparent agreement, and explain
only one set      phaenomena; for when we compare them with
 the distances   ofof
                   the heaves, the resemblance vanishes.
    These movements       inopposite directions, and stationary
masses interposed between others which have suffered con
tradictory motions, certainly require       liberal indulgence
                                            a                        of
Imagination.
   But whether the two cross-veins          be   wholly separate and

              which form the opposite Walls                    of Cross-veins.                   455
 distinct ones, or whether they may be branches of the same
 which unite and form one vein at other places, the physical
 necessity that their heaves of the same lode must be in oppo
 site directions will still exist, provided the only mass of rock
 moved is that contained between them; for theory makes the
 extent of the heaves dependent on the inclination of the lode
 and the distance of the motion, as we have already so often
 Seen.
   Now the spaces at present occupied by the cross-veins are
supposed to have been fissures originating in the movements
which produced the heaves of lodes, although their ingredients
may have been introduced at a subsequent period.
   At Wheal Union (k) we have every particular necessary to
determine whether the same degree and direction of motion
will produce fissures of the same width as the branches of the
cross-vein, and at the same time heave the lode to the ex
tent, and in the directions, observed at the different levels.
   At 22 fathoms deep the trawn heaves Wheal Gwens lode
36 feet, and at 30 fathoms 25 feet; but below this level it
divides into three veins, of which one heaves the lode 1:5 foot;
the second, 8 feet; and the third, 24 feet: in all cases towards
the right-hand.     At the upper edge of the wedge-shaped
mass of rock included between the eastern and middle branches
of the trawn, the former of them is 6 inches and the latter 3
feet wide.
   Now in order to the production of fissures of these respect
ive dimensions by the subsidence of this included mass of
rock, in a direction op, (Pl. IV. fig. 14) parallel to a line
uniting       its

                                   the subsidence must have been
about 375 feet.
    Again,     in
               order that subsidence

456            Mr. Henwood      on the Rocks and Weins
to produce a heave of 36 feet at 22 fathoms deep: the extent
of such a motion must be about 17°5 fathoms, and the following
is a comparison of the calculation from such data with the facts
observed:—
                                     Distance  of heave.
      Depth.               Calculated.                    Observed.

      43 ...     . . . . . 47 ...        . . . . . . . .   33°5  •
    But theory requires that the branches of the western trawn
shall be attended by motions successively of greater magni
 tude as we go westward.         But as the two western branches
have a westerly dip, any subsidence of the mass (horse) of
granite between them must close and obliterate any openings
 or fissures with a very much smaller extent of motion than is
 requisite for the production of the heaves.         These theoretical
 demands are in direct contradiction to each other; and are
 also inconsistent with the prevailing opinions*, that the move
 ments which caused the heaves were contemporaneous with
 the origin of the fissures now occupied by the cross-veins.
    At 140 fathoms deep, in Wheal Wor, the eastern cross
 course divides into two veins, which diverge as they descend:
 the lode passes through the wedge-shaped piece of rock              in
 cluded between them, and is heaved by both of them towards
 the left-hand.    The fracture here theoretically assumed would
 have permitted this included portion to have subsided. Now,
 at the point of divergence, at 140 fathoms deep, the eastern
 branch of the cross-course is 6 inches, and the western 3 feet,
 in breadth; and the extent which the wedge-shaped mass
 must have subsided from the position it filled before the frac
 ture, in order that it might leave a vacuity of the requisite
 dimensions, would be about 13.5 feet.
    In order that a motion of 13.5 feet in extent should pro
 duce a heave of the observed distance of 9 feet at 150 fathoms
 deep, the direction of the movement should be on a line dip
 ping southward about 57° from the horizon. The following
 is a comparison of the respective distances of the heaves, which,
 according to computation, will be produced by a movement of
 this extent and direction, with the heaves observed:—
                                         Extent of heave.

   Trifling   as the actual differences are,                      their proportion to the
total amount of the heaves gives them an importance they
would not have otherwise possessed.
    Here, too, the hypothesis which requires the subsidence of
the portions of rock included between the branches of the
cross-course, and also of that between this cross-course and
Woolf’s, encounters the same incompatible conditions, which
require for the production of the observed heaves such an ex
tent of motion as would have quite obliterated every trace of
the cross-course, and even closed every fissure which other
causes might have produced in the same position.
    IV. The configuration of the parts of the same lodes in
contact with opposite sides of cross-veins.
    The impossibility, with very few exceptions, of restoring
 the continuity of the lodes heaved by the same cross-vein, by
                                                                   of all
                                                 the cases, naturally

                                        cross-vein,   that we  may   as

 find that they had       perfectly

 same levels.
    The tables (1—98.) contain sufficient details               the                     of            in

   they had become perfectly hardened.
      V. The evidence of the relative ages of veins deduced from
  their intersections.
     It has long* been strenuously maintained, that when one
  vein intersects another, the vein intersected is older than that
  which intersects it: but the district under consideration                                         af
  fords so many exceptions to the generality of this law, that,
  in Cornwall at least, it must be received with some limitation f.
     Whilst the mineral composition of the containing rocks                                         re
  mains the same, the general character of any given vein,
 whether it be a lode or a cross-vein, is usually so uniform, that
 there can be but little doubt that similar portions of the same
 vein are of the same ages, although they may be situate at some
 distance from each other, either horizontally or vertically.
     (1.) At Ting Tang and Wheal Friendship, strings of                                             vi
 treous copper ore and copper pyrites pass through the cross
 veins and connect together the same ores existing in the lode
 on either side; and at East Wheal Rose lead ore is found
 under circumstances precisely similar.
     (2.) At the Consolidated Mines<U+017F>, two quartz rocks, which
 fitted exactly into each other, were found at the two ends of
 a lode heaved by a flucan. The flucan, in the intermediate
 distance of 7 feet, presented a horizontal open space perfectly
corresponding with the contour of the rocks in the ends of the
lode.
     (3.) At Fowey Consols (q), Tincroft (r), and Duffield (p),
the cross-veins which heave some of the lodes are themselves
heaved by other lodes exactly similar in composition; and, in
short, possess       all
                      the characters common        the lodes which         to
are heaved.
    (3  a.) At Polgooth (ff) two lodes are heaved        one elvan                       by

     Dr.   Hare observes,

                    saline solutions.
   “67. On subjecting solution      to a
                                        sulphate    soda  of electrolysis,of         to
so   as    to   be
              exposed      the current employed, simultaneously with
some water         voltameter, Daniell alleges that, for each equivalent
                     in
                      a
of the gaseous elements                    of
                               water evolved      the voltameter, there
                                                                      in

those elements, but likewise       equal number  an  equivalents     soda  of                      of

462     Dr. Hare's Observations on                               the Electrolysis         of Salts,
and sulphuric acid.    This he considers as involving the necessity.
agreeably to the old doctrine, of the simultaneous decomposition of
two electrolytic atoms in the solution, for one in the voltameter:
while, if the solution be considered as holding oxysulphionide of
sodium, instead of sulphate of soda, the result may be explained con
sistently with the law ascertained by Faraday.        In that case, oxy
sulphion would be carried to the anode, where, combining with                                                   hy
drogen, it would cause oxygen to be extricated, while sodium, car
ried to the cathode, and deoxidizing water, would cause the extrica
tion of hydrogen.
   “68. Dr. Kane, alluding to the experiments above mentioned,
and some others which I shallmention, alleges that “Professor Daniell
considers the binary theory of salts to be fully established by them.’
   “69. Notwithstanding the deference which I have for the distin
guished inventor of the constant battery, and disinclination for the
unpleasant task of striving to prove a friend to be in the wrong,
being of opinion that these inferences are erroneous, I feel it to be my
duty as a teacher of the science, to show that they are founded upon
a misinterpretation of the facts appealed to for their justification.
   “70. It appears to me, that the simultaneous appearance of the
elements of water, and of acid and alkali, at the electrodes, as above
stated, may be accounted for, simply by that electrolyzation of the
soda, which must be the natural consequence of the exposure of the
sulphate of that base in the circuit. I will, in support of the ex
position which I am about to make, quote the language of Professor
Daniell, in his late work, entitled “Introduction to Chemical Phi
losophy,' page 413:—
   “‘Thus we may conceive that the force of affinity receives an
impulse which enables the hydrogen of the first particle of water,
which undergoes decomposition, to combine momentarily with the
oxygen of the next particle in succession; the hydrogen of this again,
with the oxygen of the next; and so on till the last particle of hy
drogen communicates          impulse   its  the platinum, and escapes
                                                             to                                                 in
its own elastic form.’                                *
   “71. The      process        represented        taking  place                                                in

       be transferred from the atom
viously combined, to that next upon the right, causing an atom of
the metal to be liberated at the cathode; this atom, deoxidizing
water,      will account for the soda and hydrogen at the cathode.
Meanwhile the atom of sulphate on the left, which has been deprived
of its sodium, must simultaneously have yielded to the anode the
oxygen by which this metal was oxidized. Of course the acid is left in
the hydrous state, usually called free, though more correctly esteemed
to be that of a sulphate of water.

   “74. cannot conceive how any other result could be expected
from the electrolysis of the base of sulphate of soda, than that which
is here described.                                                     -
   “75. I will, in the next place, consider the phaenomena observed
by Prof. Daniell, when solutions of potassa and sulphate of copper,
separated by a membrane, were made the medium of a voltaic current.
   “76. Of these I here quote his own account, Philosophical Ma
gazine and Journal, vol. xvii. p. 172*.
   “77. It will be admitted, that agreeably to the admirable re
searches of Faraday, there are two modes in which a voltaic current
may be transmitted, conduction and electrolyzation.     In order that it
may pass by the last-mentioned process, there must be a row of anions
and cathions forming a series of electrolytic atoms extending from
the cathode to the anode. It is not necessary that these atoms should
belong to the same fluid.        A succession of atoms, whether homo
geneous, or of two kinds, will answer, provided either be susceptible
of electrolyzation.     Both of the liquids resorted to by Daniell, con
tained atoms     susceptible   of being electrolyzed. If his idea of the
composition of sulphate of copper, and the part performed by the
potassa, were admitted for the purpose of illustration, we should, on
one side of the membrane, have a row of atoms consisting of oxy
sulphion and copper; on the other, of oxygen and hydrogen.
    “78. Recurring to Daniell's own description of the electrolyzing
process, above quoted, an atom of copper near the anode being                               li
berated from           its
                    anion, oxysulphion, and charged with electricity,

atom     copper therewith united.

    “‘When other metallic solutions are used, containing, for                                                                   in

proportions, present nothing but confusion; but will appear per
fectly harmonious and simple, if they be considered as secondary re
sults, and will accord in their proportions with the oxygen and hy
drogen evolved from water by the action of a definite quantity of
electricity.’
    “85. I cannot conceive that in any point of view the complicated
and “confused’ results of the experiment of Daniell with electrolytes
separated by membranes, are rendered more intelligible by supposing
the existence of salt radicals.       I cannot perceive that the idea that
the anion in the sulphate is oxysulphion, makes the explanation
more satisfactory than if we suppose it to be oxygen.            Were a so
lution of copper subjected to electrolysis alone, if the oxide of
 copper were the primary object of the current, the result would be
 analogous to the case of sodium, excepting that the metal evolved at
the cathode, not decomposing water, would appear in metallic form.
 If water be the primary object of attack, the evolution of copper
 would be a secondary effect.
    “86. It is remarkable, that after I had written the preceding                                   in
 terpretation of Daniell's experiments, I met with the following de
 ductions stated by Matteuchi as the result of an arduous series of
 experiments, without any reference to those of Daniell above men
 tioned.    It will be perceived that these deductions coincide perfectly
 with mine.
     “87. I subjoin a literal translation of the language of Matteuchi
 from the Annales de Chimie et de Physique, tom. lxxiv. 1840, p. 110:—
     “‘When salt, dissolved in water, is decomposed by the voltaic
 current, if the action of the current be confined to the salt, for each
 equivalent of water decomposed in the voltameter, there will be an
 equivalent of metal at the negative pole, and an equivalent of acid,
 plus an equivalent of oxygen, at the positive pole. The metal se

466   Dr. Hare and Prof. Daniell on the Electrolysis of Salts
I had much     rather be so proved to be in the wrong than that
 any error which        Imay have committed should remain                       un
 corrected,        I
                shall  proceed  to prove that, owing to his over
 looking one important result of the electrolysis, he is not in
 the right.
    It appears, then, to Dr. Hare, that in the electrolysis of sa
line solutions, the simultaneous appearance of the elements of
water, and of acid and alkali, at the electrodes may be accounted
for simply by that electrolyzation of the soda (taking sulphate
of soda as an illustration) which must be the natural conse
quence of the exposure of the sulphate of that base in the                      cir
cuit.    I presume that by the term natural consequence is meant
that such a result might have been, d priori, expected: but
there is nothing, I think, that           I
                                      should have anticipated less
than that a solution of     sulphate  of soda would be affected by
the voltaic current precisely in the same way as a solution of
caustic soda, or that the powerful affinities of the acid and the
base should have no influence upon the result.
   The whole of Dr. Hare's argument is founded upon the
supposition that both in an aqueous solution of soda and of
sulphate of soda, “the alkali is the primary object of attack,
the decomposition of the water being a secondary result.” But
he has neglected the important fact, that in neither case is it the
sodium and the oxygen which alone travel in the circuit; but
in the first case the water, and in the second case the acid ac
companies the oxygen to the anode.          In my experiments with
the  diaphragm    cells, by which the   liquid products of the elec
trolysis may be kept sufficiently separate,                I
                                                  have proved this
over and over again.         Indeed             I
                                          should have joined most
heartily in the wonder of my friend at the failure of my own
“sagacity,” if I had not established this point beyond the
possibility of a doubt.      It will be easy, I am sure, for Dr.
Hare to convince himself by a few easy experiments that a
solution of sulphate of soda submitted to electrolysis becomes
acid in the zincode division of a diaphragm cell, not only by
the abstraction of sodium from       but   it,       by
                                             the accumulation                   of
acid transferred from the platinode division; just            will    as   he
find  an  accumulation       of
                           soda     the latter arising from the
                                          in
secondary action        of
                     the sodium transferred from the former.
   The same oversight        of
                            the fact, that    these processes
                                                      in                        of

accompanies the oxygen      the zincode while the metal travels
                              to
to the platinode, has misled Dr. Hare       his consideration
                                                     in                         of

count for the deposition of the metal upon the diaphragm,
he is reduced to the necessity of supposing that “the metallic

with it is held at the extreme point of the flame, it presents a
beautiful green phosphorescence, owing no doubt to the for

It phosphoresces with a green light.
   AEthonide of silver may be obtained by heating together
chloride of silver and aethonide of zinc, or by heating together
aethogen and silver. It is a light white solid, and is not acted
upon by any of the re-agents with which it was tried, not even
by chlorine or hydrogen at a full red heat.     This compound
phosphoresces with a peculiarly fine green light.
  I  believe    I
               have obtained aethonides of several other metals
by heating their chlorides with aethonide of zinc, but the
quantities operated upon were too small to give certain                               re
sults.
  I  am bound to apologize for sending in my results without
an analysis, but the means of doing otherwise are not in my
                I
power, and am in hopes that Dr. Kane will oblige us with
                                     I
more valuable data than could furnish.

472    Mr.      Chatterley's         Experiments on Saline Manures
product of No. 3; indeed, the product of an acre would not
then greatly exceed for 112lbs. of manure that for 26lbs.
   It will be observed that the produce of the three manures
does not bear a relative proportion to the quantity of ni
trogen contained in each, but this gives us no reason for
believing that such proportion would not hold good had the
quantity of water contained in each been allowed for at the
time  of dressing.
    The attention of the practical agriculturist will probably be
attracted to the last column of this table, in which is exhibited
the profit on the expenditure in each case; taking the average
value of the bushel at seven shillings, and of a truss of straw
at ninepence, and calculating chaff as the same value as straw
for fodder. The difference between a quarter of a hundred
weight and a hundred weight and a quarter of sulphate of am
monia is very remarkable, and, as may be easily perceived, is
due to the difference of the value of the produce, the increase
in the former instance being wholly in corn, while in the latter
it is in both straw and corn, and it is probable that there is
 some quantity of the manure between these two extremes
 which would give the largest return relative to the outlay. It is
 clear however that if a farmer have but             lay out      ma
                                                                  11.   to                  in

ture above-mentioned, the subsequent produce however was
one-sirth more than any other land of the field.       The oats
sown with the tares grew extraordinarily after the application,
and it is believed, that if applied earlier in the season to the
 tares as to the pasture, and during dry weather followed b
less drought, the leaves of the plant would not have
 and the effect would in both cases have been more marked.
    On the 21st of May a similar quantity, viz. one cwt. to the
 acre, of sulphate of ammonia was applied to a field of clover
 in dry weather: in this instance the leaves did not wither, but
 no increased growth appeared to be the consequence; and a
 similar result was obtained by the application of nitrate of
 soda.

 following dressing was applied early in the morning, and by

must be taken to pulverise the oil-cake sufficiently. A method
which has been found to be good is to mix soot and salt in
about equal parts, some weeks previous to the addition of the
sulphate of ammonia; the salt condenses moisture from the
atmosphere and fixes the carbonaceous particles, and these
tend to hold the carbonic acid and ammoniacal gases derived
from the atmosphere and decomposing organic matters in the
soil, and render them of easy access to the plants.               a very                        If
speedy effect be required, the stimulating properties of this
dressing may be increased, by setting free a portion of the
ammonia by a subsequent very slight dressing of hydrate of
lime (for obvious reasons this mixture should not be made
before the sowing); but as such a dressing is always attended
with loss of ammonia, this should never be resorted to unless
it is otherwise unavoidable, and if possible when rain may be
 expected to fall. And this leads me to a remark on the very
 common practice, in this county particularly, of mixing fer
 menting farm-yard manure with lime, by which                the ammo                  all
 niacal salts are decomposed and the ammonia driven off, and
a  large portion        fertilizing material absolutely lost:

LXXXI.       On the Chemical and Contact Theories of the Voltaic
  Battery.     By MichaeL FARADAY, D.C.L., F.R.S., &c.*
[According to our intention expressed at page 269, we now reprint
  Dr. Faraday's argument against the contact theory of excite
  ment in the voltaic battery, drawn from the consideration of the
  general and invariable laws of natural forces.—ED.]
        Improbable Nature of the Assumed Contact Force.
2065.
       I   HAVE thus given a certain body of experimental
           evidence and consequent conclusions, which seem to
me fitted to assist in the elucidation of the disputed point, in
addition to the statements and arguments of the great men who
have already advanced their results and opinions in favour of
the chemical theory of excitement in the voltaic pile, and against
that of contact. I will conclude by adducing a further argument
founded upon the, to me, unphilosophical nature of the force
to which the phaenomena are, by the contact theory, re
ferred.
   2066. It is assumed by the theory (1802.) that where two
dissimilar metals (or rather bodies) touch, the dissimilar parti
cles act on each other, and induce opposite states.       I do not
deny this, but on the contrary think, that in many cases such an
effect takes place between contiguous particles; as for instance,
preparatory to action in common chemical phaenomena, and
also preparatory to that act of chemical combination which,
in the voltaic circuit, causes the current (1738. 1743.).
   2067. But the contact theory assumes that these particles,
 which have thus by their mutual action acquired opposite elec
 trical states, can discharge these states one to the other, and
 yet remain in the state they were first     in,
                                              being    every point
                                                               in
 entirely unchanged     by what has previously taken place.    as   It
             *   From the Phil. Trans, for 1840,   p.   124.

 478             Dr.      Faraday on the Chemical and Contact
  sumes also that the particles, being by their mutual action
  rendered plus and minus, can, whilst under this inductive ac
  tion, discharge to particles of like matter with themselves and
  so produce a current.
     2068. This is in no respect consistent with known actions.
 If   in relation to chemical phaenomena we take two substances,
  as oxygen and hydrogen, we may conceive that two particles,
  one of each, being placed together and heat applied, they induce
  contrary states in their opposed surfaces, according, perhaps,
  to the view of Berzelius (1789.), and that these states beco
 ming more and more exalted end at last in a mutual discharge
 of the forces, the particles being ultimately found combined,
 and unable to repeat the effect.            Whilst they are under                                     in
 duction and before the final action comes on, they cannot
 spontaneously lose that state; but by removing the cause of
the increased inductive effect, namely the heat, the effect itself
 can be lowered to                  its
                            first condition.          the acting particles
                                                                   If
 are involved         in
                      the constitution                       of    an
                                                    electrolyte, then they
 can produce current force (921. 924.) proportionate                     the                     to
 amount         of
                chemical force consumed (868.).
     2069. But the contact theory, which               obliged, according
                                                                        is
to   the facts,     admit that the acting particles are not changed
                     to
 (1802. 2067.) (for otherwise           would   it the chemical theory),
                                                                   be
is   constrained          to
                        admit   also,  that the force which         able                    is         to
 make two particles assume             certain state

   The ascent of the sap in vegetables has been generally ascribed
to a vital contraction either of the vessels or of the cells of the plant:
the circumstances of that ascent taking place chiefly at certain sea
sons of the year, and of the quantity of fluid, and the velocity of                                                    its
motion being proportional          the developmentto      those parts whose        of
functions are obviously vital,         the leaves and flowers, have been

                     as                                 theories which pro  of   all

lution various vegetable compounds, their density is greater than
the ascending sap, which is external to them, and from which they
are separated by an intervening organized membrane. Such being
the conditions requisite for the operation of the principle of endos
mose, the author infers that such a principle is constantly in action
in living plants; and that it is the cause of the continual trans
mission      of fluids from the intervascular and intercellular spaces
into the interior of the   vessels and cells, and also of the ascent of the
sap.

Durham.
   Jan. 12, 1843–1. The reading of a paper, entitled “On the
Nerves,” by James Stark, M.D., was resumed and concluded.
   The author gives the results of his examinations, both microscopical
and chemical, of the structure and composition of the nerves; and
concludes that they consist, in their whole extent, of a congeries of
membranous tubes, cylindrical in their form, placed parallel to one
another, and united into fasciculi of various sizes; but that neither
these fasciculi nor the individual tubes are enveloped by any fila
mentous tissue; that these tubular membranes are composed of
extremely minute filaments, placed in a strictly longitudinal direc
tion, in exact parallelism with each other, and consisting of granules
of the same kind as those which form the basis of all the solid
structures of the body; and that the matter which fills the tubes
is of an oily nature, differing in no essential respect from butter,
or soft fat; and remaining of a fluid consistence during the life of
the animal, or while it retains                    its
                                         natural temperature, but becoming

   1.   “Observations          oncertain cases of Elliptic Polarization of
Light by Reflection,” by the Rev. Baden Powell, M.A., F.R.S.,
Savilian Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxford.
    The author, by way of introduction, passes in review the la
bours of various inquirers on the subject of the elliptic polarization
of light, and notices more particularly those of Sir David Brewster,
who first discovered this curious property, as recorded in the Phi
losophical Transactions for 1830; of Mr. Airy, in the Cambridge
Transactions for 1831 and 1832; and of Professor Lloyd, in the
Philosophical Transactions for 1840, and in the Reports of the
British Association for 1841. He then proceeds to give an account
of his own experimental examination of the phenomena of elliptic
polarization in the reflection of light from various surfaces, by ob
serving the modifications of the polarized rings under different con
 ditions, both of surface and of incidence, and by endeavouring to
 ascertain both the existence and amount of ellipticity, as shown by
 the dislocation of those rings, and to determine                     peculiar cha          its

F.R.S. Section 25. On the Electricity evolved by the Friction of
Water and Steam against other bodies.
   The object of the experiments related in this paper, is to trace
the source of the electricity which accompanies the issue of steam
of high pressure from the vessels in which it is contained.      By
means of a suitable apparatus, which the author describes and de
lineates, he found that electricity is never excited by the passage of
pure steam, and is manifested only when water is at the same time
present; and hence he concludes that it is altogether the effect of
the friction of globules of water against the sides of the opening,
or against the substances opposed to          passage,    the water       its                         as

    After reciting the various discordant opinions entertained at dif
ferent periods by anatomists and physiologists, relative to the struc
ture and actions of the iris, the author proceeds to give an account
of his microscopical examination of the texture of this part of the
eye, in different animals.       He considers the radiated plicae, which
are seen on the uvea in Mammalia, as not being muscular; but he
agrees with Dr. Jacob in regarding them as being analogous in
structure to the ciliary processes. The white lines and elevations
apparent on the anterior surface of the human iris, he supposes to
be formed by the ciliary nerves which interlace with one another in
the form of a plexus. The iris, he states, is composed of two portions;
the first, consisting of a highly vascular tissue, connected by vessels
with the choroid, ciliary processes, sclerotica and cornea, and abun
dantly supplied with nerves, which, in the human iris, appear, in a
front view, as thread-like striae ; and which are invested, on both
surfaces, by the membrane of the aqueous humour. They are more
or less thickly covered with pigment, which, by                            its

He, however, throws it out       as a conjecture, that this latter action

    The author commences                    by
                                    quoting largely from the writings                                               of
various electricians,            to
                           show that the habit          using Leyden dis      of
charges       many lightning experiments has led
             in                                            their adoption            to                             in
all; and then points out three circumstances            which great degrees  of in
    difference exist; the comparative distance         the clouds operating
in of

These positions were supported by several new experiments with the
double electroscope. The author then explains an imperfect state
of charge consequent on the discharge of a system which developes
on the outer coating a certain quantity of free electricity, to which
Mr. Walker gives the name “induced residual.”             He assumes a
case of 100 Harris's units being thrown on one coating of a jar
while 90 are expelled from the other, on the well-known principle
that one coating always possesses an ercess over the other; the
outer coating in this case has a capacity and attraction for 90.                                                         If,
however, the discharge     made and 90 pass, the whole
                                            is                   the 90                                        of
cannot abide there, because the      remaining       the jar would re

Since p +                     cannot be less than 2,                       it is easy to          see that, when

cidence, one-half the incident light will be reflected. The minimum
will be when i = 65° 36', and at this angle only ºn of the incident

index is that which Sir                          J.

   The only person who supposes that the refractive index of a metal

maxim in optics, that the higher the reflective power of any substance,
the higher also is                    its
                       refractive index.   But M. Cauchy completely
reverses this maxim; for,                              as

that though such is the case, this discovery is also included along
with the other facts in the general theory proposed, and that from its
being apparently a necessary consequence of the theory the merit of
its originality might appear lessened.      Such however is not the
case: what the theory does is rather to confirm       truth,    which                its              of

have evidently for their formulae Biº O3, Biº O4. This result agrees
perfectly with the experiments of M. Jacquelain, and the late ex
periments of M. Regnault on the specific heat of bismuth, and that
of its combinations.—Journal de Pharmacie, Janvier 1843.

    M. Frémy     observes, that the protoxide of lead dissolves in the
alkalies, and forms crystalline compounds with some bases; but the
hydrate of this oxide, under the influence of the alkalies, is dehydrated
as readily as the hydrates of the oxides of bismuth and tin; so that
when the hydrated protoxide of lead is boiled in a solution of alkali not
sufficient to dissolve           it,
                           the hydrate      converted into perfectly crystal

previously obtained                 by
                            treating acetate      lead with ammonia. This    of
oxide,  he has also remarked, may change               colour when strongly        its
                                                                                         by

heated, and the same effect may           produced        friction.
   The solutions           of
                        oxide     lead    the alkalies deposit by evapora

line solutions.
   M. Frémy states, that the observations which                  has made re                  he
specting the protoxide         lead, prove that

acid; acids, added to the plombates, occasion the precipitation of
 plombic acid.
    All plombates are obtained by calcining in the air a mixture of
 metallic lead and protoxide of lead. Thus, then, minium or red lead
 is one of the series of plombates; it is a plombate of protoxide of
 lead.   It is well known that when a metal forms both an oxide and
 an acid, they generally exist in combination ; as examples of this
 may be cited the chromate of chromium, tungstate of tungstenum,
 stannate of tin, &c. &c.   Minium is then also arranged in this series
 of compounds.-1bid.
  ON AM MONIA-AMIDI DE OF HYDROGEN.                                       BY PROF.            DANIELL.

                                          we add to a cold solution of
 bichloride of mercury a very slight excess of ammonia, a copious
 white precipitate is formed, and the liquid is found to contain exactly
 half the chlorine of the bichloride combined with hydrogen and
 ammonia as muriate of ammonia.        The white powder, which has
 long been known by the name of white precipitate of mercury, con
 tains all the mercury and the remaining half of the chlorine.       Dr.
  Kane believes that it is a compound of chloride and amidide of mer
 cury, and that            its
                       formula, adopting 202, the ordinary number for

in the county of Cavarras, and described by M. Zoehler, a pupil of
the Freyberg School of Mines. The mass found at Miass, fifteen
years ago, weighs 224 pounds; that of Cavarras, 27# pounds; that
of Haiti, from 30 to 34; but the mass of gold found in November
1842, in beds of alluvium reposing on diorite, is more than twice
the weight of the largest of these, as it weighs nearly 80 pounds.
Such has been the prodigious increase of the quantity of gold ob
tained by washing in Russia, and especially in Siberia, to the east of
the southern chain of the Oural, that, according to very accurate
data, the total produce during the year 1842 amounted to upwards
of 35,000 pounds avoirdupois.-L'Institut, No. 472.
       FAHLERZ ContAINING MERCURY, FRoM HUNGARY.
   Professor Zeuschner procured this remarkable Fahlerz duriug his
geognostical tour in Hungary, and wished it to be analysed, on ac
count of its containing mercury.        It occurs at Kotterbach in the
vicinity of Iglo, and is very probably the same compact fahlerz con
taining mercury, from Poratsch in Upper Hungary, which Klaproth
analysed. The ore is only found in a massive state, and is frequently
interspersed with copper pyrites, from which the portions destined
for analysis were carefully purified.      Hr. Scheidthauer performed
the  following three analyses   of the ore in the laboratory of Professor
H. Rose, but it was     only in one of them that all the component
parts were determined.        In the second analysis, from particular
causes, the whole amount of mercury could not be obtained; and in
the third the sulphur alone was determined:—

ON    ARSENIo-side RITE, A VARIETY OF ARSENIATE of IRON. By
                             M. DUFRENOY.
   M. Lacroix, pharmacien of Mâcon, sent to me some months since,
specimens of a fibrous substance, of a yellowish brown colour, found
in the manganese mine of Romanèche near Mâcon.
   The fibrous arrangement of this substance, connected with its lo
cality, led to the supposition that it was hydrated peroxide of man
ganese,    its
          colour bearing some resemblance    the specimens fromto
Romanèche.

          and that of the Royal Society, a series of photogra
phic impressions illustrative of the chrysotype, cyanotype, and
other processes, an account of which is given in the Post
script to my last paper on that subject, which has, by per
mission of the President and Council, been appended to the
original in    its
                printed form subsequently          the termination to                                of

the discovery     other photographic novelties (which may form
the subject     of
                future communications),          have been enabled

have succeeded at last, by the simple addition of corrosive
sublimate to the ammonio-citrate of iron with which the paper
is prepared. The improved process, therefore, may be thus
stated.    Mix together equal measures of a saturated cold so
lution of corrosive sublimate, and a solution of ammonio
citrate of iron, one part by weight of the salt to eleven parts
water.     No immediate precipitation takes place, and before
any has time to do so, the mixture must be washed over paper
(which should have rather a yellowish than a bluish cast), and
dried.    It is now ready for use, and I do not find that it is
impaired by keeping.          To use           must      it,exposed

 of blackness and      opacity   may    be induced on a mercurial pho
 tograph prepared as in Art. 228, by a process which is in
 itself not a little curious and instructive, as affording a kind
of parallel to the stimulating action of Mr. Talbot's second
application of nitrate of silver, in his beautiful kalotype process.
 The nature of the process in question will be best illustrated
 by describing the experiment which led to                                it.

508         Sir       J.   F.   W.   Herschel on certain improvements
viously sunned half, while it produced no perceptible change
in the other.    I found this experiment to succeed on many
different varieties of paper, and with very considerable latitude
in the dosage of the ingredients.      It was most successful in
the case of a  paper  prepared  with a cream, formed by mixing
one measure ammonio-tartrate of iron (strength Tºº") and two
saturated protonitrate of mercury, leaving out the free tar
taric acid altogether, which, among many other doses of these
i.*...
     ingredients, proved also, generally, the most sensitive to
light.
             Led by         these indications      I prepared       a paper by washing,
first with a weak solution of ammonio-citrate of iron (strength
gº), and when dry, with saturated protonitrate of mercury.
It was exposed when barely dry enough, not to feel damp, with
an engraving in a frame to a hazy and declining sun.         In
about twenty minutes a very pale and feeble photograph was
produced.     Excited as above, by water, it gained but little in
intensity (for it deserves remark that the increase of apparent
intensity produced by either water or the nitrate, is in direct
proportion to the force of the original impression, which, as
observed, was in this case very faint).   It was then held for
about five minutes in the sun (near  setting),  and by degrees,
and with the utmost regularity of gradation over every part
of the picture, each line assumed an inky blackness, the lights
and shades being exquisitely preserved in their due propor
tions, and the ground being hardly perceptibly discoloured.
The result was a very beautiful and perfect negative photo
graph.
   237. This singular power of water to excite the dormant
impression, strongly recalls the analogous power of moisture
to deepen the tints photographically impressed on auriferous
papers, of which an instance is given in Art. 45, and of which
a still more striking example is shown as follows.        Let a
paper be washed first with ammonio-citrate of iron, and when
dry with neutralized chloride of gold, and thoroughly dried
in the dark. It is then, apparently, almost insensible to light;
a slip of it half exposed to sun being hardly impressed in any
perceptible degree in many minutes; yet if breathed on, the
impression comes out very strong and full, deepening by de
grees to an extraordinary strength.      Treated in the same
manner, silver also exhibits a similar property+.      Nor,                                    in
  * By     this   I   understand one part (by weight) salt          +    11   water.
  t   Note added Dec. 21.-The excitement is produced on such paper by
the ordinary moisture of the atmosphere, and goes on slowly working                             its

                                                          silver,   it   ultimately    produced

                            on Photographic Processes.                 509
 deed,     is there any feature       in photography more general or
 more remarkable than the influence exercised by the presence
 of a certain degree of moisture in favouring the action of light,
 whether direct or indirect.
    238. There is this difference, however, in the excitement
 produced by simple water and by the mercurial solution, viz.
 that the latter is permanent, the former liable to fade; at least
I  have found this to be the case with the brown tinge produced
by it in shade, though when blackened by a second exposure
to sun no difference is perceived. On the other hand, when
the nitrate is used, the brown hue frequently passes to abso
lute blackness without any subsequent exposure to sunshine;
and in that case the photographs produced have an intensity
and opacity scarcely, if at all, inferior to that of printing
ink.                                                             -
    239. This high degree of opacity and depth, together with
 the comparative insensibility of the ground, is evidently ca
pable of being most usefully applied to the production of re
transfers.   In fact, the photographs so produced being nega
tive are so far fitted for the purpose, and if used as models
while in this, their transition state, and as it were self-fixed,
so far from being injured by the transmission of light, they
are actually acquiring additional sharpness and depth by every
                         By seizing therefore the right point of

dryness, and by using a very sensitive            to receive the
impression, there is no reason to doubt of success in procuring
very perfect positive transfers. Some trials I have made have
satisfied me as to the practicability of this, however contrary
it may at first sight appear to the usual conditions of photo
graphy.
    240.    In the positive cyanotype process,          as improved by the
addition of corrosive sublimate above recommended, we are
furnished with another instance of a transformation effected
by heat, analogous to those described in Art. 223.       picture A
prepared by this process, if heated, is transformed from posi
tive to negative and from blue to brown.        On keeping the
blue colour is restored, as well as the positive character.   In

produced; the negative character changing       by

which, whether they be regarded as rays of heat, or light, or
of some influence, sui generis, accompany in the spectrum the
red and orange rays, and are also copiously emitted by heated
bodies short of redness.           These rays are distinguished from
those of    light   by  being   invisible;  they are also distinguished
from the      purely   calorific  rays   beyond  the spectrum by their
possessing the properties recorded in Arts. 160, 223, either
exclusively of the calorific rays, or in a very much higher
degree. They may perhaps not improperly be regarded as
bearing the same relation to the calorific spectrum which the
photographic rays do to the luminous one, and if the restriction
to these rays of the term thermic as distinct from calorific be
not (as I think in fact it is not) a sufficient distinction,           would                      I

two Wollaston Medals to MM. Dufrénoy and Elie de Beaumont,
for their Geological Map of the kingdom of France; and also the
application of the balance of the Wollaston fund to promote the
publication of Mr. Morris's tabular work, the merits of which were
adverted to last year (Phil. Mag. S. 3, Vol. xx. p. 544).
    The President then commenced his Anniversary Address on the
progress of Geology, of which the following extracts present the
                                                º
most characteristic features: the paragraphs in the smaller type are
our own, introduced for the purpose                connecting those in the
larger, which are portions of the Address itself.
    The Address begins with a brief notice of three deceased Fellows of the
Society, the Earl of Munster, Dr. Arnold of Rugby, and Mr. Thomas Bot
field of Hopton Court; the latter of whom amassed a considerable fortune
by selecting, on geological grounds, the elevated and detached coal-field of
the Titterstone Clee Hill, in
                               ...}.

    The official change occasioned by the retirement of Mr. Lonsdale
having been adverted to in the Report of the Council, and the warmest
thanks of this Meeting having been voted to him,              I would now ex
press my own sense of the meritorious services of that officer.
    Fourteen years, Gentlemen, have elapsed since his appointment
was inade; during which time your collections and your volumes at

gratitude can be too strong when we record           his labours as a
geologist,     the value we entertain of his official services, and
the pang      of deep regret we experience in his retirement from this
Society.
     For a while the vacancy occasioned by the retirement of Mr.
Lonsdale was not filled up; but the value which was attached
to the office was attested by the fact, that nine candidates
claimed our suffrage.   The selection of Professor E. Forbes
leads me naturally to report to you the principal geological results
at which our new Curator has arrived during his recent researches
in the Mediterranean seas, as they are distinctly connected with
the award of the Wollaston fund during a former year, to assist
him in prosecuting his inquiries in the Mediterranean or Red
Seas.
    Mr. Forbes observed marine tertiary strata abounding in shells at
an elevation of 4000 feet in the Lycian Taurus, and he fixed the age
of two distinct tertiary groups in the Greek islands. He also deter
mined that the freshwater deposits of Asia Minor and the Sporades
belong to two separate groups, the relations of which with the marine
tertiary strata prove that there were two eras of submergence and
elevation, in that region, during the Tertiary period. He instituted a
careful comparison between the organic remains of these beds and
the living inhabitants of the adjacent sea, noticing the conditions
under which each are found, and thus learnt that in the newest of
these tertiaries (Newer Pliocene), the remains of such species as
have ceased to exist in the Mediterranean are, for the most part,
at present living in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean; and hence he very
logically infers, that the former conditions of the Newer Pliocene
period, which imply a similar and continuous submarine area, were
interrupted by that elevation of land which separated the Egean and
adjacent portions of the Mediterranean from the Red Sea, the faunas
of which are materially distinct from each other.
    Mr. Forbes explored a submarine tract of 300 miles in width,
 dredging in     all depths between        and 230 fathoms. At less than
                                            1
 100  fathoms,   the bottom often consisted          white chalky sediment,
                                                         of
which extended      throughout    the  Egean,  and was invariably inhabited
 by  the same species   of   Foraminifera.      At depth  a              of
                                                                 200 fathoms
 Mollusca only,   of  the genera Tellina, Corbula, Arca, and Dentalium
were found, but associated with Annelides, Star-fishes, Crustaceans,
 and Zoophytes.         Lastly,   he  ascertained the range and charac
 ters    of
          500  species of  existing  Mollusca and             of
                                                        numerous associated
 Radiata. Among the former were species which live indifferently
at   all depths between      10  and 150 fathoms, and several           them   of
 (including Buccinum semistriatum, Dentalium quadrangulare, and
 Pleurotoma crispata) which had hitherto been known only                fossilin
                                                                               a
 state. By this examination        he  also arrived      the important fact,
                                                              at

in   a  living state, and vice versd; and thus                 he
                                                          lays before     the      us
 last remnants of former state of the surface of whose existence we
                   a
 were ignorant, accompanied            by
                                        the descendants             of
                                                              animals, which,

  514       Geological Society: Anniversary        Address, 1843.
 first appearing in small numbers in a pre-existing period, are now
 attaining their maximum of numerical developement.
     Such discoveries, Gentlemen, are most important to the progress
 of true induction; and when these researches of Mr. Forbes are pre
 sented to you in extenso, as is his intention, each of us will, I doubt
 not, find in them some illustration of the stony deposits with which
 we are more familiar.
     I may well, therefore, congratulate the Society on having ob
 tained the services of such a naturalist as Mr. Forbes, of whom it
 has been said by a distinguished foreign contemporary, that “his
 anatomical knowledge, the accuracy of his thought, and the vigorous
 precision with which he can estimate the minute differences on which
 the distinction of species depends, render him a worthy successor of
 Mr. Lonsdale, and ensure to us that he will render important services
 to the advancement of Geological Science”.
     Having spoken of those changes in the Society which have taken
 place through the demise of Members and through official changes, I
 now proceed to consider the progress of our Science, not merely within
 the British Isles, but also, as far as I am able, in other parts of the
 world to which geological researches have been extended. In so
          I
 doing shall follow the arrangement of last year, and treat of the
 rocks of each country in the order of their antiquity, commencing
 with the most ancient.       First dwelling upon the British Isles, I will
 next advert to Russia, the Caucasus, Asia Minor, Turkey and the
 Alps, and then in succession to works upon America, the East          In
 dies and Egypt; and after an analysis of the recent progress in
 Palaeontology, I will take leave of you with a brief résumé of the
 principal geological results.

     Silurian Rocks—In the Address of last year plainly expressed
 my belief, founded not merely on researches in the British Isles, but
 also on examinations of large portions of the Continent, that the
 Lower Silurian group contained the most ancient fossiliferous type.
This view now rests upon still firmer support, established by the
 labours of our geologists at home, and the doubts respecting the
true zoological base of the Palaeozoic rocks have been entirely dis
pelled.     In South Wales this point has been worked out with extra
ordinary fidelity of research, founded both on geometrical measure
ments and a close search after fossils; and to these investigations I will
presently advert, when speaking of the labours of Sir Henry de la
Beche and his assistants of the Ordnance Geological Survey.
    In illustration of the structure of the Lake Country of the North
of England, Professor Sedgwick has recently given a short sketch
in three letters addressed to Mr. Wordsworth; and I beg you to
consult this little work, which is embodied in a Guide to the Lakes
published by his friend the celebrated poet, both as a specimen of
the author's vigorous style of communicating popular geological
knowledge, and to obtain from it a clear general perception of the

 memoir which he read before this Society in 1832, he still adheres

 by Mr. Jonathan Otley. With the two lowest of these, the Skiddaw

lessons, which      Ifirst learnt from my friend, were opposed by many
and    accepted   by few, though they now form part of the text-book
of the field     surveyor.    To a re-examination of this country, then,
Professor     Sedgwick    has devoted portions of the two last summers,
with the distinct    object  of ascertaining, first, whether he was correct
in his   original opinion,  on which I steadily relied, that great masses of
the   slaty  rocks of North Wales, sometimes containing fossils, dipped
under the Silurian rocks described by myself; and if so, secondly,
what zoological distinction could be established between such rocks
and those described as Lower Silurian. We were both aware, and
the point was fully commented upon in my own work, that the Bala
limestone fossils agreed with the Lower Silurian *; but depending
upon his conviction that there were other and inferior masses also fos
siliferous, we both clung to the hope that such strata, when thoroughly
explored, would offer a sufficiency of new forms to characterize an
inferior system. The results of Professor Sedgwick's recent re
searches would have been communicated to the Society before this
Anniversary, had not his other avocations prevented his visiting
London; and as the memoir will shortly be read before you, I will
now so far allude to it only as to enable us to draw conclusions
respecting the base of the fossiliferous slaty rocks of North Wales.
    Professor Sedgwick has reassured himself that there are fossili
ferous slaty masses, of great vertical thickness, which rise out from
beneath the lowest Silurian rocks of North Wales hitherto described,
and occupying the region of Merionethshire and Snowdonia, ulti
mately rest upon chloritic and micaceous schists (Menai Straits),
into which they do not pass. The lowest of these fossil bands,
forming the summits and flanks of Moel Hebog and Snowdonia, are,
he conceives, several thousand feet below the Bala limestone.
    The hope, however, which was entertained by my friend, of finding
these vastly expanded and lower members characterized by pecu
liar groups of fossils has been frustrated, and whatever may be the
thickness of this lowest palaeozoic division, in which he has collected
a great number of species, he now fully admits, that zoologically it
is from top to bottom a Lower Silurian seriest. Charged as it is with
characteristic Orthidae and Trilobites, including the Asaphus tyran
nus, so characteristic of the lowest Silurian rock, there are, as
might be expected, a few new and undescribed species; and, among
these, an Ophiura (an animal whose remains had not previously
been found in strata of higher antiquity than the Lias) will not
appear the least extraordinary.
    The base of the palaeozoic deposits, as founded on the distinc
tion of organic remains, may now therefore be considered to be
firmly established; for the Lower Silurian type is thus shown by
Professor Sedgwick himself to be the oldest which can be detected
in North Wales, the country of            all others   in Europe       which
                                                                        in

Wales can be as accurately laid down upon a map as the parts of
South Wales to which I will presently allude; though when the
operations   of the Ordnance     surveyors are extended to this       com
plicated region, we shall learn, by distinct geometrical admeasure
ment, the exact thickness of these subcrystalline rocks on the flanks
of Snowdon.
   Mr. Murchison concludes this part of the subject, by expressing his dis

Flags” from British nomenclature.
     Ordnance Geological Survey of England.—The progress which
was confidently expected at the hands of the Ordnance Geological
Survey, directed by Sir Henry De la Beche, has recently been so
effectively extended to a country with great part of which I am well
acquainted, that, whilst we are considering the subject of the Pa
labozoic Rocks, I take the opportunity to add my tribute to the large
share of public approbation which such labours must earn for their
authors.    If  my few comments on this subject involve reference to
my own work, I trust the Society will believe that such allusions are
made solely to explain the subsequent progress of other geologists.
    In my last Address I alluded to the valuable researches of the
Ordnance Geological Survey in South Wales, particularly in the
great coal-basin; and I have now to speak of them amid the older
rocks of Pembrokeshire and Caermarthenshire, forming the south
western tracts of the country termed the Silurian region.           In the
survey of that region, my chief object, as you know, Gentlemen,
was simply to ascertain the general classification and right order of
certain fossiliferous strata beneath the Old Red Sandstone. Having
worked out the succession in typical districts in Shropshire, Here
fordshire, Radnor and Montgomeryshire,         I afterwards traced them
to the south-west, until I equally determined their relations to the
superior deposits in the coast-sections of South Wales.         Although
the labours in the latter country were thus auxiliary only to those of
 the arena on which the classification was established, I have had
great satisfaction in finding, that my chief boundary lines of Old
 Red Sandstone and Upper and Lower Silurian Rocks are pretty
nearly those which have resulted from the very systematic Ordnance
 Survey, the first corrected field-sheets of which Sir H. De la Beche
has allowed me to view. This observation has reference only, how
ever, to the development of what may be called one zone of Silurian
rocks, or that to which, as contiguous to the Old Red Sandstone, I
gave my chief attention.     Of the existence of true Silurian rocks
to the west and north of a certain line which was set up as a de
scending limit in South Wales, I was,     I  confess, entirely ignorant.
 Finding no fossils in the few visits which I made to the west of that
barrier in Caermarthenshire, which was provisionally agreed upon,
and to the north and west of which all the country was ultimately
to be explored by my friend Professor Sedgwick, we both of us be
lieved, that such tracts, for the most part without fossils, were of
higher antiquity than the Silurian districts, and that, rising up from

518            Geological Society:             Anniversary Address, 1843.
beneath, they might hereafter be found to contain other and distinct
forms of animal life.
   The inquiry of Sir H. De la Beche has dispelled our ignorance.
Instructing a number of intelligent young surveyors how to apply
trigonometrical mensuration to stratified rocks, and patiently follow
ing up each mineral mass through             change      its

truth nothing but the very same Lower Silurian rocks which had
been pointed out                    on
                          the east and south, and which (the Llandeilo
flags being much more important than the Caradoc sandstone) are
repeated      great folds and undulations

parting with their calcareous matter, these strata, often assuming
a  crystalline slaty cleavage, are         some tracts highly altered

 shire, and at Cornden and Shelve in Shropshire, where numerous
 lines of contemporaneous trap alternate with Llandeilo flags and
 Caradoc sandstone, and where the strata on the flanks of erup
 tive rocks are the seats of lead and copper ores, the sandstones being
 often converted into quartz rocks (Caradoc, Stiper Stones, Wrekin,
 &c. &c.). Combining the evidence of these tracts with those laid
 open by the extensive transverse sections which I formerly made in
 Montgomeryshire, in the north-western parts of the Silurian region,
 where the masses have been shown to roll over in great undulations
 from S.E. to N.W., I am fully prepared to admit the existence of a
 similar configuration in North Pembroke, West Caermarthenshire
and Cardiganshire, districts with which         was very imperfectly ac   I
 quainted, and where the aspect of rocks is at first sight, it must be
admitted, very forbidding to those who search after fossil evidences,
 The greater, however, the difficulty, the greater is the merit of those
who have solved the problem, and have thus established in parts
of South Wales the precise relations of what were previously con
sidered to be anomalous masses.         The result of this Survey, up to

 larly-bedded varieties of the sandstone containing similar minutely

 great upheavals of the syenite and trappean rocks took place long
 after the deposition of the Silurian strata, and even after that of the
 old red sandstone and coal-measures, which at various points along

 sils.-A    compendious volume, entitled “A Report on the Geology
  of  Londonderry,     and parts of Tyrone and Fermanagh,' has just been
  published by our associate Captain Portlock, R.E., employed in the
  Irish Trigonometrical Survey.            Illustrated by a geological map,
  numerous coloured        sections,   and plates of organic remains, this
  closely packed volume, of nearly 800 pages, is a sample of how
 great a mass of matter may be derived from a small district.                     Not
 having had sufficient time to study the details of this work, I must
 crave the author's indulgence if I refer only to such parts of it
 as have arrested my attention. Captain Portlock, having some time
 ago discovered a small patch of Silurian rocks in the region of his of.
 ficial labours, commenced a careful and systematic inquiry into the
 nature of the Trilobites with which it seemed to abound, and he
 now presents us with some very valuable results. In a preliminary
 discourse he offers many important remarks upon the affinities and
anatomy of this group of animals, and after a very elaborate com
parison of          all
                    the forms which             could detecthe      his district with    in

                            British and foreign authors, citing among the
latter several works very little known               us,      arrives to    the conhe             at

  some new features of the Keuper formation are sketched with the
 author's usual fidelity.
     From the researches of Captain Portlock                    I
                                                            turn to those of
 Mr. Griffith, who spent many years in preparing the Geological
 Map of Ireland, and for which he has deservedly received much
  praise. In a very elaborate comparative table of the fossils of the
 mountain limestone series of Ireland, presented to the Manchester
 Meeting of the British Association, Mr. Griffith divides that series
 into five subformations, which in ascending order are the Yellow
 Sandstone, Carboniferous Slates, Lower Limestone, Calp, and Upper
 Limestone. He also shows that the two lower of these subdivisions
 must, from their fossils, many of which ascend into the overlying
 strata, be classed with the mountain limestone series, and not with
 the Devonian rocks; in which case, I would observe, that they must
 also be classed with the sandstone, limestones and shale of Berwick
 shire, to which allusion has already been made.           I am the more                      in
 duced to believe in the accuracy of this comparison, because Count
 Keyserling and myself have this year confirmed the observation of
 Professor Sedgwick, made in 1828*, viz. that Posidoniae, similar to
 those in the culm limestones of North Devon, exist in the middle
 of the mountain limestone series of Northumberland.                   As Mr.
 Griffith has shown that the Irish Calp, which also occupies the middle
place in the limestone of Ireland, contains the same peculiar fossils,
 the parallel may now be considered as very well established, between
 this central mass of the mountain limestone in these distant localities.
    Drawn up as this table has been under the directions of Mr.
 Griffith, by a diligent young naturalist of good promise, Mr. F.
 M'Coy, there can be no doubt that it is entitled to much con
sideration, and that              its
                             publication will         be
                                                    very useful.         refer In
 ence   to the comparison instituted by Mr. Griffith between the
strata  of  North and South Devon and those                   Ireland,

should   be   surveyed, and their fossils compared                  by

                          which identical species may sometimes obtain
different  specific  names;     thus considerably interfering with        nice       a

survey         of that region, and approving the general classification, had
kindly offered to illustrate our views by the use of the very fine fossils
from the Rhine and the Eifel which his cabinet contained.          While
instituting the comparisons necessary to prove, by evidences indepen
dent of those in England, that the Devonian is a true intermediary
type, the subject became enlarged in his hands, and he was so fortu
nate as to procure the assistance of his friend the Vicomte D'Archiac.
By combining researches and making a variety of comparisons, their
work soon acquired great value, not merely as regards an accurate
description of beautiful organic remains, admirably lithographed,
but as containing also a general tabular list of the fossils of the De
vonian system in Europe, as compared with the species of the Silurian
and Carboniferous deposits in the Rhenish provinces.
    This table, enriched as it has been up to the moment of publica
tion by additions drawn from recent researches in Russia, must be
considered a standard acquisition, the intrinsic merit of which can
only be estimated by those who are aware of the labour and range of

524     Geological Society: Anniversary Address, 1843.
    Igneous Rocks of South Staffordshire.—As connected with the
older depositary rocks of the central counties of England, will now                             I
direct your attention to some recent observations on the changes to
which they have been subjected by igneous agency. Besides form
ing a most instructive museum, singularly rich in Silurian and Car
boniferous species (including many unpublished), the Geological
Society of Dudley, to the establishment of which I last year alluded,
has produced a report ‘On the Igneous Rocks of the South Staf
fordshire Coal-field", not yet printed, with the results of which                                                   I
am convinced you will thank me for making you acquainted.                     In
the southern portion of this coal-field there are centres of eruption
 where the basaltic and trappean matter, rising from the bowels of
the earth, completely cuts through the surrounding carboniferous
 strata, dislocating and altering them in the manner which has been
 pointed out by Mr. Keir, Mr. Arthur Aikin, and other observers,
 including myself. In regard to the lateral injections of the igneous
 matter among the coal strata, Mr. Blackwell, by comparing the
 shaft-sections of contiguous collieries, has shown, that however a
 single vertical section might seem to afford grounds for belief, that
 such igneous matter had been formed as a bed, yet that in reality it
 traverses various depositary strata in a slightly oblique direction,
 and often thins out in the form of a wedge. From such apparently
 horizontal masses, vertical dykes, with occasional lateral veins of
 white felspathic rock, varying in thickness from a few inches to
 three or four yards, are seen to rise up and traverse the coal-beds
 in the most irregular manner, though such dykes are not found to
 produce any derangement in the regular measures. Another good
 fact observed in relation to a supposed horizontal sheet of basalt in
 the midst of the sedimentary strata,            that the beds        is,
                                                                       which                    on
 rests are less subject              to
                            faults and dislocations than those which                                               lieit
  above it; the intruded mass, indeed, sometimes rising up                   the                          to
  surface and forming      knoll, occasionally bare, and
                                  a                                other places            at
  covered by the coal strata, which mantle round                                  it.
     The report also proves, that some                              of
                                              the chief faults which radiate
  from one   ofthe great centres    eruption(Barrow Hill), were produced
                                                    of
  contemporaneously with                   its
                                elevation; since the basaltic matter which
  flows laterally    apparent beds, follows the line       fault, bending and    of
 leaping up,      as   it in
                     were, without      break from lower a       higher levels.         to
  From this fact Mr. Blackwell        infers, that the basaltic matter must
  have been       fusion when
                  in               was extruded laterally along the sur
                                                 it
  faces of certain strata, but that the subsequent dislocation            which                      by
  these beds were moved           different levels, took place before the

    Devonian Rocks.—If the horizontal range of the Silurian rocks of
Russiabe considered large as respects our terms of comparison, what
will my associates say to the expanse over which the Devonian or next
ascending group is spread, when I tell them that it is much larger
than the whole of the British Isles? Reposing upon the low Silurian
plateaus, this widely ranging deposit rises to heights of from 500 to
900 feet above the sea; and it is very remarkable by being charged in
many localities with ichthyolites, several species of which, hitherto
considered peculiar to the Scottish Old Red Sandstone, are found
associated with Mollusks, perfectly similar as a group, and often
specifically the same, as those of the limestones of South Devon,
the Boulonnais and the Eifel. The discovery of the intermixture
 of Scottish Old Red Sandstone fishes and true Devonian shells in the
same strata, was, you may believe, one of the most gratifying results
of the recent explorations in Russia, as being confirmatory of the
views of Professor Sedgwick, Mr. Lonsdale and myself respecting
 the divisions and equivalents of that member of the Palaeozoic Rocks.
 In some parts of Russia, the Devonian rocks are red sandstones and
 marls; but in an extensive central tract, where they rise into a dome
 which separates the northern from the southern basin of the em
 pire, they are composed of yellow sandy marls and limestones, which
 lithologically might be mistaken for the magnesian limestone beds of
 our northern counties:–so inapplicable are mineralogical terms as
 marks of geological epochs.
     In the vastness of their undisturbed and nearly horizontal extent,
 these strata afford us most instructive proofs of the intimate con
 nection between the stony condition of the rocks and the imbedded
 fossils; for, when the calcareous matter is present, various mollusks
 are associated with some fishes, whilst in those tracts where the lime
 stones disappear and the beds have the characters of the Old Red
 Sandstone of Scotland, fishes only can be detected: thus presenting a
 remarkable analogy between the distribution of this very ancient
 fauna and that of existing nature; the present great receptacles of
 fishes being deep sandy bottoms, whilst shelly creatures congregate
 towards the shores where calcareous springs attract them.             I
                                                                    shall
 elsewhere allude to the fishes of this deposit when speaking of the
 researches of Professor Agassiz.
    Carboniferous Rocks.-The Carboniferous deposits, which succeed,
 cover an area as broad as that of the Devonian or Old Red rocks;
 and they are throughout clearly distinguished by a decidedly di
 stinct type of animal life, presenting in some families an extraordi
 nary number of species absolutely undistinguishable from those of
 our own country published in the works of Sowerby and Phil
 lips.   This system is eminently calcareous, and exhibits a vast
 marine succession, in which the fossils of the Mountain Limestone

 practical mining engineer; they give at one view the direction,           in
 clination, thickness and quality of the coals at each locality, also
 the characters of the associated strata, as well as the state of the
 works, and their produce at each mine or trial-spot.          To these is
 added another set of tables, in which the chemical analysis of the
 coals from forty-three different places is given by M. Malivaud,
 another agent of M. Demidoff.
     Into such details, valuable as they are, it was not our province to
 enter, and I will now, therefore, merely offer a few remarks explana
 tory of those points in which the geological conclusions of my friends
 and self either agree or are at variance with those of M. Le Play.
     Certain fossils which he had brought to France, and which we
 inspected before our journeys to Russia (1840), first led us to be
 lieve, that these coal beds are subordinate to the carboniferous
 limestone. Of this, indeed, there could be no doubt, for the species
 were, to a great extent, the very same as those with which we
 were familiar in rocks of that age in western Europe. On                  in
 terrogating M. Le Play, however, we could not ascertain that he
 had arrived at any defined idea of a succession of strata, derived
 either from the stratigraphical order of mineral masses, or from their
 imbedded organic remains.        In fact, he then distinctly acquainted
 us with what has now     appeared  in his work, that, owing to the dis
turbed and convoluted condition of the strata, the want of persist
ency of mineral characters, and the apparent existence of similar
species of shells throughout the series, it was impracticable to as
sign a base line to the deposits, or to trace their uppermost limits,
still less a passage into any superior formations.
     Now, as we have ventured to effect these objects, with what suc
cess we must leave others to decide, I will here briefly state why
I   conceive M. Le Play did not arrive at similar results; although
he had in his own hands some means of proof, which, through
the short time at our disposal, we never obtained.
     No geologist, however practised, can, I venture to say, explain
the structure of any complicated part of a distant country, unless
he has made himself master of the clear succession of its normal
                             I
formations. Long as have been occupied in the study of the Palaeo
zoic rocks,   I  am confident that, had my friends and myself been
thrown suddenly into the chain of the Donetz, and had been desired
at once to unravel       its
                          complexity, we should have reached          no
                                                                     other
geological result than that      which M. Le Play has attained, viz.
                                 to                                        of
stating that the coal-seams are,       aswhole, subordinate

boniferous   or  mountain limestone. We had, however,            to
                                                                two years
of   extensive comparative researches, obtained      anintimate acquaint
ance, not only with the older Palaeozoic rocks       of Russia generally,
but,  in  reference     the carboniferous system, had convinced our
                        to
selves, that, throughout the enormous area over which we had traced
it,  the upper    or
                   coal group    western Europe was absent; and that
                                 of
the calcareous     orlower group, occupying the whole carboniferous
horizon, was divisible into three stages,       byhelp    ofcertain fossils
characteristic    ofeach. Again, we had ascertained,           by
                                                                numerous

                             Russia and the                   Ural Mountains.                                      531
sections on both flanks of the Ural Mountains, that, in becoming
part of a mountain mass, this system, so uniform and so peculiar
over a space as large as an ordinary European kingdom, put on
many of the features which are so well known to those who have
studied the carboniferous limestone only in the western parts of
Europe.
   We further learnt, that, in the absence of any deposits to repre
sent our great coal-fields, the carboniferous system was succeeded,
in ascending order, by a vast series of red and cupriferous deposits
to which we have assigned the name of Permian. It will not,
therefore,be arrogant on our part to say, that we entered upon
the examination of the territory of the Donetz, in the possession
of elements of comparison which no previous travellers had ac
quired.
  Knowing, from the maps and instructions furnished to us by the
Imperial Administration of Mines”, that the major axis of this tract
and the main direction of the strata trend from west-north-west to
 east-south-east, we resolved, after terminating our researches in
 Southern Russia, to examine the chain of the Donetz in parallel
 lines transverse to             its
                           general strike; and,                         by
                                                       carrying out this scheme,
 we arrived        the conclusion, that the oldest member
                     at                                                  the series               of

   Agreeing in the correctness of the general parallel which M. Le
Play has drawn between the deposits of the Donetz and the carbo
niferous limestones of Great Britain, Belgium and France, I do not
believe that beyond this point his comparisons can be sustained.
The coal fields, for example, of the Low Countries and of Düssel
dorf, with which I am well acquainted, do not offer, as he supposes,
an analogy to those of the Donetz; for in the former, coal-seams are
in no instance interstratified with the Mountain Limestone series
of English geologists, but are invariably superposed to       Again,                                it.

                                                                 You have been

                      Russia and the Ural Mountains.                                          533
told, that this vast group is composed of limestones, marls, great
masses of gypsum, rock-salt and repeated alternations of cupriferous
strata; and that it contains a flora and a fauna of characters inter
mediate between those of the Carboniferous and Triassic periods.
The shells are, to a great extent, those of our Magnesian Limestone
or Zechstein; and, like the conglomerate of that deposit near Bris
tol, the Permian rocks are distinguished by the presence of The
codont Saurians. The interest attached to these vast deposits, which
have been spread out on the western flanks of the Ural Mountains,
is increased by the inferences which have been drawn, that springs
and currents holding much copper in solution must have flowed
from the edges of that highly mineralized and metamorphic chain,
while the Permian strata were accumulating.             But the great value
of having worked out a fuller and richer type of a group of strata
between the Carboniferous and Triassic epochs than any which
exists in Western Europe, will be found in the fossil shells, the plates
of which are already far advanced; for, with some species hitherto
known in the Zechstein of Germany and Magnesian Limestone of
England, we shall publish others which are identical with or analo
gous to forms that occur in rocks occupying the same geological
position in North America, of which I will speak hereafter, and
concerning the age of which great doubts had prevailed.
    In America, indeed, as in Russia, these beds had been compared
with every deposit, from the coal to the Keuper inclusive, whilst in
our work they will be shown to have no connection with the New
 Red Sandstone or Triassic group, but to occupy a definite position,
truly intermediate between that system and the carboniferous.              At
the same time it is manifest, that although they overlie and are, as
they ought to be, very distinct from the Carboniferous system, yet
 they contain some species of shells which occur in that division.
 Thus it will be made evident, that after                    all
                                                 there now remains scarcely

the Carboniferous rocks and the Magnesian Limestone, which is so
prevalent in the British Isles. The examination of rocks of this age
in North America, to which I shall hereafter advert, leads to the
same opinion; viz., that the Permian deposits must be viewed as the
fourth or uppermost stage of the Palaeozoic series, notwithstanding
the occurrence of Thecodont Saurians.
  Jurassic, Cretaceous and Tertiary Strata.-Overlapped as these
Permian deposits are, in certain tracts of Russia, by red and white
marls and sands, we are not positively prepared to state (in the
absence of decisive fossil evidences) whether some of them may not
represent the Trias; though the fossiliferous limestone of Monte
Bogdo, in the steppe of Astrachan, is probably of this age. With the
Jurassic strata, however, which follow, and which occur at                                                in
tervals from 65° north latitude to the countries south of the
Crimea, we made ourselves well acquainted.         Should the word
Jurassic grate upon the ears of Englishmen, it is impossible to deny
that this geographical term is much more applicable to the strata
in question than our own word “Oolitic," which implies a struc
ture scarcely ever seen in beds of this age in Russia.        Whether
examined at Moscow or on the Lower Volga, they consist of black
shales and ferruginous sands, occasionally containing calcareous
cement-stones, and thus they present a general lithological analogy
to the Lias; a formation, however, which is not represented in Russia,
for the fossils are     referableall the groups extending from the
                                                       to
Inferior    the Upper Oolite, and many
           to                                 them are identical with of
British species.
I     must now pass over the Cretaceous deposits which occupy
such broad spaces       Southern Russia, the Lower Tertiary beds,
                                 in
some      of

of  Bognor and the London basin, and also the strata                the                             of
Miocene age, which occupy wide tracts         Volhynia and Podolia,   in

                                                                                      in is

climate, then is there also a total absence of great boulders. On
this point I would further beg to remind you, that in our examina
tion of the Ural Mountains, even up to 60° north latitude, my com
panions and myself could trace no evidence whatever of boulders
having been transported from these mountains to great distances
upon their flanks; although the peaks rise to heights of 5000 and
6000 feet above the sea, and the chain extends from north to south
through eighteen degrees of latitude. In every portion of the Ural
Mountains, and on both their Asiatic and European flanks, the
detritus is of a purely local character; and in it are occasionally
entombed the bones of the Mammoth, Rhinoceros tichorrhinus, and
other great extinct quadrupeds, mixed up with gold sand and gravel.
 Transporting ourselves to the south of Russia, we find the upper
portion of the cliffs of the Sea of Azof composed of local detritus
and clay equally charged with the same remains.
    The general examination of Russia proves in the most emphatic
manner, that the central masses of her continent, though exempt
 from  all plutonic agency, have undergone grand but tranquil oscilla

   Caucasian Chain.—We must now estimate the efforts of an ob
server, who, in common with Agassiz, does such honour to the little
canton of Neufchatel.         Though the name of M. Dubois de Mont
pereux has escaped the notice of my predecessors, an outline of
his chief labours was laid before the geologists of France, in 1837,
by M. Elie de Beaumont.             Attention having been latterly much
directed towards Russia and the adjacent regions, it becomes my
pleasing duty, the additional researches of M. Dubois having been
recently published, and having myself largely profited by them, in
the construction of a map of that empire, to invite your consider
ation to his great work.

    No country is more entitled to the name of metamorphic than the

the high class of merit which belongs to the researches of M. Du
bois is yet known to very few of them.*.
   Under the head of Asia Minor Mr. Murchison refers to the geological re
searches of one of the Secretaries of the Society, Mr. W. J. Hamilton, as
having connected the region described by M. Dubois with the southern
Mediterranean types; notices, under the head of Turkey in Europe, Servia,
&c., the investigations of M. Boué, uniting the distant regions of Asia Minor
with Western Europe; and he then briefly relates some of the prominent
results of the researches of M. Sismonda in the Piedmontese Alps. He next
proceeds to “North AMERICAN Geology,” in which he alludes to the com
munications on that subject contained in Silliman's American Journal of
Science; also to the Memoirs of Professor W. R. and D. H. Rogers, and
to the papers and views of Mr. R. C. Taylor, Mr. Featherstonhaugh, Dr.
Dale Owen and others; he then proceeds to the

dences compared.—At the last Anniversary we were aware, from the
independent     evidence of Mr. Lyell, that both the bituminous and
 anthracitic coals of Pennsylvania were underlaid by Stigmaria
Jicoides and fireclay; and we have now before us the result of the la
 bours of our associate Mr. Logan in the coal-fields of Pennsylvania
 and Nova Scotia, in examining which his chief object seems to have
 been to ascertain whether the facts relating to the theory of the origin
 of coal, as seen in North America, were analogous to those to which .
 he has so successfully directed attention in England.

logists may well be led to suppose that the theory which, if I may so
speak, has recently been rendered fashionable, of the origin of coal
by subsidence of vegetable matter in situ, must be considered esta
blished as of general application.          I, however, adhere to the cau
tionary remarks which I ventured to make last year, and will now
 endeavour to impress upon your minds the inapplicability of such
a theory, however true under limitations, to large portions of the
 carboniferous strata in different parts of the world.
    Since our last Anniversary statements have appeared in our own
 country, both supporting and impugning the probable truth of
 the theory.     The last meeting of the British Association being held
 at Manchester, geologists were there assembled in the centre of a
 tract appealed to with great reason by the supporters of this theory
 as containing many proofs of            truth; for,

exception, all the floors throughout      estimated thicknessan      near                        of
5000 feet contain the plant Stigmaria ficoides usually with        leaves                       its

the coal has been formed, grew upon the spot.
    At the same meeting this view was contested      Mr.W.C.William             by
son, also well acquainted with the structure       the country around      of
Manchester. His chief arguments were, however, derived from other
tracts, and they assisted     proving, 1st, the frequent association

with     the fact that large quantities                             of vegetables are often matted
together with marine and estuary shells, phaenomena indicative of
drift. Admitting that the floors of the coal or underclay present a
great uniformity both in the absence of other plants and in the
almost general occurrence of the Stigmaria, Mr. Williamson allows
that a plant, found so very generally in such a position, may have
grown in estuaries into which the other vegetables were drifted.
Acknowledging that the drift theory is open to some objections, he
stated that one of the greatest of these               his opinion, the ex     is,

brought from numerous localities in Nova Scotia by Mr. Lyell,
and which he has obligingly submitted to the examination of
M. de Verneuil and myself, that I have not much doubt of these
gypsiferous deposits and associated limestones of Nova Scotia,
being absolutely the same as the Permian rocks of Russia. Even
lithologically there is the greatest similarity, whether in the large
rock-masses of gypsum, red and green marls, conglomerates and sand
stones, or in the magnesian and sandy limestones; and when we
compare the fossils submitted to                the parallelism    us,    firmly                        is    as

                                   It   is   that these American strata con
tain  a  few species identical with forms which typify the Magnesian

for giving us this outline reconnaissance of the geological structure
of a colony, to become well acquainted with which will require
elaborate surveys, conducted by those who have previously made
themselves masters of the keystones of succession in the adjacent
continent.    When, therefore, the true geological equivalents of
 Canada and Nova Scotia shall have been thoroughly established by
the researches of Mr. Logan, and placed in exact relation to the
well-developed   rocks of the United States, the obscurity which
 shrouds Newfoundland may be dispelled".
    Secondary and Tertiary Rocks, and superficial deposits of North
America.-In     my Address      of last year   I   had no hesitation in   pre
dicting, that geologists would reap great instruction from the visit
of Mr. Lyell to the United States. The earlier sketches which he
sent to us, including accounts of the Palaeozoic rocks, might be taken,
indeed, as some earnest of what was to follow, and as we are
well acquainted with his powers of generalizing and habits of
faithful research, we could not well over-estimate the amount of
production at his hands. The documents which he has laid before
you have fully justified our anticipations.  One of his memoirs, on
the Tertiary formations and their connexion with the chalk in Vir
ginia, North and South Carolina, and other parts of the United
 States, has a very important bearing in showing the amount of
agreement of those deposits with the strata of similar age in Europe.
Noticing with due approbation the works of Professors W. B. and
H. D. Rogers and Mr. Conrad, on the Tertiary rocks of Virginia,
he shows, that certain deposits above the chalk are of true Eocene
 character, and never contain Secondary fossils or any forms inter
mediate between the newer Secondary and older Tertiary types.
 These Eocene beds are surmounted by rich shelly deposits, the con
 tents of which bear a great generic resemblance to those of the
 Suffolk crag and the Faluns of Touraine, and are therefore refer
 able to the Miocene epoch.
    In North Carolina, black shales, first described by Mr. Hodge,
 are shown to be of the cretaceous age by containing Belemnites,
 Exogyrae, Gryphaeae and Ostraeae, a few of the species being well
 known in Europe, and found by myself in the distant parts of
 Russia.   This cretaceous deposit is covered by a peculiar calca
 reous rock, the Wilmington limestone and conglomerate, which had
 been termed Upper Secondary, and supposed to indicate a passage
 from the Secondary to the Tertiary periods, but in which Mr. Lyell
 could detect no organic remains to support that opinion, the only
   * I  regret that I accidentally omitted to call attention in my last Address
to a short memoir, read during the preceding session by Mr. Henwood,
upon the Silurian Rocks of Lockport near Niagara. Having, long been
assiduously occupied in   his native county Cornwall   in studying the mineral
ization  ofrocks, Mr. Henwood    is,
                                  I   understand, about      publish
                                                            to      a   work on
the metalliferous deposits of  Cornwall and Devon.

determinable species being of the Eocene age. Again, in South
Carolina, on the Santee river, a white limestone occurs, which litho
logically so resembles one of the upper members of the cretaceous
deposits of New Jersey, that even Mr. Lyell, at a first view, had no
doubt it was a portion of the same formation: on examination,
however, of the fossils, it proved also to belong to the tertiary series.
This lithological resemblance had erroneously led to the admission
of several well-known tertiary fossils into the Cretaceous system of
America, an error which Mr. Lyell has removed. This correction
is valuable, and, though it tends to negative a hope which                               I
once entertained, founded upon what my friend Professor Sedgwick
and myself believed to be very good evidence on the flanks of the
Austrian Alps, that beds of passage would be discovered between the
Cretaceous and Eocene epochs, I am bound to say that the transat
lantic researches of Mr. Lyell go far towards the establishment of
an extensive, though I still incline to consider not a general break
between those periods; for he prudently admits, that evidences dif
fering from those he obtained, may be found in the Southern states
bordering the Atlantic, of which he explored but a small part.       Re
ferring you to the abstracts of his memoirs, and knowing that you
will soon have from him more complete details, I will not occupy your
time in attempting to give what would convey an imperfect idea of
the succession of the widely spread tertiary deposits, which occupy
nearly all the portion of Georgia and South Carolina between the
mountains and the Atlantic.          Illustrating the observation of Mr.
Maclure, that the first falls of the Savannah and other rivers of this
region are at the junction of the tertiary strata with granitic and
hypogene rocks, Mr. Lyell shows, that at some points, as near Au
gusta in Georgia, where the former have been made up of the de
tritus of the primary rock, they have the aspect of gneiss; a fact
quite analogous to that which I had the pleasure of observing in his
company many years ago in Central France, where the oldest ter
tiary and freshwater beds repose at once upon the granites of the
Puy en Velay. After a laborious comparison of a profusion of fos
sil shells from the American strata,

acknowledges the liberal assistance and co-operation                Mr. Con
rad, Mr. Lyell sees fresh and strong grounds for adhering                    his    to
former views respecting the value                      of

formations on the borders of the Lakes Erie and Ontario; and
states that in the valley of the St. Lawrence, as far down as Quebec,
marine shells of arctic character have been found associated with
coarse detritus. As some of this shelly and boulder deposit lies at
about 500 feet above the sea, and as Lake Ontario is at a much
lower level, it is inferred that the sea in which the drift was formed
extended far over the territory bordering that lake. That the same
sea extended as far south as 44°, 30' north latitude, is proved by
the presence on the shores of Lake Champlain, of marine shells;
which, in their Arctic forms and close agreement with those of
 Uddevalla in Sweden, formerly described by himself, are supposed
 to imply, like those of the St. Lawrence, the former prevalence
 of a cold climate when the drift originated. In regard to the far
 transported boulders, they have in one locality (Beauport) been found
both above and below the sea-shells.
  The parallel and continuous ridges of sand and gravel, which by
Mr. Roy and other authors had            considered to be the shores
                                             been
of an enormous lake, successively                             on clay of
                                                 let off, are said to rest
the boulder formation, and yet to be occasionally capped by blocks
of granite and other hard rocks. Comparing them with the Osars
of Sweden, and stating, from the evidence of Mr. Whittlesey, that
their base-lines are not so horizontal as had been supposed, Mr.
Lyell inclines to the belief, though no shells have been found in
them, that they were        all
                           formed under water, and probably beneath
the sea,        as
            banks     or
                       bars    sand, admitting

                                            to
 whether vast freshwater lakes, extending far beyond the area
 those which now exist, may not,       one period, have covered the

larger   than those which now prevail, has recently been sustained
by the Rev. Mr. Schoolcraft, an American geographer, in a memoir

twenty years of his life in their vicinity, believes that the former
great lakes have been lowered by ancient dislocations. As examples

submerged, and the cavities filled with the marine boulder forma

                                                   the land, the parallel sand
ridges were produced, the boulder formation partially denuded, and
the different lakes probably formed             succession, leaving
                                                     in                  partial                  a

near Queenstown.         The first or uppermost fall, he argues, must
have been of moderate height, when the land was sufficiently raised
to wear away the Niagara shale, and undermine the incumbent lime
stone, which is of slight thickness at                                 its

552           Geological Society:                Anniversary                Address, 1843.
   The presence at Big Bone Lick, on the Ohio, in Kentucky, of
great quantities of bones of buffaloes near the spot where salt sources
issue through marshy lands, and the existence of the beaten tracks
by which these animals approached this spot, render it highly pro
bable that they were allured thither during certain seasons in extra
ordinary numbers, and that many of them were engulfed and de
stroyed in the marshy ground.
      Mr. Lyell endeavours to show that what occurred      within the
historic aera to the buffalo, in                       all
                                      probability occurred also   the                                      to
extinct mammals, whose bones are found            the subjacent clay        in
and marsh         depthto

                            twenty-five feet, and are associated with
modern fluviatile, terrestrial and lacustrine shells, showing that floods
of  the Ohio have drifted and re-arranged buffalo bones                      higher                   at
levels than the      comparatively       ancient marsh.       Mr.  Lyell   suggests,
that         no
           great physical revolution                         of
                                                   the surface has taken place

 den, near Archangel in Russia, in Great Britain or in America as far
 south even as Lake Champlain, a very cold climate must have pre
 vailed; and as such submarine accumulations were elevated and
formed land before the great mammals in question appeared; so it
is manifest, as Mr. Lyell remarks, that these creatures could not
have been destroyed by the same cold as that which gave rise to the
Arctic shells, and with them to the correlative phaenomenon of the
transport of great boulders and the scratching and scorings of rocks.
This clear reasoning appears to me to be an unanswerable refutation
of a leading feature of the glacial theory as propounded in     widest                             its
sense.   At the same time      must be admitted, that the surface of

trated work of M. Alcide d'Orbigny, published at the expense of
the French government, and for which geologists have been long
waiting with impatience. During eight years of research, this gifted
naturalist successively examined the coasts of Brazil, the Republic
of Uruguay, the Argentine Republic from the frontiers of Paraguay
to Patagonia, the coasts of Chili, Peru and Bolivia; and by a long
residence in the last-named country he was enabled to survey, in
many directions, a large region from the coast to the interior.
The details of his labours form a first part of the work, illus
trated by many sections and by one of most beautifully coloured
geological maps which ever fell under my observation.                 In his ge
neral observations M. d'Orbigny remarks, that his own observa
tions extend from 12° to 42° south latitude, and from 45° to 80°
longitude west of Paris; a surface comprised between the coast of
the Atlantic Ocean in Patagonia to Lima on the Pacific; whilst,

fossils from more distant localities, his general views may be said

    We have, however, but to advance northwards to the Lycian
 Taurus, where Mr. E. Forbes has made known to us the elevation
to great heights of tertiary marine shells; or north-eastwards to Syria,
where the Dead Sea, as now computed, lies upwards of 1300 feet
below the level of the Mediterranean, and we are furnished with
the most remarkable proofs of the mighty oscillations to which the
surface has been subjected, even in recent epochs. In receding
from the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea, the Lake of Tiberias marks
the first depression, being 328 feet beneath the sea, and from this
lake to the Dead Sea the declination is nearly 1000 feet ! A few
years back only and we were startled at the announcement, that the
level of the Caspian Sea was 300 feet below the Mediterranean; and
more accurate measurements have, indeed, reduced the depression
to 82 feet; but that any cavity on a portion of the present surface
should be 1300 feet beneath the level of the adjacent seas, proves
an amount of vibration within a limited area, which is truly asto
nishing".

links in animal life, as well as to fossil plants, the geologist has thus ac
quired a new and powerful auxiliary. I am here, however, treading
on ground now fortunately occupied by the Microscopical Society,
the active promoters of which are well entitled to our gratitude.
    Ornithichnites.—To American geologists we are indebted for our
acquaintance with this new class of phaenomena.            The existence of
the fossil bones of birds of ordinary size had, it is true, been ascer
tained by Dr. Mantell in the Wealden strata, but great was our
astonishment, and I may add our incredulity, when Professor Hitch
cock first announced, that in rocks of considerable antiquity (the
exact age of which is still uncertain), there existed innumerable im
pressions in successive layers, which must have been formed by
birds, some of them of gigantic size, and to which he boldly assigned
the name of “Ornithichnites.”         Various opinions were entertained,
and much scepticism prevailed concerning these impressions; but
it is due to Dr. Buckland to state, that he never doubted that the
views of Professor Hitchcock were founded on true natural analo
gies, and he accordingly published this opinion, with illustrative
plates, in his Bridgewater Treatise.     The recent visit of Mr. Lyell
to North America, and a memoir he has read, as well as a com
munication from Dr. James Deane of Massachusets, have neces
sarily brought this highly interesting subject again before us; whilst
a very remarkable discovery in natural history has at       events almost                all
entirely dispelled scepticism regarding the true bird-like character                                             of

 and of the original discoverer, Dr. James Deane, who it appears, by
 the clear and modest paper lately brought before us by Dr. Mantell,
 was the first person who called the Professor's attention to the phae
 nomenon, expressing then his own belief, from what he saw in                     ex
isting nature, that the footmarks were made by birds. Let us now
hope, therefore, that the last vestiges of doubt may be removed by
the discovery of the bones of some fossil Dinornis; and in the mean
time let us honour the great moral courage exhibited by Professor
Hitchcock, in throwing down his opinions before an incredulous
public”.
  Still, however, comes the question, what is the age of the rock on
which the Ornithichnites have been impressed. Consulting what Mr.
Lyell    has recently written, we find that he does not decide this point
further than by saying, that they were formed between the carboni
ferous and cretaceous epochs, the only remains hitherto found in the
deposit being ichthyolites of the genera Palaeoniscus and Catopterus,
with some fossil wood. The presence of a Palaeoniscus would lead
 me to suspect that the deposit might be of the age of the Zechstein
or Magnesian Limestone; for in Russia, wherever the calcareous
 matter which represents that rock thins out, vast tracts are occu
 pied by marls, sandstones and conglomerates of red, green and
white colours, which form the Permian system, and in these beds
Palaeonisci occur.     If the fossil fishes from both localities be placed
in the hands of Professor Agassiz, and a comparison be made of the
fossil wood from Russia and North America, the query may be satis
factorily answered. In the meantime I cannot read the descriptions
of this American deposit, and carry the Russian types in my recol
lection, without surmising, that in the sequel the Ornithichnite and
Palaeoniscus beds of Connecticut and the gypsiferous rocks of Nova
Scotia, distant as they are from each other, will be found to belong
to one natural group—the Permian ; and if this view be borne out,
it follows that a bird analogous to the Dinornis lived at a period when
Saurian animals first began to appear upon the surface, and when
the last links of primaeval or palaeozoic life were not obliterated               t
In this case the value of the philosophic caution given by Mr. Lyell
will be very apparent, viz. that we ought not to infer the non-ex
istence of land animals from the absence of their remains in con
temporaneous marine strataf.
   Saurians, Cetaceans, &c.—I am not aware that researches of the
past year have added much to our acquaintance with new forms of
vertebrata in the secondary deposits, though it must not be unre
corded, that our zealous contributor M. Hermann Von Meyer, has
added to the list of Saurians of the Muschelkalk a new genus, which
he describes under the name of Simosaurus.

Brandt, of which I have been just informed by my friend Count
Keyserling. Pallas had spoken of a locality among the cliffs of Ta
man, in the southern steppes, where remains of whales were found;
Rathke had mentioned the head of an animal of which the vertebrae
were known, and which he described as approaching to a whale;
and more recently Professor Eichwald considered this fossil as be
longing to the Dolphins and named it Xiphias priscus. Obtaining
possession of the specimen for the museum of St. Petersburgh, Pro
fessor Brandt worked the head of the colossal creature out of the
rock in which it was imbedded, and pronouncing it to belong to a
new family of whales, described it under the name of Cetotherium
Rathkii. This fossil whale forms a new link in the animal king
dom, and is more nearly allied to the herbivorous cetaceans than
to the Dolphins. Its position in the geological series is also most
remarkable; for the rock in which it occurs contains shells similar to
those of the tertiary deposits of the Miocene age, which extend from
Volhynia and Podolia to the Crimea and Taman.            It is also very
remarkable, that along with this herbivorous cetacean the other
organic remains (among which, however, banks of corals occur)
have more the character of the inhabitants of a brackish sea than
those of the subjacent rocks, whose fauna more resembles that of the
Black Sea and the Mediterranean.
   These relations are in accordance with modern conditions, and
are, indeed, explained by an analogy in our own country, for an ac
quaintance with which I am indebted to our Curator, Mr. E.
Forbes.     The lake of Stennis, in the Orkney Islands, cele
brated by Sir Walter Scott, has been converted, whether by
elevation of the land or other cause, from a saltwater loch
into a freshwater and marshy tract, and with this great but
gradual change, certain marine genera have continued to live
on amid their new associates of land and fresh water, whilst others
have perished. That which is taught on a small scale in the Scottish
lake has occurred over a vast area in the case of the Caspian Sea;
which, in consequence of separation from the Black Sea has passed
into a brackish state, and the same hardy and time-serving marine
genera as in Scotland have continued to exist in their new abode 1

                     of                                similar animals,

            Mastodontoid and Megatherioid Animals.                561
from amid the alluvia of a tributary of the St. Louis river, where
the chief remains had probably been an object of superstitious tra
dition on the part of the Indian tribes. It does not appear
whether the zealous Prussian had any scruples to overcome ;
 but I presume they must have been considerable, if I were to
judge from my own experience in other wild countries.          In tra
 velling along the eastern flanks of the Ural Mountains, it was my lot
 to visit many sites of gold alluvia in which bones of the mammoth
 and other extinct quadrupeds are found, and for these remains the
 poor Bashkirs, the original inhabitants of the tract, preserved so
 deep a veneration, that in freely permitting the search after the
 true wealth of their country which they were incapable of extract
 ing, their sole appeal to the Russian miners was, “Take from us
 our gold, but for God's sake leave us our ancestors.”
    Overcoming, however, all difficulties, M. Koch succeeded in ex
tracting, and afterwards in setting up, the most complete specimen
of the species which has ever been seen. Applying to it the provi
sional name of “Missourium,” he exhibited it for some time in the
United States, and then brought it with many of the associated bones
to London, in the hopes both of having the remains perfectly described
and of obtaining for them a price worthy of the British nation.
    The arrival of such a collection could not fail to excite the most
lively interest and curiosity among our naturalists, and the bones
having been attentively examined by many members of this Society,
produced a diversity of opinion respecting the generic character
of the chief remains. North America had long been a fertile
mine of such reliquiae, and the naturalists of the United States
had not been backward in studying and describing them. It is not,
therefore, a little remarkable that the same difference of opinion as
to the generic and specific identity of the animals that prevailed
across the Atlantic, is presented in the Memoirs which have recently
been read before us; Dr. Harlan and Mr. Cooper having main
tained opinions, with which, to a great extent, Professor Owen con
 curs, whilst Dr. Grant and M. Koch have supported the views of the
late Dr. Godman.
    Citing the American authorities on his side of the question, in
 cluding Dr. Hayes, and enumerating no less than thirteen species of
 Mastodon and six species of Tetracaulodon, Dr. Grant has made a
 vigorous effort to vindicate the true generic characters of the  Te
 tracaulodon as founded on the presence of a tusk or tusks in the
 lower jaw and certain variations in the form of the crowns of the
 molar teeth.
    This view has been sustained by Mr. A. Nasmyth in an elaborate
 paper “On the Minute Structure of the tusks of extinct Masto
 dontoid animals.” Microscopical examination of portions of the tusks
 believed to belong to five distinct species, viz. Mastodon giganteus,
  Tetracaulodon Godmani, T. Kochii, T. Tapiroides and the Mis
 sourium, has also led this author to the same inference as Dr.
 Grant; and he concludes with the remark, that, if it be established
 that specific differences positively do exist among all these animals,

 562        Geological Society: Anniversary Address, 1843.
 the value of such microscopic researches is great; but if the five
 animals are grouped as one, then such mode of observation is of no
 value in palaeontological science.
     Professor Owen had previously expressed opinions at variance
 with those of Drs. Hayes, Godman and Grant and Mr. Nasmyth,
 and his views have been supported within these walls by my pre
 decessor, Dr. Buckland.         Pointing out certain mistakes in the set
 ting up of the Missourium, as exhibited in the Egyptian Hall, he
 compares the fossil with                        all
                                     forms with which           was acquainted;            he

 records of creation—are however but a portion of the labours of
 geologists.      They have also struggled to explain the causes
 of those    great    revolutions.        In some continents, it is true, the
 pages in the book of nature are, as it were, unruffled; for, by
 whatever agency effected, it is certain that beds of vast ancient
 oceans have been so equably elevated and depressed, and again so
 steadily elevated from beneath the sea, that the continuity of their
 rocky deposits over areas larger than our kingdoms of Western
 Europe is unbroken, and their original condition almost entirely
 preserved. In other regions, on the contrary, the sediments in the sea
 and the masses of the land have been pierced by numerous out
 bursts of igneous and gaseous matters, accompanied by violent
 oscillations and breaks, whereby the chronicles of succession have
 been sorely defaced, and often rendered more illegible than the most
 carbonized of the papyri found under the lava of Vesuvius.                        Nay,

    of this   problem was given by Gauss in his Supplementum Theoriae
,   Combinationis, &c. (Gottingen, 1828), and the method has been ap
    plied by Bessel to the triangulation for the measure of the meridional
    degree in Prussia, and also to the computation of the extension of
    the French meridian through Spain, from Montjouy to Formentera.
       The triangulation which has been selected in the present case for
    an example of the method, includes ten stations (commencing with
    the base on Hounslow Heath), at which thirty-five independent
    angles were observed. For determining the corrections of those
    angles, nineteen equations of condition are furnished by the observa
    tions, among which are instances of all the kinds which can occur
    in a trigonometrical survey. The final results differ extremely little
    from those given in the Survey, the greatest difference in the length
    of any side amounting only to about half a foot, and this in a
    distance of nearly eighteen miles. This close agreement must be
    attributed, however, to the smallness of the triangles, and the
    very great accuracy of the observations in this portion of the Ord
    nance Survey.     If the distances between the stations had been two
    or three times greater, the observations would probably have been
    less exact, and the differences between the results of the two me
    thods of computation more considerable; but however this may be,
    it is only by following the method here explained that the whole of
    the precision which is attained by the observations is preserved in
    the results; and for this reason the method should be adopted in all
    important surveys, particularly in those for determining the curva
    ture of the earth. Besides giving a determinate result, and that re
    sult the one which is most probably nearest the truth, it has the
    great advantage of superseding all arbitrary corrections, and ad
    mitting only such as are rigorously deduced from the observations.

gularities, on the edge of the disc, produce distinct beads. Professor
Powell has tried a similar experiment with the circular opake disc
and the rays of the sun reflected from a small piece of glass, which
produced a most brilliant ring, the disc being nearly double the ap
parent diameter of the sun : and he proposes to pursue the inquiry
still further.
                Meeti NG OF THE ROYAL INSTITUTION.
                           Friday, June 9, 1843.
   The lecture was by Professor Faraday, on the “Electricity of
Steam."     The Professor commenced his lecture by illustrating the
extent of our knowledge of the electricity which accompanies the
formation of steam previous to the observations about to be detailed,
showing that when water is poured into a heated metal cup electri
city was set free; and that if the vessel, into which the water was
placed, was above a certain elevated temperature, no electricity was
evolved in consequence of the water being prevented from contact
with the containing vessel by a stratum of steam.           The Professor
then detailed the first observations made at Newcastle by one of the
workmen in attendance on a boiler belonging to the Newcastle and
Carlisle Railway, and whose report, that the boiler was full of fire,
from the fact that when he placed his hand near it an electric spark
was communicated, drew the attention of Mr. Armstrong to the
subject, the result of whose investigations was then given.       A boiler
having been arranged for the purpose of illustrating this subject, the
Professor exhibited the production of the spark during the emission
of the steam, and showed most conclusively that the boiler and
appendages were charged with negative electricity, while the issuing
steam was in the opposite or positive state; that it was necessary
that the boiler should be insulated; that the steam should issue
 through a small aperture; that the material of which this aperture
 was constructed modified materially the quantity of electricity, wood
 and the metals having been found by experiment to be the best
 fitted for the purpose; that the introduction of a small portion of
 saline matter, as sulphate of soda, into the exit chamber prevented
 entirely the elimination of electricity, and even when common
 water was introduced it had the same effect; that by long con
 tinuance of the issuing current of steam, electricity was gradually
 developed, from the condensed steam displacing and driving out the
 saline matter, pure water being a necessary element for          produc
                                                                its
 tion; and that the whole phaenomena arose from the rubbing           of
                                                                       the
 condensed water against the tube from which the steam was issuing.
 The Professor also proved that the introduction   of   ammonia reversed
 the electrical states, what was before negative becoming positive,
 and that  as   the ammonia was expelled the original states were gra
 dually restored; that turpentine and acids acted    in   the same way in
 saline  substances,  from their   enveloping the particlesof   water  a as
 film of   their own substance. The lecturer considered, from these
 facts, that the view advocated  by    Mr. Armstrong, that the electricity
 arose from the passage     of    water into the aeriform state, was not
 tenable, and that the thunder-cloud and the lightning's flash could
 not  be  attributedto   this origin.
