      HE formula       which the following memoir is intended to
       expose, is called new; because, to the best of my know
ledge, it has never been used or suggested hitherto.                  It is
also   rightly   termed   empirical, in so far as it is not  susceptible
of geometrical demonstration, but thus far only; since in point
of fact, it was derived entirely from considerations d priori
and independent of any experiment or interpolation.                      Of
course, it was compared as soon as possible with the tempe
rature corresponding to the ordinary atmospheric pressure;
and after a satisfactory agreement had been found at this
point, the accord of the formula with observations at other
points, above and below, was regarded as neither accidental nor
surprising.       The extent and nearness of this accord through
a  range    of  experiment    more extensive than has hitherto been
included in one and the same table, it is the principal aim of
the present paper to exhibit, after having shown in few words
the reasonableness of the formula and                                 its
                                                 limits (or rather want

grees) which expresses the existing temperature.     Or, what
amounts to the same thing, the pressure of steam whose tem
perature is observed on any scale, is directly as the number
of degrees read for the temperature; and inversely, as the
whole number of degrees on the same scale between the
melting of ice and the boiling of water.    With Fahrenheit's
scale, calling t the number of degrees at any temperature, the
pressure of steam at that temperature must be proportionate to
i.       .    Again, the pressure of steam must be always directly as
the absolute heat of conversion, or, as it is otherwise termed,
the latent heat; expressed, of course, in degrees of the scale
assumed.      For, the greater the number of degrees for such
latent heat,  the greater also will be the repulsive force of the
heat existing in the steam; which repulsive force may be as
sumed to be at least a function of the elasticity of the vapour.
And as such repulsive force takes effect in part by expanding
the medium vaporized, and the greater such expansion, the
less will be the remaining elasticity, it follows that the pres
sure of steam in the ordinary state of an atmosphere must be
also inversely as                its
                      increased volume. This increased volume

and Tredgold, and perhaps others, in approximating the re
sults of experiments.           Moreover, it was apparent that the
numerical results in         English     inches from the formula were
altogether an accidental coincidence, which, dependent upon
the properties of numbers, could not be expected to occur
upon the use of any other scale than that of Fahrenheit; un
less, indeed, one should adopt the fancy of Mr. Woolf, who
supposed that he had discovered an immediate numerical re

should not stand, it may be very well replied, that the objec
tion may hold good against the factors without prejudice to
the form.    It is quite likely that, below 32°F., it is theoreti
cally no longer proper to use in behalf of chilled and freezing
vapour, the number (990°) which belongs to boiling steam. But
as even here and for nearly 60° below the melting-point of
ice, the actual formula was not so very discordant from the
results of experiment,             I
                            had the less motive for modifying or
transforming it into a nearer agreement at this unusual tem
perature.    The determination of a limit of this sort, whether
real or  assumed,    is necessary in converting easily a formula
like the  present,  into one which will show the pressure in at
mospheres;–a method which, as it extricates the results from
any dependence on a particular system of weights and mea
sures and thus makes them generally applicable, is of course
in any purely scientific investigation much to be preferred.
It is obvious that such a scale of atmospheres or volumes must
start from the degree where the expansions and the tendency
to expand (which is elasticity), so far as they are due to tem
perature, are null. The limit that we have found, then, of
 105°-13 below 0°Fahr., is such a term; and the distance be
tween that and the other extremity of the scale, or 317° 13
 (which is the measure on the thermometer of one atmosphere),
becomes the new denominator to replace the 180° actually
used for the pressure in inches of mercury.
   In fact, I had expected, in advance, to find the present ma
nometric formula (as it may be termed) becoming a barometric
one, by putting it into this shape;

doned this theoretical expression and preferred to deduce a
formula for pressure in atmospheres from the original one, in
the ordinary analytic way. This results in the alternative

either of which may be adopted, according as we prefer to re
tain in view the factor of the latent heat, or that of the expan
sion at the unitary atmospheric pressure.             In practice, the
constant fraction may be substituted by the number 0.33151.
For the original formula, the similar constant was carried no
further than four places of decimals; in this, where the unit of
pressure is thirty times larger, both the attainment of equal
precision requires, and the facility of calculation allows, an
other decimal place to be taken.
   These decimal constants might, indeed, have been given in
both formulae at once, instead of the fractional expression
from which they originate, were it not that I thought it de
sirable to preserve those factors which, besides solving the
equation, indicate also, in part accidentally and in part essen
tially, certain elementary relations between pressure and tem
perature (or rather certain epochs in those relations), which
are important in the future complete theory of the subject.
 For example, the denominator (1695) which expresses the
number of volumes of steam under the atmospheric pressure
and at a temperature of 212°, developed from an unitary vo
lume of water at               its
                        maximum density, shows also the number
of  atmospheres, the equivalent        whose pressure will, below

certain  temperature,   prohibit  the development       steam beyond   of
the sphere      said unitary volume. On the other hand, the nu
                 of
merator (990°) gives this limiting temperature; and shows the
degree      on
             Fahrenheit's scale, where the force       steam becomes   of
equivalent      1695 atmospheres.

selected now from one and now from the other set, and re

   Mr. Dalton's experiments were distinct, and are therefore
given      distinct columns. The numbers

 14    Mr.     J.    H. Alexander         on the Tension                  of Vapour of Water.
    The temperatures of the Franklin Institute, which were
 taken for the composition of the table, come from the second
 series of their reported experiments.         Pressures have been
 also taken from both the other series, when their temperatures
 were already in the table; and, adopting this method as a
 uniform system, I did not allow myself to exclude the ano
 maly which shows itself between the different series at the
 temperature of 300°.
    Of the experiments of M. Regnault, I have already spoken
 sufficiently.
    It is apparent, upon a slight examination of the table, that
 the calculated pressures do not differ more from the average
 of the experimental ones, than these experimental ones do
among themselves ; which is about as much as could be de
sired to show the validity of the formula, and the reasonable
ness of        its
               application, instead                of
                                        others which are     general                              in

results he has recorded for his last observation.  These two
different pressures accuse a corresponding difference of tem
perature of 0°-63 F.; a possible error, not so materially less
than what we have found as the maximum that can attach to
the formula. The Franklin Institute experiments, which cor
                                               I
respond closely with Ure's, have omitted for a similar reason;
they do not profess even to read nearer than 0°-25 F. They
may, however, for illustration be compared with those of the
Academy, as under:-
      Academy pressure, 145-15 inches: temp. observed, 305°39; temp. calculated,                307°51

Discounting the observed difference from the calculated one,
we have left 4°11 F. as the error of one or the other series;
an amount nearly four times that of the formula.
   It is manifest that the comparative error of the formula is
only approximate;      because it is based in each case upon
only one observation instead of upon the combined mean of
all the observations, or, rather, the mean of the differences at
                                             ;
every epoch observed.      Also, it can only be called an error,
upon the assumption of the mean of all the experiments re
sulting in absolute accuracy; an assumption by no means to
be made; for in general        utmost that can be done for any
experimental series, is to determine the limits of       necessary                       its

        LAUBER               first showed           in   1658 that common salt could

Hamel proved the base       common salt      ofsoda.   Previous        to   be

the alkali from sulphate of soda by fusing with charcoal, and
digesting the fused mass in acetic acid, evaporating the acetate
of soda thus formed to dryness, and calcining the residue.
   Margraff endeavoured to decompose sulphate of soda by
limestone, but without success.    In 1768 Hagen showed that
salt might be decomposed by means of potash, chloride of
potassium and caustic soda being formed.
   Bergmann succeeded in decomposing salt by caustic barytes.
   In 1775 it was shown by Scheele that salt was partially
decomposed by oride of lead.
   In 1782 Guyton and Carny decomposed salt by fusion with
felspar.
      In   1781      Constantini         succeeded in decomposing       salt by
means      of alum.
    The sulphates of lime, magnesia, ammonia, potash, &c. de
compose salt, as also iron pyrites.
    To convert the sulphate of soda into caustic or carbonated
alkali was, however, the process of greatest importance. The
first step, viz. the conversion of soda into sulphuret of sodium,
was known to Glauber, Stahl, Du Hamel, Margraff and
others. The difficulty was to get rid of the sulphur. Du
Hamel effected this by means of acetic acid. But in the year
1784 the present process was discovered by Le Blanc and
Dizé, and in the beginning of 1791 it was patented by Le
Blanc. He used carbonate of lime to convert the sulphuret of
sodium into carbonate of soda.
   The proportions used by him were
                         2 parts dry sulphate of soda.
                         2    ...    carbonate of lime.
                         1         ...        ground charcoal.
   These were intimately mixed and introduced into rever               a
beratory furnace, where     strong heat was applied
                                    a                        Afterto   it.
this had been continued for about an hour, the fused mass was
raked out       of
              the furnace and allowed      solidify.   When this
                                                         to
cooled,                             up
                           and exposed                                 of
                                                          In to

           it                                the action     moist
air, which caused        it   to
                        crumble down.         this way the caustic
soda was converted into carbonate                   of
                                        soda, the carbonic acid
being derived from the atmosphere.        After being ground                 it
was  ready for use.
   The soda process,           present carried on, will
                                   as    at                   best      be

     II.
      This brings us to the consideration of the second part of
the process, namely,–the conversion of sulphate of soda into
crude carbonate of soda or British barilla.
   This is effected by the combined action of coal and carbo
nate of lime.     The following table shows the proportions
commonly used:—
                                                         Per cent.           Theoretical quantity.

    These, after being intimately mixed, are introduced into a
reverberatory furnace and strongly heated. The mass soon
becomes soft, when care must be taken to stir it frequently in
order to expose a fresh surface to the heat. When it becomes
of the consistence of dough the chemical action commences, and
jets of inflamed carbonic oxide begin to issue from              The                       it.

cium and carbonate of soda—

      But   if  this compound were digested in water, a reverse
action would immediately take place, sulphuret of sodium and
carbonate of lime being again formed.                    To obviate this diffi
culty, a large excess of lime is used in the process, nearly
 twice as much as would otherwise be absolutely necessary.
 This excess of lime causes the formation of a compound inso
 luble in water, the composition of which is 3CaS, CaO. This
 substance has no effect on a solution of carbonate or caustic
 soda.
         Analysis of Soda Ball, or Crude Carbonate of Soda.
      An average sample was obtained by pounding a large quan
 tity of the soda ball, and from this the specimens analysed
  were taken.
       1. To estimate the amount of soluble and insoluble salts.-
  A portion of the substance was thrown on a weighed filter and
  washed with water at about 120°                 F., until     a  portion of the
  filtered liquor left no residue on evaporation; the filter and
  insoluble matter were then dried in a water-bath and weighed.

    11. Carbon.—To determine the amount of carbon, a por
tion of the ball was treated with muriatic acid and the solution
evaporated to dryness; dilute acid was then added, and the
insoluble matter thrown on a filter which had been previously
dried at 212° and weighed.                    The total amount of carbon,
silica and     sand,    was thus ascertained.               The whole was then
ignited and weighed, and from the loss the per-centage of car
bon was calculated.

    Whilst washing out the soluble salts, it was observed that
the filtered solution was of a greenish colour; and upon boil
ing it a green-coloured substance was deposited, after which
the supernatant liquor became perfectly colourless.                            Upon
examining this precipitate, it was found to consist principally
of silica and alumina with a little lime. From this it was
concluded to be artificial ultramarine, which is frequently
found in the crevices of the ball <U+017F>urnaces, and which, when
dissolved in caustic soda, yields a green-coloured solution,
precisely the same as that mentioned above.

Had any undecomposed coal existed in the         waste, it would
have contained    hydrogen, and water would   consequently  have
been formed, the oxygen being derived from the chromic acid
of the chromate of lead.
   As might be expected, I found upon trying samples taken
from different furnaces, that the constituents were subject to
great variations.   Thus the lime varied from 27 per cent. to
34 per cent. ; the soda from 22 per cent. to 26.5 per cent.; the
sulphur from 10 per cent. to 16 per cent. But they always
stood in a certain fixed relation to one another; for when the
quantity of lime was large the amount of sulphur was propor
tionally increased, and the per-centage of soda consequently
diminished.    The following table will suffice to show this:—

   I inserthere two analyses of soda balls; the one from Cassel
by Unger, the other from Newcastle by Richardson.         They
both get hydrate of soda and carbonate of lime, and are, I
think, wrong in both of these, although the other parts of the
analysis are probably quite correct.
   The manufacture in Cassel and Newcastle is carried on
almost exactly in the same way as here.

   This salt is then introduced into a reverberatory or car
bonating furnace, where it is strongly heated. In this process
the sulphuret of sodium is converted into sulphate of soda,
and part of the hydrate of soda into carbonate. The salt
when removed from the furnace is ready for the market.       In
Newcastle and some other places it is dissolved and carbo
nated again, and when thus manufactured it contains less caustic
soda.
   Soda-ash thus prepared contains from 48 to 53 per cent. of
available alkali, that                 is,

the solution attains a specific gravity of 1:250 (50° Twaddell);
it is then run into a cistern, where it is mixed with sufficient
cold water to reduce the specific gravity to 1-21 (42° Twad
dell).    This occasions the deposition of a quantity of earthy
matter.     A little bleaching-powder is then added to the liquid,
which causes another deposition.      After this has been allowed
to settle, the solution is carefully decanted into another pan,
and evaporated till it attains a specific gravity of 1:27 (54° T.).
From this it is run into another cistern, from which it passes
into the crystallizing pans. The average time taken in cry
stallization is eight days; but it of course varies very much
with the season of the year and the state of the atmosphere.
It is greatly assisted by placing a few bars of wood, two or
three inches broad, on the top of the liquor.
    The crystallized carbonate of soda thus obtained yielded on
analysis,

 III.    On a new Imaginary in Algebra. By JAMrs Cockle,
      Esq., M.A., of Trinity College, Cambridge, and Barrister
      at-Law of the Middle Temple+.
           LGEBRA   may be regarded under the triple aspect pre
         sented by the words Identity, Equivalence, and Impossi
  bility t, but the latter view will fall more particularly within
  the scope of the present observations. The ordinary algebra,
  it is true, takes cognizance, not only of negative and unreal
  quantities, but sometimes of questions involving impossibility.
  This impossibility is indicated either by contradictory arith
 metical results or, occasionally, by the symbol infinity f. But,
 neither in the one case nor the other, does the indication of
 impossibility furnish us with the elements of a calculus.                                                                Un
 real results, on the contrary, although not subjects of concep
 tion, like number, nor directly interpretable, like negative
 quantities, are yet not only indirectly interpretable, but also
 important instruments of investigation.      Why is this? My
 answer           is,
                because  impossibility has never yet been symbol
 ized. And       would add that, before this

38            Mr.       J. Cockle          on a new Imaginary                       in Algebra.
hesitate in saying, either that impossibility is incapable of being
rendered subservient to the purposes of algebra, or even that
it is absolutely uninterpretable.        A symbol for impossibility
is not only   desirable,  but  actually necessary,  provided that we
wish to   classify with  accuracy   the various  subjects of algebraic
research, and to distinguish those which are unreal from those
which are impossible.       We might adopt an arbitrary symbol
to denote   impossibility;    but a deduced symbol is preferable,
for it gives  to our  investigations  the character of true develop
ments of ordinary algebra.          Such a deduced symbol I have
obtained by means of a surd equation *. The next step                                                               is,

origin and nature being duly considered. As we might ex
pect,    priori, anomalous results offer themselves the course

of our  progress    with these inquiries; such results require                                                            at

but this equation cannot be sustained; for, if we deduce from
º,
it the value off, and substitute that value in (1.), we arrive at
                                   O'= 1 +        W. 1    — W — iX,
in place of which we may write
                      O'= 1 + 2 + i3;
this last equation gives 3=0, whence we infer that X=0;
               a being real, and the positive square root being
taken, we arrive at
       O'= 1 +2= unity together with a positive number;
which cannot be. Hence                            j
                                is not of the form W 4-i X, and
yet it is different from zero, as will be seen on substituting
                j
zero for in (1.).     In short,                       j
                                    is a quantity sui generis—an
impossible quantity—a    quantity the very conception of the
existence of which involves the equation (3.). And, of this last
mentioned equation, it may be added, that it is to be regarded
as one of the principal symbolic decompositions which the
                      j
theory of involves, and is not to be confounded with the ap
parently similar equation
                                    0 x    (2–0)= W 4-iX.
   Thus there are impossibilities not capable of being expressed
either by zero, or by quantities of the form W 4-
as are the values which may be given to W and X.

  Let    be the amplitude, p the colatitude,
          G                                       the longitude,
and a the modulus of a tessarine (t). To these quantities (which
are identical with the corresponding ones in the quaternion
theory, and which may, without confusion, be adopted from
that theory) must be added another, which       propose to call          I
the submodulus, and to denote by v.                              The submodulus is de
fined by the equation
                         w”–wy + rz,
and the submodulus                     of the product (t") of two tessarine <U+017F>ac
tors (t and        t)   is determined by the relation
                                       w"?= (wV)*-i- (u'v)*,
and the modulus                  of that product by
                                  p.” =(up')”—(2v))”.
  We      have, further,

                         ww"+wa"+yy"+sz"=ww.” + 2y/*.
  The equation for the submodulus may also be expressed                                           as
follows:—
        y”=p.” sin           6  cos p +sin à sin \, cos
                                 sin   p    (cos   3                                   ?).

                        this last equation, and    the preceding             of
ones, I hope    discuss to                by
                             another occasion.   And there                                     is a
surface—that defined       the equation     on

(where         is  supposed constant), -which appears                             to   merit      at

      a solar spot from August to November (Phil. Mag. Dec.

 In OW.
    The second view I had of the spot of this month was on the
 13th, when it was within little more than four days of             dis                               its

     From what has been observed,            am inclined       conclude
                                                                I                           to

        EFORE entering on       the main subject of this communi
        cation, I will make a   few remarks with reference to Pro
fessor Challis's last paper in this Magazine. (Vol.xxxiii, p. 462.)
    Ihave no intention of rendering my reasoning liable to the
epithet “illogical,” by attempting to explain away admitted
contradictions.      It was my endeavour in a former communi
cation, and will be my endeavour in this, to show that the
contradictions in question have no real existence.              Since it
would seem from Professor Challis's words, near the bottom
of page 463, that he does not perceive that any step of the
mathematical reasoning by which the contradiction in the
case of plane waves was arrived at has been called in question,
I  beg to state that                 I
                          do not admit the validity of any mathe
matical results obtained by a process which is equivalent to
integrating over an infinite ordinate, without inquiring whether
the passage be legitimate or not. Such a proceeding would
lead to contradictions in other subjects as well as in hydrody
namics; for example, in central forces. It was not until after
I  had pointed out, at page 352, what             conceived to be the   I
flaw in Professor Challis's reasoning, that I entered on the

considerable distance without important alteration, even if the
waves were plane; although sooner or later a wave of this
kind would be converted into what Professor Challis calls a
breaker, but which I think is more nearly analogous to a bore.
An integral of the exact equation which applies to spherical
waves has never been obtained; but it is evident that the                                                      di

of a bore. In fact, if we suppose the velocity v represented, as

 stated in detail (vol.  xxxiii. p. 463).
   The whole force of the reasoning rests on the tacit suppo
sition that when a wave is propagated from the centre out
wards, any arbitrary portion of the wave, bounded by spherical
surfaces concentric with the bounding surfaces of the wave,
may be isolated, the rest of the wave being replaced by qui
escent fluid; and that being soisolated, it will continue to be pro
pagated outwards as before,                              all
                                      the fluid except the successive
portions which form the wave                                       its
                                           successive positions being
                                                          in

     Now the function f(z) is merely defined as an integral of

vanish when z=b, and therefore when z has any smaller value.

     The velocities expressed by (5.) and (6.) are evidently such
as could take place in an incompressible fluid.  Now Professor
Challis's reasoning requires that the fluid be at rest beyond
the limits of the wave of condensation, since otherwise the
conclusion cannot be drawn that the matter increases with the
time.   Consequently we must have D=0, A=0; but if A = 0
the reasoning at p. 463 evidently falls to the ground.
   2. We may if we please consider an outward travelling
wave which arose from a disturbance originally confined to a
sphere of radius s. At p. 463 Professor Challis has referred
to Poisson's expressions relating to this case. It should be
observed that Poisson's expressions at page 706 of the Traité
de Mécanique (second edition) do not apply to the whole wave
from       r-at-s
                to r= at +s, but only to the portion from
r=at—s to r= at ; the expressions which apply to the re
mainder are those given near the bottom of page 705. We
may of course represent the condensations by a single function
 1     f

                        x(–2) = f'(x),             x(x)= F(z),

 Professor Challis has argued, that the mean condensation

inversely as the square of the distance; but these conclusions
do not in the slightest degree militate against each other.
     Ifwe suppose b to increase indefinitely, the condensation or
 rarefaction in the wave which travels towards the centre will
 be a small quantity, of the order b-', compared with that in
 the shell.   In the limiting case, in which      co, the conden     b-
 sation or rarefaction in the backward travelling wave vanishes.
If  in the equations of paragraph 3 we write b--a for r, ba (a)
 for f'(r), and then suppose b to become infinite, we shall get
 as = º(a), v=a. (a).   Consequently a plane wave in which the
 relation         v-
               as is satisfied will be propagated in the positive
direction only, no matter whether<U+017F> a (r)dir taken from the
beginning to the end of the wave be or be not equal to zero;
and therefore any arbitrary portion of such a wave may be
conceived to be isolated, and being isolated, will continue to
travel in the positive direction only, without sending back any
wave which will be propagated in the negative direction. This
result follows at once from the equations which apply directly
to plane waves; I mean, of course, the approximate equations
 obtained by neglecting the squares of small quantities. It may
 F.
 be observed, however, that it appears from what has been
          that it is a property of every plane wave which is the
  imit of a spherical wave, to have                           its

    In order to simplify as much as possible the analysis,
 instead of an expanding envelope, suppose that we have a
 sphere, of a constant radius b, at the surface of which fluid is
  supplied in such a manner as to produce a constant velocity V
 from the centre outwards, the supply lasting from the time 0
  to the time t, and then ceasing. This problem is evidently
 just as good as the former for the purpose intended, and it
  has the advantage of leading to a result which may be more
 easily worked out. On account of the length to which the
 present article has already run, I am unwilling to go into the
 detail of the solution; I will merely indicate the process, and
 state the nature of the result.
     Since we have no reason to suspect the existence of a
 function of the form F (r-H at) in the value of p which belongs
 to the present case, we need not burden our equations with
 this function, but we may assume as the expression for t

                have done so partly because the subject has been
taken up by the Astronomer Royal, partly because I have not
leisure for the discussion at present, partly because the points
which would have to be noticed, and which would be likely
to arise in the course of the discussion, are so numerous, that
I  think it hardly fair to take up the pages of a Magazine like
 the present with the controversy.    I cannot however conclude
without recording my protest, first against equation (8.)
 (vol. xxxii. p. 282), and secondly against equations (B.) and
 (C.) (vol. xxxiii. pp. 99 and 100), by which an attempt is made
 to satisfy equation (A.).

    Two British observatories only    are, properly speaking, public,-
those of Greenwich and      Edinburgh.     The Observatory of Oxford
was built and is  supported  by a  bequest   under Dr. Radcliffe's will :
it is under the control of private trustees. The Cambridge Obser
vatory was erected principally by private subscription, and is sup
ported in part by the funds of a professorship founded by Dr. Plume,
but mainly out of the University chest. The Radcliffe observer
makes an annual report to his trustees; and Visitors appointed by
the Cambridge Senate draw up yearly a statement to be laid before
that body. Since the appointment of Mr. Airy to the Royal Obser

 of having four parallel levels upon the instrument, which are always
 read, enabled me       compare the proportion

longest levels the construction with which I had become familiar in
Germany and Russia, in which the glass tube of the level is supported
in Ys: since that time the levels have been fairly accordant. Another
contrivance extensively applied to German levels, namely the cover
ing by glass shades, has also been applied here. A difficulty which
can be surmounted only by constant care has sometimes presented
itself, namely, that when the dome is opened very shortly before
observation, the changes of readings of the upper and lower levels do
not exactly correspond. Lastly, when the best values of instru
mental errors of every kind are applied, the accuracy of every part
of observation, of calculation and application of instrumental errors,
and of tabular calculation, is checked by the determinations of the
zero of azimuth.      These determinations are sufficiently steady in any
 one evening, or perhaps in groups of several evenings; but they are
 not steady from time to time, the variation amounting to three or four
 seconds of arc. Whether this arises from a twist of the brick pier,
 or from a twist of the piers of the transit instrument (the times being
 obtained from the transit-clock), or from a change in the observer's
 personal equation, I cannot tell. The substitution of improved me
 ridional instruments for those now in use will enable me to remove
 one of these conjectural causes.
    “I  have spoken hitherto solely with respect to the azimuthal ob
 servations, in which alone, from the first, I anticipated any difficulty.
The zenith distance observations have never given the smallest
trouble.
    “The accuracy of the results, as estimated by the observation of
 stars, is somewhat less than that of the mural circle, perhaps nearly
 in the degree which might be expected in circles whose diameter is
 half that of the mural circle.
    “For observations with the altitude and azimuth instrument, the
 following rule is laid down. The moon is to be observed if visible,
 and the observer is bound to watch if necessary while the moon is
 above the horizon, and the sun is not more than an hour above the
horizon.     One azimuth and one altitude are to be observed, and if
possible, two azimuths and two altitudes in reversed positions of the
instrument: and if the night is fine, a low star and a high star are
to be observed in azimuth, both in reversed positions of the            in
 strument, and one star in altitude, in reversed positions.       Thus a
complete set includes ten observations.        These rules have been fol.
 lowed carefully during the thirteen lunations intervening between
 1847, May 15, and 1848, May 30; and I am now able to give a
 comparison of the number of days of observation of the moon with
the altitude and azimuth instrument and with the meridional instru
ments.     With the altitude and azimuth instrument no days are         in
cluded except both altitudes and azimuths are observed ; and with
the meridional instruments, no days except both right ascensions and
polar distances are observed.”
    The number of days during the last year in which the moon has
been observed at Greenwich are—
                With   the altitude and azimuth circle =203

  This statement gives only           an imperfect idea of the value of the
instrument.      When          the moon passes from one to four hours before
or after the sun, there are thirty-four observations with the altitude
and azimuth, and not one with the transit and circle”. It is not
necessary to point out the immense utility of these results in the
lunar theory, or to geography and navigation, which depend on lunar
observations for their fundamental determinations f. The results of
the observations, as reduced to the state of apparent errors of tables
in R.A. and N.P.D., appear very good; perhaps a little, and but a
little, inferior to those of the meridional instruments.
    Throughout the year 1847, the new form of star-reduction pro
 posed by Mr. Airy as a substitute for Bessel's (see M. Notices,
 vol. vii. p. 189) has been used, and it has been found convenient.

ant comparisons depend.
   The Astronomer Royal has communicated, and doubtless will con
tinue to communicate, the mean right ascensions of the stars em
ployed at Greenwich, so that the Edinburgh places will harmonize
with those of Greenwich; or, as Professor Smyth remarks, “it will
not work against but co-operate with Greenwich.”
   There seems reason to complain of the smoke of the city, but pro
bably this will not very materially injure the great mass of obser
vations.   The transit has a noble object-glass 6% inches aperture,
and the Professor proposes to use the circle with illuminated wires on
a dark field.
   The instability of the Edinburgh transit was suspected by Profes
sor Henderson to arise from the effect of temperature on the founda
tion. Professor Smyth has traced it to a much simpler cause, a de
fective original construction of the Ys.   He thus describes the con
struction of the new Ys:—
   “They are large slabs of cast-iron, covering the whole area of
the top of the pier, and weighing several hundredweight;     there are
no adjusting-screws, but the sides of the angles in which the pivots
rest have been filed away, until the instrument is made to move as
nearly in the plane of the meridian as could, perhaps, have been
managed with screws.       One good result has been certainly proved
to have  followed, viz. that the reversing of the instrument to obtain
the error of collimation does not now sensibly throw it out in azi
muth, which Professor Henderson used to complain of with the old
Ys. Touching the fears that the new Ys might split the stone piers,
and the hopes that they might correct the temperature fluctuations,
there has not been sufficient time yet to settle that question through
the medium of the large transit ; it may, however, be considered to
be pretty well set at rest by the experiments on the 30-inch transit.
This was mounted on a similar huge block of cast-iron screwed and
                     as its
cemented down to        pier;       this   onhas now been sticking for

scope and other matters inseparable from an inferior instrument.
Hence they may be considered to be quite insignificant: taking them,
however, as they are, and comparing them with the azimuth errors
of the large transit in the corresponding period of the years 1841–42,
the fluctuations of the large instrument turn out to be five times as
great as those of the small one; a convincing proof that the cause of
the changes hitherto remarked is not in the ‘hill on which the ob
servatory is built.”   The above list of errors in azimuth may also
convince observers that they may themselves rub down unadjustable
Ys to limits which will be abundantly within easy calculation (and
with transits, too, without micrometer wires).
   “The Ys of the large transit having been erected, every screw
about the instrument was tried, to make sure that it was doing its
duty: a number of the smaller ones (which seemed to be made of
brass wire—drawn brass, not cast brass) were found quite rotten ;
these were replaced, and a good many new ones introduced about
the sliding tubes at the eye end; handles for moving the instru
ment, and acting only in the plane of the meridian, were added; and
then, as the line of soldering of the telescope was beginning to
show symptoms of oxidation, the instrument was painted.        A nadir
pier and mercury-trough have been established, and a collimating
eye-piece of peculiar construction, which for perfect vision seems to
leave little to be desired, and reveals almost every affection of the
instrument.    On account of some of its revelations, the fixed wires
have been removed, and five in their place mounted on the micro
meter-frame.     I propose to examine the errors of collimation and
level every night, before and after the observations, as shall be found
necessary, and am now engaged in trying to cure the reversing
carriage of a trick it has got of throwing the instrument to the west
during reversal. Collimating lenses, of the full aperture of the
object-glass, for marks on the boundary wall, are also being put up,
as the old semi-collimating semi-meridian marks are now seldom
seen, on account of the increased smoke of the city; and when they
are, the 6-5-inch aperture of the transit must be reduced to 2 inches,
and the eye-piece pulled out so far as to make the wires very indi
stinct and unsteady.”

   The Radcliffe observer has lately published his seventh annual
volume.    This consists, like the preceding volumes, chiefly of ob
servations of circumpolar stars contained in Groombridge's Ca
talogue.
   It is not necessary to dwell upon the merits of Groombridge's
Catalogue, one of the most laborious tasks ever undertaken by an
amateur, as well as one of the most useful.       His transit circle,
though perhaps rather weak as a right ascension instrument, was at
the time of  itsconstruction, and for many years after, the most per
fect instrument    inexistence for determinations   innorth polar di
stance.    On this account, and considering that the time elapsed

70                              Iloyal Astronomical Society.
 since Groombridge made his observations is sufficient to detect and
 exhibit proper motions, Mr. Johnson undertook to re-observe the
 Catalogue with great care, and has now nearly completed the task.
    The north polar distances have almost                                   all

a  large portion       the right ascensions; there are, however, several
                           of
 gaps, occasioned by the necessity                observing certain circumpolar

 stars for meridian error, and fundamental stars for clock error. The
increased number of well-determined stars will now allow the ob
 server more liberty      this respect, and the blanks are rapidly filling up.

                                                     moon, Jupiter,
the sun (of which there is a very extensive series),
 Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, with a good series of Astraea, Flora,
 and Iris. About 300 stars have been also observed.
    The equatoreal observations are for the most part of the minor
 planets and comets, which could not be seen on the meridian. These
 are Neptune, Astraea, Hebe, Iris, Flora, and the

    Professor Challis finds himself so much oppressed with unreduced
and unpublished observations, that he has discontinued observations
of the sun, moon, and the older planets since the beginning of this
yearf. The recently-discovered planets are observed on the meri

   The meridional observations of 1847 are completely reduced. The
equatoreal observations are less forward.
   The volume for 1843 is nearly ready for publication.  It does not
contain the equatoreal observations, which are reserved for separate
publication. Two appendices are added; one containing so many
of the observations made in search of the planet Neptune as are re
quired to substantiate the statements given in the special report of
Dec. 12, 1846; and the other a description of the Northumberland
telescope and dome, drawn up by the Astronomer Royal.

   A very fine equatoreal has recently been erected at the Liverpool
observatory. The general form of the instrument has been mentioned
in former Notices; and it promises, so far as we have heard, to be
the most accurate and most convenient instrument of its size now
existing.   The object-glass is by Merz of Munich, of eight inches
aperture; and as it has been approved of by Messrs. Dawes and
Lassell, most capable and somewhat fastidious judges, there can be
no doubt of          its
                  superior excellence.                     In

      Lieut.-Col. SABINE,
   I have to request of you, when transmitting to M. Regnault this
 Rumford Medal, to state to him the importance which the Royal
 Society attaches to his researches, determining with a degree of
 accuracy hitherto unobtained, the laws which govern the connexion
 between the temperature and elasticity of saturated steam, and the
 quantity of heat absorbed by a given weight of water under different
 densities and pressures.
    The laws which govern the expansion of atmospheric air, under
 different pressures, and the expansion and densities of different gases
 and mercury, and the measurement of temperatures by these means,
 form in a series of memoirs altogether the most important investi
gations hitherto made on this subject.
    Had the philosophical and philanthropical         founder of this
 Medal been now      living, I am sure that he would have cordially
approved of the award of it to inquiries connected with the most
important power that Providence has, as yet, given to man for
lightening and assisting his industry, and for giving him speed for
crossing sea and land, compared with which, the fabled wings of
Daedalus would have been comparatively useless.         My only regret
on the present occasion      is,
                              that M. Regnault     not here himself
                                                            is                    to

   Dec.    7-"  Experimental Researches in Electricity.” By Michael
Faraday, Esq., F.R.S.     Twenty-second Series. § 28. On the Cry
stalline Polarity of Bismuth and other bodies, and on its relation to
the magnetic form of force.
   The author states that in preparing small cylinders of bismuth by
casting them in glass tubes, he had often been embarrassed by the
anomalous magnetic results which they gave, and that having de
termined to investigate the matter closely, it ended in a reference of
the effects to the crystalline condition of the bismuth, which may be
thus briefly stated. If bismuth be crystallized in the ordinary way,
and then a crystal, or a group of symmetric crystals, be selected and
suspended in the magnetic field between horizontal poles, it im
mediately either points in a given direction, or vibrates about a given
position, as a small magnetic needle would do, and if disturbed from
this position it returns to             On resuspending the crystal
                                              it.                                 that                        so
the horizontal line which           transverse
                                             is       the magnetic axis shall be

come the vertical line, the crystal then points with its maximum
degree     offorce.       If     again resuspended
                                  it    be                                      so
                                                              that the line parallel
to  the magnetic axis          rendered vertical, the crystal loses all direc

or as a tangent, to the magnetic curve or line of magnetic force, passing
through the place where the crystal is situated, so the crystal changes
its position with any change of direction in these lines.
   A common horse-shoe magnet exhibits these phenomena very well:
the author worked much with one lifting 30lbs. by the keeper; but
one that can raise a pound or two only, is sufficient for many of the
actions. When using the electro-magnet, the advantage of employ
ing poles with large plane opposed faces is mentioned as being con
siderable, for then diamagnetic phenomena are almost or entirely
avoided and the peculiar magnecrystallic relations then appear.
   The peculiar force exerted in these phenomena is not either at
tractive or repulsive, but has for its distinctive character the ten
dency to place the crystal in a definite position or direction.      The
author further distinguishes it from that described by M. Plücker in
his interesting memoir upon the repulsion of the optic axes of cry
stals by the poles of a magnet", in that, that is an equatorial force,
whereas this is an axial force.
   Crystals of antimony were then submitted to a similar magnetic
examination, and with the same results.    But there were also certain
other effects produced  of arrest and  revulsion, the same in kind as
those described in a former series of the ‘Experimental Researches’
(par. 2309, &c.); these are wrought out and eliminated, and the re
sults described.
    Arsenic also proved to be a body capable of pointing in the mag
 netic field, like bismuth and antimony.
    The paper describing the foregoing results is dated 23rd of Sep
tember, 1848. In a later paper of the date of 20th October, 1848,
the author continues his researches. Native crystals of iridium and
 osmium, and also crystallized titanium and tellurium, appeared to be
magnecrystallic: crystals of zinc, copper, tin, lead, gold, gave no
 signs of this condition. Crystals of sulphate of iron are very strongly
affected by the magnet according to this new condition, and the
magnecrystallic axis is perpendicular to two of the planes of the
rhomboidal prism; so that when a long crystal is employed, it will
not, as a mass, point between the poles, but across the line joining
them.      On the other hand, the sulphate of nickel has             magne     its
crystallic axis parallel,       nearly so,

lance, or as a pendulum thirty feet in length; but whatever the
position of the magnecrystallic axis, the amount of repulsion was
the same.
    In other experiments a vertical axis was constructed of cocoon
 silk, and the body to be examined was attached at right angles to it
 as radius; a prismatic crystal of sulphate of iron, for instance, whose
length was four times its breadth, was fixed on the axis with its
length as radius and its magnecrystallic axis horizontal, and there
fore as tangent; then, when this crystal was at rest under the torsion
 force of the silken axis, an electro-magnetic pole was so placed,
that the axial line of magnetic force should be, when exerted, ob
lique to both the length and the magnecrystallic axis of the crystal;
and the consequence was, that, when the electric current circulated
 round the magnet, the crystal actually receded from the magnet
under the influence of the force, which tended to place the magne
 crystallic axis and the magnetic axis parallel.           Employing a crystal
 or plate of bismuth, that body could be made to approach the mag
netic pole under the influence of the magnecrystallic force; and this
force is so strong as to counteract either the tendency of the magnetic
body to approach or of the diamagnetic body to retreat, when it is
 exerted in the contrary direction.         Hence the author concludes that
it is neither attraction nor repulsion which causes the set or deter
 mines the final position of a magnecrystallic body.
     He next considers it as a force dependent upon the crystalline con
 dition of the body, and therefore associated with the original mole
 cular forces of the matter. He shows experimentally, that, as the
 magnet can move a crystal, so also a crystal can move a magnet.
 Also, that heat takes away this power just before the crystal fuses,
 and that cooling restores it in                 its
                                           original direction.    He next con
 siders whether the effects are due              force altogether original and

 partly induced by the magnetic and electric forces; and             concludes,       he
 that the force manifested            the magnetic field, which appears

   Mr. Faraday, in the experiments with his great electro
magnet, met with a class of bodies which are repelled by the
two poles of the magnet. One or two examples of this repul
sion had been known for some time; but the researches of
the illustrious Englishman has rendered this fact general, and
of such importance as to become the object of attention of                                       all
philosophers.      Brugmanns had already discovered          1778                      in
that bismuth       repelled
                     is       the two      by
                                       poles     magnet.     Bec   of   a
querel, sen., again met with this repulsion both         bismuth                 in
and   inantimony.      Mr. Faraday found that his great electro
magnet produced this repulsion        almost    the bodies
                                                      in      did     all                   it
not attract.    He discovered     the same time that long pieces
                                                at
thus repelled, assume, under the influence          the electro             of
magnet,      position perpendicular
              a                         that which         to

height, applied to the discovery of diamagnetism the observa
tion, overlooked by other philosophers, that the two poles of
the magnet employed together do not produce on these bodies
a repulsion equal to the sum of the repulsions produced by
each of them, but equal to their difference; so that their joint
effect is null when their forces are equal.      At the same time
he made some experiments which seemed to indicate that the
pole which repulsed the diamagnetic body produced in the
parts adjacent to it a magnetic force similar to           own, but                                                its

change of position.         But we find some attractive diamagnetic
bodies,     such as a    piece     of iridium in my possession, wood
charcoal and coke, which retain the poles they have acquired
by the influence much longer, of which it is easily to be con
vinced by experiments on the mariner's compass. The ex
perimental investigation of the phaenomena exhibited by these
bodies is complicated by this duration of the polarity; but
they will probably lead us to discover the connexion which
exists between magnetism and diamagnetism.
    When a needle constructed of an attractive diamagnetic
substance is suspended above the upper or beneath the lower
edge of a polar piece, it assumes a position parallel to this
edge.      In this parallel position, which might either be per
pendicular to the magnetic axis of the polar piece, or parallel
to   it,   orhave quite another position than the figure                    the                 of

apart, in such a manner that the extremities of this needle
were not more than 1 millim. distant from the polar faces,
was made to oscillate each time during 30 seconds.          At an
equal distance from the upper and lower edges it made only
4.5 oscillations in the 30 seconds, but level with the polar faces
it made nineteen.        -

not assume the equatorial position when it is suspended above

state his reasons for objecting to equations    (8.), (B.) and (C.).
The   subject, being  entirely  new, offers a fair field for discus
sion; and I am quite prepared to find that I have been mis
taken on some points.       In particular, have recently disco                   I
vered that the    equations   just named are not generally true
beyond the first order of approximation, as shall presently                              I
show.    From the nature of the problem the processes applied
to it must be in a great measure tentative, and can only be
tested by the results.    The equation (A.), for instance (Phil.
Mag., vol. xxxiii. p. 99), as far as I know, is the first example
of an application of analysis to a question in physics, which
presents for solution a partial differential equation containing
two principal variables and two independent sets of variables
mixed up with each other.         I have proceeded on the prin
ciple that if particular and consistent values of one set of va
riables be substituted in the equation, the resulting equation
will be true for general, if not the most general, values of the
other set.    But the application of this principle is restricted
by any limitation to which the supposition which conducted
to the equation (A.) is subject, viz. the supposition by which
uda + way--wdz was made an exact differential.      Now it is
well known that for small vibrations, the equations
                              du        du        du         dw            do            dw

 that cases of   plane-waves    and    spherical  waves cannot exist,
 but that they cannot exist spontaneously.           Having been led
 deductively from the general equations to those which define
 ray-vibrations, without meeting with any similar contradiction,

Mr.       J. H.           Alexander on the Tension of Vapour of Water,                                       99
remained to complete this memoir, in showing the probable
errors of the formula as compared with the principal experi
ments, and with the probable errors affecting too those differ
ent series of experiments themselves. Such a discussion is
the object of the present paper.
   It was already said in the preceding part, that the most
proper mode of expressing these errors is by the linear scale
of temperature; which both in theory is the most important,
and in practice is the most accessible and usual.     In this last
aspect, it is on this scale, too, where errors of observation are
the most easy to be made, and likely to occur. With this
view the formula need be repeated here only in          converse                             its
form (i.e. for ascertaining temperatures from given pressures),
as under:—

                             tº   Fahr.      =  317-18         VF-105°, 13;
p'   being         in     atmospheres             at   32°.
   As this will have           frequently applied for interpolation

practice, and for whose benefit the whole of the present dis
cussion is mainly intended.
  . It is obvious, then, in the first place, that the idea of free
dom from error is associated with symmetry in the results.
 Such symmetry will always be observable in quantities that
progress (as natural quantities may be assumed to do) accord
ing to some constant law; and as, in our ignorance of what the
true law is in this case, all that we can deal with is relative
symmetry, it is of no importance what law or formula we take
as the other term of comparison, provided there be no material
difference between the origin and termination of the two.

follow any uniform or symmetrical progression; and without

  at 32° F., a temperature especially disengaged from instru
mental errors, are, as has been already said, very numerous,
and allow of being compared among themselves. Of the forty
 seven observations whose arithmetical mean pressure is given
in the table, the
                          in.                                                           o

    and the difference 0:00768           corresponding      difference     of temp.     0.95
 This difference shows a mean error in temperature, unac
counted for, of 0°.425 F.; and a limiting error in pressure
rather more than half the difference between the formula and
 the mean       of all the observations.
     In the various series of M. Regnault, the temperature is
 given sometimes by one thermometer only, and sometimes by
                             ----
 two, and even four.             Of these latter classes, I have taken out
 of each series the observation where the difference of reading
 of the several thermometers is the greatest, to serve for another
 comparison, as follows:–

 This difference is that of the extremes; and as the mean error
 of any number of observations is as likely to be plus as minus,
 it is equivalent in this example to an absolute error of 0°-33 F.
     This error manifests itself in a series where the thermometric
 variations are the greatest.            I shall now present another where
 these same        differences,    although       not perhaps the lowest of all,
 are yet very much less than in the last. At least, this series
 (which in fact forms part of the comparative table in the pre
 ceding memoir) was selected without any reference to the
 present investigation, and with a view to the introduction of
 the greatest number of accordant observations, and may be

whereby to compare the merits of divers proposed formulae as
well as his own.        It is true this group contains, among others,
one of the very experiments which I have in the preceding
memoir noted as faulty, and as being differently recorded in
the two tables; but          I  have not allowed myself to exclude it
here   any   more than before.                 Also for his comparison, M.
Dulong has taken the reading of only the maximum thermo
meter, which represented the actual temperature of the water
in the boiler. For the present purpose, however, as in the
case of M. Regnault's experiments, it is necessary to take the
other thermometer-reading also and register the variation of
the extremes, as under.                I have entered the pressures here in
English inches, since they have already been reduced for the
comparative table; but to save unnecessary calculations, I re
tain the temperatures in Centigrade degrees.

 a deviation betweenthe formula and the experiment but little
 more than the admitted error of the thermometric readings.
 The mean error of observation from this last source was found
just now to be + 0°28 F., and the mean error of the formula
then may be either 0°.08 or 0.64 of Fahrenheit.             These
 quantities equally satisfy the equation, and the probabilities in
favour of each are even.
     It   is observable that errors in this series come out with a
different sign from those of M. Regnault, though the errors
of observation in the two experimental series are nearly iden
tical, as might be expected in advance from the great skill and
probably equal tact of the two observers.    Such a difference
of sign  is favourable to the character of the formula, which
will be seen by combining the two results, as under:—
                                                                       Error of formula.

  Mean error by both    ................... -- - - - - - -    +0.14                  +0.11
   The nearness of these limits, and the smallness of the num
ber inclosed by them, warrant, I think, a sole and entire reli
ance upon the formula in the present state of experimental
knowledge on the subject.    I do not introduce into combina
tion any  of the other and earlier series of observations; be
cause, from the way in which they have been reported by their
respective authors, they do not admit the application of the
same methods of comparison ; and because it may justly be
supposed that the apparatus, intellectual and mechanical, re
sorted to in 1829 and since, is paramount in accuracy to what
had been at disposal in preceding researches.
   I shall only, therefore, in further illustration of the present
                          byits
formula, compare         results with those       expressions that     of
have been proposed        other mathematicians; only extending,
in point       of
            fact, for this purpose,    similar comparison which

  It  is hardly necessary to repeat that the first of these for
mulae is founded in part upon the very experiments with which
it accords so well, and that the other was not.
   The table of M. Biot goes up as far as 220°C.; but he
supposes that his formula is applicable much further; and in
fact he has given results, in a small supplementary table, as
high as 300° C. or 572°F., at which temperature it makes the
pressure equal to almost exactly eighty-five atmospheres.
The present formula would make, corresponding to this pres
sure, a temperature of 559°-92 F. or 293°3 C., differing from
the other within the correction between a mercurial and an
air-thermometer.
   It is at the other extremity, where we still have opportu
nity of referring to experiment, that the difference between
the two formulae becomes more marked; and where that of
M. Biot, neither in       terms norits progression, can   conits                               be
sidered applicable.    This may     seen    under:—     be              as

    About the same time with M. Biot, other formulae claiming
(like that of M. Roche) a foundation on abstract theoretical
principles were proposed by Mr. Russell, who has also ap
plied their somewhat extensive logarithmic apparatus to the
calculation of a table of pressures for each degree from 32° to
250° F., and then for intervals of one or more atmospheres up
to fifty.         This does not properly come into this discussion,
because the author has found it necessary to employ different
terms above and below the point of boiling water, and in point
of fact to have two formulae; an inconvenience, the same in
kind though not in degree, with what the object of the very
research is to avoid.               Nor do they counterbalance this by a
proportionate accuracy which would warrant their results to
be substituted for those of experiment.                                On the contrary,
starting from their common zero, 212°, they both deviate in
their respective directions from the curve given by observation;
the pressures calculated by them are, at the two extremities,
very much above any experimental ones.                                     Not to trouble
ourselves with the           part     of the scale below the boiling tempe
rature, where the errors are not of so much practical import

   The formulae of M. Regnault, to whose experimental                                        re
searches such resort has been had, are in one respect in the
same category as those of Mr. Russell: they are three; one
adapted to pressures below the melting of ice, the second
   * Mr. Russell, in his comparison, as well as the Franklin Institute in
theirs, give this temperature at 30.8°8; an error which has arisen from
hastily reducing the actual Centigrade temperature of 153°08, as if it were
1532.80.

     N the last Number of the Philosophical Magazine, there is
                           paper, by Professor Graves, On the
          a very interesting
Calculus of  Operations,   in which he has communicated a valu
able theorem in that important department of analysis, which
I  believe has not hitherto appeared in a complete form.
    Professor Graves has been enabled to deduce this theorem
from the previous development of (1 + r.)-"; which, by means
of the differential calculus, he has exhibited in connexion with
the remainder of the series.
   This completed form of the expansion may be readily ob
tained by a process imitative of that employed in my paper
published in the November Number of this Journal, and with
out involving any operation of a more advanced character than
that of common algebraical division.      It is as follows:–

    XIV.     On a Mode      of rendering Substancesincombustible.
        By Robert ANGUs SMITH, Ph.D., Manchester*.
I     HAVE      often been surprised that, considering the number
       of materials which will not burn and the small number
which do burn, we should be compelled to build houses so liable
without constant watchfulness to instantaneous destruction;
that we should go also to sea in vessels made of a most com
bustible substance filled with enormous fires, frequently under
the care of ignorant men. I think, therefore, I may be ex
cused when I endeavour to add to a knowledge of the mode
of rendering substances incombustible, or the theory of the
mode to be sought after, even if the addition which I make be
but a very small one.
   Silicate of potash has been considered good. It is a soluble
glass which was expected to cover the fibre of cloth or wood,
and so protect it from heat. This does act to some extent, pro
bably in the same manner as stones do when put into a fire of
wood or coal; they take heat but give none, and are also bad
conductors.       If silicate of potash remained as a glass, it would
act also   by  keeping    out the air; but this does not seem to be
the case, as it falls after a time to a powder.
    It struck me that the mode of preventing combustion was
not by protecting the wood from the fire merely, as heat must
cause combustible gases to rise from wood, whether there be
incombustible substances mixed with it or not, and these gases
will force their way to the surface where there is no longer any
preventive to burning.         My object then was to find a substance
which would render the wood unfit to burn, and would cause
it to give out gases which would not burn; so that whilst the
wood itself was being preserved, except where in contact with
the fire, the gases would assist in extinguishing the fire.
    I first tried phosphate of magnesia and ammonia, thinking
the ammonia given out would be of use in extinguishing the
fire; but this was of no value, as a piece of calico required to
be made quite stiff with it before it was rendered incombustible.
The calico was prepared by dipping in a solution of phosphate
of magnesia in muriatic acid and then in ammonia. It seemed
to me that the earthy salts are of little use for the purpose
required, and that the amount of solid matter incapable of
evaporation left on the cloth, assists in a very small degree.
    Sulphuric acid, however, seemed to present the most pro
mising characteristics of a substance incapable of burning, and
of acting so strongly on vegetable substances as to make them

           On a Mode of rendering Substances incombustible.                                                             117
incapable of burning.      Sulphuric acid itself is a body perfectly
burnt, or we may say overburnt, having an atom of oxygen
given to it by artificial means, so to speak, which atom is dif
ficult to separate, and therefore not resembling the oxygen of
many highly oxidized bodies.        It requires a high degree of
heat to raise it to vapour; and the vapour formed is sluggish
and heavy, remaining long where formed, and quenching flame
wherever it           destroys the texture
                          is.    It              wood also and other                of
vegetable substances, causing them            give out after      time        to                                   a

but   ifthere    enough   be acid, forming    of mixture which does                a

  If  sulphuric acid then could          introduced into wood just be
at the time that the fire was going        take place, the fire would    to
cease      to
           take place;  and this we can          easily    saturating              do                  by

there are peculiar dangers; but if a person were standing very
near the fire, the ammonia would in part be evaporated, and
the acid remaining would be enough to injure the fabric,
There are however cases, such as curtains, to which this could
not apply, and where it would be valuable.

    I am more desirous of seeing ships built of an incombustible
 material, the means of escape at sea being few, and confined
 to few ; and whilst there is any hope of doing it easily,                                                      I

the first and second cases, a factor actually vanishes; but not
so in the third and fourth.    In these, two real moduli, of dif
ferent kinds and belonging to different factors, becoming equal
to zero, annihilate the two real moduli of the product, and so
cause itself to vanish.
   So again in the case of the trinomial a + s(y) + n(2). It
appears from the equations (3.) that it has two real moduli of
multiplication, a + y, and (c.—y)* +22°. That is to say, if
          (r-Fs(y)       +    n(z))(r'+s(y) + n(z)=a"+s(y") + n(x");
we shall have

and
           ((r—y)* +22°)((r'—y)*-i-23")=(a"—y")*+22".
 The <U+017F>actor a +s(y) + n(z) vanishes if both     real modulivanish,          its
but not otherwise.      And the product "+s(y") n(z") will not   a                    +
vanish unless both its real moduli likewise vanish.       But this
 may happen       different ways.

pable of being readily put, in evidence, because the expression
vanishes for se -- 1.   In other words, as s partakes of the cha
racter of +1, these two factors are of such a nature that either
of them, like zero, assimilates the product into which it enters
to itself.     If
               both enter into the same product, they must make
it like their own product 1–s”(1), which, by the definition of
s, is equal to zero.
    11. The same kind of reasoning admits of a more interest
ing application to the problem of finding the moduli of multi
plication in the triple algebra whose units are 1, s, and n ; or
in that other whose units are l, m, and n.
    As the operation n is defined by the equation
                                        ,     si(l-s(i)
                                                     A/2
it appears that, when   degenerates into +1, n becomes 0; and
                                   s
when s is equal to — 1, n is equal to +          In the former   V-2.
case the equation  (2.) is reduced to
                              (a   +y)(r'+ y)= x"+y".
In    the latter we shall have
 (r—y-E V-2.2)(a'—y-E V-2.2)=r"—y"+                                        V-2.2".
Thus   we obtain the two real moduli of multiplication of the
system whose units are 1, s, and n.
   12. Let us next pass to the consideration of the triple sy
stem, whose three units are l, m, and n, as defined by the equa
tions (4.).
   According as sa + 1, or                    –
                                1, these latter become

or
                        l=0,              m   = W2, n = + W —2.
And, if we introduce these two systems of values successively
into the equation
               (l:       mm
                    m3)(la'--mn"+ng')=l:"--mn"+ng",

we shall derive from               it   the following:

THE

merely confirm what Faraday has found, if they exhibit this
repulsion in a more easy and direct manner.

    The  last column is calculated upon the assumption that r,
i. e. the distance of the pole of the magnet when close to the
case from the central point of action in the ball, is 15.04 mil
limetres for the position of the torsion-rod at 0, and that the
repulsive force acts in an inverse ratio to the third power of
the distance.     The differences do not exceed the possible
error of observation.
   At the distance of 15 millimetres from the surface of the
case, and with the position of the rod at 0 of the scale, scarcely
the surface of the ball is attained, which would show that the
principal action is upon the nearest surface of the ball.
   A second observation gave the following measures of re
pulsion:—                                                                                       Millims.

   Since, however, the corresponding periods of vibration were
not observed, the repulsive force exerted in each instance can
not be calculated from them.       That the effect was found to be
greater on this occasion, is explained by the circumstance of
the position of rest of the rod, with the magnet removed, being
on an average at 0.994 of the scale instead                 the first                     of,   as   in

those situated beneath participating in this motion*... The
observation of our learned countryman is quite naturally ex
plained by attributing to the ascending sap the transport of
the corrosive poison, a transport which, in this case, would
take place in the direction from below upwards.        But how to
account for the apparent transmission of the effects of the
chloroform in the contrary direction, from above downwards?
Might the descending sap more peculiarly have the property
of transmitting the narcotic effects of this singular compoun
from one part of the sensitive plant to the other; or might
there exist in this plant some special organ susceptible of being
affected by certain vegetable poisons in a manner analogous
to the nervous system of animals 2 Notwithstanding the                 in

teresting investigations of Dutrochet and other physiologists,
there still prevails too much obscurity on this subject to ha
zard an opinion. But in any case the fact is singular, and
appears to me to merit the attention of persons accustomed to
engage in questions of this nature.                         ---
                  of the same kind, made on the contractility of
the sensitive plant with rectified aether, have furnished me with
results nearly similar to the preceding; with this difference,
however, that whilst one drop of chloroform placed on the
common petiole of a leaf situated at the extremity of a branch
of a sensitive plant suffices to cause most of the other leaves
situated beneath on the same branch to close, aether in general
produces an effect only on the leaf itself with which it is put
in contact. The next leaves have generally appeared to me
not affected.     Imust however add, that my experiments with
aether  having  been made after the others, and at a time of
year when the sensitiveness of the plant already began to              di
minish, it is possible that the intensity of the effects produced
may have thereby been affected.

  Dec. 11.—On the Formation of the Central Spot of Newton's
Rings beyond the Critical Angle. By G. G. Stokes, M.A., Fellow
of Pembroke College, Cambridge.
   It has long been known that when Newton's rings are formed be
tween the under surface of a prism and the upper surface of a lens,
or of a second prism, so as to allow of increasing the angle of inci
dence at pleasure, the rings disappear when the critical angle is
passed, but the central spot remains.       The existence of the spot
under these circumstances has even been attributed to the disturbance
in the second medium, which, when the angle of incidence exceeds
the critical angle, takes the place of that disturbance which at a
smaller incidence constitutes the refracted light; but the expression
for the intensity has not hitherto been given, so far as the author is
aware.     The object of the author in the present paper is to supply
this  deficiency.
   The author has not adopted any particular dynamical theory, but
has deduced his results from Fresnel's expressions for the intensities
of reflected and refracted polarized light. When the angle of inci
dence becomes greater than the critical angle these expressions be
come imaginary.       When the imaginary expressions are interpreted
in the  way   in which physical considerations show that they must be
interpreted, it becomes easy to obtain the expression for the intensity
of the light, whether reflected or transmitted, in the neighbourhood
of the spot. When the first and third media are of the same nature,
the following expression is obtained for the intensity (I) of the re
flected light, the incident light being polarized in the plane of inci
dence, and       intensity being taken for unity,
                 its

The difference is far more conspicuous in the former case than in the
latter, and in that case consists principally in the greater extent of
the ragged edge.     When the incident light is polarized at an azimuth
of 45°, or thereabouts, and the transmitted light is analysed so as to
extinguish the light transmitted near the point of contact, there is
seen a central dark patch surrounded by a luminous ring.

total refractions for the planet or comet, and thence deduce the dif
ferences of refraction corresponding to the measured differences of
R.A. and N.P.D. It may be questioned whether any approximate
formulae, requiring only the calculation of differences of refraction,
would lead to a less amount of calculation in this kind of observation.
If P be the pole of the heavens, Z the zenith of the observer, S the
place of the object, and ZQ be drawn a perpendicular on PS, the
formula used for the total corrections for refraction in R.A. and

     Correction for refraction in N.P.D.            = A.   tan   (PS–PQ)
     Correction for refraction in R.A.            = A.              cosec PS. sec        (PS–PQ).
The factor A is given by the tables in Bessel's Astronomische Unter
suchungen, vol. i. pp. 198, 199, the argument in the case of the star
being the true zenith distance, which is obtained by the formula
sec ZS = sec QZ sec (PS–PQ).        The argument in the case of the
compared object is the apparent zenith distance, which is deduced
from the same formula, the apparent N.P.D. and hour-angle being
first obtained by applying the corrections for refraction in N.P.D.
and R.A. of the star (with signs changed) to its true N.P.D. and R.A.,
together with the measured differences of N.P.D. and R.A. affected
only by refraction.

observatory at Southampton, adopts a collimating telescope for get
ting rid of his error of collimation. To this latter telescope he has
attached a wire micrometer, which supplies the object to be viewed
by the transit.   He also uses the wire-micrometer to measure the
intervals of his wires.   The results are more readily obtained than
by slow moving stars, and he conceives with at least equal accuracy.
Specimens of the determination of the intervals by both methods are

Rev. W. R. Dawes, at Cranbrook.
   “My attention was directed principally to the appearance of the

   “The ingress was observed with my 8%-foot achromatic, the aper

Nothing remarkable was noticed till Mercury had advanced                       the      on
sun's disc    to  about three-quarters            its own diameter, when the
                                                 of
cusps appeared much rounded off, giving              pear-shaped appearance

finition was best.       A  few seconds before the complete entrance                         of
the   planet,  the sun's  edge    became much more steady, and the cusps
sharper, though still occasionally           little broken towards their points

was    pretty  good,  and  they  formed the finest conceivable line, Mercury
appearing    at  the same time perfectly round.
    “The    impression    upon my mind was, that the distortion                the      of

to the thickness of the speculum, formed an iron mould, and dispensed
altogether with the use of sand in the casting.                 The disc does not
require to be turned, but if cast from a well-made wooden pattern
will be sufficiently true; neither do I think turning the hoop essential,
though it might be well to turn the inside surface and the edges, if
the means of doing so were at hand.
    “As it is necessary that the pouring should be pretty quick, in
order that there may not be time for the base to solidify any portion
of the metal before it is completely covered, I inclined the base a
little, pouring on the lowest side, in order that the fluid might rise
in one compact wave; and when the disc was nearly covered, it was
restored to a truly horizontal position, and the pouring continued,
until the mould was sufficiently filled, namely, to the depth of about
two inches and three quarters. The hoop was about three inches
broad, and having been turned parallel, the mould was in the first
instance placed horizontal, by a spirit-level being placed upon its
edge. The inclination was produced by the application of a lever,
which, when withdrawn, restored the base to                                      its

 the surface into equal squares, and the various manipulations which
 are required to produce a perfect result.          The grinding powder is
 known as rouge, and the best quality may be had from Mr. Fox of
 Saffron Hill.
    “The whole time occupied in obtaining the requisite lustre varies
 from about one hour to three, and it ought to be steadily advancing
 throughout.
    “A good idea may be formed of the quality of the operation as it
 proceeds by watching the motion of the tool.             It should be regular
 and   uniform,   without   any  apparent   labouring   or inequality of speed,
 and the    spontaneous     motion which the tool has upon the pin as a
 centre should be slow and regular.           No firm adhesion is ever to be
 allowed between the tool and speculum : this will take place if a due
 and regular supply of water be not afforded.
    “A second application of powder will rarely be required, and never
 in any quantity, but many applications of water probably will, and
 the more rapidly the polish is advancing the more frequently will
water be required.        It is best applied through a hole in the back of
the   polisher  as near the centre as is convenient, which may perhaps
be at about the distance of one-third of the radius.             But care should
be taken not to give the water in excess.           The speculum must never
be dry, but there must be no superfluous water.                It is very conve
niently applied with a flat camel's-hair brush, half or three-quarters
 of an inch broad; but as much as the brush would take up would
generally be too much for one application.             Towards the end, the
water should be added more sparingly, and if needful more fre
quently, going as near to dryness as may be but never reaching                                                         it.

and it is for this purpose I have undertaken the present series of
charts. . . . The stars included in Weisse's Catalogue from Bessel's
Zones were first laid down for 1825 as points of reference.        All
other stars, to the tenth magnitude inclusive, were then entered by
estimation of their positions with respect to the neighbouring mem
bers of Weisse's Catalogue. . . . The charts for the hours of right
ascension in which the ecliptic falls beyond the declination limits of
the Berlin maps (–15°) are in a state of forwardness, and will be
published as soon as they are completed.      They are regularly com
pared in their present state with the heavens, so that the search for
planets and the formation of the charts are going on at the same
time.   ... I take this opportunity of expressing my warmest thanks
to Mr.    J. R. Hind, for the great care and indefatigable zeal he has
 displayed in the formation of this chart, which, to my knowledge,
he has examined with the heavens from fifty to sixty times; but the
success of his research, as shown by the discovery of two planets,
speaks for itself, and will, I am sure, dispose astronomers to receive
these charts with confidence.”
     Extract of    aLetter from Lieut. Gilliss *, U.S.N.
     “The      computations for the longitude of Washington, from      cor
responding moon-culminations observed by me between 1838–1842,
are nearly completed.   The results for 1839 and 1840 give the fol
lowing corrections of the (hitherto received) longitude:–
                        s
          Limb —5.39 by 182 comparisons.
         1st
       2nd Limb —4:41 by 74 comparisons.
       Mean . . —4:84 by 256 comparisons according to weight.
The European observatories with which the comparisons are made,
are Edinburgh, Oxford, Greenwich, Cambridge, and Hamburg: the
individual results very accordant; those from Cambridge strikingly so.
Comparisons have also been made with the observations of Copen
hagen, Kremsmunster, Cracow, and Wilna, which seem to show
considerable errors in the longitudes assigned to those observatories.”

       ON THE EQUIVALENT OF FLUoRINE.              By M. Lou YEt.

certain weight of the purest natural fluoride of calcium, and also by
artificial fluoride.   As the two series of experiments agreed perfectly,
M.   Louyet   had   presumed   that the results to which they led were
sufficiently correct,      Nevertheless he decided with some reserve;

   In his first memoir on fluorine and the fluorides, M. Louyet, guided
by various considerations, rejected the hypothesis of Ampère, in
which fluorine is ranged with chlorine, bromine and iodine. The
equivalent of chlorine, indicated by the later researches, strengthen
this opinion; for whilst the equivalents of chlorine, bromine and
iodine, are not exactly divisible by the equivalent of hydrogen, that
of fluorine        is,    on
                    the contrary,   multiple     this equivalent, which

        M. Natterer of Vienna has constructed a forcing-pump for the
    liquefaction of gases, by means of which carbonic acid and protoxide
    of nitrogen can readily be obtained in the liquid state. Having
    procured one of these instruments, and employed it more especially
    for the liquefaction of the protoxide of nitrogen,                  soon perceived                I
    the necessity of using a series of indispensable precautions, but
    which, once adopted, have enabled me to effect with promptitude
    and security, as well as oeconomy, the liquefaction of large quantities
    of protoxide of nitrogen.
        As this liquid furnishes a means of producing an excessively low
    temperature, and is very easily operated with,                    will here briefly         I
    point out the observations I have made.                    The first relates to the
    principal piece of the apparatus, that is to say the reservoir.                   In
    my opinion the Viennese manufacturer has not given it sufficient
    strength.      I have had it surrounded with a belt of forged iron,
    capable of resisting 800 atmospheres, and very nicely made by
    M. Bianchi. Moreover, I arranged things so that the reservoir
    being surrounded by ice, the body of the pump was cooled un
    interruptedly by a circulation of water around                      and that even               it,

    trogen.    When metals are dropped into this liquid, they produce a
     noise like that of red-hot iron immersed in water. Quicksilver
    causes the same noise, instantly freezes, and affords a hard brittle
    mass, white like silver, which it perfectly resembles in appearance.
    Potassium floats upon the liquid, and experiences no change; the
    same is the case with charcoal, sulphur, phosphorus and iodine.
    Ignited charcoal floats upon the surface of the liquid, and burns
    with considerable brilliancy, and frequently until the whole is con
    sumed. Ordinary sulphuric acid and concentrated nitric acid freeze
    immediately.     AEther and alcohol mix with the liquid without
    freezing.    Water is instantly converted into ice; but it produces
    such a sudden evaporation of a portion of the liquid, that it causes
    suddenly a kind of explosion, which would be dangerous if merely
    a few grammes of water were poured at once into the liquid.—

                               ON THE U RATES.
       MM. Allan and Bensch have examined several of these salts.
       Neutral Urate of Potash is obtained with greater facility than    has
   been supposed. It is prepared by saturating a cold dilute solution
   of potash, free from carbonate, with uric acid diffused in water, and
   then concentrating the solution by ebullition in a retort.      At a cer
   tain  point  of concentration the salt  separates  in fine  needles;  the
  matter is allowed to remain a few minutes, the liquid is poured off
  and the crystals are washed, first with weak and afterwards with
  stronger alcohol.
       The salt thus obtained is very soluble in water, has a strong caustic
   taste, attracts carbonic acid from the air quickly, and is gradually
  decomposed by boiling in water.
       The crystals are anhydrous, and gave by analysis a composition
  corresponding to C*N*H* O*, KO.
      This salt is soluble in 44 parts of cold and 35 of boiling water.
       Urate of Soda.-The preparation of this salt succeeded by adopting
  a   process  corresponding to the preceding.    One part of it dissolved
  in 77   parts  of cold and 75 parts of boiling water.
      Neutral Urate of Ammonia and Neutral Urate of Magnesia.—
  Neither of these salts could be obtained. Attempts were made, but
  also in vain, to prepare double salts of magnesia and ammonia, potash
  or soda.
      Neutral Urate of Lime—This is readily obtained by adding,
  drop by drop, a neutral solution of urate of potash to a boiling solu
  tion of chloride of calcium, until the precipitate, which at first re
  dissolves, begins to be permanent ; the limpid liquid is then to be
  boiled for an hour; the neutral urate is then deposited in the state
  of anhydrous grains at 212°; they contain C*N* He O*, CaO. One

   Urate of Strontia.-Uric acid diffused through water is to be added
to a boiling and saturated solution of strontia, taking care that the
acid is greatly in excess. The first portions of acid are entirely dis
solved ; but by the addition of successive portions a salt separated,
which, examined by the microscope, appeared to be acicular and
grouped in stars. This urate of strontia contains C*N*H* O*,                                                       Sr.   On

metallic substance whatever.        The hydrochloric acid was prepared
expressly for the purpose; nitric acid only was sometimes employed;
the filters were made of paper which was analysed and found to con
tain no copper, and they were washed with concentrated nitric acid
diluted with an equal volume of distilled water.         The capsules, cru
cibles, glass rods, bottles, funnels and glasses, were washed with
aqua regia, with nitric acid, and in some cases with boiling nitric
acid.
   The blood employed in these experiments weighed 162 grs.,
200 grs., 300 grs., 315 grs., 380 grs., 472 grs. ; it was cautiously
evaporated to dryness in a porcelain capsule, and burnt in a porcelain
crucible; the ash was treated with aqua regia or nitric acid; the
solution was evaporated to get rid of the greater part of the acid,
then treated with water, filtered into a bottle, subjected to the action
of hydrosulphuric acid, and allowed to stand at least eighteen hours
that the precipitate might subside; the liquid was filtered to separate
this: the filter after being washed with water containing a little
hydrosulphuric     acid, in a small porcelain capsule, treated with a
few   drops  of aqua  regia of nitric acid, allowed to stand, or slightly
heated till the colour of the precipitate was so modified as to possess
the colour of sulphur. The filter was washed, the liquid evaporated,
and the residue calcined and treated, after cooling, with two drops
of nitric acid; it had              all

organized product;      on this and on the sides of the vessel there
were formed abundance of fine crystals of hydrated carbonate of lime.
The filtered water slightly precipitated acetate of lead. The forma
tion of carbonate of lime and mucilage ceased as the spring advanced
and in the summer.       M. Dessaignes observed beneath the malate of
lime, which diminished insensibly, the formation of a stratum of very
fine and compact prismatic crystals. . This stratum was raised by
some large bubbles of gas which were given out by the malate of lime.
This mass of crystals was dissolved in hot water, precipitated by car
bonate of soda and filtered. By this there was obtained a slightly
coloured solution, which, with the addition of alcohol and ammonia,
precipitated nitrate of lead, nitrate of silver, neutral perchloride of iron,
and chloride of barium.       The liquor was concentrated, treated with
a slight excess of hydrochloric acid, and evaporated to dryness, the
 residue being repeatedly treated with boiling aether.            The aethereal
solution gave by spontaneous evaporation fine crystals of an acid
 which was volatilized without decomposing, burnt without residue
 on platina foil, and was in fact succinic acid.

  the Persian Gulf, by which he intended to proceed to Makulla, on
  the south coast of Arabia.      He there expected to meet with an Arab
  vessel to take him to  Mombás,      on the east coast of Africa, from which
  place he would commence his journey into the interior.
     Dr. Beke informs us that he has just received a letter from Cap
  tain Haines, I.N., Political Agent at Aden, dated Dec. 24, informing
  him that Dr. Bialloblotzky had left that place for Makulla by the
  steamer “Sir Charles Forbes,” Capt. Lichfield, and it was expected
  that by the end of the month he would be able to sail from Makulla
  for Mombás.

 158                    Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
                                POST-OFFICE REGULATIONS.
    The speedy and cheap transmission of intelligence is of the
highest importance for the interest of science, and our attention
has been directed to it as a subject of general complaint, as well
as by the inconvenience and loss which we ourselves experience.
    In the Advertisement prefixt to the eighth volume of the Monthly
 Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, the Council regret the
difficulty and delay in receiving scientific information.                           “With other
countries,” they observe, “and for larger parcels, the communication
is most unsatisfactory.                 The expenses and extra charges at the En
glish ports are equivalent to a negative upon direct intercourse, even
where the freight is prepaid, and the duty trifling. The Post-office
charges for pamphlets over-sea are the same as for letters.                                  Until
these matters are better regulated, a greater service can scarcely be
rendered to scientific bodies than by facilitating the rapid transfer of
international communications at a moderate cost. Any information
on this subject will be attended to.”
    We are glad to find that the subject has at length received atten
tion from the authorities of the Post-office, and that some important
improvements have been lately introduced ; and with a view to
render these available for the interests of science, we are glad to be
enabled to furnish the following particulars from the Post-office re
gulations of the most recent date.
    Periodicals published as pamphlets, and parliamentary proceedings,
provided they are made up in the same manner as newspapers, in
covers open at the sides, so as to admit of examination, are forwarded
to the countries mentioned below at the following rates, which must
be prepaid either in stamps or money.

To it   classify and describe colours is not so easy a matter as
          might at first sight appear to be; and yet it is of very
considerable interest, as well scientific as artistical.    It is im
possible that this shall be completely done until we understand
far better than at present the cause of the colours of bodies,
natural or artificial. Had Newton’s explanation of these
colours been as satisfactory as it was for the phaenomena of
the solar spectrum, the classification of colours would be more
simple and obvious than it           My present object
                                             is.                 treat                   to

162            Prof.    J.      D. Forbes on the Classification of Colours.
Lambert, were white, ochre-yellow *, red and black; and he
supposes that a bluish tint may have been obtained by diluting
the black with white.    Leonardo da Vinci, himself a painter
of the first order, appears to have had clear ideas on the sub
ject of the formation of compound colours from their simplest
elements; and although he reckons six, namely white, yellow,
green, blue, red and black, yet it is scarcely to be supposed
that he was not aware that green could be compounded of
yellow and blue, and therefore we may probably admit that
he regarded blue, red and yellow as the primary colours, to
be mixed with white or black according to the degree of sha
dow in which they are to be represented.
    Waller, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1686, attempts
a classification of colours and pigments, proceeding upon the
basis (which appears to be there assumed as generally ad
mitted) that red, yellow and blue are the sole primary colours.
This paper was originally accompanied by a diagram of hues,
which           is,
              however, wanting         the copies which
                                                    in       have ex                  I

cannot be compounded out of only two colours in the spec
trum. This corresponds with Newton's experience, that such
a colour (the mixture of two opposites) “shall not be perfectly
white, but some faint anonymous colour".”        But these expe
riments merit well a careful   repetition, which I am not indeed
aware that they have ever received; and it is very probable
that Newton never made them with a pure, or even an ap
proximately pure spectrumt.
   But Newton's celebrated experiment of mixing together
coloured powders until he obtained a perfectly indefinite gray
is most to our present purpose.      He describes in the fifteenth
experiment of the second part of his first book of Optics, the
various dry pigments which he employed, the most effective
of which was a mixture of orange, purple, green and blue,
which “became of such a gray or pale white as verged to no
one of the colours more than to another” (p. 131), which
when powerfully illuminated by the sun was an exact match
for a pure white paper less perfectly illuminated.    The reason
why it does not appear absolutely white under ordinary cir
cumstances Newton thus explains:—“All coloured powders
do suppress or stop in them a very considerable part of the
light by which they are illuminated.       For they become co
loured by reflecting the light of their own colours more co
piously and that of                          all
                          other colours more sparingly, and yet
they       do
         not reflect the light    their own colours     copiously
                                                            of                               so
 aswhite bodies do.”     [This      illustrates              he
                                                     illuminating red              by
lead and white   paper  with the red     ray;   the white paper ap
pears the more brilliantly red         the two.]      “Therefore of                                         by

of natural bodies (which refers them to the colours of thin
plates), the reasoning of the above paragraph will hardly be
 questioned.      There will therefore be always this essential
difference between compounding rays of the spectrum and
compounding pigments; that in the former case, by throwing
 light of two or more colours upon a white screen, each of
 these colours being reflected with equal vividness, the bright
 ness of the screen will be the sum of the brightnesses due to
the several rays (and if a sufficient number of rays be com
bined, the result will be a dazzling white); but, on the other
hand, by combining pigments we do not add together lights,
but merely construct a ground or screen capable of scattering
a greater number of the constituents of a beam of white light
which falls upon            Thus there will

and half of the remainder is yellow, the rest blue, constituting
a green colour.
   Similar reasoning will hold true of any number of separate
colours combined into one; and as perhaps no pigment reflects
only one pure colour of the spectrum, the mixtures will always
be more compound than they are assumed to be, and give
hues of always increasing impurity.
   The process of mixture cannot in any case be expected to
improve the power of reflecting the pure colours residing in
the constituent pigments.       It is much more likely to deterio
rate    it,
         which will tend       give    toneto  always less absolute

must be in proportion to the sines of those angles, which are
'9785, '9031 and 4593; the first being blue, the second red,

And there can be little doubt that this rule is sufficiently cor
rect, though we restrict the colours of the spectrum to three
only; for the centre of gravity of the blue (for example) may
be regarded as the centre of gravity likewise of the blue con

   Let then the proportions 0.386= R, 0.196= Y, 0.418= B
represent the constituents of white light in the spectrum, their
sum being = 1. But by what has been said of Lambert's expe
riments, it appears that red, yellow, and blue pigments reflect
but #rd, Tººths, and #th of the rays of those respective colours
which fell upon them. Therefore to have reflected light of the
same composition with the white of our tricoloured spectrum,
we must have the surfaces of the colours larger in proportion
as their reflecting power is less. Hence the spaces in our
coloured wheel must be

 found the combining proportions by weight of carmine, gam
 boge and Berlin blue, to be 1, 10 and 3*.
     We are now to consider how far this triangle carries us
 towards a complete scale of colours.                 It is manifest that the
 intensity of the colours depends upon the reflective power of
 the pigments used, and that this essentially varies for the dif
 ferent primary colours.            In no sense, then, can we be said to
 have red, yellow and blue, of equal brightness at the corners
 of our triangle; for even if we assume as merely convenient
 definition, that by equal brightness of different colours we
 mean the proportions in which, when combined, white light
 results, we have already seen that the yellow pigment, being
far most reflective, will be brightest, then the red, and after                                                  all
 the blue.     But       fact we have

the quantity              of in
                      light which they scatter, and consider these
as  the primary colours.           The mixed colours also vary their                                   in
lucidity, according          the prevalence
                                       to                 more         of

      Prof.      J.   D. Forbes            on the Classification                         of Colours.                    171
 colours, we shall be sure to have none to match which are
 not included in our suite.
     The question now arises of the number of intermediate
 mixed colours which can be interpolated between any two
 primary or simpler colours, so that each may be distinguish
 able by the eye upon a close comparison.                 The number is
 much smaller than      might     be supposed.      Lambert states, that
 from perfect black to perfect white he could only trace thirty
 intermediate shades distinguishable by the eye under the most
Javourable circumstances possible". The number of gradations
 of even the most positive colours is probably considerably less,
 and of the more neutral colours much less again; at least if
 we do not repeat those semi-neutral compounds which are
 indistinguishable from one another.
      As to the transition from one quality of colour to another
 without regard to          dilution with light

 stance, from red        blue, the sensible intermediate stages are
                                to
 also probably much fewer than might                 suspected. Mayer           be
 affirms that the distinction

    approached white on the one hand and black on the other;
    forming thus a double pyramid, whose common base was
    Mayer's triangle, the colours vanishing into white at one apex
    and into black at the other”.         A triangular pyramid or tetra

     and the double pyramid or hexahedron 910 elements.

media, for these colours are (as is      well known) undecomposable
by refraction.
    Various attempts have been made to carry out Mayer's
principle of compounding colours from red, yellow and blue,
and some elaborate attempts have been made to obtain model
suites of colour.       I shall at present only refer to Mr. D. R.
 Hay's ingenious work called Nomenclature of Colours, which
he has illustrated by a very large number of selected hues and
 shades       compounded from Red, Yellow and Blue, variously
               all
 diluted with Black and White, which, from Mr. Hay's skill
in   the choice and use                          of
                                  colours, are probably          pure and                          as

evident.      Mr. Hay, following Field, calls tertiary colours
those produced by           union   a                  of
                                      the secondaries: thus—

  “Their    distinctions arise from a double occurrence of vel
low in the first, of red in the second, and of blue in the third+.”
In like manner, by the combination of the tertiary colours (or
primary hues, as Mr. Hay calls them), he produced a system
of quaternaries (or secondary hues), and so on until the small
predominance of any one or two primary colours in the com
pound reduces the whole to a neutral gray.           Now a simple
inspection of Mayer's triangle, p. 168, shows that the confusion
of the colours, by drawing a series of perpetually inscribed
triangles, increases with great rapidity, and that consequently
the gradations of shades will not be such as affect the eye most
sensibly, but will be deficient in the brighter and redundant
in the grayer colours.
   The law of composition of the secondary and tertiary colours
is however worthy of notice, and may be represented in the
following diagram (employing the notation of page 169).

Hence citrine, for instance, is a mixture of four parts of yellow,
with two of blue and two of red, which is equivalent to two
parts of yellow and six of neutral gray (since gray = y br);

 We therefore refer them at once to their places in Mayer's
 triangle as intermediate between the secondaries and neutrality,
 and dividing the interspace in the ratio of 3 to 1, as in the
 former case; only here the compound is more neutral, because
 the secondary colours are themselves one stage on the way to
 neutrality.
    Thus we arrive at this conclusion, that all combinations of
 three primary colours (as far as difference of quality is con
 cerned) may be represented by transitions from the primary and
 secondary colours into gray; and thence, though it may appear
 at first sight paradoxical, though the quality of a primary or
 secondary colour (such as red or green) is not changed by
 diluting it with white, it is changed by mixing it with gray,
 or by first mixing it with white and then diminishing the       in
 tensity of light in the mixture.
    Hence a classification of colours may be made, which,
 although redundant in some parts, has the advantage of point
ing out clearly the composition of each in this point, and also
 of suggesting a convenient nomenclature, which I propose to
adopt in preference to Mr. Hay's (where they differ), as more
 expressive of the composition of each.         This diagram, like
 Mayer's triangle, includes colours varying in quality, but of
standard intensity and of the highest attainable purity. This
diagram was obligingly arranged for me by Mr. Hay out of
the coloured specimens in his work.
    The places marked by asterisks will supply a sufficient rela
tive number of intermediate hues, as these evidently approach
the absolute uniformity of neutral gray in the last column,
whilst the first contains the graduated colours of the spectrum.
    All these colours may be varied by mixing them with white
or black, forming what Mr. Hay judiciously calls tints or
shades of any colour.
    It is sometimes convenient to have these tints and shades
arranged in immediate apposition for the purpose of compa
rison.     This may be conveniently done for the principal co
lours   by  having two diagrams.      In one, the colours of the
spectrum form a circular ring, the colours passing through
tints into perfect white at the centre, and the shades continued
in outward radiating lines till they coalesce in a perfectly
black circumference.      In the other, the principal intermediates
between the principal colours and gray may be exhibited with
like transitions. These intermediates may conveniently be
denominated by the following terms, sufficiently expressive
and in common use.

  Mr. Hay                kind enough to arrange for me his ex
                  has been
tensive suite of artificial colours according to these diagrams.
   But it must be owned to be highly desirable to possess such
a suite of colours in more perfect and durable materials than
any pigment as usually applied presents.     Painted porcelain
and coloured enamels alone appear to possess this valuable pro
perty.  The immense collection of artificial enamels employed
in the Vatican fabric     of mosaic pictures seems to offer an unri
valled   opportunity    of forming such a classification.
    This gigantic establishment was founded about two centu
ries ago for the express purpose of adorning the interior of St.
Peter's with the elaborate mosaic pictures and ceilings which
astonish every visitor.       The whole interior of the stupendous
dome is incrusted with mosaic patterns and pictures, of coarse
execution indeed, but such as suits best the vast distance from
which alone they can be properly viewed; whilst the finished
mosaic works which adorn the altars reproduce in unfading
colours and with consummate skill in shading the chefs
d'auvre of Raphael, Domenichino, and other artists preserved
in the Vatican gallery.          The material is a soft and fusible
 enamel, and the formation of 18,000 tints was effected by an
 ingenious artist named Matteoli, at the time I have mentioned.
 The rough cakes of enamel are preserved in separate cup
 boards or pigeon-holes, surrounding a hall of great length ap
 propriated to this purpose by Pope Pius VI.               But the main
intention of the work being completed with St. Peter's, it has
 not been thought worth while to preserve the integrity of the
collection (which, indeed would be no easy matter); and it is
 certain that though still reputed to contain 18,000 modified
colours, the effective number is vastly smaller.
    Having been fortunate enough in 1844 to make the valu
able acquaintance of Monsignore de' Medici Spada, an en
lightened and influential prelate residing at Rome, I entreated
  his influence      procure
                       to        selection

    had long left Rome, and was therefore quite unable                            to

 scarcely sensibly differing from each other.               This last circum
 stance was     probably    occasioned      by  the carelessness and indo
 lence of the workmen who selected them. The former cir
 cumstances might naturally be expected in a collection con
 structed for the purpose of imitating paintings, in which, as is
 well-known, optically pure colours are almost never used; but
 their effect is invariably produced by skilful contrasts.                Many
 of the suites of indefinite colours are               exquisitely   beautiful.
 With Mr. Hay's assistance, I selected a sufficient number of
 distinct hues to represent tolerably Mayer's triangle of colours;
 but the great mass of colours being only detached suites, it was
 impossible to combine them into a connected whole. As I have
 no doubt, however, that the collection is one which faithfully
 represents the colours chiefly used by artists, it may not be
 uninteresting to copy the catalogue forwarded to me by Mon
 signore Spada, with the local names and the principal denomi
nations on the scale of nomenclature proposed in this paper,
which they include.

              Sir John                        Lubbock has suggested that shootin
stars may be small planetary bodies which shine by
light, and that their sudden disappearance may be occasioned
by their immersion in the earth's shadow; and he has given
a formula for calculating, on this hypothesis, the distance of
a shooting star, at the moment of         disappearance, from            its
                                                                                                                   byit a

  The calculation by means of equations (14.) and (15) does
not require a table of natural tangents. It requires the lo
garithmic tables to be opened six times.

culations without being able to follow the steps of this investi

XXIII.  Remarks on the Weather during the Quarter ending
  December 31, 1848.    By JAMEs GLAishER, Esq., of the
  Royal Observatory, Greenwich *.
THE  meteorological returns for the past quarter furnished
  to the Registrar-General have been received from sta
tions spread over the country.     The observations have been
made, for the most part by experienced observers, upon an
uniform plan.     The following remarks are based upon obser
vations which have been furnished either to myself or to the
Registrar-General, and drawn up to accompany the meteoro
logical tables published by the Registrar-General,                      all
                                                             which        myof
have been examined          by
                          myself, and reduced under          direc

tion.
   The weather during the period has been variable. The
changes   oftemperature have been frequent and great, there
has been     anunusually large number          exhibitions   of the           of
aurora   borealis,  and the magnetic instruments have been
greatly disturbed.    The amount        electricityof    the atmo  in
sphere has been small, many days together having passed
without the instruments      Greenwich being affected.

 on  the 17th    ofNovember; this was best observed            Professor      by
 Challis, and described           him    by the Cambridge

   Thunder-storms occurred at Whitehaven on October 9, 23,
28, 29, November 22, December 1; at Preston on Dec. 1;
at Stonyhurst on December 9, distant thunder and lightning
were noticed.    Thunder was heard at Exeter on October 22
and on December 1. Lightning was seen at Truro on Oc
tober 16, at Stone on October 28, at Saffron Walden on De
cember 1 and 6, at Durham on October 18 and 28, at White
haven on December 2, at Greenwich on October 25, and at
Stone on October 6 and November 3.
   Hail fell at Truro on October 18, November 4, 7 and 8,
at Greenwich on December 1, at Exeter on December 23, at
Whitehaven on October 23, 28, 29, December 1 and 4.
   Snow fell at Exeter, Empingham, and Saffron Walden on
October 18, at Truro, Southampton, Greenwich, and Em
pingham on November 4, at Truro on November 7 and 8, at
Hartwell on November 23 and December 2, and at Exeter
on December 23.
   Solar halos were seen at Maidenstone Hill, Greenwich, on
October 5, 24, 29, and November 25; at Stone on Nov. 30;
at Greenwich on October 24; at Highfield House on Oct. 1,
4, 18, 29, and December 2.
   On November 8 a mock sun was seen at Highfield House.
   Lunar halos were seen on October 8, December 2, 4, 10
and 12.
   Large and continuous falls of rain.—On October 23, at
Latimer Rectory, rain to the depth of 1:7 inch fell in twenty
four hours following 9 A.M.
   At Falmouth, on December 27, there was a heavy fall of
rain; in a few hours 1-5 inch fell. At Truro, on December 27,
rain fell to the depth of 2:1 inches.    In some parts of the
county of Cornwall the fall of rain on December 27 exceeded
2 inches; at Penzance more than 2 inches fell.      Great da
mage was done by the consequent floods.
   The mean monthly values of the several subjects of research
for the times of observations are appended to the report of
the Registrar-General.
   The monthly mean temperatures in the counties of Cornwall
and Devonshire exceeded those at other places; but there
seems to have been a good deal of bad weather in these coun
ties, and more snow, hail and sleet seems to have fallen in
these counties than elsewhere.
   The readings of the barometer till October 4 were between
29'5 inches and 29-7 inches; after October 4 it steadily    in
creased, and passed the point 30 before noon on the 5th, and
remained above this point until the 7th ; the highest reading
was 30.062, and took place at 9h A.M. on the 6th.     Between

the 8th and the 20th the fluctuations were very frequent, with
generally larger decreasing than increasing readings.       On the
25th the            was 29°111, and was the lowest in the month.
On the 26th, at 6h P.M., it had increased to 29.749, and after
this the readings were low, and with slight variation to the
end of the month.      The extreme difference of the readings
                  j.
during the month was 0.953 inch.
    From November 1 to 6 the readings were between 29-6 and
29:4; it then increased from the latter reading to 30'248 on
the 10th at midnight.      On the 15th the reading was 30-348,
which was the             during the month. On the 18th, at
 midnight, the reading was 29:417; on the 19th the increase
 was 0.520 inch, and on the 20th the decrease was 0.454.        On
 the 23rd, at midnight, the reading was 29-048, which was the
 lowest in the month.     On the 25th, at noon, the reading was
 29.984; after this the changes were small till the end of the
 month.     The range during the month was 1,300 inch.
     On December 1 the reading decreased 0.436, and was
 29:284 at midnight; on the 2nd it increased 0-253, and on the
 3rd, at 10h A.M., it was 29.730; it then decreased rapidly,
 and the lowest reading during the quarter took place on the
 5th at 6" A.M.; it increased slowly till the 7th, and then quickly
 from the 7th to the 10th. The reading was above 30 from
 the 10th to the 13th ; it was between 29'5 and 30 from the
 13th to the 18th. On this day, at 6 P.M., it was 29.677, and
 on the 22nd, at midnight, the reading was 30°266, the highest
 during the month. The reading was generally high till the
 end of the month. The range during the month was 1.432
 inches.
     At Stonyhurst, from Nov. 1 to 6, the readings were between
 29.098 and 29:355, it then increased to 30-150 at 11 P.M.; on
 the 12th it remained above 29-8 till November 17, when it
 decreased suddenly to 29'518, and gradually to 28:923 on the
 20th ; it increased to 29°110 on November 21, but decreased
 to 28.624 by 3 P.M. on the 22nd; it then increased steadily
 till November 25 at 9 A.M., when it was 29'615, and the varia

     On December 5, at 9" A.M., the reading was 28:421, the
  wind at the time blowing strongly from the west.
     Charles Charnock, Esq., of Stourton Lodge, Leeds, has
      N.
  kindly furnished me with the following agricultural report for
  the         Riding of Yorkshire.
     “The continued rain from the 20th of September to No
  vember 1 prevented any large quantity of wheat being sown,
  even on dry lands; and that which was sown was finished in
  a very unsatisfactory manner.    The comparative dry weather

 190         Mr. J.    Glaisher's Remarks on the Weather
 from November 1 to 12 enabled the farmers to sow a great
 portion of their wheat.    On strong wheat soils a large breadth
 remains for spring sowing with wheat or oats.          The seed time
 upon an average was nearly a month later than usual, and the
 seed since has vegetated very slowly, owing to the wetness and
coldness of the soil.
    “The continued fall of rain in September completely de
stroyed the crops of corn in the backward situations, and large
quantities of barley, oats and beans, in the straw have been
carried into the yards for the cattle and pigs, as not worth the
expense of thrashing.
    “The disease among potatoes has not been found so destruc
tive as was anticipated, and will be more injurious to the grower
than to the consumer.        In some situations the crops were
totally, and in others partially destroyed; yet from the great
extra breadth planted with this vegetable last spring, there
will perhaps be no great scarcity felt.            I
                                                 was most surprised
by seeing field potatoes taken up as late as the 18th of De
j
cember.                                                       -
   “The crops of corn now thrashing are very deficient both in
  uantity and quality.     Turnips are an indifferent crop, and
    not bear much    eating;  the sheep folded upon them have
been prevented from doing well by the wetness of the weather.
Symptoms of rot are apparent among many flocks of sheep.
   “From the open weather the grass land has been full of meat,
and has kept cattle out of the straw yards longer than usual.
The disease on the lungs of beasts and milch-cows has been
É.revalent and exceedingly fatal; the mortality is calculated to
      been 95 per cent. of those attacked.
   “Within the last few weeks the epidemic prevalent in the
years 1839 and 1840 has appeared among lean stock;                                 its
symptoms are blisters         on
                             the tongue and lameness.              not It   is
often fatal, but reduces the cattle attacked                by

    The mean of the numbers in the second column, for those
places situated in Cornwall and Devonshire, is 47°-9; for those
places situated south of latitude 52°, including Chichester
and Hartwell, is 44°6; for those places situated between the
latitudes of 52° and 53°, including Saffron Walden and High
field House, is 44°-2; for those places situated between the
latitudes of 53° and 54°, including Liverpool and Whitehaven,
 is 43°3; and for Durham and Newcastle is 43°0. These
 values may be considered as those of the mean temperature of
 the air for their parallels of latitude during the quarter ending
 December 31, 1848.
    The average daily range of the temperature of the air in
 Cornwall and Devonshire was 9°-6; at Liverpool and White
 haven was 6°-9; south of latitude 52° was 11°.6; between the
latitude of 52° and 54° was 9°6; and at Durham and Newcastle
was 8°-9.
   The greatest mean daily ranges of the temperature of the air
took place at Greenwich, Hartwell, Latimer Rectory, and
Aylesbury respectively; and the least occurred at Whitehaven,
Guernsey, Torquay, Liverpool, and Truro respectively.
   The highest thermometer readings during the quarter were
76° at Hartwell and Leicester, 74° at Greenwich and Aylesbury.
The lowest thermometer reading was 20°5 at Stonyhurst,
and readings about 21°occurred at several places. The extreme
range of temperature of the air during the quarter was there
fore about 55°.
   The average quarterly range of the reading of the thermo

     XXV.        On Single and Double Vision produced by viewing
         objects with both eyes; and on an Optical Illusion with regard
         to the distance of objects. By John Lockrº.
     I     HAD    commenced the investigation of this subject so early
            as 1816, while I was a student of medicine in Yale Col
     lege, and    Ihave occasionally turned my attention to it up to
     the present time.
         Although I have been fairly anticipated in the publication
     of some of my results, perhaps most of them, by the late                in
     vestigations of Prof. Wheatstonet and Sir David Brewsterf,
     yet I deem it not useless to give you an account of the history
     of my own experiments and conclusions, especially as some of
     them are not, so far as I know, contained in the publications
     of either of the distinguished philosophers who have just
     written upon the subject.        It is a well-known phaenomenon,
     that with both eyes open we can see a single object either
     single or double, according as the axes of the eyes are made
     to converge and meet either at the object, or at a point nearer
     than that object. Having acquired the power of voluntary con
     vergence of the optical axes to an extreme degree without the
     aid of viewing near objects, such as the nose, or a finger held
     near to the eyes, I commenced my experiments as follows:–
         Experiment    I.-I    viewed a burning candle at the distance
     of about   eight  feet, the axes of the eyes being “crossed ” or
     extremely converged.         Two images were of course seen, the
     distance between which could be varied at pleasure by the
     amount of that convergence.         The two images of the candle
      being thus seen, I suddenly closed one of my eyes, when the
     image on the same side of the closed eye vanished.           Thus on
      closing the right eye, the right image disappeared; and on
      closing the left eye, the left image became extinct.
         Inferences.—1st. As the axis of the right eye was directed
      to the left of the object, and the image which disappeared on
      closing that eye was to the right of               it,
                                                   that image must have
      been   an  oblique one, seen        as    we
                                             see lateral objects        to
                                                                     which
      the  eyes are not directed.        appears,
                                          It       too, that while the axes
      were converged upon vacancy, the oblique image              the right
                                                                   in

      the left eye, and the same relatively              its of
                                                   the left eye; thus each
      eye appeared    to have    an image          axis, which image was
                                                  in
      really in the opposite eye       S.

196       Mr.      J.   Locke on Single and Double Vision,
   2nd. The two oblique images on the retina must have been
formed on points nearer to the nose, or nearer to the medial
line of the body than the principal axis of perfect vision.
    3rd. The images appeared in such position as objects
should have been to produce pictures on the same parts of the
retina, the aires being at the same time parallel, or nearly so.
    4th. As with both eyes we see a lateral object ordinarily
single, especially when at the same distance as the principal
object viewed, it is inferred that the two pictures, one in each
eye, must fall on parts of the retina not correspondent to the
medial line of the body in order to produce single vision. For
example, on looking at a person standing ten yards in front,
the image of a person standing two yards or more to the right
will appear single though not well-defined.             The picture of
this second   person   must in such case be formed to the left side
of the retina of both eyes, towards the nose in the right eye,
and from it in the left eye.         In these two situations on the
retina, and in no other, will the two oblique pictures present
a single image to the mind.
    5th. All this establishes the principle, that certain parts of
the retina of one eye correspond to certain specific parts of the
retina of the other eye, in such a manner that when identical
pictures fall on those corresponding parts, single vision is the
result. Those corresponding parts               inward    lie
                                                            one eye and    in

 double vision will thus               be
                                  the result.      Here the eye being
 rolled upward,   the  image   falls     the    on
                                              upper  part     the retina;   of

      2.        AA AA                       View with axes slightly converged.

                                                 images coalesced into one.
   On suddenly closing either eye, this middle or superimposed
image did not disappear, and it was evidently made of two
images from two objects formed on corresponding parts of the
retinae. Hence we have the converse of the case of double
vision of a single object, for two objects are made to produce
a single impression.   Thus far had proceeded in 1816, when    I
I   read a paper on this subject to a club                               of my fellow-students
at Yale.

º
nomena.        Thus the distance from the eye to the illusive image
(AE) will be to the     distance from the object to the same image
(1) E)   as the distance between the eyes (AB) is to the distance
            the objects (CD) the figures or pannels on the paper,
   C.
    It is not merely the two objects directly in the axes of the
eyes which coincide, but every contiguous pair of objects seen
obliquely will also coincide, and form the illusive picture in
extenso.      Indeed the optical operation of convergence seems
like taking up a duplicate copy of the figures lying in the first
place exactly over them, and slipping it gradually to the ex
tent of one figure, until again the figures coincide in a new
place.
    Some of the phaenomena of the Illusive Image.—It is quite
perfect, and can be viewed deliberately and critically as if it
were a real substance in place as it appears; the figures are
smaller than the originals in proportion as they are nearer;
as the outlines are a little blended by double pictures not ex
actly coincident, an elegant softening and a playful beauty
exalts their effect above that of the original; as the head
moves sideways, upward or downward, the illusive image
moves, but with a diminished motion; as the head is inclined
to the right or left, the superimposed pictures slide out from
each other, the one ascending and the other descending to the
extent of the inclination.
    Optical Equivalency.—The illusive image and the erroneous
distance at which it appears, show evidently that philosophi
cally we do not see an object, but we contemplate an image on
the retina.      If this image can by any means be formed without
the   object,   we still contemplate the substance such as would
produce that image.         Thus in Exp. III., and the figure illus
trating that experiment, the two objects C and D produce
each picture in the eyes at A and B, exactly as would be pro
duced by a single object of smaller size at E. Thus the two
objects, one at C and the other at D, “fulfill the conditions
of the problem” of the images on the retina, exactly as it
would be fulfilled by a single smaller object at E.          In both
cases identical pictures are formed on “corresponding” parts
of the two retinae. Hence the two objects produce the im
pression of a single image.
    Directions how to make the experiment of the Illusive Image.
—With two identical objects only, although it is easy to su
perimpose them as in Exp. II., yet the illusion of distance
can scarcely be attained.        But with a papered wall having a
repetition of the same figure at equal distances, a person who
has voluntary command of the optical axes will soon move the
double images to coincide, when presently the illusion will be

                              and an Optical Illusion.                               199
perfect.   Persons who have not this command of their eyes
may succeed in obtaining the proper convergence by looking
at a finger held about fifteen inches from the face, while stand
ing ten feet from a wall with figures twenty inches apart.
   Apparent distances of objects.--It seems that we judge of
moderate distances by a kind of triangulation, the distance
between the eyes being a constant base-line.      In order to put
this to the test, I have several times made the actual measure
ments as in the following cases:–
   Having measured the distance between my eyes, 2-6 inches,
the distance between the figures on the wall 21 inches, the
distance from the wall 10 feet, the distance of the illusive
image was calculated to be 14-7 inches, when it had been mea
sured as near as may be 14.5 inches.   In a second experiment
we endeavoured to ascertain the distance of the observer from
the wall.  The other data were—
          Distance between the eyes    .  .                    2:6 inches.            .
          Distance between the figures    .                   21   inches.
          Distance of illusive image   .  .                   1675 inches.
          Calculated distance of the wall .                   12.5 feet.
          Measured distance of wall    .  .                   13:15 feet.
     When it is recollected that the observer is obliged to range
lengthwise on his measure while he determines the distance
of the aërial image, and that the base-line is only 26 inches,
the above results appear quite as accurate as we ought to an
ticipate.
    There is peculiar beauty and accuracy in some of the results
of these experiments; and it had occurred both to Sir David
Brewster and myself, that when a strip of wall-paper was placed
at a greater or less distance from                 its
                                              fellow than others, the
illusive  image  would not     appear     the same place, some strips
                                              in
would advance       little and others would recede,

and as no other apparatus is required than our eyes and the
objects of our inspection, it would seem that they were easily
made.      But it requires rather an acquired power over the
organs of vision to be readily successful. Sir David Brewster
applied “binocular” convergence upon two figures, drawn
side by side to superimpose one upon the other, and compare
their exactness in point of size and form.        I have extended
the same operation to figures of unequal size, though of the
same form.      My son had just completed a half-size copy of a
drawing representing an Arab on horseback, the correctness
of which had been questioned. It was evident that, being
placed at distances proportionate to their size, the images
of the original and copy on the retina would be equal when a
consistent illusive image might be obtained by convergence.
The original was hung on the wall, and the half-size copy sus
pended at about half the distance from the observer, at such
an angle that one could be fully seen beside the other.               I
converged or superimposed the images, and found them so
nearly to coincide, that the common outline was merely ele
gantly softened by the inequalities.     In this experiment it ap
peared as if the eye, when the figures did not exactly coincide,
had some power to complete the work or conceal the imper
 <U+017F>ections.
    I have just succeeded in substituting a blank tablet for one
of the pictures, and in tracing upon it with a pencil the illusive
image converged from the other tablet.           But this is not a
very practicable method of copying pictures, requiring unusual
command and steadiness of the optical axes for even the most
 moderate success in the operation.
    XXVI.     Analytical Proof     the Parallelogram    of   Forces.
                         By T. #H. PRATT.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
        my work on Mechanical Philosophy, I have given a proof
 IN of the Parallelogram     of Forces which depends on the so
 lution of the following functional equation,
                 Jºi (f(-)}=1.
    I there solved  this equation indirectly.   The
                                                   .  .    .

                                                               .   (1.)
                                                                    di
 rect solution  may  be acceptable to some    of your readers.
     Put
                 {f(3)}*=cos^4 + (cos   3–sin ();(),

and the equation (1.) becomes after reduction
                                                  7"
which is rendered identical by putting f(3) equal to any                                               arbi
trary function of sin 20, as F(sin 23).
   Hence the most general solution of equation (1.) is
                {<U+017F>(?)}*=            cos^4      + (cos   0– sin () F(sin               28).     .   .        (2)
   In the application of this formula to the Parallelogram of
Forces, we must make use of some condition that the function
F may be determined; as mechanical experience shows it
cannot remain arbitrary. Such a condition is the following:
that if be increased by r, the resultant will obviously be                                                  §
same as before in magnitude, but opposite in sign: this will
therefore be the case with f(0).
   Put, therefore, r +3 for 6 in (2.), and equate the two values
of the square of the function (as they must be the same), and
reduce, and we have
 cos”0+(cos         0–sin          6)   F(sin 20)=cos' 3–(cos 0–sin () F(sin 20);
         ...   F(sin 25)=0
for all values of         0.
   Hence      the case
               in                       ofthe Parallelogram                     of   Forces,

                               f(0)=cos          3     or   —   cos
the latter    excluded, because when
               is                           the resultant       0   =                                  is   the
force itself,   f(0)=1.
                    or
   Hence f(0)=cos       the complete solution.

                                 Respectfully yours,

               Mr. G. G. Stokes    on the Theory   of Sound.       2O3
    plied to the purpose of rendering a meridian mark visible at
    night; and that the same means might also be used for illu
    minating the wires of the transit instrument.      I proposed that
    the meridian mark should consist of a hole in a plate of brass,
    adjustible in a vertical and horizontal direction by screws,
    and that behind this hole should be placed the incandescent
     wire in a glass tube for the purpose of illumination, the bat
    tery being of course at any required distance.       For illumina
    ting the wires of the telescope,   I proposed that the platinum
    wire, protected by a glass tube, should be placed either within
    or at the side of the eye-piece, and thus obviate the necessity
    of piercing one of the transit-arms, as is usual. I was only
    able to try the above plans upon a small scale for want of a
    more powerful battery; but the experiments of Mr. Staite
    lead me to think that there may be cases in which his method
    of illumination by galvanism might be used with the greatest
    advantage for rendering a very distant meridian mark visible.
    I have found that even platinum wire, rendered incandescent
    by alcohol, may be distinguished by the telescope at a con
    siderable distance; as may also the hydrogen and platinum
    lamp.    By any of the above plans, the necessity of attention
   to the lamp itself by an assistant is done away.
       While upon the subject of micrometer-wires, may I also be
   allowed to state, that so far back as 1831 I invented a substi.
   tute for them by lines drawn upon glass with a diamond, which
   lines were illuminated through the edge of the glass? but          I
   was led to abandon the plan after trial, fearing to introduce
º
   the errors of the two surfaces of the glass, though     I found that
   in other respects the plan fully answered.         I am induced to
   mention this, having lately seen in the public prints that the
   same method has been since independently discovered, and           I
   rejoice to find satisfactorily employed, by the     Earl Rosse.

  WaWes.
      Professor Challis has divided his demonstration of the
  “contradiction” arrived at in this case into five heads. I
  entirely agree with the first four; the fifth I beg leave to dis
  pute. The part to which I object is contained in the sentence,

 “Hence by the principle of the constancy of mass employed
 in investigating one of the hydrodynamical equations, those
 two quantities must be equal to each other.”                   deny that the           |
 equality follows in any manner from the principle in question.
 As the onus probandi evidently rests with Professor Challis,
I  might here stop; but to render everything as definite as
 possible, I will give a precise enunciation of the principle of
 the constancy of mass, at least as I myself regard                      and                        it,         I     ->

G9.2   as found in nature is never chemically pure, being
  combined with variable proportions of silver and traces
of iron and copper, and occasionally it occurs with palladium
and also with tellurium.
  The amount of silver was found by Boussingault in a series
of analyses of the native gold of Columbia to vary between 2
and 35 per cent, from which he drew the conclusion that the
gold and silver were combined in atomic proportions, l atom
of silver being constantly combined with more than 1 atom of
gold. The specimen containing 35 per cent. of silver he con
sidered to be a compound of 1 atom of silver and 2 atoms of
gold, Ag Au”, and that containing 2 per cent. of silver 1 atom
of silver and 12 gold, Ag Au’”.
   This view of Boussingault was controverted by Gustav
Rose on his return from his celebrated journey to the Ural
Mountains theoretically, on the ground that gold and silver
were isomorphous bodies, and such substances are not gene
rally met with combined in atomic proportion.         would be                “It
as remarkable as if antimony, arsenic and tellurium were found
combined in atomic proportion,” he remarks         “but as iso         f;
morphous substances do sometimes occur combined in atomic
proportion, as in bitterspar, diopside, &c., the only remarkable
result of the analyses of Boussingault                        ” is,
                                                  that the gold and
silver should      constantly

208         Sir R. I. Murchison                        on the Geological Structure
self”, and to extend the survey from that portion of the chain to
Switzerland and Savoy. The second part is a brief explanation of
his present views respecting the northern flank of the Carpathian
mountains, and the third relates to Italy and the Apennines.
   The Alps.—The central masses of the Eastern Alps, though in
parts highly crystalline, contain recognizable remnants of Upper                                              Si
lurian, Devonian, and carboniferous deposits, as proved by organic
remains; but no traces of the Permian system f of the author, so
abundant in Russia, Germany and England, have been found in
them or in any part of Southern Europe.          In the same regions, viz.
in the South  Tyrol  and the Salzburg   Alps,  the above-mentioned palae
ozoic formations are succeeded     by   trias, with true “muschelkalk.”
fossils, as recently expounded by Von Buch, Emmerich, Von Hauer,
and other geologists. But in following the central parts of the chain
from Austria into Switzerland and Savoy, all fossil evidences of these
palaeozoic and triassic deposits cease; which, if ever they existed,
have been obliterated by the very powerful action of metamorphism
which has affected the Western Alps. The presence, however, of
undoubted species of old coal plants in Savoy has led some geolo
gists to believe that the carboniferous system had some representa
tive there; whilst M. E. de Beaumont and M. Sismonda contend,
that the association of such plants with belemnites proves that they
occur in the lias of this part of the chain (Mont Blanc, Taren
taise, and Maurienne), so clearly recognized by          numerous animal                its
organic remains. Sir       Murchison allows, after personal inspection,

Sedgwick and himself described them, and after showing the great
value  of the Oxfordian group       Von Buch    of the clear uppermost zone as
of  the Jurassic   limestones,   the author   goes      his chief point, and      to
proves     bya number           of
                           natural sections, that the  opinion  for which his
colleague and himself formerly contended, and which met with                                                      so
much opposition,       is length completely established;—that the flanks
                                at
of the  Alps  exhibit   true transition from the younger secondary into the
                           a
older  tertiary strata. But whilst this principle was correct, the author
allows that his friend and himself were         error      applying       in
                                                                          the          in           it   to

 210           Sir R. I. Murchison            on the Geological Structure
  posed, an upper member of the cretaceous rocks, but really represents
  the true eocene. The adoption of this view, which it is supposed all
  palaeontologists must adhere to, seems already to be also in great
  part taken by M. Boué, in opposition to his former opinion.                       In
  reviewing the physical relations of the upper secondary and lower
  tertiary rocks of the Alps, it is made manifest, that the independence
  of any one member of this succession cannot be assumed from its
  unconformability to others in certain localities; inasmuch as such
  appearances    are proved to be local phaenomena only, by a more
  general survey which detects the order to be unbroken and conti
  nuous.     In the Alps therefore, as in Russia, where deposits of several
  ages are conformable, the limits of formations can alone be defined
 by their imbedded organic remains.
     The author next developed the true age of the “Molasse and Na
 gelflue” of the northern portion of the Alps. Citing the researches
  of Prof. Studer, M. Escher and others, he showed that the axis or
 older part of these tertiary deposits was usually removed to some
 distance from the higher ridges of cretaceous and eocene rocks, and
 consisted of freshwater strata; that the central or marine accumula
 tions are from their fossils (as collected in the Cantons St. Gallen
 and Berne) of sub-Apennine or pliocene age, and that the great over
 lying portion of molasse and nagelflue, which frequently (owing to
 enormous dislocations) seems to dip under the older rocks, out of
 which it has been formed, is again, as far as can be ascertained, of
 terrestrial and freshwater origin.         Following these deposits in as
 cending order to their outermost and superior zone, they are found
 to be surmounted by the well-known lacustrine formation of CEnin
 gen, formerly described in some detail by the author”. The remark
 able feature of this deposit           is,
                                         that although       has unquestionably

              of the Alps, Carpathians and Apennines,              211
of crystalline   rock, whether eruptive or purely metamorphic, the
 deviations from such conformity are very numerous, particularly
where the strata wrap round the ends of each separate crystalline
mass; in illustration of which a geological map of the Canton of
Glarus, by M. Escher, was appealed to. Seeing that the forms of
the anticlinal and synclinal folds exhibited in his sections coincided
with the illustrations of the Appalachian mountains and other chains
recently produced by Prof. H. Rogers, the author—without offering
any opinion on the theory of that able geologist—pointed out that
in the Alps, as in the United States, the long and slightly inclined
slopes of each anticlinal face the great centre of disturbance, whilst
the short and steep sides of the same dip away from the chain.       In
reference to the very frequent phaenomenon of the younger strata
 (including the molasse) dipping under the older, particularly along
the line of great longitudinal faults, Prof. Rogers presented diagrams
explanatory of such overlaps in accordance with his theory.
    Carpathians.—A brief sketch, the result of a survey in 1843, is
then given of the northern flanks of the Carpathian mountains. Indi
cating the general succession northwards from the Tatra chain, the
author points out how a mass of nummulitic limestone, overlying
secondary rocks, dips under shale and sandstone like the flysch of the
Alps, such deposits representing, as in those mountains, the eocene
of geologists. An outer ridge (Zafflary and Rugosnik) of Oxfordian
Jura and chiefly Lower Neocomian according to Zeuschner and Key
serling, rises abruptly through these superior deposits, and between
it and Cracow are undulating hills, much broken up and dislocated,
consisting of sandstones, shale, &c., in parts of which Prof. Zeusch
ner has discovered many secondary greensand or Neocomian fossils.
These sandstones have a wide range, extending into Moravia, and
doubtless constitute a large portion of what has been termed Car
pathian grit. But the author observes that in tracts like this, where
the cretaceous system assumes an arenaceous and earthy form, and
particularly in those districts where the nummulitic limestones no
longer exist, it is exceedingly difficult to draw any clearly defined
line of separation between sandstones of secondary and tertiary age.
He therefore believes that under the name of “Gres des Carpathes”
rocks both of eocene and cretaceous age have hitherto been con
founded, and that arguments concerning the age of any given portion
of these sandstones in a country so constituted and so full of dislo
cations are valueless without the test of organic remains.
    The Apennines.—A general view of the structure of Italy is then
offered; and whilst on the authority of General della Marmora the
existence of Silurian rocks in Sardinia is cited, it is shown that
the lowest fossiliferous deposits of the Peninsula are liasso-jurassic,
followed by limestones, often of red colours, of Oxfordian age (am
monitico-rosso).     These constitute a number of parallel ridges of
various altitudes, overlaid by or forming troughs with younger accu
mulations, and thus forming numerous backbones, of which the
Apuan Alps and their crystalline marbles, the hills of La Spezia
and Pisa, are the most prominent examples in the North.

212           Sir R. I. Murchison                        on the Geological Structure
   Admirably exposed on the flanks of the Venetian Alps, and
scarcely less so at Nice, the cretaceous system in all its members
(from the Neocomian limestones of foreign geologists or equivalents
of the English lowest greensand up to the white chalk inclusive) is
surmounted by nummulitic eocene deposits, which near Asolo and
Bassano are followed by miocene and pliocene shelly strata. After
showing how they occupy a trough between such Alps and the Eu
ganaeans, the author explains how the latter hills have recently been
described by M. de Zigno as composed of Oxfordian Jura and a
full cretaceous system up to the white chalk inclusive, overlaid by
the nummulitic group.       In Liguria, Modena, Lucca and Tuscany,
such clear evidences do not exist; for there the formations above
the Oxfordian Jura are singularly devoid of fossils, and the series
between that horizon and the deposits of miocene age, with the ex
ception of certain flaggy limestones (Alberese), assumes an arena
ceous type.    At very rare intervals only, and chiefly to the south of
Florence, are any bands of nummulites observable; but where they
occur the author refers                    all
                              the “macigno "sandstone which          asso                                          is

the Carpathians to Cutch at the mouth of the Indus, a space of not
less than 25° lat. has been occupied by sea-basins in which creatures
of this aera lived. In reference to Egypt, he cites copious collections
of shells and nummulites, chiefly those at the Royal Museum of
Turin, examined by M. Bellardi and himself; and in regard to Hin
dostan (after reverting to the Cutch fossils collected by Grant and
described by Sowerby), he pointedly dwelt on the rich and instructive
supplies of them recently sent home to him by Capt. Vicary from
Scinde and Sabathoo, and examined by Mr. Morris, which not only
demonstrate the existence of this same group in the Hala range, ex
tending northwards towards Caubul, but also along the southern
edge of the Himalaya mountains.

Italy, any words he may be cited      as having spoken at that Meeting
 are not to be taken as affecting his ultimate conclusions expressed in
this memoir. Since it was read he has received a letter from M.           Al
cide d'Orbigny, which he willingly cites both as confirming his ge
neral conclusions and as bringing these deposits into close comparison
 with the lower tertiaries of Northern Europe.      “For three years,”
 M.  d’Orbigny  writes,    “I
                            have made the most extensive and most ge
neral researches on the strata containing nummulites; and in com
paring all the stratigraphical and palaeontological results, it is im
possible not to recognize therein two distinct epochs superposed the
one to the other, and having each its proper fauna.       One of these
epochs, which l have recognized in the French Alps, the Pyrenees
and the Gironde, corresponds to the plastic clay of Paris and Lon
don, and, which, belonging to the lower sands of Soissons, I have
named 'Etage Suessonien’; the other, equally common in the Alps
and the basins of the Gironde, and which includes the ‘Calcaire
Grossier' of Paris up to the gypsum of Montmartre and the London
clay, &c., I designate “Etage Parisien.” These divisions, based upon
a considerable number of facts, are detailed in the work I am now
printing, and the entire composition of their characteristic faunas is
given in my ‘Prodromus of Universal Palaeontology.’        The habit        I
have acquired of determining these fossils makes me regret that I
cannot go to inspect your collections in London; but the portions
of them I have seen in the hands of our friend M. de Verneuil has
led me to recognize at once what I was already acquainted with in
the Pyrenees and the French Alps. Again, the fossils I have exa
mined in the collection of M. Tchichatcheff, confirm me in my opi
nion, and would lead me to extend the limits of these tertiary stages,
as you have suggested, through Asia Minor and other tracts even to
Hindostan.”
      may be added, that in citing the able memoir of M. Coquand”,
     It
Sir Roderick   has expressed his opinion, that the data, though con
strued differently by that author, may be so interpreted as to lead to
the conclusion that the mass of the rocks containing nummulites in
the Barbary states and the shores of the Mediterranean are, like
those of the Alps and Apennines, supra-cretaceous; his own limited
observations in the Neapolitan territories being confirmed by the
local knowledge of Professor Savi. Similar conclusions are, he thinks,
inevitable respecting the nummulitic rocks of Egypt, on the part of
any one who has read Russegger's work on that country.         At the
same time, though well-assured of his own facts, he would not con
          º
tend against the possible existence in certain southern regions, not
examined by him, of some one species of nummulite in strata of the
age of the uppermost chalk, as insisted upon for the Crimaea by M.
Dubois de Montpereux, and for Cape Passaro in Sicily by M. Con
stant Prevost. All that he contends for is that the great nummulitic
group, as characterized by a multitude of species of shells, Echino

derms, nummulites, &c., is a formation superior to and distinct from
the chalk; and if there be situations (which however he has never
seen) in which a species of nummulite be common to the uppermost
chalk and lowermost tertiary, they would only the more confirm his
view of transition from the one epoch to the other in some regions
of the surface of the globe. In the memoir about to be published,
the author will give the result of the comparison of the species of the
nummulites, whether collected in the Alps or Hindostan, with those
of the south of France by M. le Vicomte d'Archiac, who has obli

                                                     F. W. Herschel, Bart.)
on presenting the Honorary Medal of the Society to William Lassell,
Esq., of Liverpool.
   Gentlemen,-The Report of the Council having been read, in
which the astronomical discoveries of the year, and especially that
of the planet Metis, have been clearly and eloquently commemo
rated, it is now my pleasing duty to state to you the grounds on
which it has been agreed by us to award the gold medal of the So
ciety for this year to Mr. Lassell. And this duty, pleasing in itself,
I execute with the greater satisfaction, because I have a sort of he
reditary fellow-feeling with Mr. Lassell, seeing that he belongs to
that class of observers who have created their own instrumental
means—who have felt their own wants, and supplied them in their
own way.            I
                  believe that this greatly enhances the pleasure of
observing, especially when accompanied by discovery, and gives a
double interest in the observer's eyes, and perhaps, too, in some
 degree, an increased one in those of the public, to every accession
 to the stock of our knowledge which his instruments have been the
 means of revealing: upon the same principle that the fruit which a
 man grows in his own garden, cultivated with his own hands, is en
joyed with a far higher zest than what he purchases in the market.
 Nor is this feeling by any means a selfish one.          It arises from the
 natural and healthy excitement of successful exertion, and is part of
 that happy system of compensation by which Providence sweetens
 effort, and honours well-directed labour.                    If
                                                        this be true of the
 labour of a man's hands in the mere production of material and
 perishable objects, it is so in a far superior sense, when the faculties
 of the intellect are called into exercise, and works elaborated with
 rare skill, and wrought to an extraordinary pitch of perfection, have
 yet a higher, ulterior, intellectual object, to which their existence is
 subordinate, as means to an end.
    Mr. Lassell has long been advantageously known to us as an
 ardent lover of astronomy, and as a diligent and exact observer, in
 which capacity he has appeared before us, as a reference to our
 Memoirs and Notices will testify, on numerous other occasions
 besides those to which I shall more particularly call your attention
 presently.    In the year 1840 he erected an observatory at his
 residence near Liverpool, bearing the appropriate name of Starfield,
 which has ever since been the scene of his astronomical labours.
 Even at      its
                first erection this observatory presented features        of
 novelty and interest.      In
                             addition       good transit,

step, and forms an epoch in the history of the astronomical use of
the reflecting telescope. Those only who have had experience of
the annoyance of having to keep an object long in view, especially
under high magnifying powers, and in micrometrical measurements,
with a reflector mounted in the usual manner, having merely an alti
tude and azimuth motion, can duly feel and appreciate the advantage
thus gained. But the difficulties to be surmounted in the execution
of such a mode of mounting were very considerable—much more so
than in the case of an achromatic,+owing partly to the non-coin
cidence of the centre of gravity of the telescope and mirror with the
middle of the length of the tube, and partly to the necessity of
supporting the mirror itself within the tube in a uniform bearing
free from lateral constraint, and guaranteed against flexure and
disturbance of      adjustment by alteration
                         its                         bearings.      These      of   its

   The mode of casting and grinding the mirror, differing in some
of the details, though proceeding generally on the same principle as
Lord Rosse's (i.e. by a chilled casting), has been described in a
communication read to this Society on the 8th of December last.
The polishing was performed on              a machine almost precisely similar
to that    of    his lordship.     But finding after many months' trial that
he could not succeed in obtaining a satisfactory figure, he was led to
contrive a machine for imitating as closely as possible those evolu
tions of the hand by which he had been accustomed to produce per
fect surfaces on smaller specula.             This machine has been described

      It   is right that              I   should now say something                                of the performance
of    the nine-inch and two-feet reflectors.                                                And first,         as regards the
success         of    the system          of mounting adopted in securing the peculiar
advantages of the                     equatorial movement. This appears to have been
very complete. The measurements, both differential and micro
metrical, made with them, and recorded in our Notices, show that
in this respect they may be considered on a par with re<U+017F>ractors, and
in facility of setting and handling they appear nowise inferior.                     Of
the optical power of the former, two facts will enable the meeting
to form a sufficient judgement.               With this instrument Mr. Lassell,
independently and without previous knowledge of                        existence, de                     its

  228            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
  have existed respecting the competency of fused nitre to explode with
  water, or with aqueous, hydrogenous, and carbonaceous combustibles.
  This subject was treated of in reference to a series of detonations ter
 minating in an explosion of tremendous force, by which, in July 1845,
  the intensely ignited contents of a store in Broad Street, New York,
 were thrown over an extensive district, involving the destruction of
 about 200 houses and property estimated at two millions of dollars.
 As far as the oaths of highly competent witnesses could avail, no
 gunpowder was present, so that the result could only be attributed
 to the reaction between an enormous quantity of nitre and combus
 tible merchandize with which the store was promiscuously occupied.
 In all there were 300,000 lbs. of nitre in parcels of 180 lbs, (each
 secured by two bags, an additional bag having been put over that
 originally employed). About 30,000 lbs. was situated upon the first
 floor, l 80,000 on the second floor, and 80,000 on the third floor.
     Of the merchandize, the aggregate was more than double the
weight of the nitre.
     It was however the general opinion of those best acquainted with
 the subject, that when ignited with combustibles, nitre produces only
 that species of combustion which is called deflagration by chemists,
 without being capable of the more violent and instantaneous reaction
designated by the word explosion. This impression was strengthened
 by the failure of every effort (made by several eminent chemists em
ployed by the Corporation of New York) to explode nitre by ignition
with combustibles.                                      -
     Nevertheless, agreeably to Hays, of Massachusetts, an explosion
 was effected in his laboratory, by bringing water into contact with
 about 100 lbs. of incandescent nitre; also the accidental falling of a
jet of melted nitre on some water in the laboratory of the University
 of Pennsylvania had been productive of a similar result.
    The explosion of a vessel laden with nitre, which, while lying in
 Boston harbour, was burnt to the water's edge, and of others simi
larly laden and burnt, could only be explained by supposing that
 nitre, when sufficiently heated, will explode with water on due con
 tact.    Consistently, it might be inferred that this salt (well-known
 to be a compound of nitric acid and oxide of potassium or potash)
 would explode with any substance capable of yielding either or both
 of the elements of water or hydrogen. The presence of the latter
 would be equivalent to water, since it would, with the oxygen of the
 acid, form water.
     In a letter addressed to the distinguished chemist above-mentioned,
 in July 1845, Dr. Hare had adverted to the explosion which succeeds
 the combustion of potassium upon water, as arising from the combi
 nation of one portion of the water with the resulting incandescent
  globule of oxide, while the heat of this globule uniting with another
  portion of the liquid, converts it into high steam.     Moreover, it was
  suggested that in this instance chemical affinity between the water
  and the oxide, in causing the water and heated globule to coalesce,
  is equivalent in efficacy to the momentum of the hammer when a bar
  of iron, at a welding heat, is forced into contact with some moisture
  situated upon an anvil.

   Dr. Hare presumes that no explosion can take place unless the re
agents for producing it are held or brought together at the moment
of reaction, by a certain force, either chemical or mechanical.
   Some chemical compounds, such as are formed with fulminic acid
or with ammonia, by metallic oxides; also the chloride of nitrogen
and perchloric aether, explode violently without confinement, so as
 to fracture a plate or saucer, upon which a small quantity may be
 detonated; but pulverulent mixtures, such as gunpowder, however
powerfully explosive when employed in gunnery or rock-blasting, in
 open vessels flash without fracturing them, or producing any report.
 In an exhausted receiver gunpowder is far less explosive than when
subjected to atmospheric pressure in an open vessel.                  Nevertheless,
when gunpowder is restrained until the temperature requisite for the
appropriate reaction of its ingredients is attained, it exerts a force
far exceeding that which the chamber confining it is capable of re
sisting.     In this respect it differs from steam, of which, when the
temperature of the fire applied is sufficiently high, the explosive force
is directly as the pressure immediately before bursting, and this of
course is commensurate with the strength of the confining boiler.
    The ingredients of gunpowder, sulphur, charcoal and nitre, to pro
duce the greatest effect, require extreme comminution and intimate
intermixture by trituration, and to be so granulated that the flame of
the portion first ignited may convey inflammation to the rest through
the interstices between the grains.             Its superiority over any other
mixture of nitre with combustible matter destitute of sulphur, is con
ceived to be due not only to the pre-eminent susceptibility of this
substance, of vaporization and inflammation, but likewise to                   well             its
known ability       to decompose metallic oxides                    by
                                                              attracting both the
metal and oxygen.          Since        an

enough for the charge of a musket, within an exhausted receiver, to
a wire intensely ignited by a galvanic discharge.               The grains did
not take fire     instantly,   probably   because the     vapour   evolved pre
vented actual    contact;    and when   ignition  did  ensue,  it extended only
to the   production     of a feeble flash. On      examination,    it was found
that a portion of the powder had escaped inflammation.
    In the next place, a like weight of gunpowder was consolidated
into a cylinder by intense pressure. Thus prepared and ignited, by
contact with an incandescent wire in the exhausted receiver, more
than half of the cylinder remained unconsumed.
    A much larger cylinder of the same mixture, similarly consolidated,
placed at the bottom of an iron pot, four inches in diameter and
twelve inches in depth, on being touched by the end of an iron rod
reddened in the fire, burnt at first like a squib, but towards the last
was dissipated with an activity in some degree explosive, probably
in consequence of the pressure created by the reaction of the gaseous
current generated by its own deflagration.
    The want of confinement, which is thus capable of lessening the
explosiveness of gunpowder, of which the constituents are intimately
intermingled, is still more enfeebling, where analogous reagents are
ignited together without admixture or comminution.                  Under these
circumstances, the reagents are made to recede from each other by
the generation of that vapour or gas, to the evolution of which, under
 confinement, the capability of exploding is due. Thus sundered, they
 are chilled by radiation, so that the temperature requisite to sustain
 and communicate ignition is not supported.              Moreover, the rapidity
 of reaction being as the multiplication of the points of contact, and
 these being fewer as the substances are less divided and intermingled,
 the deflagration takes place in detail, instead of having that simul
 taneousness which is indispensable to render it explosive.
    In addition to the ideas above-mentioned as having been conveyed
 in Dr. Hare's letter to Hays, it was urged also that his inference as
 to the explosion of water with incandescent nitre being attributable to
 a reaction analogous to that represented as taking place when potas
 sium is burnt with the oxide of hydrogen, was supported by the fact,
 that at a white heat the base of nitre spontaneously abandons              acid,   its
while from water cannot  it         separated by any temperature. Conse

   The explosibility of incandescent nitre with water was illustrated
in the small way, by heating a portion in a platina capsule by the
flame of a hydro-oxygen blowpipe, and sudden immersion in the
liquid. So active was the explosion, that a portion of the resulting
hydrate flew out upon the operator.    Yet, when thrown in the same
state upon molasses or sugar, no explosion ensued: nevertheless,
when a capsule containing nitre heated to the point of volatilization
was struck with the face of a hammer coated with sugar melted upon
it and made to adhere by moisture, a detonation took place. A still
more powerful detonation was produced as follows:—Upon an anvil
a disc of paper of three inches in diameter was laid, covered with
pulverized sugar: over the sugar was placed another similar disc,
covered with pulverized nitre: a bar of iron rather wider than the
discs at a welding heat was then held over them, and subjected to a
blow from a sledge.          An explosion, with a report like that of a
cannon, ensued.
   Instructed by the facts and considerations above stated, it is inferred
that the explosions which contributed to extend the conflagration in
New York, as above mentioned, arose from the reaction of the nitre
with the combustible merchandize with which it was surrounded. It
is presumed that as soon as the fire reached any of the gunny bags it
must have run rapidly through the whole pile, by means of the inter
stices necessarily existing between them, the nitre with which they
 were imbued causing them to deflagrate.              Much of the salt being
thus   brought    to the   temperature   of  fusion, it must have run about
 the floor, reached the combustibles, and soon found                way        its
                                                                             the           to

                                            the consequent deflagration, far
 exceeding   in  activity any ordinary combustion. Meanwhile, the nitre

iodide of lead the nitrate ought to be preferred to the acetate, on
account of the greater quantity of product which it yields.
   The process by iodide of calcium is the most advantageous both
as to the quality and quantity of the product.
   The two processes by iodide of iron and iodide of zinc yielding
equally fine and abundant products, it is nearly indifferent which
is employed.
   The process by iodide of sodium offers no advantage, and that by
iodide of potassium is the least economical.
   There is a loss of nearly 10 per cent. in preparing iodide of lead
on using iodide of potassium and acetate of lead; the greater part
of which loss may, however, be avoided by substituting the nitrate,
or by adding to the supernatant liquor a sufficient quantity of nitric
acid to decompose the acetate of potash.-Journ. de Pharm. et de

          ON   THE PROTOGINE OF THE ALPS.                              BY M. DELESSE.
  . The author observes that protogine usually contains five different
 minerals, which are, quartz, orthose, oligoclase, mica with a base of
 iron, and a variety of talc : these may be seen in the protogine of
  Mont Blanc. These minerals are not however equally distributed,
 and one or more of them are frequently wanting ; but then the
 minerals which remain have so preserved the same characters as
 those which they possessed when the five elements are present in
 the rock, that it is impossible not to consider them as formed under
 the same circumstances; they constitute therefore varieties of the
 original rock, into which they pass insensibly, both by their mine
 ralogical characters and their geological relations.
     Quartz.-Quartz forms one of the important elements of proto
 gine as of      all
                  granitic rocks.    When the rock has         well-character a

Warmbrum in Silesia, analysed by M.M. G. Rose and Rammels
berg.
     Mica.-M.          Beudant has already observed that protogine contains
mica: it is of a more or less deep green colour, and has little or no
lustre; by calcination in an open crucible it becomes of a reddish
bronze colour, with brilliant reflexions; in a close crucible it becomes
blackish green.      When it is in very thin laminae the action of the
air is sufficient to give it a bronze colour, which is a character that
may serve to recognize           Its density

the substance and the brown colour which it acquires by calcination
indicate that it is richer in iron than is the case with talc.
   Independently of the minerals which have been described, proto
gine, as observed by M.M. Dufrenoy and E. de Beaumont, may
accidentally contain hornblende, sphène, iron pyrites, garnets and
serpentine.
   Some veins contain fluor spar, oligiste iron and sulphuret of
molybdenum, &c. In l'Oisan there are albite, rutile, anatase, brookite,
&c.; lastly, there are found in veins which appear to be contem
poraneous with the rock, and usually formed of quartz, epidote
 and the variety of chlorite, to which M. G. Rose has given the
 name of ripidolite; it is also found in the paste of protogine.—Ann.

hydrate of lead. The colouring matters form with this oxide in
soluble compounds of a reddish brown colour.       The deposit is to
be separated, washed, and decomposed with dilute sulphuric acid
and heat. The colouring matters, which are slightly soluble in
water, separate with the sulphate of lead. The precipitate is to be
boiled in alcohol, which dissolves the greater part of the colouring
matters. They may be separated into two groups by agitating the
 alcoholic solution with calcined oxide of zinc.     Some of them pre
 cipitate in combination with the oxide of zinc, while others remain
 in solution.
     The author has hitherto examined only the first group, that is to
 say, the colouring matters combined with the oxide of zinc. They
 are purified by decomposing them with weak sulphuric acid, and
 dissolving the precipitated colouring matter in aether; the solution
 obtained is again heated with oxide of zinc.     The zinc compound,
 heated with dilute sulphuric acid, leaves as a residue a mixture of
 two colouring matters, both soluble in a boiling solution of alum,
 one of which precipitates on cooling and the other remains in solu
 tion ; the first constitutes what the author calls lizaric acid; this
 substance is obtained in a state of purity by boiling it with a little
dilute hydrochloric acid, to free it from the alumina which it retains,
and by repeated solution in boiling alcohol.
    The second colouring matter, which remains in solution in the
aluminous liquors, may be precipitated by sulphuric acid.          The
separation is not completed in less than twenty-four hours; the pre
cipitate, exhausted by hot dilute hydrochloric acid, which removes
a little alumina, is afterwards dissolved in 150 to 200 times its
weight of boiling alcohol.     In two or three hours long red needles
separate, which constitute what M. Debus calls alizaric acid.

pitate is obtained, consisting of small and nearly colourless needles.
    In operating on dilute solutions deprived of free acid, crystals of
two to three centimetres in length and of a very bright yellow colour
are obtained; they are four-sided prisms, terminated by dihedral
summits: these crystals are ferrocyanuret of strychnia, represented
by the formula 2(Str, H Cy)+Fe Cy--8HO. At 212° the salt loses
6.1 per cent., or six equivalents of water.     If it be dissolved in hot
 water, or if the cold saturated solution be boiled, crystals of strych
 nia separate, and the liquor, which is of a deep yellow colour, holds
 ferrocyanide of strychnia in solution,
                    3(Str, HCy,)+Few Cy3+ 12HO.
   This salt, which forms crystals of a golden-yellow colour, corre
sponds to the red prussiate of potash, and may also be obtained by
mixing the cold saturated solutions of sulphate of strychnia and red
ferrocyanide of potassium: according to the author, this salt loses
three equivalents of water in a dry vacuum, six equivalents at 212°,
and eight equivalents at 277°F.     Above this temperature it decom
poses. When an alcoholic solution of strychnia is mixed with a
solution of hydroferrocyanic acid in alcohol, a white amorphous pre
 cipitate is obtained. This is nearly insoluble in water or alcohol,
 and has a distinct acid reaction. M. Brandes assigns to it the for
 mula (Str, 2ACy--2Fe Cy)+5HO. He considers it as an acid ana
 logous to the hydroferrocyanic, and expresses  constitution    fol    it its
                                                                                  as

in preparing salts directly with this acid.
   The ferrocyanurets of brucia are prepared by processes analo
gous to those above described; they resemble, both in their pro
perties and composition, the corresponding salts of strychnia.-Ibid.

XXXIII.         On the Eristence and Effects of Allotropism in the
     constituent elements of Living Beings.   By John WILLIAM
     DRAPER, M.D., Professor of Chemistry in the University of
     New York +.
IT mentary
   has      completely established for the majority of ele
            been
           substances, that there are several forms under
which each may occur; forms which differ entirely both in
their physical and chemical relations.
  Thus, in the case of carbon, many such forms are known.
To three of them M. Berzelius has directed attention:—1st,
ordinary charcoal; 2nd, plumbago; 3rd, diamond.      They
are three distinct modifications of the same element. They
differ in specific gravity, in specific heat, and in conducting
power, both for electricity and caloric.       In their relations
to light, the first perfectly absorbs it and is black; the
second reflects it like a metal; the third is transparent like
glass. When crystallized, plumbago and diamond do not
belong to the same system: their chemical relations are also
strikingly different. Charcoal takes fire with facility, and
some varieties of it are even spontaneously combustible in the
air; but crucibles and furnaces are made of plumbago because
of   itsincombustibility; and the diamond with difficulty      set      is
on  fire    pure
           in     oxygen  gas.
  It   seems immaterial     what class elementary bodies belong,
                                 to
whether electro-negative        positive: they present analogous
                                      or
results.    Silicon, sulphur,  selenium,   phosphorus, titanium,
chromium, uranium, tin, iridium, osmium, copper, nickel,
cobalt, iron, oxygen, chlorine, are cases         point; and the
                                                              in
instances which    appear     exceptions
                                    as    are rapidly diminishing
in  number.

   Asis well known, to these singular modifications M. Berzelius
gave the designation of allotropic forms, and the whole phaeno
menon passes conveniently under the designation of allotropism.
He shows that the peculiarity assumed is often of such a per
sistent nature that it is not lost, even though the substance
affected should go into combination with others. Thus there
are two forms of silicon; one combustible, and the other re
markably incombustible. Each, by uniting with oxygen, gives
rise to a silicic acid; the acid in one case being soluble in water
and in hydrochloric acid, and in the other the reverse. And in
like manner, metallic arsenic, which exhibits the same duality
of condition, gives rise to two different arsenious acids. Of
phosphorus there are at least two modifications; and accord
ingly we have two compounds of that body with hydrogen,
one of which is spontaneously inflammable, and the other not;
and at least two oxygen acids, the monobasic and tribasic, in
which the essential difference rests in the state of the phos
phorus they contain.
   It is to be remarked, that, so far as observation extends, the
most common cause of producing these singular differences is
the action of that class of agents which we term imponderable
substances. In very many cases change of temperature brings
about allotropic change; in others it is the agency of light, as
in chlorine and phosphorus; and again, in others, association
with foreign bodies, which apparently establish new voltaic
relations.     Heat, light and electricity seem to be the general
modifying agents.
   Mi. Berzelius, following the suggestion of M. Frankenheim,
proposes a nomenclature for pointing out the peculiar form
referred to in any special case.       It depends on the use of
Greek letters.  Thus we have the three forms of carbon just
alluded to, designated on these principles by Co., C3, Cy.
But in a paper which I published in this Journal on the allo
tropism of chlorine (Nov. 1845, p. 327), it is remarked that
we may often with greater convenience use the simple expres
sions “active" and “passive.” Thus active chlorine is that
which will decompose water in the dark, passive chlorine fail
ing to do so. In this paper the same expressions will be em
ployed.
     itherto allotropism has only been considered as affecting
inorganic states of matter, but      itsinfluence can   be plainly

   In the Philosophical Magazine (March 1846, p. 178) there
is a paper by me explanatory of the causes of the circulation
of the blood in the capillary vessels. It is merely an abridge
ment of a lecture which for eight years past has been delivered
in this university. The doctrine there set forth has been ge
nerally received in America, and introduced into some of the
standard works on physiology published in England. The
principle on which it essentially depends, and which has been
abundantly confirmed by direct experiment, is briefly this—
that if there be two fluids occupying a capillary tube, or a
porous structure of any kind, under the condition that one of
them has a stronger chemical affinity for the substance of that
tube or structure than the other, a movement of the liquids
will at once ensue, that which has the stronger affinity driving
the other before          On this principle clear account

 thus can sometimes declare the very mode by which the alchy
 mist was led to his golden error, and the Chaldaean shepherds
 to brighter truths.       Without this principle of interpretation,
 many almost modern writers, may authors of this very century,
 can sometimes not be understood.              The laws of modern geo
 logy and zoology, for such there are, and well-founded too,
 are as much required to put a true construction on some of
 the writings of Lister and Linnaeus, as the methods of Ray,
 Linnaeus, and Cuvier are required for the just estimation of
 Aristotle. We shall probably find the darkest pages of an
 tiquity to be precisely those which refer to subjects where our
own knowledge is least clear, least collected into laws of phae
nomena, and most removed from laws of causation. Ought
we not, before declaiming on the ignorance of the ancients, to
be careful to make allowance for the differences of form in
which knowledge presents itself at different periods, as well
as for the incompleteness of their records, and the imperfection
of our interpretations?
    Pliny’s Natural History appears to me to be precisely in
the position of difficulty which has been already alluded                                               to.

 (cap. 18.) . We need not ask what is plumbum nigrum, for

    That kao attepos or kattitepos was tin, appears to be ge
 nerally allowed.     The mineralogist and miner who know the
 mode of occurrence and character of tin ore, will have no
 doubt that plumbum album of Pliny is tin, and that author
twice positively and expressly identifies this with kaaaitepos.
    The uses to which Homer puts kaalaitepos in the thoraca
and shields of Agamemnon, Achilles, and Asteropaeus, and in
the greaves of Achilles, are such as imply easy fusibility and
ductility, and indicate that the metal was highly valued and
almost precious *.
    Virgil puts no tin into the arms of AEneas—perhaps the

 252          Mr.       J.   Phillips on Ancient Metallurgy and Mining
      Upon the whole, the case is probably thus.   It is the old
 Phoenician trade, destroyed with Carthage, which Strabo de
 scribes, and Pub. Crassus went to explore in the cago wrépubes.
 Diodorus Siculus narrates the course of trade in the days of
 Augustus from Ictis, when Gaul offered an easy route to the
 Mediterranean; but 100 years of war and commotion inter
 rupted this trade of Cornwall with the East, and Pliny was
 suspicious of the fables of Greece, and knew that tin was
 obtained in Spain.   Notwithstanding this fact, it appears that
  Cornwall and the Asiatic Isles have been the principal, almost
  the only sources of the tin of the ancient world, that of Zinn
  wald being quite unknown till a much later date.
     Stannum is evidently an alloy of an argentine or tin-like
 aspect—a variable pewter—a metal more easily melted than
  copper, for the lining of which it was much used in Pliny’s
  days to obviate the danger of cupreous solutions.                 This pro
 cess we now call tinning; and stannum *, with                         variable          its
 meanings,       perhaps the common parent                 the French étain,of
                    as is
  meaning        often   pewter        tin;   and   as                 of

 for  pewter, when    lining  vessels,   and solder when covering sur
 faces which are            joined.

the subsequent melting with charcoal, or a flux, be facilitated.
Indeed without roasting, and without flux in many cases, the
lead will flow out of the ore, if placed among flaming wood or                                       /.
                                                                                                     *
peat, and subjected to a sufficient stream of air.
   But the use of fluxes could not long remain unknown in the
limestone districts of Northumbria, or amid the fluoric veins
of Derbyshire—limestone and fluor being to this day valuable
aids in the furnace.   Peat was the fuel in Cornwall, and still
is in   Yorkshire; and perhaps   the Roman smelters did really
erect their furnaces on waste ground and heaths at Dacre and
 Matlock, far from the mines of Greenhow and Youlgreave,
even as is done at present with the cupolas of Lee and Langley
 mills.
   The use of crucibles (xãavov), bellows, cavities of some pe
culiar sort (káuvvot), perhaps chimneys, great variety of car
bonaceous fuel, the power of purifying and alloying, and
knowledge of the properties of alloys, appear quite conspicu
ous among the ancient arts.
   The inscriptions * on these masses of lead are in the same
general form as the “marks’ of the different mines now in
 work, and which, no doubt, are their literal and lineal descend
ants. Thus the Ald or Auld Gang mine of Swaledale, old in
the days of the Saxons; the mines of Greenhow Hill, which

258         Mr.  J.  Phillips on Ancient Metallurgy and Mining
supplied sheet and pipe lead for our baths and coffins at York,
as well as tribute to the imperial treasury; the mines of Mid
dleton and Youlgreave (Aldgroove), from which the Lutudae
sent not only lead, but ‘exargentate’ (that is to say refined)
lead from which the silver had been removed, use to this day
the pig of the same weight of 13 cwt., of similar shape and
similar mark to that of 1800 years antiquity +.               And just as
at the   present    day,  the  countryman       whose   galloway    is tired
drops the leaden load by the way side, for another day's work,
so in the days of Rome, the Brigantian lead was thrown down
from the tired caballus by the side of the ancient mining road,
on Matlock Moor in Derbyshire, and Dacre Pasture in York
shire.
    This fact of the discovery of the Roman lead, not at the
mines, but at a distance of some miles from them on a track
leading towards a Roman or rather a Pre-Roman station, is of
much importance in archaeology.              For thus we arrive, in the
first  place,  at the conviction of the existence of very ancient
mining roads not of Roman work, nor probably of Roman
but of earlier date, leading toward Cataractonium, Isurium,
Eburacum, Mancunium, Derventio, or rather to the Brigan
tian towns or centres of trade, on which the Romans following
their wont in Africa, Spain, and Gaul, fixed their attention
and established their war camps and their colonies. ' The
politic lords of the world broke up no national industry, set
no legionaries to supplant the native miners, but stationing a
few cohorts on the ancient roads, in or close to the mining
district, as at Hope and Bainbridge, to control a rude popu
lation, received regularly the fruits of the industry which they
might direct, but did not personally share. Viewed in this
light, how complete appears the grasp of the Roman treasury
on the mining fields of Britain                The Fossway from the
Ocrynian promontory crosses the Mendip Hills—the road
from Mancunium to Bremetonacum traverses the Calamine
district of Bowland—the road from Derventio or Tutbury to
                                               .*.
Mancunium runs along the west of the great Derbyshire field,
and the legionary path from Carlisle
the metalliferous country of Yorkshire and Durham.

    We may even ask, with some confidence, whether the line
of the Hadrian wall, which cuts off from the north all the
richest mines of the Derwent, the Allen, and the Tyne, but
abandons the mossy dales of bleak Northumbria, was not

               Mr. Wheatstonet states that when two visual
fields, or the corresponding elements of the two retinae, simul
taneously receive impressions from rays of different refrangi
bility, no perception of mixed colours is produced.                 The as
sertion of this able philosopher being opposed to the opinion
 of the majority of those who have attended to the same sub
ject, we have thought it useful to repeat, modify, and extend
 these experiments.         The stereoscope of Mr. Wheatstone

THE
  the       Registrar-General were from about thirty different
stations, situated between the latitudes of 51%" and 55°, and
between the longitudes of 5}* W. and I }* E. of Greenwich.
The elevations of the different places varied from 30 feet to
350 feet above the level of the sea.
   The monthly returns in each quarter were published in
their respective quarterly reports, but only the monthly values
corresponding to the times of the observations, and not
those showing the mean values for the month; these were
reduced to mean values for the formation of the quarterly
tables; but the corrections used in their reduction were those
deduced from three years’ observations only; since that time
I  have formed tables from the five years' Greenwich observa
tions ending December 31, 1845+, and have reduced the ob
servations again by these values.         The true monthly values
thus found will probably appear in a future Annual Report of
the Registrar-General.
    On discussing the true monthly values, it was found that
the temperature of the                   air
                               decreased from the month     January                   of

         at                                                                                     of

perature of the air increasing, and those from August to
January or February by a decreasing or stationary tempera
 ture. The places situated in the counties of Cornwall and
 Devonshire were less humid than elsewhere; for notwith
 standing the greater amount of vapour contained in the same

evaporation was 27-7, and above that of the dew-point was
6°9, at places situated inland.
   The highest readings of thermometer occurred at Uckfield,
 Helston, Beckington, Lewisham and Walworth respectively.
   The mean yearly range of temperature in the counties of
Cornwall and Devonshire was 56°6, at places in the vicinity
of the sea was 52°3, and in latitude 51°30' was 78°.0. This
value diminished by about 5° for an increase of 1° in latitude.

   The places of least yearly range were Truro, Liverpool,
Brighton, Torquay and Whitehaven.

  It   is desirable to compare the results deduced by means of
the preceding formulae with the observed results, not only
for the purpose of testifying their accuracy, but also to examine
the accuracy of the several instruments which have been used
at the different stations.
    The annexed table shows the results of this comparison.
    In viewing the differences shown in the fourth and tenth co
lumns between the observed and calculated pressures, it is evi
dent that at most places the instruments are good. When we
view the differences which some of the places present, we shall
readily see that the instruments at those places need correction.
 The barometer at Exeter seems to read too low by 0-103 inch;
that at Uckfield to read too high by 0-131 inch; and that at
 Derby to read too low by 0:193 inch. These corrections
 should be applied to the readings of these instruments              the                  till

    Again : if a pair of conjugate roots of a biquadratic equa

  express the fact that the roots of every equation of an even

  a truth which, however obvious from the theory of common
  quadratic equations, has never, I believe, been turned to any
  account elsewhere.        The conjugate factors here referred to
  express obvious identities: they do not presuppose the solution
  of a quadratic, but actually supply that solution, by aid of the
  fundamental property that the coefficient of the second term is
  the sum of the roots with changed signs, and the third term
  the product.

 XL.     On the Theoretical Value of the Velocity of Sound, in
     reply toMr. Stokes. By the Rev. J. CHALL1s, M.A., F.R.S.,
     F.R.A.S., Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental
     Philosophy in the University of Cambridge*.
 THE  velocity of propagation of waves in an elastic medium
   so constituted that the pressure varies in the same pro
 portion as the density, is usually deduced from the hydrody
 namical equations by assuming, either that the motion of the
 vibrating particles is a function of the distance from a fixed
 plane, or that it is a function of the distance from a fixed
 centre.   On the former assumption, an exact integral, appli
  cable to propagation in a single direction, may be obtained,
  which conducts to the inference that a point of maximum ve
  locity of a given wave travels at a rate different from that of
  a point of no velocity, so that, however large the maximum
  velocity may be, one of these points may overtake the other,
  without any indication on the part of the analysis of the phy
  sical impossibility of such an occurrence.          The inevitable con
  clusion from this result                    is,
                                    that the integral admits         inter                      of   no
  pretation compatible with fluid motion, and that the assumption
    ofplane-waves        inadmissible.

  Therefore the waves cannot be supposed to be spherical.
  That there may be no excuse for misapprehension as to the
result attributed to the analysis in the second member of the
syllogism,             I    proceed to exemplºy that result by a numerical
instance.   The pressure being a”(1 +s), the value of the con
densation s at any distance r from the centre, and at any time
t, is admitted to be given by the equation

tradictions resulting from the suppositions of plane-waves and
spherical waves, of the utmost importance in hydrodynamics,

 of sound cannot be deduced from those suppositions. By
another supposition which conducted to ray-vibrations,        ob                I
tained in the Philosophical Magazine for February a value of
 the velocity of sound very nearly agreeing with observation,

XLI.  On the Diurnal Pariations of the Magnet Needle, and
  on Aurorae Boreales.    By AUGUSTE DE LA RIVE, being an
  Ertract from a Letter to M. Arago".
       LLOW   me to communicate to you, with the request that
      you will make it known to the Académie des Sciences,
an extract of a memoir recently read before our Société de
Physique et d’Histoire Naturelle, on the cause of the diurnal
variations of the magnet needle and of aurorae boreales.   In
assigning successfully these two classes of phaenomena to the
same  origin, I have but followed the path you have pointed
out; for more than thirty years ago you established with in
defatigable perseverance, by your numerous observations, the
remarkable agreement which prevails between the appear
ances of the aurora borealis and the disturbance of the mag
net needle.                     -
   The following is my theory. You will observe that it rests
solely upon well-ascertained facts and on principles of physics
positively established.
   I had already, in 1836, in a notice upon hailt, attempted
to show that the atmospheric electricity owes      origin   the   its           to

of the two electricities, which tend to unite.                               Sometimes the
 winds, by mixing the air in contact with the surface of the
earth, and like it negative, with the positive air of the more
elevated regions, give rise to sheet-lightning, or to storms,
when there is at the same time a formation of clouds and con
densation of aqueous vapours, owing to the humidity and dif
ferent temperature of the strata of air which become mixed.
The attraction of clouds by mountains, the luminous phaeno
mena exhibited at the extremity of elevated points, are like
wise due to the same cause.            But I will not stop to discuss

 merous and the more concentrated the nearer we approach
 the pole; and        as
                      they      proceedall      the same direction, that

mosphere and from north to south on the surface of the earth,
their effect will become the more perceptible in proportion as
we leave the equator and approach the pole. But as the cur
rents produced by the equatorial strata are individually stronger
than those proceeding from more northerly strata, the dif
ference, although real, will notwithstanding be less than
would be believed. What passes in our northern hemisphere
must occur in exactly the same manner in the southern hemi
sphere; the currents proceed equally from the equator to the
pole in the upper regions of the air, and from the pole to the
equator on the surface of the earth; consequently, for an ob
server travelling from the north pole to the south, the current
would proceed in the same direction from the northern pole
to the equator, and in a contrary direction from the equator
to the southern pole: I speak here of the current circulating
on the surface of the earth.                      I
                                   ought moreover to observe,
that the limit which separates the regions occupied by each of
these two great currents is not the equator properly so called,
for it must be variable; it    according    my theory, the pa
                                           is,                    to
rallel between the tropics which has the sun         zenith;            at       its              it
changes consequently each day.
     Now    it    easy
                 is           to
                         conceive the cause    the diurnal varia  of

northern    pole     the equator ought
                        to                   cause the north pole

our hemisphere; and the current which proceeds from the
southern pole         the equator should cause the north pole
                         to                                                                       of

the difference       temperature, and consequently

  It   is now well        proved    that the aurora borealis                 atmo                is   an
spheric phaenomenon,                 you long ago suspected. The name

his Cosmos, implies the same idea, which is moreover con
firmed by the interesting details which he gives of this meteor.
The observations of Parry, Franklin, and especially those of
M.M. Bravais and Lottin, so numerous and carefully made,
are likewise quite favourable to this opinion, which followed
equally from the observations of M. Biot at the Shetland
Isles.
   Admitting this point, I explain the production of the aurora
borealis in the following manner:—When the sun, having
passed into the southern hemisphere, no longer heats so much
our hemisphere, the aqueous vapours which have accumulated
during the summer in this part of the atmosphere begin to
condense, the kind of humid cap enveloping the polar regions
extends more and more, and facilitates the passage of the
electricity accumulated in the upper portions of the air. But
in these elevated regions, and especially at this period of the
year, the aqueous vapours must most frequently pass into the
state of minute particles of ice or snow floating in the air,
similar to those which give rise to the halos ; they form, as it
were, a kind of semitransparent mist. Now these half-frozen
fogs conduct the electricity to the surface of the earth near
the pole, and are at the same time illumined by these currents
or electric discharges. In fact,                     all
                                         observers agree      asserting                in
that the aurora borealis          constantlyis  preceded          mist               by     a
which rises from the pole, and the margins                which, less           of
dense than the remainder, are coloured the first; and indeed
it    very frequent near the pole
     is                                     the winter months, and
                                                            in

necessary that these clouds, composed            frozen particles, ex
                                                                    of

frequently the case, produce the halos.

by conducting the electric discharges, gives rise to the lumi
nous effects. It will be conceived that the electric discharges
transmitted by this kind of network of ice must, on becoming
concentrated near the pole, produce there a far more brilliant
light than they develope when they are distributed over a
much greater extent.
    But why does the magnetic pole, and not the terrestrial
pole, appear to be the cause of the phaenomenon?                     Here is
my answer.        Place the     pole of a   powerful    electro-magnet   be

duces in the action of the magnetism.
    The magnetic disturbances which always accompany the
appearance of an aurora borealis are now easily explained.
This accidental union of a greater proportion of the accumu
lated electricities must derange the normal action of the regu
lar current; with respect to the directions of the disturbance,
it will depend on the portion of the current acting upon the
needle, and consequently on circumstances impossible to fore
see, since they depend on the extent of the phaenomenon and
the position of the needle in relation to                 fact, according    it.   In

 1848.              tion."            By        W. R. Grove, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.
   The author refers to some experiments of his published in the
Philosophical   Magazine for December 1845, and in the Bakerian
Lecture for 1847, relating to the difference of ignition generated in
a platinum wire heated by the voltaic current, when the wire is im
mersed in atmospheres of different gases.         In the present paper
these experiments are continued, the current being passed through
two platinum wires both in the same voltaic circuit, but immersed
in atmospheres of different gases.
   It appears from these experiments that the heat generated in the
wire is less in hydrogen and          compounds than   its  other gases;                  in
and that when the wires and their atmospheres         gas are immersed             of
in given quantities     water, the water surrounding the hydrogenous
                            of
gases     less heated than that surrounding those which contain
         is                                                                                                           no
hydrogen.
   Similar experiments,      which the wires are immersed
                                      in                         different                          in
liquids, are then given     the heat developed appears not

                      experiments are brought into relation                                         by by

appears that the cooling effect                        of

   The paper consists    two parts, having
                                     of       real relation    each          a                              to

 I.   On the Movements                of
                            the Stomach.-The anatomy           mus                                  of      its

cular coat is first briefly mentioned, and the so-called oblique fibres
of some authors stated to be really transverse, i.e. at right angles to
the altered direction of the canal.
   The muscular actions of the digesting stomach are then con
sidered.
     These Haller regarded as alternate contractions in two directions,
  now forwards, now backwards, forcing the contained food in corre
  spondingly reversed directions, and rested this conclusion on expe
 riment and argument; but the author believes the experiment to be
  solitary, and not parallel with the fact sought to be established, and
  the argument to be inconclusive.
     Beaumont's views are cited as analogous to Haller's, but are con
  sidered as having been by no means clearly stated.
     The author indicates an argument from analogy, but chiefly bases
  his conclusion on the observations of Owen and others on Fishes, and
  his own observations in animals immediately after death:—in the
  cmpty or non-digesting stomach; and in the stomach which contains
  food; first, in the early stage of digestion; and, secondly, at a later
  period.
     From a contrast of these three states it is found, that in the first
  there is no movement; in the second and third a considerable one;
  that in the latter, the opening of the pylorus, and the preponderance
  of the contractions of the pyloric half of the viscus, constitute                        its
  chief distinction from the second. The two latter movements are
  both peristaltic,    or one direction only—being never reversed,
                            in                                                        so   far
  as the author has seen.
     The movement impressed             the food   on  next considered.
                                                                  is       Ac
  cording   to the observations     Beaumont and others, the food passes
                                              of
in    two directions or streams, forwards and backwards. These ob
 servations the author has been unable            repeat, but regards them
                                                             to
  as established.
     Assuming the truth         these observations, and contrasting them
                                        of
 with the muscular actions     previously   stated,    appears that the latter
                                                                  it
 are   uniformly  in one direction,  the former        two, -an apparent

 congruity, which the author next seeks            explain.  to
     By experiment         he
                         attempts       imitate the natural conditions, and
                                                   to
             production                                               explana    an
                                of of
 with the                   the like result. He next offers
 tion and illustration       the fact (which   might    almost              be
                                                                   predicated,
a   priori), and adduces some (possible) analogues from the animal
 kingdom.
     He then seeks         to
                         establish     general law—that transverse con
                                                a
 tractions, occurring          closed tube filled with fluid, and proceed
                                in      a
 ing  in  one direction only, imply two currents;           peripheral a    ad        of
vance, taking the same course         the peripheral contractions; and
                                                as                                         an
axial  of  return,    the opposite direction.
                      in
     He next points out the modification                     of
                                                    this law for stomachs                  of
human shape, and shows how compatible this                  with the careful
                                                                       is
observations     of Beaumont, none          which are essentially opposed
                                                        of
to it.
    The author indicates       probable modification correlative with the

consistence of the food in some animals, and thus shows a dependence
of this physical process on a previous one.
   A solitary experiment is adduced to show that, as in the healthy
movement, so also in vomiting, no backward or antiperistaltic con
traction necessarily occurs.
   A conjecture concerning regurgitation of fluid from the stomach
concludes this part of the paper.
   II. On the Physiology of Intestinal Obstructions.—In the preceding
part of the paper it has been stated, that two currents probably ob
tain in the liquid contents of the stomach.              Many of the conditions
of the intestinal tube approximate to those of the stomach; and if
disease or experiment add to these occlusion and distension, the ana
logy of the two organs is rendered tolerably complete, and the results
will hence probably be referrible to the same general principle.
   The most remarkable and constant symptom of this state of ob
struction is the occurrence of faecal vomiting.
   The author briefly states the theory of an antiperistalsis by which
this phenomenon is ordinarily explained: and from an inquiry into                                                    its
experimental basis                  he
                            deduces this general result, that              antiperi                 an
staltic movement has never yet been observed                  any part      the ali
                                                                                                        on of
                                                                                 in
mentary canal.         He regards the irregular actions seen                 laying
open the bellies         healthy animals recently killed,
                               of                                     not definedly           as
peristaltic        the reverse, but
                     or                     dependent   as    the irritation pro on
duced by the admitted air.           So also,       the case      in
                                                                  the occluded        be of                          in
testine,        an
               inverted movement likewise fails                  recognized.     to                                  In
general, the vermicular actions are more energetic, and more peri
staltic, than       the healthy bowel.
                        in
    He next adduces the following arguments:—
      1.The antiperistalsis           usually attributed
                                               is                  irritation; but     to
irritation      present               every                     tube,       of
                                                                        while faecal
                                    is to in
                            almost             disease     the
vomiting        is is
                limited       cases      obstruction.of    This renders        pro                          it
bable that the latter         the  cause,   and that the    process       causation                of
is, like the cause, physical.
      2.The starting-point          the supposed inverted movement
                                               of                                the                            is
fullest   part     the  bowel,
                        of      while the place towards which             has set                  it                is
the emptiest. This condition                inconsistent with the supposition
                                                        is
of     anantiperistalsis, yet perfectly consistent with            forward move         a
ment, and analogous                       to
                                the obstructions          other tubes conveying
                                                                        of
fluids.
      3.Intus-susception        often the cause
                                          is            obstruction.   of But, both
from   experiment      and  argument,          appears  probable,
                                                             it      that      anti                        an
peristalsis would         once remove this condition, and would there
                                  at
fore       incompatible with
           be                                  it.
      4.The supposed inverted movement                    continuous, while the
                                                                        is

   6. The general and comparative date of accession of the vomit
ing is scarcely compatible with the antiperistaltic theory.
   The author next adduces experiments in which the intestine of
animals was artificially occluded by a ligature. In exceptional cases,
the ligature sloughed into the canal, and the obstruction was thus
destroyed. In all others, the tube was distended above the stricture
to a variable extent.    Below the stricture, the intestine was usually
empty and contracted for an inch or two.        The contents of the tube
varied both in quality and quantity; uniform fluidity being asso
ciated with a large quantity of contents, while their smaller amount
was often attended with differences of consistence. The date at
which the vomiting acceded varied considerably.        In one or two in
stances this symptom did not occur at all. These differences ap
peared mainly dependent on—
   1. The amount of fluid ingesta,
   2. The distance of the stricture from the stomach.
   The date of death seemed to vary chiefly with the degree of dis
tension.
   He therefore deduces the theory, That, in an obstructed intes
time, a movement of the ordinary (and probably peristaltic) character
propels the contents onwards to the seat of occlusion; that a con
tinuance of the process distends, first this part of the tube, and next,
those portions above it; that, if the contents are fluid, the ordinary
peristalsis tends to develope an axial and reversed current, which re
turns matter from a lower to a higher point of the intestine;—often
from the obstruction to the stomach, whence they are ejected by
vomiting.
   That in some cases, however, the action is probably much less
perfect than this; the consistence of the contents preventing the
perfection of these currents throughout the whole course of the tube.
But still a mixture results, although a less intimate one.
   The author next glances at the mode in which obstruction ap
pears to affect peristalsis, and the nature of the distending fluid.
He compares the obstructed intestine to the healthy stomach, to the
obstructed artery and duct; referring                       its
                                               peculiar appearances                     to
the dilatable yet muscular structure      its coats.   of

beats  of  his chronometer.        The New York astronomer compared the
signals received with the beats               his clock, and waited for
                                                          of                    coin                     a

recorded, and the astronomer waited six minutes for another coin
cidence        of
                beats.    The Cambridge astronomer continued beating
seconds for fifteen minutes, during which time the New York ob
server was sure         two coincidences, and might obtain three. When

over the same meridians. The difference of these times gives the dif
ference of longitude independent of the right ascension of the stars.
Both observers then reversed the axis of their transit instruments;
Cambridge selected a second pair of stars from the list, and the same
series of observations was repeated as with the first pair. The error
of collimation was thus eliminated, and by confining the observations
to stars within about five degrees of the zenith, the influence of azi
muthal error was avoided.       The level being read at every reversal,
the correction for it was applied by computation.       In this manner
it is hoped to eliminate every possible source of error, except that
which arises from the personal habits of the observers. In order to
eliminate this error, a travelling observer worked for a time at Cam
bridge and compared with the Cambridge astronomer; then came
to New York and compared with the New York astronomer; then
returned to Cambridge again, and so on as often as was thought
necessary.    Finally, at the conclusion of the campaign        the ob                            all

   On one           or

each observer telegraphed both star       and star              A                  B.

 In this preparation the distribution of  the ganglia and nerves over
the entire surface of the heart, and the relations of these structures
 to the blood-vessels and muscular substance, are considered by the
author to be far more fully displayed than in any of his former dis
sections. He states, that on the anterior surface there are distinctly
visible to the naked eye, ninety ganglia or ganglionic enlargements
on the nerves, which pass obliquely across the arteries and the mus
cular fibres of the ventricles from their base to the apex; that these
ganglionic enlargements are observed on the nerves, not only where
they are crossing the arteries, but where they are ramifying on the
muscular substance without the blood-vessels; that on the posterior
surface the principal branches of the coronary arteries plunge into
the muscular substance of the heart near the base, and many nerves
with ganglia accompany them throughout the walls to the lining
membrane and columnae carneae.
    The author considers that, in the accompanying beautiful draw
ings, Mr. West has depicted with the greatest accuracy and minute
ness the whole nervous structures demonstrable in this preparation
on the surface of the heart; but that the ganglia and nerves repre
sented in these drawings constitute only a small portion of the
nervous system of the heart, numerous ganglia being formed in the
walls of the heart which no artist can represent.

   The author states that the 17th of November was a fine day with
a clear sky and bright sunshine: towards evening the sky became
cloudy and a few drops of rain fell, but it soon again became clear,
with the exception of a few fleecy clouds that here and there dimmed

the horizon to the central ring or pole.       The beams appeared to be
at nearly equal distances from each other, the entire column of them
stretching over a space equal to about one-fifth part of the visible
horizon, in the form of a fan. The whole figure rapidly changed
from a pure white light into a glow of brilliant colours of every tint,
variegating the undulating waves as they rolled on their way to the
pole of the aurora. In the course of three minutes these gave place
to the white flashing radiations.
    During the time of the aurora there were a great number of small
meteors, the direction of whose motion was from east to west, and
which appeared to be considerably below the sphere of the aurora.
    A box containing a delicately balanced needle, was exposed upon
the ground during the display of the aurora, but did not appear to
be affected in the slightest degree till about one o'clock, when it was
observed to be considerably deflected. At the time when the needle
was disturbed, there was a dense column of radiating light in the
north-west and south-east. The reflexion from the north-west was
so clear, that when made to fall upon the polarizing plate of
M. Biot's polarizing apparatus, and a film of mica was placed upon
the stage of the instrument, the various colours produced by the
mica were beautifully clear and distinctly seen in the analysing glass.
    The author considers that the phenomenon of the colours which
were noticed, was probably caused by exhalations or vapour floating
in the atmosphere, betwixt the light of the aurora and the observer,
causing a refraction of the rays transmitted to the eye, analogous to
that which produces the phenomenon of halos. The continued
undulations of the auroral light, and also the passing of the rays
through thick and thin portions of the vapour, may, he considers,
have produced the great variety of colours.           During the time of
 the exhibition of this phenomenon,    a thin fog or vapour was observed
on both sides of the auroral fan. The author is of opinion that the
 cause which produced the variety of tints, is different from that
 which occasioned the red-coloured auroral clouds. At the time of
 the latter phenomenon the moon's position was nearly due east, and
 a cloud moved from the west towards the east, which in its course
 passed between the moon and the observer; as soon as the cloud
 obscured the light of the moon, the red colour to the north-west
 disappeared, but became visible when an opening in the cloud allowed
 the rays to pass through, and again vanished when another portion of
 the cloud cut off the light; and when the cloud had finally passed
 over, the red colour in the different parts of the sky resumed the
 same tint that it possessed before the moonlight was obscured by
 the cloud.    The author states that it would thus appear, that when
 the light of the moon was incident at a certain angle upon the white
 light, or some kind of vapour that surrounded          it,

 nected with the phenomenon.          He remarks, that the red colour
 was first observed  in   the east, and the moon being       that quarter
                                                              in
 of  the heavens, the rays proceeding from         itwould first come in

aurora commenced, the moon was considerably below the horizon;
but this, it is considered, does not form any serious objection to
what has been stated, since the aurora soared to so great a height,
that the rays of light proceeding from her would strike the aurora a
considerable time before she arose above the horizon.
   The aurora continued for upwards of six hours, and during that
time the thermometer stood at 34°.
  Jan. 18.-“On the Development and Homologies of the Cara
}.
 .R.S.
      and Plastron of the Chelonian       Reptiles.”   By Professor Owen,
   The author commences by defining the several parts of which the
osseous thoracic-abdominal case of the Chelonian Reptiles is com
posed, and briefly discusses the several opinions that have been
published with regard to their nature and homologies, dwelling
chiefly on that recently proposed by Prof. Rathké, in his work on
the Development of the Chelonia, in which it is contended that the
carapace consists exclusively of the development of parts of the
endo-skeleton, viz. the neural spines and vertebral ribs (pleurapo
physes), agreeably with the opinion of CUvi ER and Boja NUs, and
that the remainder of the thoracic-abdominal case, consisting of the
“marginal pieces" and “plastron,” are formed entirely from bones
                                     -
of the dermal system.
    Adverting to the hypotheses of Cuvier, Geoffroy and Meckel, that
the thoracic-abdominal case is a modification of parts of the endo
skeleton exclusively, the author tests their determinations by com
parisons with the corresponding parts of the bird and crocodile, and
infers, from the latter animal, that the hyosternal, hyposternal and
xiphisternal bones are not parts of the sternum, but are homologous
with the haemapophyses(sternal ribs and abdominal ribs); those in the
Plesiosaurus making the nearest approach to the peculiar develop
 ment of the parts in the Chelonia, especially as they appear in the
 plastron of the immature Terrapenes and Sea-turtles.
    Admitting that any hypothesis framed from the comparison of the
 completed structures in the adult Vertebrata requires for confirma
                                                              the develop
      of its
 tion     agreement with the important phenomena             of
 ment     those structures, the author proceeds         apply that test.

    He details his observations      onthe development       of
                                                              the skeleton,
                      *
 and especially  of  the thoracic-abdominal     case,   inthe embryos and
 young    ofdifferent genera  of  Chelonia.    The chief facts that have
 governed his conclusions are the following:—
    With respect     tothe carapace. The cartilaginous basis        of   the
 neural plates  is  developed  in   the substance       the derm; and
                                                       of                 of
 these, the 9th, 10th, 11th, and the “nuchal’ plate are ossified from
 independent centres, and remain permanently free from anchylosis
 with the subjacent spines      of  the vertebrae  :  they are, therefore,
 “dermal bones,” homologous with those that overlie the vertebrae
 of the crocodile.    But the first  tothe eighth neural plates inclusive
 are serial homologues with the foregoing, and must, therefore, have
 the same general homology. The objection that ossification extends
 into their dermal                         from the neural spines    is  met
                                      2

 by the remark, that other parts, e.g. the radius and ulna of the frog,
 are ossified from a common centre, without their homological di
 stinctness being thereby masked or destroyed. The course or start
 ing-point of ossification does not determine   the nature and homology
 of parts, and the author refers what he believes to be an erroneous
 conclusion of Prof. Rathké to undue value being given to the cha
 racter of connation.
     The cartilaginous basis of the costal plates is developed in the
 substance of the derm; the subjacent ribs are previously ossified and
 present the normal slender form. But ossification extends from near
  the head of each of the eight pairs of dorsal ribs, from the second
  to the ninth pair inclusive, into the superincumbent dermal carti
 lages. This had been described as the development of the tubercle
  of the rib. But Prof. Owen observes that, in the development of
 the carapace of the young of the Testudo indica, the connation of
 the costal plate with the rib commences at a different point in each
 rib alternately, and appears to be governed by the arrangement of the
  horny scutes above.     Another objection to these ossific expansions
 being the tubercles of the ribs is presented by their abutment me
 sially against the neural plates, not against the vertebral diapo
 physes, as in the bird and crocodile.
     In regard to the development of the plastron, the author describes
 two situations in which the primitive cartilages are developed, cor
 responding with those in the embryo-carapace, viz. one belonging to
 the endo-skeleton, the other in the derm. The first form under
 which the endo-skeletal parts of the plastron appear agrees with the
 evidence afforded by the comparison of the fully-developed parts
 with those of the crocodile, and proves the hyosternals, hyposternals
 and xiphisternals to be “haemapophyses' or abdominal ribs: the
 hyosternals and hyposternals are primitively long, slender, trans
 verse bars, which join the vertebral ribs in the Tortoises and Terra
 penes, without the intervention of any marginal pieces. The ossifi
 cation of the superadded dermal portions proceeds from the pre
 viously ossified endo-skeletal elements.
     The author concurs with M. Rathké in regarding the marginal
 pieces as ‘dermal bones,' and concludes by a full discussion of the

    Jan. 25.-Some remarks on a paper entitled “On          the Depth of
Rain which falls in    the same localities at different Altitudes in the
Hilly districts of Lancashire, Cheshire, &c., by S. C. Homersham,
C.E.”     By John Fletcher Miller, Esq. Communicated by Lieut.-
Col. Sabine, R.A., For. Sec. R.S.
    The author, after alluding to the discordance between the con
clusions at which he had arrived from a discussion of his meteoro
logical observations in the lake district of Cumberland and West

                                    Royal Society.                                            309
moreland, described in a former paper, and those drawn from the
same facts by Mr. Homersham, in a paper read before the Society
on the 25th of May last, states that the results for the year 1848
show a precisely similar gradation to those of the two preceding
years; and that the whole of the observations appear to warrant the
conclusion which he had ventured to draw from those detailed in
his former paper.
    He remarks that, as the rain-gauges are, with one exception, si
tuated on the high mountains surrounding the head of the Vale of
Wastdale, this valley is the only one which can fairly be selected as
a standard in comparing the quantities of rain obtained at the differ
ent mountain stations. The discordance between his conclusions and
those arrived at by Mr. Homersham, he considers, has arisen from
that gentleman having selected the distant and excessively wet loca
lity of Seathwaite at the head of the southern fork of Borrowdale,
as a representative of the quantity of water deposited in the valleys
generally.
     If
      the receipts of the mountain gauges, he observes, be compared
with the rain-fall at Wastdale Head, or in any of the other valleys
except Seathwaite, it will be found that the quantity increases con
siderably up to 1900 feet, where it reaches a maximum; and that
above this elevation it rapidly decreases, until at 2800 feet above the
sea the amount is very much less than in the surrounding valleys.
   In conclusion, the author states that it appears to him, that much
of the discordance in the results obtained at various elevations amongst
the mountains has arisen from the circumstance of the instruments
having been placed on the slope or breast of the hill nearly in a line
with each other; in which positions, he is convinced from experi
ence, that when strong winds prevail, the gauges are exposed to eddies
or counter-currents, which prevent a portion of the water from enter
ing the funnel, and thus a less depth of rain is obtained than is due
to the elevation.
   The gauges under his superintendence being                        all
                                                         stationed either
on  the top    or
                shoulder        of
                             the mountain, and exposed          the wind        to

                       the compass, are not,               he
                                                  observes, open      this               to
objection.

 definite object to observe in connection with the different parts of
 the spectrum.       In Professor Powell's experiment, the wire of the
 telescope, placed in coincidence with one of the fixed lines of the
 spectrum previously to the insertion of the retarding plate into the
 fluid, marks the place of the fixed line, and so affords a definite ob
ject to observe when the retarding plate is inserted into the fluid,
 and the spectrum is consequently traversed by bands of interference.
     The practical applications considered by the author are princi
 pally four.     In the first, the variation of the refractive index of the
 plate in passing from one fixed line to another is determined, the
absolute refractive index for some one fixed line being supposed ac
 curately known.       The observation consists in counting the number
of bands seen between two fixed lines of the spectrum, the frac
tions of a band-interval at the two extremities being measured or
estimated.
     In the second application, the absolute refractive index of the plate
is determined for some one fixed line of the spectrum. The obser
vation consists in counting the number of bands which move across
the wire of the telescope, previously placed in coincidence with the
fixed line in question, when the plate is inclined to the incident light.
    The third application is to the determination of the change in the
refractive index of the fluid, for any fixed line of the spectrum, pro
duced by a change in the temperature. The observation consists in
counting the number of bands which move across the wire of the
telescope while the temperature sinks from one observed value to
another, the temperature being noted by means of a delicate ther
mometer which remains in the fluid.          For this observation a know
ledge of the refractive index of the retarding plate is not required.
    The fourth application is to the determination of the change of
velocity of the light corresponding to any fixed line of the spectrum,
when the direction of the refracted wave changes with reference to
 certain fixed lines in the plate, which is here supposed to belong to
a doubly refracting crystal. The observation consists in counting
the bands as they pass the wire when the plate is inclined.           It re
quires that the plate should be mounted on a graduated instrument.
 It would be possible in this way to determine, by observation alone,
 the wave surface belonging to each fixed line of the spectrum.
    While considering the theory of Professor Powell's bands, the au
thor was led to perceive the explanation of certain bands, described
 by Professor Powell, which are seen in the secondary spectrum formed
 by two prisms which produce a partial achromatism. Although the
 account of these bands has been published many years, they do not
 seem hitherto to have attracted attention.      It is easily shown by com
 mon    optics that when two colours are united by means of two prisms,
 the deviation, regarded as a function of the refractive index, the
  angle of incidence being given, is a maximum or minimum for some
  intermediate colour.      For the latter colour, two portions of light of
  consecutive degrees of refrangibility come out parallel; and there
  fore the diffraction bands belonging to different kinds of light, of
  very nearly the same refrangibility with the one in question, are su

perposed in such a manner that the dark and bright bands respect
ively coincide.      Thus distinct bands are visible in the secondary
spectrum, although none would be seen in the spectrum formed by
a single prism, in consequence of the mixture of the bright and dark
bands belonging to different kinds of light of nearly the same degree
bf refrangibility. The diffraction bands here spoken of are of very
sensible breadth, in consequence of the small width of the aperture
employed in the actual experiment.
   When a spectrum is viewed through a narrow slit half covered by
a  plate of mica, the edge of which bisects the slit longitudinally, and
is held  parallel to the fixed lines of the spectrum, the bands described
by Sir David Brewster are seen, provided the mica plate lie at the
side at which the blue end of the spectrum is seen, and provided the
thickness of the plate and the breadth of the slit            within certain      lie
limits.   When these bands are invisible          consequence     in the slit                of
being too narrow,         or
                          the spectrum too broad,      follows from theory
                                                                        it
that the bands ought            appear when the slit and plate are turned

parallel  to the fixed lines      theofspectrum.   The author has verified
this conclusion      byexperiment, employing plates adapted           obser                     to
vations with the naked eye, which are best suited            the purpose.        to

of indifference when we come to treat of the properties of the                    in
tegrals which determine the motion.              Generally those integrals de
pend on the properties of those curves of double flexure in which
cones of the second degree are generally intersected by concentric
spheres; and it so happens that the direct ellipsoid of moments is
intersected by a concentric sphere in one of these curves. By means
of the properties of these curves a complete solution may be ob
tained even in the most general cases, to which only an approxi
 mation has hitherto been made.
    In the first section of the paper, the author establishes such pro
perties as he has subsequently occasion to refer to, of cones of the
second degree, and of the curves of double curvature in which these
surfaces may be intersected by concentric spheres, some of which
he believes will not be found in any published treatise on the sub
ject. He considers that he has been so fortunate as to be the first
to obtain the true representative curve of elliptic functions of the
first order.       It is shown that any spherical conic section, the tan
gents of whose principal semiarcs are the ordinates of an equilateral
 hyperbola whose transverse semiaxis is 1, may be rectified by an
 elliptic function of the first order; and the quadrature of such a
 curve may be effected by a function of the same order, when the
 cotangents of the halves of the principal arcs are the ordinates of
 the same equilateral hyperbola.
    This particular species of spherical ellipse the author has called
 the “Parabolic Ellipse," because, as is shown in the course of the
 investigation, it is the gnomonic projection, on the surface of a sphere,
 of the common parabola whose plane touches the sphere at the focus.
 As in this species of spherical ellipse either the focus or the centre
 may be taken as the origin of the spherical radii vectores, in effect
 ing the process of rectification, we are unexpectedly presented with
 Lagrange's scale of modular transformations, as also with the other
 equally well-known theorem by which the successive amplitudes are
 connected.        Among other peculiar properties of the spherical para
 bolic  ellipse   established in this paper, it is shown that the portion of
 a great    circle touching the curve, and intercepted between the per
 pendicular arcs on it from the foci, is always equal to a quadrant.
    In the second and following sections, the author proceeds to dis
 cuss the problem which is the immediate subject of the paper.
 Having established the ordinary equations of motion, he shows that,
 if the direct ellipsoid of moments be constructed, the motion of a
 rigid body acted on solely by primitive impulses may be represented
                                      a its
 by this ellipsoid moving round              centre,in   such  amanner that        its
 surface shall    always   pass through      point fixed  in space. This point,
 so  fixed,      the extremity of    the axis of   the plane       of
                                                                  the impressed
          or is
 couple,      of   the plane known   as   the invariable plane          of
                                                                     the motion.

uniform velocity.    This cone may always be determined.   For the
circular sections of the invariable cone coincide with the circular
sections of the ellipsoid of moments; whence the cyclic axes of
the ellipsoid, or the diameters perpendicular to the planes of these
sections, will be the focal lines of the supplemental cone; and as
the invariable plane is always a tangent plane to this cone, we have
sufficient elements given to determine                                          it.

   By treating nitrate of silver with perfectly dry chlorine, M. De
ville has succeeded in isolating anhydrous nitric acid, the existence
of which was demonstrated by numerous analyses. This beautiful
substance is obtained in colourless crystals, which are perfectly bril
liant and limpid, and may be procured of considerable size; when
they are slowly deposited in a current of gas rendered very cold,
their edges are a centimetre in length. These crystals are prisms
of six faces, which appear to be derived from a right prism with a
rhombic base.     They melt at a temperature not much exceeding
85°5    F.; their boiling-point is about 113°; at 50° the tension of
this substance is very considerable. In contact with water it becomes
very hot, and dissolves in it without imparting colour, and without
disengaging any gas; it then produces with barytes the nitrate of
that base.       When heated               its
                                        decomposition appears             commence               to

rine should  pass very slowly, at the rate of about three or four litres
in twenty-four hours.     All the gas however is not absorbed by the
mitrate of silver.   Oxygen is evolved, the volume of which appears
to be equal to that of the chlorine employed.      An apparatus thus
constructed operates day and night without watching, care being
however taken to renew the sulphuric acid which displaces the chlo
rine, the spirit of the lamp, and the ingredients of the freezing mix
ture.

I shall employ    preference the names methylamide and ethylamide
                             in
to designate these new bases.
     Inthe present communication    shall restrict myself merely
                                                               I                                                     to
communicating the circumstances under which these substances are
produced, and      communicating the results
                               to               some analyses which                of

establish their composition.             They are produced under three dif
ferent   circumstances,—1st,        by    the action of potash on cyanic athers;
2nd, by the action of potash upon cyanuric athers; and 3rd, by the
action of potash upon the ureas. These reactions will be best exhi
bited by a few formulae:–
             Cº  NO, HO-H2KO-H2HO=2CO3, KO-H H3N
              Cyanic acid.                                      Ammonia.
        Cº NO, Cº H3 O-H-2KO-H2HO=2CO3,                   KO-HCs H5N
      Cyanate  of methylene.                                    Methylamide.
        Cº NO, C4H8O-H2KO +2HO=2CO3, KO-HCA H7N
           Cyanic aether.                                       Ethylamide.
Cyanuric acid and the cyanuric aethers being isomeric with the
cyanic compounds, it will suffice to multiply the preceding formulae
by 3 to explain the second mode of formation. With respect to the
ureas, the following equations            will show how they give rise to    these
bases:—
       C2  H4N2O2+2KO-H2HO=2CO3, KO-H H3 N-H H3N
            Urea.
       C+  H6 N•   O2+2KO +2HO=2CO3, KO-H H3 N-H Cº Hº N
        Acetic urea.
       C6H5 Nº O2+2KO-H2HO=2CO3, KO-H H3N4-C4H1N
       Metacetic urea.
    Hydrochlorate of Methylamide.—I obtained this salt by boiling
cyanurate of methylene with an excess of potash in an apparatus
arranged so that the vapours of methylamide, after having passed
through a refrigerator, were condensed in a receiver containing a
little pure water. The excessively caustic liquid thus obtained has
a strong odour of ammonia, but does not contain a trace of that
alkali; for if saturated with hydrochloric acid and evaporated to
dryness, the residue, consisting of hydrochlorate of methylamide,
dissolves very readily in hot absolute alcohol.              The salt crystallizes
on   cooling   in beautiful   laminae,      which are iridescent so long as they
float in the     liquid,   and assume a nacreous appearance when dry.

   Hydrochlorate of Ethylamide.—I have prepared this substance
both with cyanic and with cyanuric aether.             It dissolves readily in
absolute   alcohol,   and  crystallizes  in   laminae;   it melts below 212°,
and solidifies on     cooling  into a   crystalline    mass.    When distilled
with burnt lime, it gives off ethylamide in the form of an excessively
caustic liquid, which diffuses a strong odour of ammonia.                  This
liquid precipitates                  all

           RECTIFICATION              OF   SPIRIT OF NITRO US AETHER.
   M. Klauer, pharmacien of Mulhouse, states it to be well known,
that when spirit of nitrous aether has become acid, it is usual to
rectify it from calcined magnesia, which, however, does not prevent
this preparation from becoming again acid in a few weeks. The
author observes that this is not the case when it is rectified from
neutral tartrate of potash instead of magnesia; it may then be kept
for several months without exhibiting any sign of acidity.—Journ.

XLVI.       On the Isomeric Modifications of Phosphoric Acid.
     By H. Rose, Professor of Chemistry in the University of
     Berlin *.
IT                   |...}.
       has frequently been remarked, that no substance presents
      greater            in every respect to the chemist in                               its
examination than phosphoric acid; whilst the longer and more
constantly we are engaged         studying the reactions
                                                  in          this                   of
acid, the greater                  do
                      the difficulties become.   Every   time the
investigation    renewed, the chemist meets with new anomalies,
                         is
and numerous new obscure phaenomena are exhibited, whilst
even those previously known are far from being satisfactorily
explained.
    Some time since,                         an
                            investigation upon the isomeric mo
                                        in
difications         of
               the peroxide     tin, drew attention
                                                  of    Ithe fact,              to
that such modifications are principally met with          those me            in
tallic oxides which possess acid properties; they are almost
entirely absent       those which possess strong basic properties.

The latter    certainly  frequently alter    density       consider
                                                                  in       to  a
able extent when exposed           various elevated temperatures,

in  acids; when, however, they are once dissolved, they always
exhibit    insolution the same reactions.
   Phosphoric acid exhibits paradoxical isomeric properties
still more than any metallic acid. After the important disco
very       Clark, the ingenious investigations
          of                                            Graham did       of
much towards the elucidation           the difficulties; but

effected.
 I shall now make some remarks upon each                                               of   these three

                                anomalous phaenomena which
this acid exhibits, we are compelled                              to
                                                  admit the existence                                      of
several submodifications of it:                least three of these are

 The supernatant fluid reddens litmus-paper.       The mass is not
affected by ebullition, but when heated with muriatic acid, it
 is dissolved. The precipitate is entirely dissolved by excess
 of the soda salt; ammonia does not produce a precipitate in
 the solution.
    A solution of sulphate of magnesia does not produce any
 precipitate, even on ebullition.    If much of the soda salt has
 been added, no precipitate is produced in the solution by am
 monia; in the opposite case, ammonia produces a precipitate
which is soluble in chloride of ammonium.
    Nitrate of silver produces a dense, voluminous, white pre
cipitate, which is soluble in ammonia and nitric acid.       It is
also perfectly soluble in a large excess of the salt of soda.
The supernatant liquid reddens litmus-paper.         The precipi
tate does not become     oleaginous  when shaken in the cold, but
when boiled it     contracts,  occupying  a smaller volume, and
becomes perfectly resinous.        Heat renders it tenacious, so
that it can be drawn into threads; and on cooling, it solidifies
to a brittle mass.
    A solution of permitrate of mercury, which necessarily con
tains free acid, produces a white precipitate; this, when shaken,
even in the cold, subsides to the bottom of the vessel as a
dense oleaginous mass.
    Solution of bichloride of mercury produces no change.
    Solution of protonitrate of mercury produces a dense white
precipitate, which is soluble in an excess of the soda salt;
on boiling it becomes resinous, like the salt of silver.
    Solution of sulphate of copper produces no change; but
chloride of copper produces a bluish-white precipitate, which
is soluble both in excess of the soda salt and of the chloride
of copper.
    Solution of acetate of lead produces a dense voluminous pre
cipitate, which is soluble in excess of the soda salt, and when
shaken forms a coherent mass, but does not become oleagi
nous; when set aside, however, it becomes somewhat resinous.
    Solution of protosulphate of manganese produces a white
precipitate, which when shaken becomes an oily mass. The
precipitate is soluble in an excess of the soda salt; sulphuret
of ammonium throws down sulphuret of manganese from this
solution.                                                       -
    Solution of protosulphate of iron does not produce a preci.
pitate.    Nor is any precipitation caused by the addition of
ammonia to this solution, but it renders it dark green.
    Solution of sulphate of zinc produces no change.
    Solutions of the sulphates of cobalt and nickel also produce
no change. However, solutions of the chlorides of cobalt and
                                 Y2

nickel produce red and greenish-white precipitates, which on
agitation subside in the form of heavy oily drops of a red and
greenish-white colour.    The precipitates are soluble in excess
of the soda salt.
   Solution of the nitrate of bismuth, although it contains free
acid, produces a white precipitate, which on agitation becomes
somewhat resinous, but not oily. The precipitate is soluble
in the soda salt.
       If the acid
                contained in the salt of soda be separated from
the base,      aqueous solution exhibits somewhat different pro

    Solution of chloride of calcium produces an extremely small
precipitate, which is perfectly soluble in excess of the acid.
Ammonia produces a dense voluminous precipitate in this
solution.    Lime-water does not cause any precipitate until
added in excess.      Both acids exhibit the same reactions with
sulphate of magnesia, nitrate of silver and albumen.
    These two acids therefore differ principally in their reac
tion with chloride of barium.        But as solutions of Graham's
metaphosphate of soda, as stated above, when decomposed
by solutions of neutral salts, yield liquids which possess an
acid reaction, the acid separated from the precipitates must
be different from that in the soda salt used.
    As the composition of the oily and resinous precipitates
produced by Graham's salt was entirely unknown, the salt of
silver was analysed by M. Weber.            It was prepared in the
same manner as the salt precipitated for the purpose of ob
taining the free acid.      After having been dried for a long
time at   212°F.,   0.930 grm. lost at a red heat 0.019 grim.,
or 2.04 per cent. of water. It fused into a mass of a yellowish
colour, which, when dissolved in nitric acid, yielded on the
addition of hydrochloric acid 0.815 grin. of chloride of silver,
corresponding to 70-09 oxide of silver. The phosphoric acid
in the filtered liquid was precipitated in the form of the phos
phate of ammonia and magnesia; G.257 grim. of pyrophos
phate of magnesia was obtained after heating to redness,
corresponding to 27.87 per cent. of phosphoric acid.
    These results correspond to the formula 3AgO, 2P. O'
 + HO.      Berzelius examined this salt long ago, but he ob
tained it in a different manner *.         He precipitated a solu
tion of phosphoric acid which had been recently heated to
redness, with nitrate of silver; he then obtained a precipitate,
the composition of which but little resembled that of AgO
 P*O", the amount of oxide of silver differing nearly 3 per cent.
from that calculated.      This salt was placed in boiling water;
in a few minutes it fused into a viscid mass resembling tur
pentine, and had the same composition as the compound men
 tioned above.
    The composition found above explains the acid reaction of
 the liquid, when the neutral solution of Graham's salt is pre
 cipitated with solution of nitrate of silver.          It also renders
 evident  why  the acid separated   from the silver salt may possess
 different properties from metaphosphoric acid as obtained by
 the combustion of phosphorus.          The question, whether the
 other  oleaginous  salts, which a solution of Graham's salt forms
 with other neutral salts, possess an analogous composition to
                  • Poggendorff’s Annalen, xix. p. 333.

326             Prof. H. Rose on the Isomeric Modifications
the silver salt, as might be expected from the circumstance
that on their formation the solutions which are originally
neutral acquire an acid reaction, well deserves investigation.
   A salt of silver having an analogous composition can be
prepared from Graham's salt. M. Fleitmann decomposed
Graham's salt with nitrate of silver, filtered the precipitate
immediately, washed it slightly, with cold water, and then
pressed it strongly between blotting-paper. The water used
in the washing possessed a barely acid reaction. . The fused
compound gave the following per-centage composition                                                 :-
                            Phosphoric acid .               .        .       37.62

which closely approximates the composition calculated ac
cording to the formula AgO, P. O', which requires 61-89 oxide
of silver and 38.11 phosphoric acid. The loss probably arises
from         its
           containing    little soda, which was not removed

solution of the soda salt      produces    no precipitates with solu
tions of nitrate of   silver,  nitrate of lead, chloride of barium,
chloride of calcium, chloride of strontium, sulphate of mag
nesia, protosulphate of manganese, protosulphate of iron, the
sulphates of zinc, cobalt or nickel.           In the solutions of the
proto- and pernitrates of mercury, the solution of the soda
salt at first produces no turbidity, but after a considerable
time a precipitate is formed. . It also produces a precipitate
in a solution of acetate of lead.
   The solution of the soda salt, as also that of Graham's salt,
produces no precipitate with albumen; but this is the case
when acetic acid is added. According to Fleitmann, the acid
may be readily isolated from the solution of the crystallized
silver salt by a current of sulphuretted hydrogen.             The solu
tion of the free acid immediately produces a copious precipi
tate with albumen.       When saturated with carbonate of soda,
the  original  soda salt is again obtained; and if               solution,              its

metaphosphate of silver appeared to have been formed, in ad
mixture with a little undecomposed c-phosphoric acid.
    Some uncertainty still continues regarding the composition
of fused phosphoric acid. A very long time since          made           I
several experiments upon this point *, and found that the acid,
fused for a considerable time over a spirit-lamp, in three ex
periments, contained a slightly less amount of water than is
required by the compound P-O'H HO. In another experi
ment, probably with some acid which had been heated more
strongly, and for a longer time, the amount of water was still
less, and nearly corresponded to the compound 3PO3 + 5
(PO’-- HO): hence it is thus rendered probable that phos
phoric acid would be obtained in a perfectly anhydrous state
by a very long and continuous application of heat.
    My experiments have been recently confirmed by M.
Weber, who examined an acid which had been exposed for a
considerable time to a temperature at which it began to be
slightly volatilized; 3:127 grims. of this acid, when treated
with 16-891, grms, of oxide of lead, left, after having been
heated to redness, a residue of 19700 grms.    The per-centage
composition of the acid was therefore—
             Phosphoric acid      . .  . . 89.84
             Water . . . . . . . . 10'16
                                                        looroo
In this  case also the quantity of water is slightly less than
the composition  PO’-- HO requires. The quantities of oxygen
are in the proportion of 50.34 : 9:03.
   In addition to these three submodifications of metaphos
phoric acid, there are undoubtedly others. That acid which
is formed on burning phosphorus in dry atmospheric air or
oxygen gas, may be considered as a fourth submodification, for,
as has been stated above, the reactions of its solution are dif
ferent from those of the other modifications. The salts which
it forms with bases have not been prepared and examined. I
shall merely remark here, that anhydrous phosphoric acid does
not exhibit any affinity towards dry ammoniacal gas, nor does
it absorb it; hence differs
                       it      this respect from anhydrous sul
                                     in
phuric acid. Probably the various submodifications            me             of
taphosphoric acid should             be
                                considered      conjugate

 quantity of soda. Persoz and Fleitmann have also procured
and examined insoluble double salts of the pyrophosphate of
 soda with the pyrophosphate of copper.
     The following are the special reactions of a solution of
 pyrophosphate of soda with salts of the metallic oxides:—
     Solution of chloride of barium produces a precipitate, which
 is insoluble in excess of the soda salt; at least the filtered
 liquid either yields no precipitate, or at most a very slight
 troubling with dilute sulphuric acid.
     Solution of chloride of calcium produces a precipitate, which
 is soluble in a very large quantity of the pyrophosphate of soda.
 The clear liquid however becomes spontaneously turbid when
 set aside, and in 24 hours a very slight precipitate only of
oxalate of lime is caused by a solution of oxalate of potash.
     Solution of sulphate of magnesia produces a precipitate,
                    F.
 which is soluble in excess of the pyrophosphate of soda; but
on ebullition a copious precipitate is produced in this solution,
which does not disappear as the liquid cools.                 Ammonia
does not cause a precipitate in a solution of the pyrophosphate
of magnesia in                        of soda, even when set aside for
a   long  time. The      precipitate   of the pyrophosphate of mag
nesia is also    readily   soluble in excess of sulphate of magnesia.
 Ebullition causes a      precipitate  in this solution, which does not
disappear on cooling.
     Solution of nitrate of silver produces the well-known white
precipitate. It is not wholly insoluble in a very large excess of
the pyrophosphate of soda. The supernatant liquid does not
affect litmus paper, and only renders it blue when excess of
the soda salt has been added.
     Solution of pernitrate of mercury, although it necessarily
contains free nitric acid, produces a copious white precipitate,
which becomes basic and of a reddish-yellow colour on the
addition of excess of the pyrophosphate of soda.
     Solution of the protonitrate of mercury produces a white
precipitate, which is soluble in excess of the pyrophosphate of
soda.      In this solution, ammonia causes a blackish gray, sul
Prº
phuret of ammonium a black, and hydrochloric acid a white
                 the latter consists of chloride of mercury.
    Solution of bichloride of mercury does not immediately pro
duce any precipitate.         After a considerable time, a dense red
precipitate is formed, which is still more rapidly thrown down
when heat is applied.
     Solution of sulpha<U+017F>e of copper produces a bluish-white pre
cipitate, which is readily soluble in excess of the pyro

phosphate   of soda. The solution is of a blue colour; on the
addition of ammonia it becomes of a darker blue, sulphuret of
ammonium immediately produces in it a brown precipitate of
sulphuret of copper.      The pyrophosphate of copper is also
soluble in a very large excess of sulphate of copper.      Heat
produces a precipitate     in the solution  which does not   dis
appear on cooling.
   Solution of acetate of lead causes a white gelatinous preci
pitate, readily soluble in the pyrophosphate of soda. Sulphuret
of lead is immediately thrown down from this solution by
sulphuretted hydrogen.
   Solution of protosulphate of manganese produces a white
precipitate, which is insoluble in excess of the protosalt of
manganese, but is soluble in the pyrophosphate of soda. This
solution is not troubled by ammonia; sulphuret of ammonium
does not produce a precipitate of sulphuret of manganese in
it (which certainly deserves special notice), even when set
aside for a considerable time.
   Solution of protosulphate of iron produces a white preci
pitate, soluble in excess of the pyrophosphate of soda. A
black precipitate of sulphuret of iron is immediately formed
in the solution on the addition of sulphuret of ammonium ; the
solution is not however rendered turbid by ammonia; it
merely renders it of a dark colour.      The pyrophosphate of
iron is also soluble in excess of the solution of the proto
sulphate of iron.
   Solution of perchloride of iron causes a white precipitate,
readily soluble in excess of the pyrophosphate of soda. Sul
phuret of ammonium immediately produces in the almost
colourless solution, a black precipitate of sulphuret of iron,
which deserves particular notice, because Persoz denies the
production of sulphuret of iron in the solution by sulphuret of
ammonium.       Ammonia however does not render the solution
turbid; it immediately turns it of a blood-red colour.
    Solution of sulphate of zinc produces a white precipitate,
soluble in the pyrophosphate of soda. The solution is neither
precipitated by ammonia nor by boiling, but sulphuret of am
monium throws down sulphuret of zinc.         The precipitate is
also soluble in excess of the solution of sulphate of zinc.
On boiling, the solution becomes turbid; the turbidity does
not disappear on cooling.
    Solution of sulphate of cadmium produces a precipitate
 which is soluble in pyrophosphate of soda. The solution be
comes turbid when heated, the turbidity not disappearing as
the solution cools.     Sulphuret of cadmium is immediately
precipitated from it by sulphuret of ammonium.

 pitate is produced, which is readily soluble in the soda salt.
 The solution is not rendered turbid by heat. With chloride
 of nickel the same reaction occurs, except that the solution of
 the precipitate in excess of the soda salt is rendered turbid
 when heated and does not become clear on cooling.                    Sul
 phuret of nickel is immediately thrown down from this solution
 by sulphuret of ammonium.
    Solution of sulphate of cobalt is precipitated of a pale red
 colour; the precipitate is readily soluble in the soda salt.
 The solution is red, and when heated becomes perfectly blue,
 but not turbid; on cooling it reacquires the red colour. Sul
phuret of ammonium immediately causes the formation of sul
phuret of cobalt in                   it.

the c-phosphoric acid does not take place, until the pyro

come converted into the c-phosphoric acid. With the appli
cation of a high temperature, the conversion can be better
effected in this manner in the case of the pyrophosphate of
strontia, and still better of the pyrophosphate of baryta;
pyrophosphate of magnesia may be completely decomposed,
and the pyrophosphoric acid contained in it completely con
verted into c-phosphoric acid, even by fusion over a spirit
lamp with a mixture of carbonate of potash and carbonate of
soda in atomic proportions.
   It is well known that the conversion of pyrophosphoric acid
is perfectly  effected by acids, especially when it is heated with
them. The stronger the acid, the more completely the con
version is effected; it succeeds best when concentrated sul
phuric acid is used.
     An aqueous solution of pyrophosphoric                           acid, immediately
after    its   preparation,       exhibits the following reactions:—

   Solution of chloride of barium produces a copious precipi
tate, which is neither soluble in excess of the phosphate of
soda nor of the chloride of barium.

 Erperiment to separate Phosphoric from Pyrophosphoric                                            Acid.
    The different reaction of the phosphate                                 and pyrophosphate
 of soda towards a solution of sulphate of                                  magnesia and am
 monia, led me to hope that it might form the basis of a method
 of separating these two modifications of phosphoric acid.
    When pyrophosphate of soda is dissolved in a large amount
of water, and the solution is mixed with a very large quantity
 of chloride of ammonium, no precipitate is produced on                                               the

only one, exhibited         currents. no

INvol.myxxxii.
          notes on Mr. Cockle's paper (Phil. Mag., S. 3.
               p. 351), it was incidentally suggested to express
the conjugate pair of roots of one of the quadratic factors of
an algebraic equation by 2 + 3 and 2–3, without assigning
the algebraical form of 3. It was, moreover, proposed to form
the two subordinate equations which contained relations be
tween 2 and 3, as is now generally done, after the example of
Lagrange.
    It has been objected by analysts with whom have corre                    I
sponded or conversed—analysts who would not have raised
frivolous objections to any proposition whatever—that by
the assumption of these forms I deprived myself of the means
of forming those two equations upon any legitimate principle;
inasmuch as their derivation is founded entirely on the appli
cation of the principle of incongruity, by showing that in
                                        X+ Y3    w/-   i =0
                                                       -
we must have simultaneously
                                        X=0,    and   Y = 0.
   I may   remark in the first place, that though I do not ques
tion the   legitimacy    of this argument when           the roots are all
imaginary,                      ambiguous when some
                                                                                 no of
              I  still think             it                    the roots
are real, and altogether fallacious when there are            imaginary
roots   atall.
   And,       the second place, that any process founded
             in                                                       this                    on

simple assertion.     am unable
                              I      perceive  the slightest
                                                          to  con
nexion between the conclusion that     4Triºsia=4rrºs,”    and the
principle    the constancy

assumed step     reasoning.
                         of    Without noticing this connexion
explicitly, Prof. Challis has certainly rendered his reasoning
more definite              by
                   the introduction     the supposition      rigid
                                                               of                                          of
 envelopes.
                            *   Communicated             by   the Author.

                   in reply to Professor Challis.                      349
   Prof. Challis's argument, as it now stands, may be divided
into the following heads:–
   1.  The condensation s may be expressed by r- F(r—at).
   2. The function F may be given arbitrarily from r—at=b
to r-at-b-H A, and may be supposed to vanish beyond those
limits, so that the wave of condensation is comprised between
the spheres whose radii are at + b and at +b+x.
   3. The fluid may be supposed at rest beyond the outer, and
within the inner boundary of the wave of condensation.
   4. Therefore we may introduce two rigid envelopes, &c.
   The third head I wholly deny, and have already, as con          I
ceive, disproved. (Phil. Mag., vol. xxxiv. p. 54.) I have
                           +
                          b-HX
shown that
              unless/,         F(r)ar=0, the fluid cannot be at rest
both outside and inside the wave of condensation.
   It is vain to reply (as at p. 91) that the expression for the
velocity is not proved.        It is proved on the hypothesis (I do
not   myself regard    it as an hypothesis) of spherical waves, as
Prof. Challis does not seem to deny. . It is plainly illogical
reasoning to make the hypothesis of spherical waves, obtain a
part of  §.  results to which the analysis leads on that hypo
thesis, refuse to attend to other results to which the analysis
equally leads, and then, on the gratuitous assumption of the
possibility (according to the hypothesis under trial) of a state
of things which does not result from the partial solution already
obtained, and which the analysis, if wholly carried out, would
have proved to be impossible, to argue that the hypothesis is
 absurd.
   In  conclusion,   I  will merely explain what I meant by saying
that  I did not   regard   the hypothesis of spherical waves, as an
hypothesis.     I  consider it axiomatic that the initial conden
sation and initial velocity may be conceived to be given arbi
trarily in a mass of elastic fluid; at least if no abrupt varia
tions be supposed to exist in the initial condensation or velo
city: such abrupt variations, in so far as they are admissible,
may be afterwards considered as limiting cases of continuous
variations.    Consequently we may without absurdity conceive
the initial condensation and initial velocity to be arranged
symmetrically about a centre.          But in this case the conden
sation and   velocity    must be    symmetrical    with respect to the
centre  during   the whole     motion;   because if we draw any two
radii vectores from the centre, whatever we can say of the one
we can say of the other; and therefore the velocity will be
directed to or from the centre, and the condensation and ve
locity will be functions of r and of t. This will be equally
true whether we neglect or take account of the development

    Shea butter appears to be the same as that which is called
Galam butter, and is derived from a species of Bassia; but the
species has not yet been made out, as no specimens of the
flower and fruit have reached botanists.                The       upon which                 oil

acid contained in the shea butter, it is obvious it is margaric
acid, the same substance which is found in the human fat
and in butter.   There is little doubt that on examination this
acid will be found extensively distributed in the vegetable

   The acid was not quite pure; for when heated it softened
at 143°, became very soft at 149°, of the consistence of cream
at 150°, and quite fluid at 154°; it obviously therefore retained
some stearic acid, but must have consisted principally of mar
garic acid, as stearic acid fuses at 167°.   There is no doubt
that both of these oils might be advantageously employed in
soap-making, the supply apparently, from the statements of
the traders, being unlimited.
LII.  Determination of the Velocity of Sound on the princi
  ples of Hydrodynamics.    By the Rev. J. CHALLIS, M.A.,
  F.R.S., F.R.A.S., Plumian Professor of Astronomy and                              Ez
  perimental Philosophy in the University of Cambridge*.
IN myconformity with the intention expressed at the close of
       communication to the Number of the Philosophical
Magazine for last February,              I   propose now to exhibit collec
tively the whole course of the mathematical reasoning by which
I obtain, entirely on hydrodynamical principles, a value of the
velocity of sound closely agreeing with that found by obser
vation.   The importance              of the result, and the novelty of the
considerations on which               it depends, will be my excuse for
going through the reasoning somewhat in detail, and for re
peating some parts of previous communications.          It may be
proper to state at once, that I do not regard as defensible, or
pertinent, all that I have written in the course of this difficult
investigation; for instance, I have found that the new hydro
dynamical equation, the necessity of which I have elsewhere
insisted upon, is not, as I supposed, essential to the present
inquiry. My immediate object is to extract and put in logical
order what is really legitimate and essential.
   The problem to be solved                  is,
                                     the numerical determination
    the velocity      sound from the equations     hydrodynamics.

 moreover, an antecedent objection to the supposition of plane
 waves. For on making this supposition, a particular and exact
integral of the resulting differential equation may be obtained,
 which, as I have recently shown in this Magazine by argu
 ments that need not now be repeated, admits of no interpreta
tion consistent with fluid motion.            Such inconsistency must
necessarily be significant.         The    reasoning     by which it was
arrived at being good, it clearly means that the general sup
position of plane-waves is not legitimate.
   Again, a general reason for the integrability of udz--vdy
 +wdz is given, if it be proved that in every instance of small
vibrations the motion is composed of motions in spherical
waves, that          is,
                    waves      each        in

ance, particular forms of p and f, which define a particular
kind of vibrations, it is shown that in all cases of small dis
turbances the motion is composed of such vibrations.         As the
vibrations are symmetrically disposed about an axis,            have             I

The numerical value of this quantity is         less by only 3:17 feet
than the mean result (1089'42 feet) of a large number of de
terminations of the velocity of sound by direct experiment.
     The course of this investigation has shown that the velocity
of propagation (a) resulting from the hypothesis of plane
waves, is not the correct value deducible from hydrodynamical
    rinciples. The only true value given by hydrodynamics is that
     have exhibited above. The difference between the observed
velocity of sound and the value a, has been attributed, accord
ing to a well-known theory, to the effect of the development
of heat accompanying sudden compressions of the air, and of
absorption of heat accompanying sudden dilatations.                   The
fact of such    development    and  absorption    is established   by  ex
periments made on air in enclosed spaces.             The walls of the
enclosure, by preventing the immediate escape of the deve
 loped heat, and the immediate restitution of the absorbed
 heat, allow of ascertaining the fact by the thermometer.             The
 same development and absorption of heat must accompany the
 condensations and rarefactions of aerial vibrations.             But the
 absence of     enclosing  walls makes an essential difference be
 tween this case and that of the experiment just mentioned. It
                                                                                       *
 may not unreasonably be supposed that the thermometric
 effect in the experiment is wholly due to reflexions at the
 walls of the enclosure, by which the developed heat or cold is
  made to traverse the enclosed air numberless times in an                                          in
  appreciable interval, and thus produces a sudden change of
  temperature.      In a similar manner, when heat is
  from the earth's surface into a clear sky, as soon as a clou
  comes over, the air between the cloud and the earth, beco
  ming in some degree enclosed, and being traversed by the heat
  reflected from the one to the other, has              temperature im
                                                                   its

366          Mr.   J.   Glaisher's Remarks on the Weather
ascribes to the air of preventing the immediate escape of the
developed heat or cold be demonstrated. At present this pro
perty is hypothetical.     The argument contained in this com
munication would rather point to the inference, that the de
veloped heat or cold instantly passes off in a radiant form,
without producing any very appreciable alteration of the state
of temperature of the air where it is generated.
[...
    The mathematical investigation of the velocity of sound
which I have now expounded, originated in an attempt to ex
  lain theoretically the polarization of light exclusively on
                   principles, the aether being treated as a con
tinuous medium, the pressure of which, as in air of given
temperature, varies in the same proportion as the density.
My views on this subject are contained in several recent com
munications to the Cambridge Philosophical Society.        In the
course of the  inquiry   I found that the velocity of propagation
in such a medium was not the value a, as generally supposed,
but a certain greater quantity, a V 1 + k, and that the explai
nation of the phaeromena of polarization essentially depended
on this result.  It was clearly, therefore, important to obtain
a numerical value of a V1 +k which could be tested by actual
observation of the velocity of sound.    This I consider that I
have now done, and that         I
                              have thus removed an objection
which otherwise might have been urged against the proposed
theory of the polarization of light.

attention to their instruments than hitherto.   The results are
therefore found to be more accordant with each other than
any previously received.
   Till January 7 and after March 18, the temperature of the
air was below         average value; the mean amount

   The interval of time between January 8 and March 17 was
distinguished by very unusual warmth for the season.           The
average daily excess of temperature within this period was
6°1 ; on four of the days this exceeded 12°, on three days it
exceeded 13°, and on two days it was greater than 14°.
   The mean temperature of the three months ending Febru
ary, constituting, in fact, the three winter months, was 42°5,
being no less than 4°7 above the average temperature of the
same time for seventy years. The warmest winters within this
period were those ending February 1796, 1822, 1834 and 1846,
and which were 43°:2, 42°4, 43°0 and 43°-2 respectively.
   The pressure of the atmosphere during the month of Fe
bruary was very unusual.       The average reading of the baro
meter from the 1st of February till the 18th was 30°36 inches
at the height of 160 feet: this was fully half an inch above                         its
average value. This denotes          increasean   the volumein   air            of
of about one-sixtieth part above the usual quantity.        On the
11th day the very unusual reading                      of
                                              80-715 inches took
place. The true reading for the whole day, reduced and cor
rected   to 32° Fahrenheit, was 30-695 inches, showing that
about one-thirtieth more than the usual quantity            air was        of
over  England      thison
                        day.    The   reading               of
                                                  the barometer                      on
the 11th day, reduced             to
                            the level             of
                                         the sea, was 30-91 inches.
in InDecember 1778 the reduced reading was 30.90 inches;
     January 1825      was 30.92 inches +.

                  the past quarter, both with respect         pressure to
and   heat,  has been  very   unusual.
   From the discussion of the observations which have been
made    atthe Apartments        the Royal Society since 1774, there
                                   of
appears      to   be   no
                    foundation for the opinion that hot summer    a
either precedes         or
                      follows     cold winter;

warm winters.

                                             of                 would      it
seem that for some time       past  causes have been         operationin
which have raised the temperature: these causes probably
still exist, and therefore there seems              every probability
                                                       to   be

    The reading for the month of February, exceeding 30:1
inches at the height of 160 feet, is very remarkable.     Since
the year 1774 there have been eight such instances only :
these occurred in July 1800, April 1801, November 1805,
April 1817, February 1821, January 1825, December 1834,
and December 1843.
    The average weight of a cubic foot of air under the average
temperature, humidity, and pressure, was 549 grains; the
average for the seven preceding years was 546 grains.
    The rain fallen at Greenwich in January was 1-6 inch; in
 February was 2.2 inches; and in March was 0.5 inch. The
amount for the quarter was 4.24 inches. The average amount
 for the preceding eight years was 5' 14 inches.
    The temperature of the water of the Thames was 43°8 by
day, and 42°1 by night.      The water, on an average, was 1°
 warmer than the air.
    The direction of the wind at Greenwich from January 1 to 6
 was N.E.; from January 7 to 28 was S.W.; on January 29
 was N.N.W.; from January 30 to March 7 was at times
 variable, but chiefly S.W.; from March 8 to 17 was mostly
 N.W.; from March 18 to 28 was chiefly N.E.; and after
 wards it was mostly S.S.W. to the end of the month.
    At Leicester the direction of the wind was S.W. during
 seventy-six days within the quarter.
     The daily horizontal movement of the air from January 1 to
 6 was about 90 miles; the greatest value was 200 miles; from
 January 7 to 28 was 240 miles; the greatest was 500 miles;
 and from January 30 to March 28 it was 110 miles; the great
 est was 320 miles.     The movement of the air in the month of
  March was small.
     The average daily ranges of the thermometer in air at the
  height of four feet, were 10°.8 in January, 12°-9 in February,
  and 13°-8 in March. The average ranges for these three
  months, from the observations of the eight preceding years,
  were 8° 1, 9°-6, and 13°4 respectively.
     The readings of the thermometer on grass in January were
  below 20° on three nights, the lowest was 17°; at and below
  32° on fourteen nights; between 32° and 40° on six nights;
  above 40° on six nights; and on one night it was 50°.
     In February the lowest reading was 20°, and the readings
  were below 32° on eleven nights; between 32° and 40° on eight
  nights, and above 40° on seven nights.    In March the lowest
  reading was 21°; and the readings were below 32° on sixteen
  nights; between 32° and 40° on twelve nights; and above 40°
  on three nights.
     The mean amount of cloud was 7-5, being the same as the
  average for the preceding eight years.

370       Mr.   J. Glaisher's Remarks on the Weather
   There were nine exhibitions of the aurora borealis during
the quarter ending March 31, 1849, which occurred on Janu
ary i4, and were seen at Aylesbury, Whitehaven and Maiden
stone Hill; on January 15 at Hartwell; on February 18 at
Wakefield; on the 19th at Stone, Whitehaven and Wakefield;
on the 20th at Whitehaven, Hartwell and Greenwich; on the

Norwich, Newcastle and Greenwich; on the 23rd at White
haven and Hartwell; and on March 18 at Stone.
    Thunder-storms occurred on January 10 at Whitehaven;
on January 14 at Norwich; on February 25 at Truro; and
on March 81 at Uckfield.
    Hail fell at Norwich and Hartwell on January 14; at New
castle on February 22; at Wakefield on February 23; at Saf
from Walden on March 8.
    Snow fell at Saffron Walden on January 4; at Leicester,
Saffron Walden, Highfield House, and Southampton on          Ja
nuary 5; at Saffron Walden on January 29; at Stone, Hart
well, Norwich, and Saffron Walden on February 28; at Stone
and Saffron Walden on March 24 and 25 ; at Stone on the
 28th; and at Norwich on the 31st.
    Solar halos were seen at Greenwich on February 26 and
 on March 30.
    Lunar halos were seen at Greenwich on January 6, and at
 Stone on February 27, March 7, 8 and 31.
    Žodiacal light was seen at Whitehaven on February 11.
    The reading of the barometer was above 30 inches on the
 1st of January; it decreased to 29'58 by the 3rd, and        in
 creased to 29.93 by the 6th. During the evening of the 7th
it decreased quickly, and was 294 on the 8th and 9th. On
the 10th the lowest reading in the month took place, and was
 28:83; on the 11th it increased rapidly, and was 29.85 at
 midnight, and passed the point 30 early on the morning of the
 12th.   On the 13th and 14th the readings decreased, and
 were 29-31 on the latter day, and then it increased with slight
 exceptions till the evening of the 23rd, when the reading was
 30828, being the highest during the month; it then decreased,
 slowly at first, and rapidly during the afternoon of the 27th.
 The reading was 29-26 on the evening of the 28th, after which
 it increased, and was 30' 16 at the end of the month. In
 February the average reading from the 1st to the 18th was
 30°36.   On the 11th, in the evening, the very extraordinary
reading of 30.715 took place.      On the 19th the reading de
 scended below 30    inches;  on the 20th the decrease was 0-4;
 on the 21st and 22nd the reading was about 29:7; on the
 24th and 25th the decrease both days was about 0.25, and the
reading was 29:21 on the evening of the 25th; it increased 0-5

on the 26th, and still further increased 0.25 on the 27th. The
reading at this time was 29.91 at midnight.        On the 28th it
decreased   rapidly,  and was 29:20 at   midnight,  being the low
est in the month.     The range within this month was 2.52                                          in
ches.
    On the 2nd of March the reading passed the point 30 inches,
and on the 6th the highest reading in the month took place,
viz. 30°48; after this the changes were small till the 26th,
the reading being above                 an its
                               average value. On the 27th the
reading decreased half         inch, and     the 28th the lowest  on
reading took place       the month, 29:18, and
                                 in                  remained low           it

           Mr.  J. Glaisher's  Remarks on the Weather.       373
of 52°, including Chichester and Hartwell, is 41°4; for those
places situated between the latitudes of 52° and 53°, including
Saffron Walden and Leicester, is 40°7; for those places
situated between the latitudes of 53° and 54°, including Derby
and York, is 40°:2; and for Whitehaven, Durham and New
castle is 40°5. These values may be considered as those of
the mean temperatures of the air for those parallels of latitude
during the quarter ending March 31, 1849.
    The average daily range of temperature in Cornwall and
Devonshire was 10°4; at Liverpool and Whitehaven was
6°7; south of latitude 52° was 12°.6; between the latitudes of
52°and 54° was 11°5; and at Durham and Newcastle was 11°5.
    The greatest mean daily ranges of the temperature of the air
took place at Hartwell, Aylesbury, and Latimer; in fact, in
and near the vale of Aylesbury; and the least occurred at
Whitehaven, Liverpool and Guernsey.
    The highest thermometer readings during the quarter were
65° at Highfield House, 63°7 at Hartwell, and 63°-5 at La
timer.    The lowest thermometer readings were 10°-0 at Saf.
fron   Walden,   11°-0 at Leeds, and 12°O at Hartwell.       The
extreme range of temperature of the air during the quarter in
England was therefore about 55°, most likely somewhat less
than this value.
    The average quarterly range of the reading of the thermo
meter in Cornwall and Devonshire was 28°1; at Liverpool
and Whitehaven was 33°-5; south of latitude 52° was 40°3;
and north of 52° was 42°1.
    The mean temperature of the dew-point in Cornwall and
Devonshire was 41°1; south of latitude 52° was 37°6; be
tween the latitudes of 52° and 53° was 36°-5, and north of 53°
 was 37°2.
    The direction of the wind has been mostly south-west; at
some few places it seems to have prevailed for some time from
 the north-west.
    From the numbers in the tenth column the distribution of
clouds has been such as to cover about three-fifths of the whole
 skv.
    film has fallen on the greatest number of days at Wakefield,
 Falmouth, Truro and Helston. The average number at these
 places was 53. It fell on the least number of days at Oxford,
 Saffron Walden, Durham and Leicester, and the average
 number at these places was 35.       The stations at which the
 largest falls have taken place were Stonyhurst, Falmouth,
 Whitehaven and Leeds. The falls were smallest in amount
 at Durham particularly, York, Holkham and Oxford.            The
 average fall in the counties of Cornwall and Devonshire was
 7-2 inches; south of latitude 52° was 5-1 inches; between

374.       On Sines and Cosines                            of Multiples of                 a variable angle,
 latitudes 52 and 53 was 4 inches; and south of 53°, omitting
 Stonyhurst, was 4-3 inches.
    The smallness of the fall at Durham is remarkable; between
January 31 and March 28 only 0:14 inch fell.
    The numbers in column 14 to 18 show the mean values of
the hygrometrical results at every station; from which we find
that—
    The mean weight of vapour in a cubic foot of air                                                             for   all

376             Mr. T.      J.    Herapath on             some     Combinations of
of caustic ammonia (I., IV.).                         It would also appear to be pro
duced when the basic acetate of lead is imperfectly precipitated
by biborate of soda (II., V.), or when an acid solution of either
of the subsequently described borates is supersaturated by
strong liquor ammoniae (III., VI.).
      It is a heavy, white, amorphous powder, which is almost
 insoluble in water, both hot and cold.                   It is perfectly inso
 luble in alcohol. It dissolves with great facility in dilute nitric
 acid, even when cold, and likewise in boiling acetic acid; from
  these solutions it may be again precipitated unaltered, by
  adding a large excess of ammonia.                  It is easily decomposed
  by sulphuric and hydrochloric acids, and likewise by a boil
  ing solution of caustic potash or soda. Before the blowpipe,
   it intumesces, gives off water, and becomes dark in colour;
   and at a low red heat fuses into a clear colourless glass, which
   possesses a specific gravity of 5'5984, at 56°F., and is softer
   than common flint-glass.            Heated to redness on charcoal, it
   is   partially   reduced,   and the fused mass contains numerous
   globules of metallic lead.
       The following are the results of my analysis of the hydrated
    salt, after it had been exposed to a temperature of about 212°F,
    in a Liebig's drying-tube, for three or four hours.

   Sesquiborate of Lead, 2PbO-F3BO”.—The salt which is
produced when a boiling solution of the nitrate, or any other
soluble salt of lead is precipitated by a great excess of bibo
rate of soda, has been hitherto considered by chemists to be
composed of PbO-H2BO'.             According to my experiments,
however, it would appear to consist of 2PbO + 3BO'.             It is a
white powder, like the preceding, which it closely resembles
in   its
       properties.    Before the blowpipe        fuses into    colour               it                    a

He must have been very unobservant of public events of late years
who is not aware that statistics may be made use of with equal con
fidence to support any side of any question.        Hence the cautious
inquirer who really desires to get at some actual and permanent
result, will always look with extreme suspicion upon every thing
that comes before him with an ostentatious parade of statistics,
aware that there is nothing so easily abused, nothing which is more
liable to abuse.
   But a perusal of these pages has shown us that mere statistics form
but a very subordinate part of the design of the author. A long and
intimate practical acquaintance with mines and mining operations in
different parts of the world had necessarily led him to amass a great
quantity of materials; the value of which, as a constant object of
reference for his own use, led him to feel the utility of a digested
and methodized arrangement of those materials, in a permanent
shape, for the use of others.     But there is found throughout these
pages a pervading spirit beyond that merely materialistic and dry
one which the title would indicate, and which the professional en
gagements of the author might have led us to anticipate.        We per
ceive impressed on every section the idea, not of coal the mere wealth
producer, the mere material instrument of the human animal, but of
coal as an important agent in promoting civilization. “We take it
for granted,” are the first words of the introduction, “that every one
who may chance to peruse the summary of statistics of mineral fuel
which we have embodied in the present section will be impressed
with the immense importance of those substances, particularly as
developed of late years; how vastly enlarged the area and bulk of
their production in all countries; how essential they now are to
the comfort of the human family; how much they have done towards
the extension of the useful arts; how gloriously they have aided the
progress of invention and improvement; how mighty are the results
which have followed their increased application.” (P. xiii.)         And
again in p. lxxxiv. the author justly says: “Respecting the won
drous influence which the employment of mineral combustibles has
had, even in our own days, upon the whole world, by the acquisition
of new forces; by the extension of mechanical powers, of manufac
turing capabilities; by the impulse given to the industrial arts and
the creation of new sources of wealth; by rapid and cheap modes of
transportation and enlarged commercial facilities; above all, by the
 improved condition of the people, we will not here dilate. Abundant
evidence of all these will be found in this volume.”   It is in the same
spirit, and imbued with the same everywhere pervading high moral
sentiment, that the author more than once (pp. xiv. and xxxviii)
calls attention to the vastly greater importance of iron than of gold
and silver,-a truth which it is not by any means beside the mark
to touch upon in these days of California-mania.     Adam Smith long
ago remarked that the adventurer in a silver mine ran every pro
bability of being ruined, but that the adventurer in a gold mine
was certain of being ruined.       It will not be amiss to put, beside
such an   authority,  the following passage from the work before us   :-

  And    it not only
                  is         these respects that the author departs from
                                      in
a mere dry statistical detail.        He justly considers every matter con

intimate something like a wish that we had, in Great Britain, a

is awake to the fact that such “official” completeness is only to be
obtained at the price of the sacrifice of national liberty and individual

 ancient Icelandic Saga in which we find this word used in a way
 which clearly shows that something very different was meant by it
 from that heavy mineral which we commonly now call “coal.”             In
 the Saga which relates the explorations of Thorfinn Karlsefni on
 the American coast, A.D. 1008, we find it related that, when his
 party were on that part of the coast now known as Rhode Island,
 they had some encounters with the natives. It is expressly told
 how these latter came, on one occasion, in their canoes in numbers
 “as many as if coals had been strewn upon the bay” (svá mart sem
 kolum vari sat fyrir hopit).      What the sort of coals were which,
as floating on the surface of the water, suggested this simile we will
 not undertake to say, but they were certainly much more likely to
 have been charcoal or peat than stone coal. The name remains
however no less apt at this day than it was at that in its application
to the substance, in each case of vegetable origin, which is used as
fuel,-whether that substance be the peat, spongy and light, of yes
terday's growth, or the prostrate giant trees, compressed and heavy,
which grew and flourished and were embedded in ages of unknown
remoteness.     It is interesting to find that the following passage will
properly include coals of every age, and of every growth, and of
every shade of meaning of the word, ancient or modern :—
    “Each stratum of coal is the product of a peculiar vegetation,
frequently different from that which precedes and that which follows
it,-vegetations which have given rise to the superior and inferior
layers of coal. Each stratum resulting in this manner from a distinct
vegetation, is frequently characterized by the predominance of
certain impressions of plants; and the miners, in numerous cases,
distinguish the different strata which they remove by the practical
knowledge they possess of the accompanying fossils.          Any seam of
coal and             its
               overlying rock       slate should consequently contain
                                                      or
the various parts      the living plants

and,       by
         carefully studying the association         these various fossils,      of
which form      many special floras, containing generally but few spe

                                     reconstruct these anomalous forms
of the ancient world.” (P. xc.)

 sufficient for the whole trade.           At the present day there are several
 thousand ships constantly engaged in the transportation of that
 combustible.” In 1845 upwards of thirty-four millions of tons of coal
 were produced in Great Britain (p. 259); and in the same year
  11,987 ships' cargoes of coal were entered for duty at the port of
  London alone.        As many as 282 cargoes, amounting to upwards of
  80,000 tons,—have been sold in the City of London Coal-market in
  one day (p. 263).           And the iron manufacture has followed with no
  halting steps upon this amazing increase in the production of coal.
  It is not seventy years since William Hutton wrote his History of
  Birmingham. He alludes to an iron furnace in the neighbourhood
  of that town, and calculates the age of those iron-works from                                               the

and a quarter of tons, for the service of the neighbouring states.”
(p. 20.) . Further on, the author, in the spirit which we have already
remarked as pervading the entire work, concludes another division
of the same subject by the observation: “It is beyond the scope of
human vision to contemplate, in our day, the results associated with
these millions,—the industrial facilities, the wealth, and power, and
influence at home and abroad, which they must inevitably confer
upon the future inhabitants of the country.” (P. 33.)
    Another illustration of a more special nature, of a means of the
consumption of coal accompanied by a vast amount of benefit and
comfort to the community, is touched upon in this work, which we
cannot omit to notice.     “It was in 1803,” says the author, “that
 Mr. Winsor first exhibited the effect of gas-light at the Lyceum
Theatre, London.”      It appears that there were in London in 1845
nineteen gas companies, who produced, on an average, 10,000,000
cubic feet of gas every twenty-four hours, which is at the rate of
3,650,000,000 cubic feet a year. The whole number of lights is
calculated at 100,000.     In 1838 these London gas companies alone
consumed 340,000 tons of coals annually.
    It would be obviously impossible to direct attention to all the
 matters, however great their interest, which are discussed in this
volume.     We must content ourselves with referring to two more
 points, both of them of much importance, and both of them among
 those numerous ones which we have already said that the title of the
 volume will hardly lead the reader to expect to find discussed
within it.
   The comparative merits of anthracite and bituminous coal are very
fully discussed in all their bearings, as to the application of each,
both to domestic use and to manufacturing purposes. We are espe
cially glad thus to see done “justice to anthracite in pointing out
the incalculable value of a species of fuel previously rejected and
despised, as amongst the most inferior and most impracticable of all
the combustibles.” (P. 365.)      It cannot be denied that an absurd
prejudice still exists in this country against the use of anthracite
coal. Our countrymen seem in love with smoke. Two centuries ago
“the famous city of London petitioned the parliament of England
against two nuisances or offensive commodities which were likely to
come into great use and esteem,” one of which was “Newcastle
coals, in regard of their stench,” &c. (P. xl.) But the citizens seem
to have now become in love with that same stench ; and, while no
effectual means have been taken, as they might be, to prevent the
waste of material which takes place in the escape of smoke,
which is the mere result of imperfect combustion—the use of the
smokeless anthracite encounters hopeless prejudices.       Our author
well remarks, that “the difficulty suggested about ignition, even
were it found so in practice [which it is not in reality], is deprived
of  all weight, from the consideration that, with ordinary attention,
                                                                    of up

anthracite to emit a greater amount of noxious vapours during com
bustion than bituminous coal, is contradicted by the daily experience
of those who employ the former in their apartments, and is much
less objectionable on that head than bituminous coal. Our tables of
analyses at the end of this volume will, if doubts remain, decide
this matter.    In fact, they show that the anthracites contain less
sulphur than the blazing coal.” (P. 92.)
   We can speak on this matter from our own experience, having
ourselves used the anthracite coal for many years, both in open
grates and in various other ways, and having always found it pro
ductive of far less trouble and of far greater comfort than any kind
of bituminous coal. We cannot conceive the inducement by which
we should be persuaded to return to the use of the smoke-giving
system. The matter is one of importance in other respects in this
country, besides those of present health, cleanliness, and comfort;
for we are told by our author that “Great Britain possesses a                                                far
larger area            of
               anthracite than exists    America      any other part
                                                                  in                  or
 of     the world.” (P. 92.)
        Another matter, not unconnected      several respects with the last,

 which is covered with perpetual snow. The elevation of this moun
 tain can scarcely be less than about 20,000 feet, and from other
 sources we learn that it is crossed by the road to the country of Mono
 Moezi. In the native languages of this part of Africa “Moezi”
 means “moon; ” so that it is not unreasonable to conclude, as Dr.
 Beke does, that Mount Kilimandjáro forms a portion of the “Moun
 tains of the Moon,” in which Ptolemy places the sources of the Nile,
 and the snows of which he describes as being received into the lakes
 of that river.
     It   is by proceeding into the interior westwards from Mombas that
Dr. Bialloblotzky, whose exploratory journey into Eastern Africa has
on several occasions been noticed in this Journal, expects to reach
the sources of the Nile; and the discovery of this snowy mountain
and high table-land so near the coast argues favourably for the suc
cess of his undertaking. According to the last letters received from
him, he arrived on January 3rd at Muscat, whither he had gone on
by steamer from Aden and Maculla; and he was there looking for a
native vessel to take him across to Mombas or Zanzibar.

 ON          THE WANADIATE  OF LEAD AND THE DOUBLE VANADIATE
               OF LEAD AND COPPER.  B.Y. M. IGNACE DOMEIKO.
    The formation of secondary porphyry of Chili, which has been
already remarkable for specimens of the native amalgam of Arque
ros, and of iodide of silver of Algodones, also contains a very rich
formation of vanadiate of lead and of copper.
    The mine in which these specimens were discovered is twelve kilo
metres to the east of the silver mines of Arqueros, and is known by
the name of the Mina Grande, or Mina de la Marqueza, and was con
sidered as one of the richest silver mines in Chili.           A miner who
was about to recommence        working    the mine, found a heavy yellow
mineral, which he brought to Coquimbo for analysis.             It was found
by M. Domeiko to be very poor in silver, but contained vanadium.
    This mineral is of a dirty yellow colour, sometimes of a sulphur
yellow, or slightly orange or greenish;           powder             yellowish     its                is   of   a

volatilizable by calcination out of contact of the air. This result
certainly does not prove the igneous origin of these diamonds, but
renders improbable the idea expressed by M. Liebig, that diamonds
are derived from the transformation of organic vegetable matter.
   The three specimens were successively burnt in pure oxygen gas
in the apparatus employed by M. Dumas for the combustion of the
diamond.      The oxygen obtained from chlorate of potash was con
tained in a gasometer; it was dried and purified before it reached
the combustion-tube by passing through two tubes containing sul
phuric acid and pumice, and one tube with potash; employing this
method with the precautions indicated by M. Dumas, 100 of the
                                      Carbon.               Ash.       Loss.

   In the combustion of the first specimen only one bulb-tube with
potash was employed, so that a portion of the carbonic acid produced
by the combustion was lost; but in the other two experiments, in
which two bulb-tubes containing potash were used, the second                    in
creased in weight some centigrammes.
   The two last analyses prove perfectly that the specimens are com
posed entirely of carbon and ash. The ash was yellowish, and in
the first specimen it had retained the form of the diamond.                   When
examined by the microscope, the ash appeared to be composed of
ferruginous alumina and small transparent crystals, the form of
which could not be ascertained.—L'Institut, Mars 2, 1849.

                   IMPURITY OF COMMERCIAL BROMINE, *
       M.  Poselger,  in distilling some samples of commercial bromine,
    found that the   boiling-point   was not 122°F., but 248°F.; and that
    the colour of the   liquid   became gradually lighter, till it was even
    tually quite colourless. On continuing the distillation to dryness,
    he obtained a residue of charcoal.       On separating the bromine from
    the last portions  of the distilled liquid by means of a solution of pot
    ash, an aromatic, oily, colourless liquid was obtained, which analysis
    proved to be carburet of bromine; this existed in various specimens
    of bromine to the extent of 6 or 8 per cent., and there is every reason
    to conclude that it was derived from the aether employed in the pre
    paration of this substance.—Journ. de Ph. et de Ch., Février 1849,

consist, not of strict mathematical investigation, but of ana
logies and conjectures; and will therefore be fairly liable to

November Number of your Journal, with the diagrams drawn
by me in the Encyclopædia Metropolitana.                   But have pre                           I
ferred to show, step by step, that there is strong analogy in
every part of the mathematical process in the two cases.
   The rapid change of velocity implies in both cases very
violent forces of compression among the particles; and very
sudden alterations of the surface for the water, and very rapid
expansions for the air.
   Now in the case of waves of water we cannot by mathema
tical process (so far as I know) pursue the investigation of the
condition of the particles to               limit, but we canits         some                             in

          I
     should propose to apply the term hyper-algebraic to typal

Ought we to apply the word hyper-algebraic to impossible
quantity? I think not.                                 If I
                                may be permitted to use the term
possible so as to include under it not only real quantities but
also the unreal quantities of ordinary algebra, I would suggest
that it is only in respect of certain anomalous resultst (re
sults, however, that do not defy explanation f) that impossible
differs from possible quantity, and consequently that impossible
quantity must be regarded as algebraic.      It is unquestionably

   * My friend Professor Davies has (supra, p. 37, and vol. xxix. p. 171–
175) intimated or expressed an opinion adverse to the interpretability of
the symbol           V-Iin geometry.                     If
                                           eminence in geometric science can
confer a right, not only to express such an opinion, but to have that ex
pression duly weighed, then I think that there are few, if any, English geo
meters who possess those rights more unquestionably.              I must however
confess that I do not see the force of the reasoning employed in Mr. Davies's
proposition (Ib. p. 174). The inconsistency alluded to in paragraph 4 of the
  roposition could never arise—at least 1 am unable to perceive how it could.

sions with L, rose from the true sun, passed through the ver
tex of the circle A, where it cut the segment L, and stretched
out towards the north-east. This was inverted with respect
to L. 10° of a circle of large dimensions also cut the seg
ment L at P. On the west horizon a few long muddy cirro
strati were just visible above the fog.
   1n 15m. The circle A alone remained, the other portion of
the phaenomenon having disappeared soon after 1*10*.
   1h 30m.   More clouds; the halo A fainter; but another
feature was at this hour traceable—a ring, Q, fig. 7, whose
centre was a few degrees above the true sun, cut the circle A
at R and the circle G at                         T;
                                 the vertical diameter was 70°
and the horizontal diameter 55°.     The circle A had become
more elliptical;                 its   vertical diameter was 48° and                 its   horizontal
diameter 444°.

                                       in
the point   X,   which was distant 70° from the sun. These
segments both went eastward; there were again three mock
suns visible, viz. M,        and C; the latter was bright but
                                            N

introduced into the numerical process.      shall only observe,             I
in conclusion, that, by using other conjugate forms, it is easy
to see how equations of an odd degree may be brought, in a
direct manner, under the operation of the above method; or,
without using any change of form at all, the method becomes
immediately applicable upon introducing, into an equation of
an odd degree, the new root a = 0; or by supposing this to be
done after the partial analysis of the equation in       original                           its

perposition of an indefinite number of curves, having for their
bases, some the entire length of the string, and others the half,
the third, the quarter, &c.                        If
                                   these different curves were taken
separately for the figure of the string, the fundamental note
would be heard for the first, the octave for the second, the
twelfth for the third, &c.       Now analysis shows that if the
ordinates of the initial figure were the sums of those which
correspond to any number of these curves, the ordinates vari
able with the time would always be the sums of those which
should correspond to them, at the same instant, in the partial
motions answering to each of the curves, taken as initial figure.
Thence Daniel Bernouilli concludes that the movement of
each point being capable of being decomposed into a succes
sion of others, which, if they existed singly, would give the
sounds 1, 2, 3, 4, &c.,                     all
                               these sounds must necessarily                                              be
heard       at
           once.   He expresses himself          follows,     the par     as              in
ticular case     which the octave alone
                      in                        heard   along  with      is                               its
fundamental sound:—“This absolute movement                   the point                    of

                                                                                                         be B.

The number                 of
                    the first  periodical    returns will always
double that           of
                 the second.     The mind    perceives  each species of
these periodical returns, and thence remarks two sounds, one of
which   isthe octave            of
                        the other.”
   This rather subtile explanation, however, did not satisfy
all geometers; and        reality                  explanation, since         an
                                    is innot              it   is

   Lagrange well observed, that this decomposition                  the                             of
movement was purely geometrical conception, but one which
                           a
proved nothing relative          the sound produced;

that this sound could alone result from the absolute movement,
which   was single.  Daniel                          Bernouilli was much surprised                        at
these objections, which

higher than    a fifth, and the nodal lines were the two diagonals
of the  plate.
   If now, after producing one of these sounds, which con
tinues for a considerable time, the bow is employed in the
same manner as when it is used to produce the other sound
when the plate is at rest, the two sounds are heard at once:
the nodal lines disappear, as M. Savart had remarked, and
as Daniel Bernouilli had already observed in the case of
strings.    There only remains to determine the relation of the
number of vibrations executed in the same time by two points
situated near each of the modal lines, which only exist when
each sound takes place separately. This I have done by means
of the apparatus already mentioned; and I constantly found
the relation of 31 or 32 to 45, as I ought to find for the two
sounds, whose distance was a little less than a fifth.
   I should add that another verification, less susceptible of
accuracy, might be made.        On bringing the ear close to one
.
of the corners, scarcely any but the low note was heard; and,
on the contrary, on bringing it near to the middle of one side,
only the high note was heard; whence it appeared to follow,
      the two sounds were produced by different parts of the
plate.
   I sought on the outline the point of separation of the parts
related to each number of vibrations; but this point varies
with the relation of the intensities of the two causes of vibra
tion, and this inquiry is only of secondary interest.
   I communicated these results to M. Savart, and he wished
immediately to repeat the experiment with me, employing
resonant tubes, which he put in unison, first with one sound
and then with the other.       On bringing one of the tubes in
succession close to the different parts of the plate, the sound
was considerably strengthened in some, and was not percep
tibly in others; the first appeared therefore only to produce
the sound of this tube; the second produced a similar effect
with the second tube. These results perfectly agree with
Inline,
   We finally considered the simultaneous sounds produced
by a large bell, and thought that we perceived in the case of
two, and even of three sounds, that each of them existed singly
in the same part of the surface. We did not perform this
experiment with the same degree of precision as the first,
because the result presented itself naturally as it was expected.
   Both the reasonings, therefore, and the experiments in
question, led to the admission of this general
                                                   law of the co
existence of sounds, that—
   When one and      the
                     same vibrating surface simultaneously emits

several sounds, each of them exists in one or more finite parts of
the surface, and appears to be perceptible there only, so that
the ear is affected as it would be by several separate surfaces,
which should each give one only of the sounds in question.
   In this memoir, resting on new facts, which first arrived        I
at theoretically and then demonstrated by experiment, I
attempted to bring the phaenomenon in question under another
class of phaenomena admitted without dispute, and which con
                                              .
sists in our perceiving simultaneously the sounds produced by
the vibrations of different points. These inductions were not
disputed by any physicist M. Poisson himself, who was much
occupied with acoustics, raised no objection to them. It is to
this same class of phaenomena that I      proceed now to refer
those under consideration; but it will be by means of a more
simple and at the same time more general theory, which will
supply the voids and uncertainties which still existed, and
which induced me to engage anew in this subject.
General      explanation   of    the simultaneous         sounds produced by
                                a single body.
     We admit that when         several points      of   a medium have         dif
ferent vibratory movements, we hear, in general, the different
sounds which each of them would give if it alone were in
motion; and we propose to refer to this phaenomenon that of
the perception of several simultaneous sounds produced by a
single point in motion.     In other words, it has to be proved
that our organs are sensibly affected in the same manner by
several movements existing in distinct points of the surround
ing medium, as by a single movement resulting from the com
position of the several movements in a single point of this me
                                          -
dium.
   In the first place, when a point of the medium is not at a
very small distance from the ear,           movement produces
                                              its                                  in
                                                         if do
all parts    of
             our   organ movements which           not differ percep
tibly from those which would take place,           for the first point

    But, according to the preceding remark, our organs will
 be affected in the same manner by the movement of a point of
 the medium, or by an identical movement attributed to another
 point near the first. Hence results the following propo
 sition:—
    When any point of the medium which surrounds us is affected
 by a movement resulting from the composition of several others,
 all parts of our organs are sensibly affected in the same man
 ner as they would be                       if
                               these different component movements,
 instead of  being  united in the same point, existed separately at
 different points  of the first.
          And reciprocally:—
          If               medium affected by different vibratory
            several points of a
movements cause us to hear several sounds at once, it will suffice,
in order that a single point of the medium should cause us to

              Experiments which confirm the preceding theory.
    The theoretical considerations on which I have founded
 the explanation of the multiple sounds of bodies, seem to me
 incapable of giving rise to any difficulty; and the assump
 tion cannot be denied, that the movement of a single point
 may produce the sensation of several sounds, as soon as we
 admit that this effect may result from the movement of several.
Nevertheless I have thought it not uninteresting to demon
strate this fact experimentally. The first thing required was to
find an accurate method for determining the sound given by
each point of the surface of the vibrating body.    I was at first
obliged to give up that which I had already employed, to depict
upon a disturbed plane the movement of the vibrating point,
since the object was to verify a sensation; and it could not
  even have been affirmed that a movement which might have
  appeared to depict the same vibrations as when only one sound
  was heard, would not have contained some difference imper
 ceptible to the eye, but which would have produced an effect
 sensible to the ear: it was therefore to be referred solely to
 this last sense.    I tried different processes, the results of which
 were always attended with uncertainty, and              at last stopped      I
 at that which I shall     proceed     to describe and which is free
 from all error.
     Ishall first call to mind, that when a rod or an elastic wire,
 indefinitely extended in one direction, has             extremity sub       its
jected       any small movement, each
             to                                     points        of   its

 This proves two important things; namely, first, that the sound
 which is heard is transmitted by the wire alone; and in the
 second place, that it only proceeds from the point where it is
joined to the surface, and that the other parts of this surface
 do not act perceptibly upon it by the medium of the air; for
if that were the case, we should still hear a sound when this

           HOPE    that the Academy, which has always been pleased
           to encourage me in my researches upon electro-physio
    logy, will permit me to communicate some new investigations
    upon this subject.      I cannot commence the exposition of these
    researches without very briefly recapitulating the four principal
    points from which I started, and which, to a certain extent,
    form a summary of the whole of my former labours.
        1. In each cell of the electric organ of fishes, the two elec
    tricities become separated under the influence of the nervous
    action propagated from the brain towards the extremities of
    the nerves.                  A
                       relation exists between the direction and the
     intensity of the nervous current, and the position and the
    quantity of the two electricities developed in the cell. . In ac
    cordance with this relation which has been established expe
    rimentally,               if,
                         was done      Ampère

     I have already shown in my former researches, and by
direct experiments, the great difference between the nervous
and the muscular substance as regards the conduction of the
electric current. Regarding these experiments, which it would
 be impossible for me to describe here in detail, shall confine                     I
 myself to the account of one, the evidence afforded by which
is perfect, and which may be applied to the case in point. This
experiment consists in introducing the nerve of a very sensitive
 galvanoscopic frog into the interior of a muscular mass, cut
 with a knife in the direction of           fibres.    On passing tole
                                                           its                                    a
 rably strong electric current through the muscular mass, con
 tractions are never excited          the prepared frog.
                                                  in               this case,            In
 besides the better     conductibility        the muscular  of  substances,
 we have for the production                           of

 difference between the relative mass of the muscle and of the
 nerve.       It unnecessary

 tractions, produces the phaenomenon called induced contrac
 tion.    The experiment succeeds perfectly                      taking the         on

      M. Matteucci's    Researches on Electro-Physiology.        443
from those slight modifications which sometimes occur, espe
cially at the commencement of the experiment.
    These results can only be explained in one way. The very
powerful contraction excited in the muscles of the leg and in
the foot by the passage of the electric current, proves the
existence of a nervous current propagated from the extremi
ties towards the centre, and developed under the influence of
an electric current which traverses the muscular mass in the
 contrary direction to that of the ramification of the nerve.
    As an electric current, when propagated through a muscle,
 never leaves the muscular fibre to follow the nervous fila
 ments, we have perfect evidence that the nervous currents of
 which we have spoken are due to the influence of the electric
 states which are propagated in the muscle.
    To demonstrate the entire importance of these conclusions,
 we only require to be made acquainted with their connexion
 with the law of the electric discharge in fishes; this connexion
 is as intimate as is possible.    In fishes, the electric discharge
 arises from the   production   of a nervous current by the stimu
 lation of the nerve which is distributed in the organ.        In the
 experiments which we have described, a nervous current is
 produced by the electric discharge which is passed through
 the muscle. When this discharge is passed through the
 muscle in such a manner that the positive and negative elec
 tric states are disposed with regard to the nerves in the same
 manner as in the discharge of the electric fishes, a nervous
 current is produced by the influence of the electric current.
  This nervous current has the same direction in both cases;
  but in the discharge of the torpedo the electric states are pro
  duced by the animal, whilst in the experiment of the muscular
  contraction the nervous current is produced by the influence of
  the electric current.
     When the electric current traverses a muscular mass in a
  contrary direction to that of the ramification of the nerve, it fol
  lows, from the facts which we have established, that the electric
  current developes a nervous current, the direction of which is
  opposed to that which it developes on traversing a muscle in
  the opposite direction.    This is shown experimentally by the
  phaenomena of sensation or of pain which are produced by an
  electric current traversing a muscle in the contrary direction
  to the ramification of these nerves.

LXVI.       On Spherical Waves in an Elastic Fluid, in reply to
     Mr. Stokes. By the Rev. J. CHALLIs, M.A., F.R.S.,
     F.R.A.S., Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental
     Philosophy in the University of Cambridge".
TH:       question which has been discussed by Mr. Stokes and
      myself in several recent Numbers of this Magazine, is of
the following nature. On supposing the waves in a compress
ible fluid to be spherical,                        I
                               deduced from that supposition,
by reasoning given at length in the Philosophical Magazine
for last February, a result inconsistent with one of the funda
mental principles of hydrodynamics, viz. that of constancy of
mass. , Hence              I
                  concluded that the supposition of spherical
waves is inadmissible.    Mr. Stokes undertook to dispute this
inference.   Now  although  by an acknowledged rule of logic,
the inference could not be set aside except by showing some
fallacy in the reasoning which conducted to the absurdity,
Mr. Stokes, in three attempts to set it aside, has not once
alluded to any step in the reasoning.    In the first attempt he
produced an argument which took for granted the very point
in dispute; in the next he denied, without giving any reason,
what was altogether undeniable; in the third attempt (Phil.
Mag. for May) he admits what he before denied, and denies,
again without assigning a reason, what in the second attempt
he admitted.     The denial in this instance refers to the possi
bility of the propagation of a solitary wave of arbitrary con
densation and constant type.         infer the possibility from the
                                                       ...

principle      of
              discontinuity.    Mr. Stokes calls this inference                                      a
gratuitous assumption, without making the slightest allusion
to the principle      which    on
                                rests; and yet
                                             it     has drawn     like          he              a

                                Communicated                 by   the Author.

450       Prof. Plücker on the Magnetic Relations of the
has obtained by two courses of reasoning in the Phil. Mag.,
vol. xxxiv. pp. 54–57 and 57–59.       I cannot concede that these
results have any weight against my position, because the rea
soning from which they are derived takes for granted the
question in dispute; but I may adduce them in favour of it so
far as they exhibit inconsistencies.    The first argument, which
professes to be a general consideration of a solitary wave of
arbitrary condensation, conducts to the result that the sum of
the condensations is exactly equal to the sum of the rarefac
tions.     Now if the reasoning be restricted to the case in which
the sum of the condensations is equal to the sum of the rare
factions by the original disturbance, it ceases to be general,
and the result is a mere truism without meaning; and if it be
not so restricted, it is impossible that the result can be true.
Mr. Stokes's argument cannot escape from this dilemma. The
second argument, which applies to a case in which condensa
tion prevails over rarefaction, is included in the general argu
ment above mentioned, if that be of any value, and          leading                its
 by   adifferent process      to
                             different result

   The crystal showed, resembling in that also a magnetic
needle, strong polarity; the same end being always directed
to the north.    I think this may be a polarity of the opto-mag
netic  power.   Two questions too may easily be answered:—
1st. Is the north pole indicated by the forms of crystalliza
tion ? 2nd. Did the crystal obtain, when formed,               polarity                           its

been observed and their orbits computed; and our knowledge of the
sidereal heavens has been greatly extended, not merely in conse
quence of continued observation, but by the more general use of large
instruments.    Hence the work of 1833, however complete at that
time, necessarily leaves the student much behind the point to which
this branch of knowledge has actually attained. To supply the de
fects, record the recent discoveries, state the modifications of former
views to which they lead, and represent the science as it exists at
the present moment, are the objects of the work now before us. It
appears under an enlarged form, and with a different title; and though
the substance and arrangement of the original treatise have been
preserved, the additions and alterations are so extensive and import
ant as to render it rather a new book than a new edition of the
former one.
   The present work is divided into four parts. The first embraces                                                             .

 to the few who possess the requisite technical knowledge.            Many
 attempts have been made to give elementary explanations of the
 inequalities of the celestial motions, but seldom with much success:
 indeed, if we except Maclaurin's Account of Newton's Discoveries,
  Mr. Airy's Treatise on Gravitation, and the work now under
  review, it would be difficult to point out one from which a student
  about to enter on the works of Newton and Laplace would derive
  any considerable aid; and even in respect of these master-pieces it
  may perhaps be said, that their merit will hardly be appreciated ex
  cepting by those who have proceeded to some extent in the technical
  examination.      But Sir John Herschel has not confined himself merely
  to the illustration of methods already known.     In discussing certain
  effects of perturbation   he has struck out an  entirely  new path, and
  presented the subject in a light which certainly renders it much
  easier of comprehension; and on this account the work must be re
  garded as an important contribution to physical astronomy. To these
  new views he thus alludes in his preface:—
      “In delivering a rational as distinguished from a technical expo
  sition of this subject, the course pursued by Newton in the section
  of the Principia alluded to has by no means been servilely followed.
  As regards the perturbations of the nodes and inclinations, indeed,
  nothing equally luminous can be substituted for his explanation;
  but as respects the other disturbances, the point of view chosen by
  Newton has been abandoned for another which it is somewhat diffi
  cult to perceive why he did not, himself, select. By a different re
  solution of the disturbing forces from that adopted by him, and by
 the aid of a few obvious conclusions from the laws of elliptic motion,
 which would have found their place, naturally and consecutively, as
 corollaries of the seventeenth proposition of his first book (a propo
 sition which seems almost to have been prepared with a special view
 to this application), the momentary change of place of the upper
 focus of the disturbed ellipse is brought distinctly under inspection;
 and a clearness of conception introduced into the perturbations of
 the eccentricities, perihelia and epochs which the author does not
 think it presumptuous to believe can be obtained by no other method,
 and which certainly is not obtained by that from which it is a de
 parture. . . . . . . . The reader will find one class of the lunar and
 planetary perturbations handled in a very different manner from that
 in which their explanation is usually presented. It comprehends
those which are characterized as incident on the epoch, the principal
among them being the annual and secular equations of the moon,
and that very delicate and obscure part of the perturbational theory
 (so little satisfactory in the manner in which it emerges from the
analytical treatment of the subject), the constant or permanent effect
of the disturbing force in altering the disturbed orbit.     I will venture
to hope that what is here stated will tend to remove some rather
generally diffused misapprehensions as to the true bearings of New
ton's explanation of the annual equation.”
    The third Part relates to Sidereal Astronomy.         If the former is
that which is likely to have the fewest readers, this undoubtedly is

                    Cambridge Philosophical Society.                               455
the one which will have the greatest number.      The extreme interest
inherent in the subject would naturally secure this result; but in
the present case the interest is greatly heightened by the circum
stance, that the author himself stands in the foremost rank among
those to whose labours we are indebted for the progress recently
made in this department of astronomy.        The subject, indeed, may
be said to belong to him of hereditary right.        He has devoted to
it a large portion of the labours of his life; and after scrutinising
the heavens from pole to pole, he has here become the expositor of
the great discoveries in which he has taken so large a part, and in
language alike remarkable for its eloquence and perspicuity, has pre
sented us with an epitome of all that is known about the fixed stars,
—their parallaxes, distances and distribution—their motions, relative
and systematic—about variable and periodic stars—double stars and
binary systems—clusters and groups of stars—the classification, dis
tribution and resolvability of nebulae, the zodiacal light, &c. It may
be said without any exaggeration, that in the whole range of natural
philosophy there is nothing more interesting in respect of subject

       March 12, 1849.-On the Intrinsic Equation to a Curve, and its
    application.    By the Master of Trinity.
       The author remarked that the expressions for the lengths of
    curves, their involutes and evolutes, in the ordinary methods, are
    complex and untractable, which arises in a great measure from the
    properties of eatrinsic lines being introduced, namely, coordinates.
    But a curve may be represented without any such additions, by an
    equation between the length and the angle of flexure, which is
    therefore called the intrinsic equation.     This equation gives, with
    remarkable facility, the radii of curvature; involutes and evolutes
     of most curves.     It also expresses very simply what may be called
     running curves; namely, curves which run like a pattern along a
     strip of ornamented work.       A very simple equation expresses, for
    instance, the inclined scroll pattern so common in the antique, and
     by altering the constants, gives to this pattern an endless variety of
    forms.    If s be the length of the curve and p the angle, the intrinsic
    equation to the circle is s = ap ; to the cycloid s = a sing.       The
    equation to an epicycloid or hypocycloid is s = a sin mº, according
    as m is less or greater than unity.     The equation to an undulating
    pattern is p = m sins, which assumes very various shapes by varying
    m.    The method was also used in proving that if we take the suc
    cessive involutes of a curve an indefinite number of times, the re
    sulting curve (with certain limitations) bends to become the equi
    angular spiral   if the unwrapping be always in the same direction,
    and tends to become the cycloid if the unwrapping be alternately in
    opposite directions.     The latter proposition had already been dis
    covered  by  Bernouilli and proved by Euler.

   From the above formula for A, may be determined all the coeffi

Having determined the quantities A in any particular case, let them
be substituted in the first line of the series.         If the sum of that line
be  equal  to  —p,   unity   is a root of the   equation.    Let the second line
be then written down and added to the first.              If the sum of the two
equals—p, 2 is a root of the equation, and so by adding successive
lines we shall ascertain whether the successive integers 3.4., &c. are
or are not roots of the equation.
   The quantities h in the expression for A, depend upon the number
of the coefficient and the number of the dimensions of the equation.

    March 9, 1849.—On Irradiation. By Professor Powell.
    After adverting to the history of researches on this subject, the
author dwells particularly on the method of exhibiting the phaeno
menon adopted by M. Plateau, which forms the basis of all his own
experiments, and which consists of a card or lamina, cut so that one
half of a long parallelogram is cut out whilst the other remains,
 having the portions at the sides cut away.          Viewed against the
 light, the enlargement of the bright half, in breadth, is seen con
 trasted with the opake, and might be subjected to measurement.
    The first question on the subject refers to the supposition of a
 peculiar physiological cause affecting the eye to produce the apparent
 enlargement of the bright image.        After fully allowing for some
 portion of such phaenomena being fairly attributable to ocular causes,
 such as dazzling, contrast, &c., experiments are adduced to show
 that precisely similar phaenomena are produced in an artificial eye, or
 camera obscura; whence the hypothesis of any peculiar affection of
 the retina is rendered unnecessary.     The same conclusion is further
 confirmed by photographic impressions of the image of the card cut
 as before, which exhibit the same enlargement.        Specimens of these
 impressions, taken by Mr. N. S. Maskelyne, were exhibited.
    These results, clearly pointing to an optical cause, agree with the
 conclusions of the undulatory theory, relative to the “diffraction of
 a lens,” as investigated by Mr. Airy, which apply to the eye con
 sidered as an optical instrument, as well as to the object-glasses of
 telescopes; in either case the image of a point being an ertended disc,
 which, if the light be bright enough, will be surrounded by rings. A
 luminous surface will exhibit a like enlargement.
    Without reference to any theory, it is an ascertained law that the
 enlargement increases with the intensity of the light. The enlargement
 also is formed with a rapid decrease in brightness towards the edge.
 On these grounds it is easy to explain the fact of the great diminu
 tion or total destruction of irradiation by the interposition of lenses,
 which would follow immediately from the weakening of the intensity
 in proportion to the square of the linear magnification.     The author
 has examined particularly into the extent to which this effect takes
 place, and announces that low powers (from 5 to 20) are sufficient to
 obliterate all irradiation even in the most intense light which the eye
 can bear.
    Various results of M. Plateau and others as to the effects of con
 trast in making a narrow bar or wire continue visible, though the
 irradiations ought to overlap, have been examined, and found only
 to hold good with low intensities.
    The author next considers the effect in telescopes.        Here that
 portion of the effect which regards the ocular image being placed out
 of consideration from the influence of the magnifying power (already
 referred to), we have only to consider that part which affects the
focal image of the object-glass. The diminution of the aperture in

creases the irradiation,              but at the same time               it diminishes the light.
At a certain point, then, these two causes counterbalance each other,
and no further enlargement takes place. This limit will vary with
each instrument, and we have no certain grounds on which to de
termine it. Various observations are referred to in which its influ
ence is evinced.
   The astronomical facts connected with these causes are then ex
amined from the testimony of various observers.              In particular the
application of these principles to some of those singular phaenomena
occasionally noticed in eclipses, transits, occultations, &c. seems easy
in theory abstractedly considered. The difficulty lies in explaining
why they are observed only in some cases and not in others. The
author dwells particularly on the desirableness of a closer attention
to stating all the conditions of the telescopes employed, especially the
apertures.
    In particular the phaenomenon “the neck,” in the transits of Mer
cury and Venus, would be an obvious consequence of irradiation,
which would diminish the planet's disc and enlarge that of the sun
except at the small portion of the circumferences in contact, when
the absence of both irradiations would produce a “neck.”
    Both theory and experiment show that a small dark disc would
 have for      its
               image     diminished disc with
                               a                   bright internal concentric
                                                                   a
ring, which, the discif                   be
                                 very small, will      contracted       be

bright point.      This seems        agree with the appearance noticed by
                                                to

   “Recently Prof. Bond and Dr. Locke have invented different pro
cesses, which are described in Mr. Walker's Report.
   “Prof. Bond proposes to make circuit by the metallic contact of
insulated portions of the pallet and escapement-wheel.  Dr. Locke,
like Mr. Wheatstone, uses a metallic wheel on the arbour of the
seconds' hand. This wheel has sixty teeth, each of which when
horizontal strikes against a platinum lever or tilt-hammer, weighing
two grains. The rising and falling of the hammer from a bed of pla
tinum breaks and makes the galvanic circuit. The fulcrum of the tilt
hammer and the platinum bed rest severally on a small block of wood.
    “The object of all these methods is to cause a delicate astrono
mical clock to make and break the galvanic circuit every second,
without injury to the machinery or rate of the clock. The mode of
action of such alternations on Morse's electro-magnetic telegraph
register, as now in daily use in the United States, is the same for
each of these methods.
    “The automatic clock register thus formed consists of a graduated
fillet of paper delivered pretty uniformly at the rate of an inch per
second. The beginnings of minutes, and fives and tens of minutes,
and of seconds, and fives and tens of seconds, are distinguished from
each other by the lengths of the corresponding imprinted blank spaces.
The printed second consists of an indented line of about nine-tenths
of a second or less, and of a blank space for the remainder. The rate
of the delivery of the paper is regulated by a centrifugal clock like
those of the Munich equatoreals.        An error of two seconds per
minute in the rate of delivery causes only an average error of one
hundredth of a second in the register of a date.

distant one or more thousand miles.           All the levels are to be read
with the instrument pointing to the zenith, then twenty bisections
of a circum-zenith star are to be imprinted on the automatic clock
register previous to reversal. The like number for the same star on
the same wires are to be imprinted after reversal, and the levels are
again to be read.
    “A similar operation is performed for the transit of the same star
at the western station.
    “The primitive astronomical clock may be located and rated at
the central station of the coast survey.         The automatic clock register
may be made and kept there, even if the distance be a thousand
miles from either station.
    “Clock registers in any number may be made at the separate
stations.     The transits of two fundamental stars at remote dates, at
either of the three stations, may give the rate of the primitive or
central clock.
    “One such transit of the same star over each station with twenty
printed registers of normal bisections, and six normal levelings, with
independent levels, at or near the position of actual observation,
 with the increased precision of the instrumental adjustments, will
 give in the form of a permanent printed record (with multiplied
 copies) the relative longitude of the two stations.
    “The uncertainty of such a result need be only a few hundredths
 of a second, and may be such only as attends our present knowledge
 of the relative longitudes of Greenwich and Paris, the two oldest
 observatories extant.
    “I   avail myself of the occasion to remark, that the Coast Survey
 operations were completely successful this autumn between Phila
 delphia and Cincinnati, while actually working on the line from
 Philadelphia to Louisville. The distance of the line in the air is
 nine hundred miles, that of the circuit is eighteen hundred.          I learn
 from an authentic source that the same success attends the use of
 the line from Philadelphia to the Mississippi river opposite St. Louis.
 The length of this circuit is one-tenth of the circumference of the
 earth.    The inference from this trial is clear, that a line round the
 earth, if such could be constructed, might be worked with facility at
 one stroke.     The expense of acids to supply the thousand Grove's
 pint cups, required for the motive power, would be about one pound

 turers    of archil, though the quantity of colouring matter contained
 in it is by no                          being little more than a twelfth
                          means considerable,
  of that in the Roccella    Montagnei.     The Gyrophora pustulata, on
 which the author    operated,   was  brought   from Norway, where it is
 annually collected in considerable quantity for the manufacture of
 archil. The colouring principle was extracted by maceration with
 milk of lime, and was precipitated in a gelatinous state by neutral
 izing the lime solution by muriatic acid precisely in the way so fre
 quently described in the author's former paper (Phil. Trans. 1848).
 The precipitate was gently dried, and then dissolved in hot spirits
 of wine. On the cooling of the liquid, the colouring principle was
 deposited in small soft crystals, which by digestion with animal
 charcoal and repeated crystallizations were rendered quite colour
 less.  This principle, to which the author has given the name of
  Gyrophoric acid, is almost insoluble in either hot or cold water, and
 is also much less soluble in hot spirits of wine than either orsellic,
 erythric, or any of the analogous colouring principles.         It is neutral
to test-paper, and possesses no saturating power, as the smallest
 quantity of an alkali gives       solutions      alkaline reaction. Gyro

   This lichen, like the Gyrophora pustulata, has been employed

         early period    the manufacture

both of Scotland and Ireland.    The lichen on which the author
operated came from Norway.      He found         also     contain gyro    it         to

                 much about the same     quantity       the Gyrophora               as
pustulata.          This fact was established                        by   the analysis        of   the acid
itself and     of    its   ether compound.

  May 10.—“Remarks on M. De la Rive's Theory for the Physical
Explanation of the Causes which produce the Diurnal Variation of
the Magnetic Declination,” in a letter to S. Hunter Christie, Esq.,
Sec. R.S., from Lieut.-Col. Sabine, For. Sec.R.S. Communicated by
S. Hunter Christie, Esq.
     MY DEAR SIR,                            Woolwich, April 16, 1849.
  The Annales         Chimie et de Physique for March last contains a
                              de
letter from M. De la Rive to M. Arago", in which a theory is pro
posed, professing to explain, on physical principles, the general
phenomena of the diurnal variation of the magnetic declination, and,
in particular, the phenomena observed at St. Helena and at the Cape
of Good Hope, described in a paper communicated by me to the
 Royal Society in 1847, and which has been honoured with a place
 in the Philosophical Transactions.
    Although I doubt not that the inadequacy of the theory proposed
 by M. De la Rive for the solution of this interesting problem will be
 at once recognised by those who have carefully studied the facts
 which have become known to us by means of the exact methods of
 investigation, adopted in the magnetic observatories of recent esta
 blishment; yet there is danger that the names of De la Rive and
 Arago, held in high and deserved estimation as authorities on such
 subjects, attached to a theory,       which moreover claims reception on
 the ground of                 its
                        accordance with “well-ascertained facts” and
 “with principles         physics positively established,”—may operate
                                   of
 prejudicially      checking the inquiries which may
                         in                                       progress         be   in                   in
  other quarters into the causes which really occasion the phenomena
 in  question;     have thought
                     I                desirable therefore
                                                     it       point out,           to                    in  a
  very brief communication, some         the important particulars
                                                            of          which                      in
  M. De      Rive's theory fails
               la                    represent correctly the facts which
                                                      to                                                     it
  professes      explain, and others which are altogether
                    to                                                variance                at
  with, and opposed                  to   it.
         M. De      Rive's theory,        few words,        follows:—
                                                           in                     as

on the diurnal variation in each month during the five years in
 which hourly observations were maintained day and night at that
 observatory, will perceive,           on evidence which admits of no uncer
 tainty,+that the two portions of the year in which the diurnal variation
 is in contrary directions at that island, are not determined as M. De
 la Rive supposes by the declination of the sun relatively to the la
 titude of the place, but by the declination of the sun relatively to the
 equinoctial line. The sun is vertical at St. Helena, passing to the
 south in the first week of November; and again when passing to the
 north in the first week of February: consequently the two portions
 into which the year is thus divided, are respectively the one of three,
 and the other of nine months' duration; but the actual portions in
 which the contrary diurnal movements of the magnets take place at
  St. Helena are of equal duration, and consist of sir months and sir
 months; the dividing periods coinciding unequivocally, not with the
 sun's verticality at St. Helena, but with the equinoxes.
     2. But if M. De la Rive's explanation be thus inconsistent in respect
 to the dates of the transition periods of the phenomena at St. Helena,
 it must be regarded as altogether at variance with, and opposed to.
  the phenomena described in the same paper at the Cape of Good
  Hope, where also they have been observed at the Magnetic Obser
 vatory at that station with an exactness which leaves no uncertainty
 whatsoever as to the facts themselves. The Cape is not situated within
 the tropics;         its

  It is known that it does not occur at places situated in correspond
ing latitudes north of the geographical equator; at Algiers, for ex
ample,    which is moreover nearly in the same geographical meridian
as the Cape, and where the magnetic inclination is nearly the same
towards the north as is the case at the Cape towards the south.         It
may be quite correct perhaps to view the corresponding phenomena
at St. Helena and the Cape as those belonging to magnetically-equa
torial stations; but they are certainly not those peculiar to or cha
racteristic of geographically-equatorial stations, which would be the
condition in M. De la Rive's theory.        There are thus two parts in
the   problem    demanding    physical  explanation;   on the one hand,
the cause is   required   of the  contrariety  of movement,  as well as of
the times at which the different movements occur, the latter having
obviously a dependence on the sun's position either in the northern
or the southern signs; and on the other hand, the cause must be
shown why certain stations are thus affected and others not: a di
stinction which obviously does not depend on situation in regard to
the geographical equator or to the tropical divisions of the globe.
   I have myself been led to infer that the peculiarity in question re
sults from and is indicative of proximity to the line of least mag
netic force, regarded as physically the separating line on the surface
of the globe between the northern and southern magnetic hemi
spheres; the peculiarity would thus be strictly a magnetically-equa
torial one.
   It results from the present position of the four points of maximum
intensity at the surface of the earth, that the intermediate line of
least intensity departs considerably in the Southern Atlantic from
the middle or geographically-equatorial portion of the globe, passing
between the Cape and St. Helena, and consequently not far from
either of these stations.
   As far as I have yet been able to examine, have found that the         I
same remarkable peculiarity does exist at                              all
                                                     other stations which
are near this line, and               at
                                 none which are remote from           But                 it.
however this may be, the accordance           the phenomena  of  the Cape            at
of Good Hope and St. Helena, and their dissimilarity from those                                     at

production*.     Although this may be the ordinary circumstance, it
is not always the case. More than once vessels have been carried
along by the wind, and their images shifted in a similar manner.
This phaenomenon is often remarked on the Black Sea, from Odessa.
The accounts of the observations of Woltmann near Cuxhavent, and
 of Vince at Ramsgatef, leave no doubt with respect to this fact. The
 following is a similar instance, observed at Nyon in the summer of
 1848 by M. Thury, formerly professor at Lausanne, and which is
 still better characterized than the previous ones.
    It was twenty minutes to 8 o'clock, A.M. The bise had raised
 foaming waves upon the lake.         In the south-east some vapours
 floated on the horizon: the sky in every other part was of a clear
 blue.    By the aid of a good telescope of 0-068 millim. aperture, and
 which magnified thirty times, M. Thury descried on the heights of
 Coppet, in the direction of Geneva, the two lateen sails of a bark
 the hull of which was not at all visible.    A little below the lower
 extremity of these sails, the commencement of their image was seen
 inverted. This incomplete image terminated abruptly on the agitated
and clear surface of the water. The space which separated the sails
from their image was of a uniform greenish-blue colour. The lowest
strata of air undulated in a very perceptible manner.
    This last circumstance, and the situation of the image below the
object which it represented, are proofs that the phaenomenon resulted
from a greater heating of the atmosphere in the lower strata than in
the more elevated regions.      But for the hull of the vessel to be      in
 visible, and for the contours of the objects, examined with a telescope
 at fourteen metres above the level of the water, to be perfectly well
 defined, the warmest zone of air must have terminated under the
wind toward the base of the sails, that is to say, at three or four
metres above the surface of the lake. The existence of a zone thus
limited is therefore possible with the bise blowing sufficiently strong
 during the few minutes necessary for the observation. This fact
recalls the persistence of the undulation in the strata of air which
 are close to the roofs and the ground during the warm hours of a
summer's day, or above the chimneys in winter, notwithstanding the
agitation produced by intense winds.
    II. On blue rays.-On the 30th of November last, a little before
sunrise, M. Thury perceived at Nyon, above the mountains which
border the lake on the east, horizontal strata of light clouds tinged
with a beautiful yellow. The sky, seen in the spaces between them,
was of a deep azure colour. Toward the point of the horizon where
the sun was about to appear, a dark blue ray rose divergingly up to
a great height, and occupied a space in which no cloud was percep
tible. This appearance vanished after two or three minutes.
    Dr. Gosse has found, among his father's papers, the account of an
analogous observation made at Lyons toward the end of the last

century by this venerable founder of the Helvetic Society of Natural
Sciences. The manuscript unfortunately has not been preserved.
    What has been called a ray appears to me, on the contrary, to be
a  phaenomenon      of shadow. The light of the sun, arrested by some
obstacle out of    sight,  left the transparent vapours situated near the
horizon invisible in a determinate region of the sky, whilst to the
right and left it tinged them by playing upon them. The space not
illumined should offer to the eye a blue colour, the more remarkable
as it contrasted strongly with those of the adjacent strata of a golden
yellow. The diverging form of the ray is a well-known illusion in
perspective. What apparently increased the separation of                   mar                        its
gins toward the upper part, was the less quantity              vapour existing        of

agree with the formulae of M. Cauchy, to prove that the intensity of
metallic luminous reflexion depends on the colour of the light em
ployed.    The numerous analogies which exist between heat and
light, scarcely admit of an essential difference on this head. The
authors, indeed, are of opinion, that they have in fact proved by ex
periment that this difference does not exist, and that the rays of heat
of different natures are reflected in very unequal proportions on the
same metallic mirror.
   The plan adopted and followed by the authors is precisely the
same as that previously followed in their Researches on Metallic
Reflectors.   The source of heat was always a Locatelli's lamp;
only they operated successively with the direct rays, and with the
same rays transmitted, sometimes through a plate of natural sal
gem, and at others with it smoked, and lastly through a lamina of
glass 5 millimetres in thickness.    The incidence of the rays being
about 60°, the following results were obtained:—
   Erperiments made with the Metal of the Reflectors of Telescopes.—
The metal of the reflector employed reflected 0-80 or 0.84 of the
direct heat of Locatelli's lamp.   It reflected only 0.74 of the heat
derived from the same source when modified by passing through
a lamina of glass of 0"-005 in thickness.      Lastly, it reflected 0.82
to 0.83 of the same heat transmitted through sal gem.
   Experiments with Silver.—The silver mirror reflected 0-95 to 0-96
of the natural heat, and 0.91 of the heat which had passed through
0.005 of glass.
   Experiments with Platina.—The platina employed reflected 0.79
of the natural heat; 0.77 to 0-78 of the heat which had traversed
 sal gem; 65 to 66 of that which had traversed 0”005 of glass; and
 lastly, 83 of that which had passed through smoked sal gem.
     Some experiments were also made with plates of gold and unpo
 lished silver, which were employed by the authors in an investiga
 tion respecting the diffusion of heat. The proportion of the incident
 flow which these plates reflect back to the pole when it is placed in
 the direction of the regular reflexion, is extremely different, according
 as the heat has previously traversed glass or sal gem.
     It results from these numbers, that the heat most transmissible
 through glass is reflected in smaller proportion on the various metals
 tried; and that the heat, which is transmitted in larger proportion
 through smoked sal gem,' is reflected more abundantly upon the
same substances.       A marked consequence of these experiments            is,
that  a        of
          bundle    heat rays reflected  on
                                          a  metallic mirror has generally
a   composition entirely different from that    of   the incident bundle,
and that    consequently it should not suffer the same loss in   traversing
diathermanous substances. This has been directly verified             bythe
authors   in  the following manner:—
    1.  They determined the loss    of intensity which the heat   of  a    Lo
catelli's lamp suffered   in   traversing a   lamina of   glass  of 0”005
in thickness.
     The loss suffered

on parallel mirrors.

   In the first  case the lamina of glass employed transmitted 0-44 of
the incident  heat;    in the second only 0.33 to 0-34.
   These two methods afford then concordant results; and the
authors are of opinion that they have determined that, on a great
number of metals, and probably on all, the different kinds of heat
are reflected unequally, and that the reflexion on polished metals
changes the proportions of the different kinds of heat which compose
the incident bundle.—Comptes Rendus, Avril 16, 1849.
          ON CHLORONICEIC ACID.         B.Y. M. E. SAINT-EVRE.
   For the preparation of this acid, the first operation consists in
passing a current of moist chlorine gas into a cold and strongly alka
line solution of benzoate of potash. After many trials, the propor
tions which succeeded best were found to be 60 grims. of benzoic
acid, 200 grims. of hydrate of potash, and 300 to 350 grims. of water,
according to the degree of hydratation of the potash of commerce,
which is far from being constant.
   The potash is to be dissolved at a gentle heat, and the benzoic
acid afterwards added; and the chlorine is not to be passed till
everything is dissolved.      After some time the solution assumes suc
cessive shades of yellow, greenish-yellow and bright green; it then
again becomes yellow, and eventually deposits an abundant pulpy
compound, which is grayish and crystalline. An abundant evolution
of carbonic acid takes place during the operation, which is readily
detected by passing it into a vessel containing barytes water.         An
operation performed with the quantities above described continues
about two days.
   The precipitate is composed,—1st, of chlorate of potash, the cry
stallization of which is completely modified by the presence of or
ganic matter, the salt being usually obtained in the form of four
sided prisms; they are long, hard and brittle; 2nd, of a small quan
tity of unaltered benzoate of potash; 3rd, of a salt of potash con
taining the new acid; and lastly, the supernatant liquor contains
benzoate of potash and chloride of potassium.
   About half its volume of water is to be added to the mass. The
solution is to be saturated, at a moderate temperature, by means of
a current of carbonic acid, the saturation being completed by the
addition of a small quantity of dilute hydrochloric acid. The solu
tion is then to be boiled. The magma which is precipitated gra
dually redissolves, and there soon appears an oleaginous substance
which is fusible at about 270°F.; it is of an amber colour, and heavier
than water.      It sometimes precipitates to the bottom of the capsule,
and sometimes, on the contrary, it floats, according to the degree of
concentration of the solution.       The solution being poured off, an
oily matter remains, which soon concretes by cooling.
   The crude acid thus prepared is hard, brittle, of a slight yellow
colour, and contains a notable quantity of benzoic acid.       It is freed
from this by repeated solutions in boiling distilled water; and the

474                    Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
purification is eventually completed by repeated crystallizations in
alcohol, or in a mixture of alcohol and aether.
   The benzoic acid separated in this manner is added to that which
the decanted liquor contains, which is then strained through a cloth
and washed with cold water.      It is to be carefully pressed; and by
treating it in a capsule with a small quantity of hot water, a fresh
and often considerable quantity of the new acid is separated, which
had been dissolved during the first separation.
   The pure acid consists of granular crystals of a cauliflower form.
When examined by the microscope, they present the form of four.
sided acicular prisms.   It melts at 302°, and when melted        den                                                 its

only in one equivalent of hydrogen being replaced by one equiva
lent of hypoazotic vapour; for this reason the author gives it the
name of anisidine nitrée. This base forms with hydrochloric acid,
a colourless salt crystallized in long needles, represented by the                                            for

   The chloroplatinate crystallizes in needles of a golden yellow
colour; its formula is ClFI, PtCl2, C*H* N2O6 ; the nitrate has the
form of prisms of considerable size, which are slightly soluble in
water; the formula is NO3, HO, C*H*N* 0° ; the sulphate is very
soluble in water, it crystallizes in very fine needles, grouped around
a common centre; its formula is SO3, C*H*N* O9.
   When toluol is treated with fuming nitric acid, it forms two com
pounds, one of which is liquid, and is the mononitric toluol; the
other is crystallized, and is the binitric toluol; when the latter was
treated with an alcoholic solution of hydrosulphate of ammonia, it
yielded a very fine alkaloid corresponding to anisidine nitrée, differing
from it only by two equivalents of oxygen.          This new alkali the
author calls toluidine nitrée ; its formula is C+ H8 N* O*.
   The number of alkaloids increases daily; their study affords re
sults of great interest, and the hope may be entertained that those
presented by nature may eventually be formed by art. M. Würtz
has described two very remarkable alkalies obtained by the action of
potash on cyanicaether, alcohol, and pyroxylic spirit; petinine, recently
discovered by M. Anderson in the products of the distillation of ani
mal matters, is to be added to the group.        The strong ammoniacal
odour, the manifest analogy of the properties of        salts, with those                    its

       polarization has formed the subject of several important
investigations; but nevertheless there still remain some con

ditions of the phaenomenon to discuss, some conclusions to
verify, some obscure points to clear up.        I have attempted to
do  this, aided   by  the valuable assistance of MM. Pouillet and
Edmund Becquerel, who have kindly placed at my disposal
the apparatus they made use of in their researches on this

rent itself during a series of experiments would produce dif
ferences far more considerable, which must be avoided by
comparing only the rotations observed at short intervals, and,
as it were, the one following the other.
   It has been observed, that for the success of these experi
ments it is indispensable that the glasses experimented with
should be annealed; but happily this is not the case, other
wise these researches would be impossible, since the greater
part of them are unannealed, or soon become so. When
such a glass is suitably placed between two crossed Nichol's
prisms, one or several black lines appear in             which serve                            it,                               as

    The same condition is still better satisfied in Ruhmkorff's'k

    By means of the above-mentioned apparatus                                  I have been
able to make the          experiment             so as to render it visible at a
public lecture.        The arrangement presents no other difficul
ties than those resulting from the narrowness of the beam of
light traversing the electro-magnet.                        I therefore removed the
diaphragms placed at the extremities of the helices, and was
then able to work with a ray of light of two centimetres in
diameter.        This ray proceeded from a lamp of M. Soleil's
construction, placed before one of the reels. It traversed
successively a polarizer formed of one large pile of glasses,
a Faraday's flint-glass, of 48 millimetres, placed between the
two reels and in contact with them, an analyser formed of a
large doubly refracting prism, and then a convergent lens
which projected it upon a screen. One of the two images of
the prism having been extinguished while the current passed
in a certain direction, it was seen to reappear as soon as the
direction of the current was changed; and it was again ex
tinguished, or rather it was brought to the tint of passage by
a suitable rotation of the analysing prism.                                But the expe
riment is much more striking when a doubly rotating Soleil's
plate of quartz is placed behind the polarizer.                              The lens then
projects upon the screen two images of complementary tints,
the two halves of which, brought at first to an equality of tints
by means of the analyser, change in a contrary direction as
soon as the current is altered.                      On turning the analyser a
certain extent, we reobtain an uniformity of tint in each image.
This experiment is precisely the same as that of M. Pouillet”.
    The direction of the rotation impressed on the plane of po
larization was correctly recognized by Prof. Faraday, and may
be determined in a simple manner. The rotation has the same
direction as the current which produces magnetization, or rather

electro-magnet in a piece of soft iron inserted in the place of
the substance experimented with.
    It may not be without interest to connect this general law
with the theory which M. Fresnel has given of circular pola
rization.     After having shown that a ray of light polarized at
right angles can be                           into two others polarized
circularly in a contrary direction, and vice versä, it sufficed
for him to suppose that a plate of quartz cut perpendicular to
the axis has the property of allowing to pass, with unequal
velocities, rays polarized circularly in one or other direction,
and    all the rotatory properties                           of

this simple supposition.           Let       admit,         us

tion observed ought to be in the same direction, whether the
glass is placed in front or behind; and if the helix is viewed
from the south pole, a rotation to the left should occur: it
would be to the right if the helix were viewed from the other
pole, or, which comes to the same thing, the current is changed
without altering the position of the eye.
   Hence it follows, that in an apparatus formed of two similar
helices, the direction of the rotation should be the same when
the flint-glass is between the two helices or reels as when it is
at the extremities; so that in the whole length of a file of
reels thus arranged, the direction of the rotation should not
change.

   The change of rotation with the direction in which it                                                           is
º:
observed establishes between the magnetized flint-glass and
         a difference which is rendered still more perceptible by
the  experiments     just cited. However, that is nearly the only
difference. The      dispersion of the planes of polarization for the
different colours is the same in the two bodies.         have proved                  I
it in the following manner.
    With the flint-glass placed between the two poles of the
electro-magnet under the most favourable conditions to pro
duce a great rotation (29 degrees), I counterbalanced this ro
tation by the contrary effect of a plate of quartz of the requi
site thickness, which is easily obtained with M. Soleil's com
pensator.      The system was then perfectly neutral, and would
remain so in every position of the analyser, if the quartz and
magnetized flint-glass acted in the same manner on the light,
which  of is,    effect, what
                in              have observed
                                          I         all the different       in
kinds      flint-glass    have experimented with.
                                  I
   Let us now examine the various circumstances which cause
the magnitude            of  the rotation            to   differ.
  The nature             of the bodies should rank first.                                 The differ
ences are considerable       the various kinds
                                          in      glasses; they                  of
are less perceptible    liquids, and indeed, according
                                    in                     some                                   to
experimenters,              all
                     solutions have the same    rotatory power.
Thus Prof. Faraday (in 2185                               of
                                       his memoir) considers                                                       as
probable that,        aqueous solutions, the [ruling] rotative

matter      the water, and not the other substance.
           is                                              But this

which it will remain constant, an increase of thickness only
producing layers which are no longer influenced.
    It is likewise evident, that if the substance is submitted to
the contact action of two poles of constant equal force, the
effects will only be doubled, and that in consequence the law
will still be the same.
   But on interposing fresh strata between the poles, it becomes
requisite to separate them more and more, which somewhat
diminishes their intensity by decreasing the influence which
they exert one on the other. Three cases may then occur;
either this diminution of intensity will compensate the effect
produced by the increase of thickness, or it will have a more
feeble influence, or lastly, it will preponderate.
    In the first case, the rotation will be independent of the
thickness; in the second, it will increase with the thickness
up to a certain point, beyond which it will remain constant;
and lastly, on the third hypothesis, it will attain a maximum,
beyond which it will decrease, but without returning to zero,
the two poles always producing effects which conjoin; so that
the extent of the rotations will be twice the effect produced by
a single pole.
    It will be seen from the following table that the two first
cases may occur with M. Becquerel's electro-magnet, where
the variation of the poles of the keepers must be considerable.

    If instead of always bringing the poles in contact with the
magnetized substance, they are left at the same distance, by
placing between them a gradually increasing number of strata,
the rotation will be seen to increase in a continuous manner
until the thickness is equal to the distance of the poles. Again,
if these poles are sufficiently removed from the various strata
of the substance, so that the variations of their distance do not
produce perceptible variations in their rotations, the action

will be equal upon all, and the rotation observed will be pro
portional to the thickness of the substance. This, in fact, is
the law discovered by Prof. Faraday, on employing horse
shoe electro-magnets not furnished with keepers.
   The law of the variations with the thickness is evidently
connected with that of the variations with the distance; but
this is not better known than the first.   It is therefore to
the simultaneous examination of these two laws that my at
tention was necessarily directed, and   made it as soon as I                                          I
had Ruhmkorff’s great apparatus at my disposal.

   The action of the two reels or coils of the apparatus being
no more than the sum of the rotations produced by each of
them, I had at first, in order to simplify the problem, to study
the action of a single coil upon a substance of known thick
ness, placed upon the axis at a fixed distance.
  Action of a single pole.—One of the coils being removed,                                                                                                     I
placed the flint-glass upon which I wished to experiment in con
tact with the remaining coil, then I removed it a certain distance,
which I valued by the passage of               support over      divided                        its                                             a

On    expressing   by A the rotation produced by the flint-glass
in contact with the coil, if Ar is the rotation produced by the
same flint-glass at the distance of 1 millimetre, the action of
the coil at a distance a millimetres will be y=Ar".

     GENTLEMEN,
       I see no advantage likely to result from further discus
AS sion of the question of the possibility           of the existence of
spherical waves of sound, it is not         my   intention to continue
the  controversy.        have,  as  Iconceive,             I

tradiction” arrived at      by Professor   Challis    has no real exist
ence; and I am quite content to leave the            question    as it now
stands to the judgement of mathematicians.

heating the zinc shield; and thus this motion could be pro
duced or avoided at pleasure, and was,               Ithink, sufficiently
accounted for.
   7. The steam was obtained from a small hydro-electric
machine; and the various apparatus for effecting the discharge
were screwed into the condenser at the place made to receive
the Armstrong's jet. The condenser was always dry, except
where I have noted the contrary, and the steam was discharged
horizontally towards the north.
   8. A galvanic current was sent through a wire in the neigh
bourhood of the galvanoscope; the wire lay parallel with the
needles in the path taken by the steam (9.), and acted about
equally on both; the wire of course lay about north and south,
and the electricity passed along it from north to south, sup
posing the current to pass through the conducting wire of a
voltaic circle from the platinum to the zinc. When the circuit
was completed, the needle moved to one side, A, of the field
of view from the opposite side C. Throughout these experi
ments the motion of the same end of the same needle was
always recorded, and the galvanoscope always stood to the
east of the current of steam. .
   9. To a brass jet, 1-8 inch long, was fastened a piece of glass
tube, 11.5inches long and <U+017F>º inch diameter inside, and the junc
ture was made tight, or nearly so, with caoutchouc; the aper
ture at the end of the brass jet which projected from the con
denser (7.) was circular, and tº inch in diameter. The nearest
point of the convex surface of the zinc shield was about ºn
inch from the glass tube; the stage of the microscope in this
and the following experiments came nearly close to the shield.
The fibre which suspended the needles was about 1; inch
from the nearest part of a plane drawn through the end of the
brass jet, and making a right angle with
                                                     35its

Things being        so arranged,   I  found when the steam was turned
                                                  move towards C; and

                                                                 reversing

                                                              the needles
could   be  again reduced.     I     had ascertained         by
                                                          previous trials,
that turning the cock         of the boiler without letting off the steam
produced      no  effect on  the needles.     The experiment was made
 by  screwing   a   stop-cock       the
                                   in    place  of the above-mentioned
brass jet; and then the cock             ofthe boiler could             be
                                                                   worked
 without   letting   off the  steam,   and without   affecting  the galva
noscope.
    10. The galvanoscope was raised             few inches,
                                                a                      so
                                                                  that the

           Mr. R. Phillips   on the Magnetism    of Steam.      505
steam might act principally on the lower side of the undermost
needle, instead of acting equally on both as before, everything
else being as in the former experiment.       When the steam was
turned on, the needle began to move towards A; and by
alternately shutting off the steam and letting it issue at the cor
responding positions of the needle, a vibration through full
half of the micrometer was obtained; and then by making the
blasts of steam synchronical with the opposite vibrations of
the needle, the motion was checked.
    11. The glass tube was now taken away, the galvanoscope
lowered as in (9.), and the shield and galvanoscope moved
horizontally about $ inch in a perpendicular direction to the
path of the steam, which was used at about 35 pounds on the
inch. Operating as before, I could with this jet of steam
more easily obtain the swing, the motion being towards C
when the steam was turned on. Water being placed in the
 Armstrong's condenser, produced no alteration in the magnetic
effects of the jet of steam.
     12. The effect of this jet (11.) was much greater than that
of the current of electricity of an Armstrong's jet under the
 most favourable circumstances.        The comparison was made
 in the following manner:—I found that an Armstrong's jet
 could discharge more steam in a given time than the brass
jet (11.), also that the electricity produced by the Armstrong's
jet could deflect the needle of a galvanometer of the ordinary
 construction 3 or 4 degrees.      I then found that a small voltaic
 arrangement capable of deflecting the needles of the galvano
 meter 4°, and having a conducting wire lying in the path of
 the steam, acted far less on the needles of the galvanoscope
 than the blast of steam from the brass jet (1.1.).       Also when
 an   Armstrong's   jet was substituted for the brass jet, and water
  placed in the condenser, I could perceive no difference in the
  swing, whether the steam passed by the galvanoscope in a
  highly electrified condition, or whether the electricity was, in
  a great measure, collected by means of a number of fine points
  almost as soon as it left the wooden channel.          The points
  were supplied by two small concentric loops of wire-gauze,
  placed edgeways in the steam at a distance in different expe
  riments  of from 4 to # inch from the end of the Armstrong's
 jet.    The galvanoscope was as before (11.), except that it was
  placed about $ inch further from the jet, but at about the
  same distance from the path of the steam.
      13. There is a singular variation which     I have sometimes
  observed in the magnetic effect produced by the steam issuing
  from an Armstrong's jet; namely, that the action of the steam
  on the galvanoscope is much stronger when one of the needles

  506        Mr. R. Phillips  on the Magnetism  of Steam.
  is in the same horizontal plane as the central line of the path
  of the steam, than when the galvanoscope is placed so that
  the steam may pass equally near to both needles.         I have
  occasionally observed the swing to be five or six times greater
  in one position than in the other; but sometimes the swing is
  the same in either position.      I have not perceived a similar
  effect with any other jet.
      14. A pewter tube 6 feet long, having a bore <U+017F>º inch dia
  meter, was coiled up after the fashion of the wire of a galva
  nometer: it made six convolutions.       One end of the tube
  was jambed on the brass jet (9.), and the coil stood horizon
  tally like the coil of a galvanometer; the zinc shield was
 brought nearly close to the coil, and the height of the galva
 noscope was adjusted so that the coil might act on both the
 upper and lower sides of the lower needle; the steam entered
 on the upper side of the coil in the same direction as before.
  By this arrangement I succeeded in producing a marked
 swing with steam of a very low pressure, I think below 5 lbs.
 on the inch; but I did not exactly ascertain the amount of
 this low pressure, because the safety-valve of the boiler is not
 graduated below 40 lbs. As the pressure rose, the power
 exerted on the needles became greater; and at 40 lbs. on the
 inch, a few puffs of steam caused the needle to move through
 the whole length of the micrometer; the motion, when the
 steam was turned on, being towards C.
     15. Instead of allowing the steam to pass continuously
 through the tube during the whole of each alternate vibration,
 it was shut off before the vibration was completed. The swing
 was now much less, showing that it was not the first gust of
steam which alone moved the needles; and this agreed with
the visible motion of the needle, which manifestly increased
in velocity after it began to move.
     16. Water being placed in the condenser of the hydro
electric machine did not sensibly alter the force exerted on
the needles by the coil.
     17. The coil was now attached to the boiler by means of a
piece of brass, the steam-way of which was so large that the coil
only might be looked upon as opposing the exit of the steam.
Various pressures were tried, as the boiler became heated, up
to 40 lbs. per inch.    A lead pipe was, in this experiment and
frequently afterwards, placed at a short distance from the coil
to catch the steam and convey it up a chimney, whereas in
former experiments it had freely escaped into the apartment;
everything else remained as before (14.). The needles began
to be affected at a very low pressure; and as the pressure in
creased, the swing became certain and steady, the needle

LXXIV.        On     some       Points relating to the Theory                     of Fluid
    Motion.    By the Rev. J. CHALlis, M.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S.,
    Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philo
    sophy in the University of Cambridge*.
    N   a memoir on certain questions in the theory                         of the motion
        of fluids, published (1847) by Professor P. Tardy of                         Flo
rence, for a copy of which I am indebted to the author, re
ference is made to a communication contained in tom. xxiii. of
the Comptes Rendus of the Academy of Sciences of Paris, in
which several of my investigations on fluid motion are brought
under review by M. J. Bertrand.         Professor Tardy states at
the same time, that he had himself previously made remarks
on one of the points on which I am supposed to be in error.
The citation of Professor Tardy first made me aware that
M. Bertrand had taken notice of my labours. On turning to
the article in the Comptes Rendus, I perceived that the im
portant errors (erreurs graves) attributed to me were partly
due to misconception of my reasoning, which, I am ready to
admit, may not have been developed with sufficient clearness;
and partly to the circumstance, not unusual in the history of
science, that new truths appear to be errors so long as the
errors they replace are supposed to be truths.        It will suffice
for the  present  to advert to one  point  of primary   importance.
I  have repeatedly   contended  that,  to  complete  the analytical
theory of hydrodynamics, a new general equation is absolutely
required.     M. Bertrand first calls in question the principles
on which this equation is established, and then contends that
an equation which           I
                        derived from a combination of the new
equation with that which is            called the equation of con
                                           ...}
tinuity, is identical with a particular case of this latter equa
tion.   The following investigations will supply answers to
these objections.
    1.  I
        propose first to exhibit the principles on which the
new equation rests, and to deduce it accordingly.         the equa           If
tion V(x, y,  z, t)=0 express any given relation between the
coordinates a, y, z and the time t, any other relation be
tween the same quantities may be expressed by the equation
                                                                                     &y,
W(a +?a, y +?y, & 4-82, t +8t)=0, the increments &c,                                       8s

Supposing the increments            indefinitely small, we obtain

 If u,   v, ºr be the resolved parts of the velocity of a given par
 ticle   of fluid in motion, and we suppose that
                             ºr= u2t             Zy=t2t                 2:=::2t,
 the above equation becomes
                                 — u + -i- tº + – ºr = 0.

 The signification of this equation depends entirely on the na
 ture of the curve surface defined by the equation 9 r:y, z, t) = 0.
 If, for instance, this be the surface of a fixed or moveable
boundary with which the fluid is in contact, the equation
affirms that the same particle remains in contact with the
boundary in successive instants.       the function º be the        If
general expression for the pressure p, then since        is the                             p-0

press in this instance the condition that a given particle
                                                              is

Then, as is known, 9–0 is the equation of a surface cutting at
right angles the directions of the motions of the particles
through         which it passes.                 The factor;                   is applied        for the
sake of generality, because it may be assumed that such a sur
face always exists, and consequently that the right-hand side
of the above equality is an exact differential, although it can
not be affirmed that ud-r-t-vdy + waz is always an exact differ

This expression for the velocity is general, having been ob
tained prior to the consideration of any particular case of mo

which passes in a given small time a given small element of a
surface of displacement, being proportional to Vrr', is given
for a given value of p(t), and consequently that the moment
ary trajectory of the surfaces of displacement to which a single
disturbance gives rise is a straight line.

partial differential coefficients of p. This expression being
substituted in (7.), and p being eliminated by means of (5.) and

equations are equally general.             The essential difference be

  The equation (10.) being linear, may be satisfied by the sum
of this value and that which results    changing the sign of
 M-I. So that putting a = 0 and    y=0,  and suppressing the
constant B, the final result               is,

any contradiction.                I   infer that the supposition          of plane-waves
is not allowable.
  I   have    been induced to make the last remark from   having
seen it asserted by the Astronomer Royal in the Number of
the Philosophical Magazine for June, that I have pointed out
a difficulty in the interpretation of an equation applying to the
case of plane-waves. Mr. Stokes asserted the same thing before;
and I then disclaimed, as I now disclaim, having pointed out
any difficulty. The equation is a very simple one, and easily                               in
terpreted.     A few steps of plain deduction conducts to a result
incompatible with fluid motion.         It follows in due course that
the supposition    of plane-waves     cannot be made. This in<U+017F>er
ence is in perfect accordance with the argument contained in
this communication, which I think Mr. Airy may find to be
worthy of some consideration.           Any other inference would
have  presented   a real  difficulty.

    Seeing, then, that this coarse drift or water-worn detritus is dis
tributed sometimes on the hard rocks and often on the summits of
the remnants of the old valley alluvia, he believes that the whole of

elevations since the period                        of    the earliest glaciers—

 upon land. This last hypothesis is at variance even with the physical
 phaenomena in and around the Alps, whilst it is in entire antagonism
to the much grander and clearly established distribution of erratics

commensurate with the cause.         The Scandinavian chain, from

mutation 1212 derived from the primitive arrangement 1122.
Considering this primitive arrangement as a particular case
of abcd, there are four permutations which, on the suppositions
a=b-1, c=d=2, reduce themselves to 1212, viz. acbd, bead,
adbc, bdac, which are obtained by means of the respective
symbols (a)(bc)(d); (abc)(d); (a)(bdc); (abdc), the supplements
of the exponents of irregularity being therefore 1, 2, 2, 3, or the
permutation being negative; in fact it is obviously derivable
by means of an inversion of the two mean terms.

Feb. 22,                             of an Infusory Animalcule allied to
 1849.             the genus Notommata of Ehrenberg, hitherto unde
scribed.       By John Dalrymple, Esq., F.R.C.S.
    The examination of various specimens of the animalcule described
by the author, disclosed the dioecious character of one of the more
highly organized of the rotiferous class of Infusoria, hitherto sup
posed to be androgenous.          This discovery was first made by obser
ving the difference in the form and development of the embryo
while still enclosed in the ovisac of the parent animal. From the
extreme transparency of this form of rotifer, it is possible to trace
the progressive development of the young from the Graeffian vesicle
in the ovary to the period of mature gestation, when the embryo is
expelled, the whole machinery of whose organs has been perfected
while still within the body of the female.
    Thus, although the young one observed in the ovisac, when nearly
ready to be expelled, was in the great majority of instances a mi
niature portrait of the parent, yet occasionally an embryo was seen
of a different aspect, within whose body a vesicle was discovered
filled with actively moving spermatozoa.
    A further investigation of the subject brought clear evidence of
the functions performed by this male,                   its
                                                 copulation with the young
females; but          also displayed the singular fact, that although the
                        it
organs    of  reproduction and locomotion were highly developed, there
was       total absence of those        assimilation;

                             the paper the author describes the anatomy
of   the female, which differs from the family                of

  In relation to physiology, the author submits a new theory of the
mechanism of circulation and respiration in the general group of
Rotifers, a subject which is but obscurely treated of by the great
German observer, who appears to have believed in the existence of
tubular vessels or true vascular system. The author thinks, how
ever, that these functions are performed in a manner more resem
bling that of insects, viz. that the blood is contained in the general
cavity of the animal and circulates round the lung, which is here
represented by a contractile vesicle that receives and expels the
water in which the animalcule lives, and so comes to be in interme
diate relation with the air mixed with the water. The difference
therefore between the aëration of the blood of insects and that of this
rotifer is rather due to the difference of the media they respectively
inhabit, than of design. In both, the blood is contained in a general
cavity and brought in contact with the air, without the intervention
of any true vascular system.
   The beautiful transparency of the animal, and the facility with
which the development of the ovum may be traced through all                                                          its

a crank, which by a connecting rod acts upon a sliding rod that
moves the grinder or polisher backwards and forwards.                       This sliding
rod   passes    through    a fixed   guide    at the end next the       connecting     rod,
and   through     a slowly    moving    guide   [described under (2)] at the other
end; and thus every stroke of the grinder is very nearly a straight
stroke.      The sliding rod is interrupted in                                  its

spindle of the third wheel carries a spike pointing downwards (the
distance of this spike from the centre of the spindle of the third
wheel being adjustable), and this spike lodges loosely in the centre
of the grinder and moves it upon the face of the mirror. Thus it
will be seen that the centre of the grinder is always moved in an
epitrochoid (including the circle as a possible case, if the adjustment
is made for that curve), in which the proportion of velocities of the
two circles is fixed, but the radii and their proportions are adjustable.
The grinder, as in Lord Rosse's construction, is allowed to take
freely the rotatory motion which it may receive from the friction on
the mirror; but no counterpoise is used, the weight of the grinder
being comparatively small.
    The essential difference of these constructions, as regards the
movements of the grinder, is therefore this: that in Lord Rosse's
apparatus every stroke is very nearly straight, while in Mr. Lassell's
apparatus there is no resemblance to a straight movement at any
part of the stroke.
    IV. The process of grinding is nearly the same (with differences
corresponding to the difference of dimensions) in the operations of
both constructors.
    In Lord Rosse's grinding, the speculum having received an ap
proximate figure from the form of the annealing furnace, the cast
iron grinder is brought very exactly to form by turning upon the
lathe, with proper reference to a gauge, and                        (if
                                                         not done before)                              its
surface       scored with cross-furrows about two inches apart and
          an is
nearly       inch deep, leaving the acting part                   of  squares.
                                                      the surface                        is in

  flour, and of such a consistence that, at a temperature of 80°Fahr
  enheit, the nail can make an indentation in it. It is not to be un
  derstood that there is any particular virtue in the temperatures 50°
  and 80°, but (for reasons to be hereafter given) it is necessary to
  have two strata of different degrees of hardness (the harder being
  the exterior); and the hardnesses defined by those two temperatures
  having been used in many experiments, the other adjustments have
  been determined, using these as bases; and if these bases were now
  changed, every other adjustment must be changed.
     The necessity for the different strata of resin is thus explained.
  It is necessary that the polisher yield a little, else the polishing sur
  face could not be in contact with the mirror at all parts of its stroke
  (the mirror being supposed parabolical), and this yielding is given
 by the first or soft stratum.       But it is also necessary that the stra

they were used,     means       by               an
                                object fixed something more than

less than 50 feet above them.     But for the larger mirror such a trial
is impracticable (the height of the object must exceed 100 feet),
and the mirrors have therefore been placed in the telescope without
any trial, and their definition has been found perfect.
    Mr. Lassell uses for polisher a wooden plate formed of two thick
nesses of pine-wood with the grain crossed; and this apparently
yields to accommodate itself to the form of the mirror. In the arrange
ment of its square protuberances, it is similar to Lord Rosse's; but
it is covered with only one coating of pitch. The polishing powder
used is the same as Lord Rosse's. The Astronomer Royal believed
that the attentions to temperature, moisture, &c., which Lord Rosse
found indispensable for his large mirrors, are not found necessary by
Mr. Lassell. Mr. Lassell finishes the operation with the speculum wet.
   VI. The next point to which allusion was made is the form and
mounting of the telescopes.
   Lord Rosse's telescope is a wooden tube, its interior diameter
exceeding 6 feet in every part, being at the middle about 7 feet, and
nearly 50 feet in length.     This is fixed to a cube of 10 feet, which
has folding-doors on that side which, when the telescope is hori
zontal, is the upper side (at which side the fixed frame supporting
the mirror is introduced, as has already been said), and which carries
the fixed frame by three large screws in that side of the cube which
is opposite the mouth of the telescope. To this side of the cube is
attached the universal joint by which the lower end of the telescope
is connected with a fixed support, the joint being a few feet below
the general surface of the ground.           On each side (east and west)
of the telescope is an enormous pier of solid masonry, about 70 feet
long, in the north and south direction, between 40 and 50 feet high,
and in     its
            thickest part nearly           20
                                       feet thick. [None         these dimenof
sions are taken from actual measure.]          The fixed support        nearer           is
to  the north than    tothe south ends        these piers.

the piers,       on
                the interior faces,      the east and west plane passing
                                               in
through the universal joint, are two cranes with pulleys (the turning
crane being no bigger than suffices             carry    large pulley, whose

chains pass which are attached            the telescope; and

south of the fixed support, are brought successively into action as
the telescope is raised. There is then only a comparatively small
and very manageable tendency of the telescope towards the south,
and this is supported by a light chain which passes over a pulley on
a bar connecting the horns before mentioned (the pulley being in
the direction of a polar axis passing through the lower universal
joint, and the motion of the telescope, therefore, for a given length
of the chain, being equatoreal), and this chain is shortened or
lengthened, and the telescope is thereby raised or depressed, by a
windlass a little way north of the fixed support.          Upon the inner
face of the eastern pier is an iron arc of a circle, upon which slides
a runner connected with a rod that passes through a frame on the
telescope tube and near to its mouth, and is there racked for working
with a pinion: by the movement of this pinion the distance of the
telescope from the pier is altered, and thus a motion in hour-angle
is given.    At the south ends of the piers there are strong ladders,
upon which (assisted by counterpoises) there slides a stage; upon
which stage a small observing-box travels east and west: this is
used for observing, so long as the mouth of the telescope is below
the end of the pier.     For greater elevations, the top of the western
pier being shaped by slopes so as to approximate to a circular arc,
there are mounted upon it curved galleries, which are carried by
beams that run above and below pulleys fixed to the top of the pier;
and the galleries are carried out by rack-and-pinion work, to ap
proach the side of the telescope.       It is intended to give the power
of observing as far north as the pole; but at present the galleries
extend only to the zenith.      The telescope is Newtonian, the minor
axis of the small mirror being about six inches, and the observer
looks into the side of the tube.
   Mr. Lassell's tube is of sheet-iron; and this tube is not carried
immediately by the mounting, but is inserted in a long box of cast
iron, in which it can be turned round its own axis. This movement
is necessary to place the eyepiece exactly in the same side-position
in   alldirections     the telescope, and also

    The Astronomer    Royal then proceeded to describe some of the
difficulties to which instruments of this class are yet liable, founded
partly upon his own observations with Lord Rosse's telescope.
   Upon directing the telescope to an object very near the zenith, it
was seen very well defined, or at least with no discoverable fault.
It must be remarked that the image of a star never assumes the neat
spherical form to which the eye of an observer with a fine refractor
is so much accustomed.        This arises evidently from the circumstance
that (from the   great  aperture   of the mirror) the diffraction image and
diffraction  rings  are   invisibly small, and the form of the blurred
image is probably determined by the irregular sensibility of the ner
vous membranes of the eye. The same effect exactly is produced
by a large refractor when a power is employed too low to exhibit
the rings.
    But when the telescope was directed to a star as low as the equator
its image was very defective. The defect, however, followed that
simple law which the present Master of Trinity College has described
by the word astigmatism.         When the eyepiece was thrust in, the
image of the star was a well-defined straight line, 20 seconds long,
in a certain direction; when the eyepiece was drawn out a certain
 distance (about half an inch from the former position) the image of
the star was a well-defined straight line, 20 seconds long, in a di
 rection at right angles to the former.      Between these two positions
the   image  was  elliptical, or, at the middle position, a circle of 10
seconds diameter. The image of Saturn (then without a ring) was,
in the two positions above-mentioned, an oval (not an ellipse) whose
length was about double its breadth; or, in the middle position, it
was a confused circle, whose diameter was about 30 seconds instead
of 20. The position of the astigmatic lines had no distinct relation
to the vertical plane; and this circumstance, as well as the magnitude
of the astigmatism, proved that it was not produced by a tilt of the
mirror.
  Lord Rosse immediately suggested a probable cause of this defect.
The triangular levers which support the mirror are all, to a certain
degree, elastic.  When the telescope is dropped from the vertical
position, the edge of the mirror begins to press the fixed pillars in
the fixed frame mentioned under No.        and    the edgewise pres

was not so satisfactory.             Here, again, Lord Rosse discovered the
cause. The       triangular     levers which immediately support the mirror
are  necessarily    not    plane,   inasmuch as the points which take hold
of the   plates  that adhere to the mirror must project higher (the tele
scope being vertical) than the fulcra of these levers.                       then, when                          If,

Mr. Lassell that some difficulties had been found in the arrangement
of the edge-bearing of the mirror, which had been overcome by sus
pending it in an iron hoop. These, however, from the great differ
ence of dimensions, would probably be trifling compared with those
of Lord Rosse's mirrors.
    Adverting again to the mounting of these telescopes, the Astro
nomer Royal suggested for consideration whether it might not be
advantageous to mount the telescope with an altitude and azimuth
movement, by an overhanging fork inserted in a vertical pillar. If
a rod were joined to the stalk of this fork, and, by means of an or
dinary parallel motion, were compelled to move parallel to the axis
of the telescope, and if any part of this rod were connected by an
other rod (adjustable in length according to the polar distance of
the object) to a universal joint on the ground, in such a position
that the line drawn from that universal joint to the stalk of the fork
is a polar axis, then the motion of the telescope would be equatoreal.
For the observer, it was proposed that an observing-box should be
fixed to the telescope, and that the access should be by a spiral
staircase round the pillar, by a narrow platform near its top, and
by a staircase along the side of the tube.
    In conclusion, the Astronomer Royal observed that it was impos
sible to overrate the advance that had been made in the construction
of telescopes by the two amateur constructors of whom he had spoken.
Lord Rosse had shown that it was possible, without any important
manual labour, to produce with certainty, by means of machinery,
mirrors of a size never before attained, and perhaps with a perfect
ness of definition which had not been reached before ; and he had,
by publication and by private communication, made these methods
accessible to the world.         This success was the more remarkable,
because the whole of the work was done by workmen found on the
spot; even the steam-engine, by which (to a late time) the whole
of the machinery was driven, was made by native workmen under
Lord Rosse's personal instructions.        To Mr. Lassell also much was
due, for the example which he had set of what may be done by a
man possessing less ample means, and whose time is fully occupied
in business; and much also for the elegant and compendious and
manageable apparatus arranged by him, which promises to be of the
greatest use in the construction of large object-glasses as well as of
 mirrors.

 platina.      These strips are dipped down into two vessels filled with
 salt and water, into which fluid, as contained in each vessel, two
 corresponding fingers of the two hands are to be plunged.                     On the
 first immersion of the fingers there is almost always observable a
 more or less decided deflection of the needle, this deflection not being
 amenable to any known law, and being in the opinion of the experi
 menter due to the difference existing to some extent and in some
 way or another between the cutaneous covering of the two fingers.
 Whenever there is a wound on one of the fingers the deflection is
 greater than usual; and           direction its  uniformly such that the injured

but it is readily ascertained that in  these instances there is a want of
sufficient muscular tension.
    There is one remark, to conclude, which the author has been fre
quently led to make, namely, that the habitual superiority of the right
hand over the left in this experiment is to be interpreted by the prepon
derance of the amount of deflection produced by the tension of the
right arm. This peculiarity was likewise observed when the experi
ment was performed by M. von Humboldt. The impulsion impressed
on the needle by the contraction of the muscles of his right arm
was appreciably more considerable than that produced by his left
arin.
    For his own part, M. von Humboldt has addressed to M. Arago a
letter of the following tenor:—He says, the fact of the experiment
of affecting a magnetic needle by the alternate tension of the mus
cles of the two arms, an effect due to volition, is established beyond
all question or doubt. Notwithstanding my advanced years and the
little strength that I have in my arms, the deflections of the needle
were very considerable; but they were naturally more so when the
experiment was performed by M.       J. Müller or by M. Helmkoltz, who
are   younger   men. To facilitate the experiment it is advisable to
plunge the fore-fingers into the water, and to support the palms of
the hands, to enable one to brace up well the muscles of the arm
which it is purposed to bring into play.
ON THE      ARTIFICIAL FORMATION OF MINERALS IN THE HUMID
                      WAY.    BY M. DE SENARMONT.
     Many mineral species very nearly approach some compounds
 obtained by the usual processes of chemistry, and even supply the
 deficiencies, which are still left in certain natural series. Such for
 example are the carbonates of magnesia, of protoxide of iron, man
 ganese, nickel, cobalt and zinc, which are placed near rhombic car
 bonate of lime, and are met with in nature in a state of purity, or of
 isomorphic union, yielding hybrid species, forming connecting links
 between pure species.
     These natural compounds, which have not been hitherto formed
 artificially, could not evidently have arisen under the usual conditions
 of laboratory experiments; for we have no reason for supposing that
 the same causes could produce different effects at different epochs.
 It is therefore a subject of great interest to determine with precision
 the circumstances necessary to the production of all minerals; and
 the solution of this question would undoubtedly be the best method
 of raising the veil behind which are hidden the phaenomena which
 attended the formation of a great number of rocks and of a part     - of
 the terrestrial globe.
     Some happy synthetical attempts have already afforded valuable
 data on this head.      M.M. Mitscherlich and Berthier have obtained
 several fusible minerals in the dry way, and M. Ebelmen has made
 an additional step in his researches on the formation of infusible
 silicates and aluminates.      M. G. Rose has ably examined the con
 ditions under which carbonate of lime is precipitated in the state of
 aragonite; lastly, the beautiful experiment of M. Haidinger has

thrown great light on the controverted question of the formation of
dolomites and the general problem of metamorphism.
    The author conceived the idea of forming certain mineral species
in the humid way, and his first essays were made with the carbonates.
As it is clearly demonstrated that heat generally favours dehydra
tion, it occurred to the author that the formation of neutral car
bonates might be a simple question of pressure and temperature;              but
before attempting to precipitate them by the disengagement of the
excess of carbonic acid serving them as a solvent at a high tem
perature under strong pressure, the author attempted double decom
positions in the humid way.            These first attempts set out there
fore from the beautiful experiments of M. Haidinger.
     The substances were exposed to each other in glass tubes, herme
 tically sealed, after having exhausted them. If they were of a kind
 to react upon each other immediately, they were at first separated,
 and were then by turning moved at the proper time.                   For high
 temperatures the tubes were inclosed in a gun-barrel, hermetically
 sealed and half-filled with water, so as to equalize as much as possi
 ble the internal and external pressures on the glass tube. The tubes
 were heated in small closed chambers in the furnaces of a gas-work.
     The following mineral species were by these means produced:—
     Carbonate of Magnesia.-By the double decomposition of sulphate
 of magnesia and carbonate of soda, at about 322°Fahr.                It was in
 the state of white      crystalline  sand,  which was   scarcely   acted upon
 by weak acids.      Having understood, during the course of his experi
 ments, that M. Maurignac had performed analogous experiments on
 the reaction of chloride of magnesium and carbonate of lime, hereafter
 to be described, the author did not proceed further.
     Carbonate of Protoride of Iron.—Obtained by double decomposi
 tion: first, of sulphate of protoxide of iron and carbonate of soda,
 at about 302°F. and above; second, from protochloride of iron and
 carbonate of lime, at temperatures between 266°F. and 39.2°F.,
 kept up during twelve, twenty-four, and thirty-six hours.                 The
 carbonate of iron was in the state of crystalline sand, of greater or less
 fineness, of a grayish-black colour, nearly unalterable in dry air, very
  slowly acquiring a flaxen colour in moist air, and scarcely acted upon
 by diluted acids. This crystalline sand has then                       all
